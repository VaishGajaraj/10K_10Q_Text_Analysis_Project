                                    PART I

Item 1. Description Of Business

  General

   Pacific Century Financial Corporation ("the Company") is a Delaware
corporation and a bank holding company. The Company was incorporated in Hawaii
in 1971 and in April 1998, the Company changed its state of incorporation to
Delaware.

   Through its banking subsidiaries, the Company provides a diversified range
of banking financial services and products primarily in Hawaii, the West
Pacific (consisting of Guam and nearby islands) and American Samoa. Additional
subsidiaries are engaged in equipment leasing, insurance and insurance agency
services, securities brokerage and investment services and other activities.
The Company's principal banking subsidiary is Bank of Hawaii. The Company also
owns First Savings and Loan Association of America ("First Savings").

   The Company groups its principal revenue-producing businesses into the
following markets: Retail Banking, Commercial Banking, Financial Services, and
Treasury and Other Corporate. The divestiture businesses were grouped
separately. For additional information about the Company and its operations see
the Business Segments discussion in Note Q to the Consolidated Financial
Statements of this report.

Divestiture Activity

   Beginning in December of 2000 and extending to the end of the first quarter
of 2001, the Company performed a rigorous self-assessment of its businesses.
Management evaluated the attractiveness of the Company's businesses, as well as
the ability to compete in those businesses in the future. The performance of
each business was assessed in relation to the risks assumed. Evaluations
considered the extent to which returns are expected to exceed the cost of the
capital allocated to the businesses. As a result of this assessment, a decision
was made that certain businesses would be divested or liquidated.

   The following divestitures were completed this year:

   In March 2001, the Company sold its credit card portfolio to American
Express Centurion Bank.

   In April 2001, the Company's U.S. Mainland subsidiary, Pacific Century Bank,
N.A., sold its nine branch Arizona franchise to Zions Bancorporation.

   Also in April 2001, the Company sold its entire investment in the Bank of
Queensland Limited in Australia. The Company's convertible notes were sold back
to the Bank of Queensland Limited and its common share investment was sold to a
private Australian investor.

   In August 2001, the Company closed its Bank of Hawaii Hong Kong branch and
its representative and two extension offices in the Philippines. The Bank of
Hawaii Tokyo branch closed in September and the Taipei, Seoul and Singapore
branches in October. The bank's subsidiary, Bank of Hawaii Incorporated, New
York, an Edge Act corporation, also closed in October.

   In September 2001, the Company sold Pacific Century Bank, N.A's 19 branch
California franchise to U.S. Bancorp.

   In November 2001, the Company completed the sale of its operations in Papua
New Guinea and Vanuatu to Australia-based ANZ. The sale of its Fiji operations
to ANZ closed in December 2001. These transactions involved two branches in
Papua New Guinea, two in Vanuatu and three in Fiji.

                                      1

<PAGE>

   In December 2001, the Company completed the sale of its approximately 95%
share interest in its French Polynesia and New Caledonia operations to
France-based Caisse Nationale des Caisses d'Epargne (CNCE). The sale included
all 17 branches of Bank of Hawaii's subsidiary bank in French Polynesia, Banque
de Tahiti, and all eight branches of its subsidiary bank in New Caledonia, Bank
of Hawaii-Nouvelle Caledonie.

2002 Outlook

   The Company has reaffirmed its net income expectations of $120 million for
the full year 2002. Compared to the strategic plan (announced in April 2001),
the forecast is for slightly lower revenues and expenses than originally
estimated. Achieving these results will require diligent expense control which
will also improve the efficiency ratio. Programs have been put in place to
reduce inefficient process costs. In addition, the Company is currently
evaluating rescaling its technology and operating systems to achieve efficiency
and cost savings. Any benefits or costs from this potential project have not
been included in forecast assumptions.

   Quarterly earnings should show an improving trend during 2002. A quarterly
run-rate of $90 million for expenses is anticipated, with the possibility of
slightly higher costs in the first quarter as divestiture and restructuring
activities are completed. These costs may be offset by additional sales gains
when post-closing audits for some of the divested businesses are completed
during the quarter.

   With respect to credit quality, loan losses may increase from the strategic
plan due to economic conditions. The Company plans to continue to provide for
net loan charge-offs until economic uncertainty is reduced. The tax rate should
improve due to tax strategies that allow the utilization of foreign tax credits.

   Earnings per share guidance is not being provided as it is dependent on the
timing, amount, and cost of share repurchases which are difficult to estimate.
Currently, the gradual open market purchase of shares, verses an accelerated
buy-back program, is anticipated to continue. As of February 22, 2002, the
Company has remaining authority of approximately $360 million under share
repurchase programs approved by the Board of Directors (see further discussion
in the Capital Management section of Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations).

Bank Subsidiaries

   Bank of Hawaii was organized under the laws of Hawaii on December 17, 1897
and has its headquarters in Honolulu, Hawaii. Its deposits are insured by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Bank of Hawaii became a member of
the Federal Reserve System in February 2002. Bank of Hawaii is the largest
full-service financial institution headquartered in the State of Hawaii with a
statewide network of 76 traditional and in-store branches. Bank of Hawaii
provides customary commercial banking services through branch offices or
representative offices mainly in Hawaii, the West Pacific and American Samoa.

   First Savings is located in the territory of Guam. It provides retail
financial services through six branches.

Regulation and Competition

Effect of Governmental Policies

   The earnings of the Company and its principal subsidiaries are affected not
only by general economic conditions, both domestically and internationally, but
also by the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States and its agencies,
particularly the Federal Reserve System, and foreign governments and their
agencies. The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve System influence to a
significant extent the overall growth of loans, investments, and deposits; the
level of interest rates earned on assets and paid for liabilities; and interest
rates charged on loans and paid on deposits. The nature and impact of future
changes in monetary policies are often not predictable.

                                      2

<PAGE>

Competition

   The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to substantial competition in
all aspects of the businesses in which they engage from banks (both domestic
and foreign), savings associations, credit unions, mortgage companies, finance
companies, mutual funds, brokerage firms, insurance companies and other
providers of financial services. The Company also competes with certain
non-financial institutions and governmental entities that offer financial
products and services. Many of the Company's competitors are not subject to the
same level of extensive regulations and oversight that are required of banks
and bank holding companies.

Supervision and Regulation

  General

   The Company is registered as a bank holding company (BHC) under the Bank
Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the BHC Act) and is subject to the
supervision of and to examinations by the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System (FRB). The Company is also registered as a bank holding company
under the Hawaii Code of Financial Institutions (the Code) and is subject to
the registration, reporting, and examination requirements of the Code. In
January 2002, the Company announced that it had satisfied its obligations under
the Memorandum of Understanding imposed by its regulators during the third
quarter of 2000 and it has been removed. See further discussion in the
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations section of the report, and Note A to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

   The BHC Act prohibits, with certain exceptions, a BHC from acquiring
beneficial ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any
company, including a bank, without the FRB's prior approval and from engaging
in any activity other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks or
other subsidiaries authorized under the BHC Act, or furnishing services to or
performing services for its subsidiaries. Among the permitted activities is the
ownership of shares of any company the activities of which the FRB determines
to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a
proper incident thereto.

   Subject to certain limits, under the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and
Branching Efficiency Act (Riegle-Neal Act) an adequately capitalized and
adequately managed BHC may acquire control of banks in any state. An interstate
acquisition may not be approved if immediately following the acquisition the
BHC would control 30 percent or more of the total FDIC-insured deposits in that
state (or such lesser or greater amount set by the state), unless the
acquisition is the BHC's initial entry into the state. An adequately
capitalized and adequately managed bank may apply for permission to merge with
an out-of-state bank and convert all branches of both parties into branches of
a single bank. An interstate bank merger may not be approved, if immediately
following the acquisition, the acquirer would control 30 percent or more of the
total FDIC-insured deposits in that state (or such lesser or greater amount set
by the state), unless the acquisition is the acquirer's initial entry into the
state. Banks are also permitted to open newly established branches in any state
in which it does not already have banking branches if such state enacts a law
permitting such de novo branching.

   Hawaii has enacted a statute that authorizes out-of-state banks to engage in
mergers with Hawaii banks or acquisitions of substantially all of their assets,
following which any such out-of-state bank may operate the branches of the
Hawaii bank it has acquired. The Hawaii bank must have been in continuous
operation for at least five years unless it is subject to or in danger of
becoming subject to certain types of supervisory action. This statute does not
permit out-of-state banks to acquire branches of Hawaii banks other than
through an "interstate merger transaction" under the Riegle-Neal Act (except in
the case of a bank that is subject to or in danger of becoming subject to
certain types of supervisory action) or to open branches in Hawaii on a de novo
basis.

   Under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, a BHC may elect to become a financial
holding company and thereby to engage in a broader range of financial and other
activities than are permissible for traditional BHCs. In order to qualify for
the election, all of the depository institution subsidiaries of the BHC must be
well capitalized and

                                      3

<PAGE>

well managed and all of its insured depository institution subsidiaries must
have achieved a rating of "satisfactory" or better under the Community
Reinvestment Act. Financial holding companies are permitted to engage in
activities that are "financial in nature" or incidental or complementary
thereto as determined by the FRB. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act identifies several
activities as "financial in nature," including, among others, insurance
underwriting and agency, investment advisory services, merchant banking and
underwriting, and dealing or making a market in securities. The Company has not
elected to become a financial holding company.

  Subsidiary Banks

   Bank of Hawaii is subject to supervision and examination by the Federal
Reserve Bank of San Francisco and the State of Hawaii Department of Commerce
and Consumer Affairs Division of Financial Institutions. Prior to becoming a
member of the Federal Reserve System in February 2002, Bank of Hawaii was
subject to supervision and examination by the FDIC. First Savings is subject to
supervision and examination by the Office of Thrift Supervision. Depository
institutions, including Bank of Hawaii and First Savings, are subject to
extensive federal and state regulation that significantly affects their
business and activities. Regulatory authorities have broad authority to
implement standards and to initiate proceedings designed to prohibit depository
institutions from engaging in unsafe and unsound banking practices.

  Dividend Restrictions

   The Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiary
banks and other subsidiaries. Its principal source of funds to pay dividends on
its common stock and debt service on its debt is dividends from its
subsidiaries. Various federal and state statutory provisions and regulations
limit the amount of dividends the Company's subsidiary banks and certain other
subsidiaries may pay without regulatory approval. For information about the
restrictions applicable to the Company's subsidiary banks, see Note I to the
Consolidated Financial Statements, incorporated by reference herein.

  Holding Company Structure

   Transfer Of Funds From Subsidiary Banks. The Company's subsidiary banks are
subject to restrictions under federal law that limit the transfer of funds or
other items of value from such subsidiaries to the Company and its nonbank
subsidiaries (including affiliates) in so-called "covered transactions." In
general, covered transactions include loans and other extensions of credit,
investments and asset purchases, as well as other transactions involving the
transfer of value from a subsidiary bank to an affiliate or for the benefit of
an affiliate. Unless an exemption applies, covered transactions by a subsidiary
bank with a single affiliate are limited to 10% of the subsidiary bank's
capital and surplus and, with respect to all covered transactions with
affiliates in the aggregate, to 20% of the subsidiary bank's capital and
surplus. Also, loans and extensions of credit to affiliates generally are
required to be secured in specified amounts.

   Source Of Strength Doctrine. Under FRB policy, a BHC is expected to serve as
a source of financial and management strength to its subsidiary banks and to
commit resources to support its subsidiary banks in circumstances where it
might not do so absent such a policy. This support may be required at times
when the BHC may not have the resources to provide it. Under this policy, a BHC
is expected to stand ready to use available resources to provide adequate
capital funds to its subsidiary banks during periods of financial adversity and
to maintain the financial flexibility and capital-raising capacity to obtain
additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks.

  Capital Requirements

   The Company is subject to risk-based capital requirements and guidelines
imposed by the banking regulatory agencies.

                                      4

<PAGE>

   As an additional means to identify problems in the financial management of
depository institutions, the FDI Act requires federal bank regulatory agencies
to establish certain non-capital safety and soundness standards for
institutions for which they are the primary federal regulator. The standards
relate generally to operations and management, asset quality, interest rate
exposure and executive compensation. The agencies are authorized to take action
against institutions that fail to meet such standards.

   The FDI Act requires federal bank regulatory agencies to take "prompt
corrective action" with respect to FDIC-insured depository institutions that do
not meet minimum capital requirements. A depository institution's treatment for
purposes of the prompt corrective action provisions will depend upon how its
capital levels compare to various capital measures and certain other factors,
as established by regulation.

  FDIC Insurance

   The FDIC has adopted a premium schedule under which the actual assessment
rate for a particular institution depends in part upon the risk classification
the FDIC assigns to that institution. The FDIC may raise an institution's
insurance premiums or terminate insurance upon a finding that the institution
has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices.

   This regulatory framework is intended primarily for the protection of
depositors, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole,
and not for the protection of security holders. To the extent that this
information describes statutory and regulatory provisions, it is qualified in
its entirety by reference to those provisions. Any change in applicable laws or
regulations may have a material effect on the business of the Company and its
subsidiaries.

Employees

   At December 31, 2001, the Company and its subsidiaries had 3,175 employees.

Item 2. Description of Property

   The Company and its subsidiaries own and lease premises primarily consisting
of branch and operating facilities, the majority of which are located in
Hawaii, the West Pacific, and American Samoa. Bank of Hawaii's main branch and
administrative offices are located at the Financial Plaza of the Pacific in
Honolulu, Hawaii. Additionally, Bank of Hawaii owns a fee simple two-story
building near downtown Honolulu that houses data processing operational
functions and an operations facility in the Kapolei area on Oahu.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

   The Company and its subsidiaries are defendants in various legal proceedings
arising from normal business activities. In the opinion of management, after
reviewing these proceedings with counsel, the aggregate liability, if any
resulting from these proceedings would not have a material effect on the
Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

   No matter was submitted during the fourth quarter of 2001 to a vote of
security holders through solicitation of proxies or otherwise.

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations

Overview

   On April 23, 2001, the Company announced a new strategic plan designed to
maximize shareholder value by strengthening its Hawaii and West Pacific
operations and divesting most other holdings, including Pacific Century Bank in
California, the Asia Division, and the South Pacific Division, excluding
American Samoa.

   The divestiture program was completed prior to year-end. As discussed in
more detail earlier in this document, the Company's credit card portfolio was
sold in March 2001, Pacific Century Bank, N.A.'s franchise in Arizona was sold
in April 2001, the investment in the Bank of Queensland Limited in Australia
was sold in April 2001, substantially all of the Asia division was closed by
October 2001, Pacific Century Bank N.A.'s California branch franchise was sold
in September 2001, and the South Pacific banks were sold in November and
December 2001. These divestitures and other strategic actions have made
comparison of results between accounting periods more difficult and less
meaningful.

   A new organizational structure was also announced in April 2001. Businesses
were aligned into the following units: Retail Banking, Commercial Banking,
Financial Services, and Treasury and Other Corporate. The divestiture
businesses were grouped separately. The Line of Business Financial Review in
this report is presented in a format that is consistent with the new
organization structure which is different from the previous year. Note Q to the
Consolidated Financial Statements includes the Company's business segment
financial reports for the three years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999.

   As part of its efforts to effectively manage capital, the Company initiated
a $70 million and a $200 million common share repurchase program in the third
and fourth quarters of 2001, respectively. Through December 31, 2001 the
Company had repurchased 8.3 million shares under these programs at an average
cost of $23.57 per share for a total of $195.7 million. In January 2002, the
Company's Board of Directors approved an additional $300 million common stock
repurchase program.

  2001 Performance Summary

   .   Net income of the Company was $117.8 million in 2001, reflecting an
       increase of 3.6% from the $113.7 million reported in 2000.

   .   Diluted earnings per share were $1.46 in 2001 compared to $1.42 in 2000.

   .   Net interest income decreased 13.5%, from $531.2 million in 2000 to
       $459.7 million in 2001 primarily due to the divested businesses and the
       managed reduction of the loan portfolio to improve asset quality.

   .   Net gains of $173.4 million were recognized in 2001 from the sales of
       banking operations and venture investment losses.

   .   The Company realized $33.0 million in investment securities gains during
       2001, mostly related to the strategic plan.

   .   Restructuring and other related costs of $104.8 million were recognized
       in 2001. In addition, a higher effective tax rate was incurred due to
       non-tax-deductible goodwill and other costs associated with the
       divestitures.

   .   The provision for loan and lease losses was $74.3 million in 2001, a
       decrease of $68.6 million from $142.9 million in 2000 due to improved
       asset quality and recoveries.


   .   Assets totaled $10.6 billion at December 31, 2001, down from $14.0
       billion at December 31, 2000. This decline was primarily a result of the
       divested businesses.

   .   The Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses as a percent of loans
       outstanding was 2.81% at December 31, 2001 compared to 2.67% at the end
       of 2000.

   .   Non-performing assets were $79.7 million, or 1.41% of total loans at
       year-end 2001, compared to $183.0 million, or 1.98% at year-end 2000.

Statement of Income Analysis

Net Interest Income

   Net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis was $459.9 million in
2001, down from $532.0 million in 2000, and $552.2 million in 1999. The
decrease in net interest income from the prior year is primarily a result of
the divestitures, the closure of the Asia business and the managed reduction of
loans to improve credit quality.

   The decline in net interest margin from 4.08% in 2000 to 3.91% in 2001
resulted largely from loan reductions, assets sales (particularly the sale of
higher-yielding assets such as the credit card portfolio), and lower returns
earned on the increased liquidity that arose as the divestitures were completed.

Provision for Loan and Lease Losses

   The provision for loan and lease losses was $74.3 million in 2001, compared
to $142.9 million in 2000 and $60.9 million in 1999. Net charge-offs were
$121.4 million in 2001, an increase from last year when net charge-offs
were $89.4 million. A substantial amount of the charge-offs in 2001 were the
result of efforts to reduce risks in the loan portfolio. For further
information on credit quality, refer to the section on "Allowance for Loan and
Lease Losses" of this report.

Non-Interest Income

   Non-interest income was $452.6 million in 2001 compared to $284.9 million in
2000 and $285.5 million in 1999. In 2001, non-interest income included gains of
$173.4 million on the sales of banking operations net of venture investment
losses, and gains on the sale of non-strategic investment securities totaling
$32.1 million. Adjusted for special items, non-interest income decreased 8.4%
in 2001 from the prior year. The decrease is mainly due to the implementation
of the Company's strategic plan to divest certain businesses.

   In 2000, non-interest income included gains of $11.9 million on the
settlement of certain pension benefit obligations and $3.2 million on the sale
of minority interests in Bank of Tonga and Pacific Commercial Bank, Ltd. of
Samoa.

   In 1999, non-interest income included other special credits that contributed
$18.3 million to other income and $12.1 million to securities gains.

   Table 4 presents the details of non-interest income for the last three years.

   Trust and Asset Management income decreased in 2001 from 2000 mainly due to
the decline in market value of the assets under management, driven by a general
decline in stock market values in 2001. Assets under management totaled $12.2
billion at December 31, 2001 compared to $12.8 billion at December 31, 2000.

   The increase in Mortgage Banking income in 2001 was due to higher levels of
loans originated, sold and serviced for others.

   Service Charges on Deposit Accounts decreased from the prior year primarily
due to decreases in the number of deposit accounts, including those from the
sale of the Pacific Century Bank branch franchise.

   Letters of Credit and Acceptance Fees decreased primarily due to the closing
of the Asia Division.

   As previously discussed, in 2001, $173.4 million was recognized as Gains on
Sales of Banking Operations, Net of Venture Investment Losses related to the
divestitures that took place during the year. Table 5 presents the details of
these gains and losses:

   In 2001, gains on investment securities included $28.4 million from the sale
of a stock investment in ATM processor Star Systems, Inc. and $3.7 million gain
on the sale of Bank of Queensland stock. Net Losses on Investment Securities in
2000 included losses taken on the investment portfolio, partially offset by
gains of $2.1 million from the sale of minority interests in Pacific Commercial
Bank Ltd. of Samoa and Bank of Tonga. Securities gains in 1999 included a $12.1
million gain from the sale of securities associated with venture capital
investments.

   In 2000, the Company recognized a gain of $11.9 million from the settlement
of a portion of the Company's pension benefit obligation. The Company settled
this obligation by purchasing annuities with a portion of the pension plan
assets.

Non-Interest Expense

   Non-interest expense in 2001 was $598.0 million compared to $493.2 million
in 2000 and $550.5 million in 1999. Non-interest expense in 2001 included
$104.8 million of restructuring and other related costs primarily resulting
from the implementation of the strategic plan and the related divestiture
program. Adjusting for such expenses, non-interest expense was $493.2 million,
essentially flat compared to 2000.

   Salaries increased $7.1 million primarily due to normal compensation
increases, additional management costs, and an increased number of employees at
the Bank, mainly in customer service positions. In 2000, salaries decreased
primarily due to a reduction in staff levels from a Bank-wide redesign project
and the completion of the Year 2000 computer project.

   Net Occupancy expense in 2001 was $46.3 million, a decline from $48.8
million in 2000. The decrease in net occupancy expense was caused primarily by
decreases in rent and property taxes related to the sale and closure of the
divested businesses.

   Net Equipment expense was $53.4 million in 2001, an increase from $50.6
million in 2000. The increase was due to software licensing fees and
write-downs and acceleration of depreciation of certain equipment of the
divested businesses.

   Credit Card Processing expenses declined in 2001 due to the sale in the
first quarter of the credit card portfolio.

   The 2001 efficiency ratio of 65.6% was negatively impacted by the
divestiture program, where revenue declined more quickly than the related
expenses.

</TABLE>

Restructuring and Other Related Costs

   In 2001, restructuring and other related costs were comprised primarily of
foreign currency translation losses, the write-down of goodwill related to the
sale of banking operations, and employee termination costs. The employee
termination costs related largely to severance for 336 employees of the Pacific
Century Bank N.A.'s California franchise, the Asia Division, the South Pacific
banking operations, and Hawaii based personnel who supported those businesses.
See Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Income Taxes

   The tax structure at the Company is complex given the various foreign and
domestic locations in which it has operated. The 2001 provision for taxes
reflected an effective tax rate of 50.9%, compared to effective rates of

                                      15

<PAGE>

36.9% and 41.1% in 2000 and 1999, respectively. The unusually high rate in 2001
was a result of a higher level of non-tax-deductible costs associated with the
divestitures, the most significant of which was $83.6 million of goodwill from
the divested California branch franchise.

   The Company invests in low income housing tax credits that reduced tax by
$12.4 million and $12.0 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively. See Note N to
the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Balance Sheet Analysis

Loans

   Loans comprise the largest category of earning assets for the Company and
produce the highest level of income. Overall loans decreased $3.6 billion or
39% to $5.7 billion at December 31, 2001. The decrease is primarily due to the
implementation of the Company's strategic plan which included the divestiture
of approximately $0.86 billion of loans from Pacific Century Bank N.A., $0.34
billion of loans from the Asia Division, $0.89 billion of loans from South
Pacific and $6.9 million of other loans based on December 31, 2000 balances. In
addition, loans totaling $294.2 million were sold based on the Company's
decision to exit certain higher risk relationships. Note D to the Consolidated
Financial Statements presents the composition of the loan portfolio by major
loan categories.

Commercial

   Commercial loans consist of loans made for commercial, financial, and
agricultural purposes and involves lending on both a secured and unsecured
basis. Collateral requirements vary in accordance with the Company's
underwriting standards.

   Geographically, commercial loans are concentrated in the U.S. Mainland and
Hawaii, which represented 30.1% and 55.3%, respectively, of the total
commercial portfolio as of year-end 2001. In Hawaii, Bank of Hawaii is a major
commercial lender and maintains a significant presence throughout the State.
Bank of Hawaii supports the business community in Hawaii by offering a wide
range of products and services. In the U.S. Mainland market, commercial lending
is comprised of business loans to Fortune 1000 companies.

Real Estate Construction

   Construction loans are secured primarily by commercial properties located in
Hawaii. Because construction lending is generally considered to involve greater
risk than financing on improved properties, the Company utilizes tighter
underwriting and disbursement standards. The majority of these loans are
underwritten based on the projected cash flows of the completed project, rather
than the value of the underlying property, and generally require a committed
source for permanent financing.

Real Estate Mortgage

   The Company's real estate loan portfolio consists of loans that are secured
by residential as well as commercial properties. The largest component of the
real estate loan portfolio consists of loans secured by 1-to-4 family
residential properties. At December 31, 2001, approximately 91.2% of these
loans were secured by real estate in Hawaii.

   The Company sells the majority of its fixed rate loans in the secondary
mortgage market. In 2001, residential mortgage originations by Bank of Hawaii
totaled $2.3 billion compared to $0.9 billion in 2000.

   Commercial real estate loans are secured by commercial real estate in Hawaii
and the U.S. Mainland, respectively, with the remainder mostly in the West
Pacific. The commercial real estate portfolio is diversified in

                                      16

<PAGE>

the type of property securing the obligations, including loans secured by
commercial offices, hotels, retail facilities, industrial properties,
residential projects and warehouses.

   At December 31, 2001 outstanding loans to national hotel and management
companies totaled $65 million with undrawn commitments of $59 million. Exposure
to hotel companies in Hawaii at December 31, 2001 included loans outstanding of
$112 million and undrawn commitments of $19 million. In the West Pacific, loans
outstanding to hotel owners totaled $59 million at December 31, 2001.

Installment

   As of December 31, 2001, installment loans consisted of home equity credit
lines and other consumer loans (e.g., auto loans and unsecured credit lines).

   Home equity credit lines are underwritten primarily based on the borrower's
repayment ability rather than the value of the underlying property. The total
available credit under home equity credit lines was $575 million at year-end
2001.

   Installment loans declined $272.2 million to $729.7 million at December 31,
2001. The decline is primarily due to the sale of the Company's $209.3 million
credit card portfolio in the first quarter of 2001.

Lease Financing

   Lease Financing is comprised of leveraged leases and auto leases. See Note D
to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the
Company's leveraged lease portfolio.

   The Company's total exposure to the air transportation industry at December
31, 2001 was $158 million, consisting of $136 million in equity interests in
leveraged leases and $22 million in lending exposure of which $5 million was
undrawn. The leases are comprised of $90 million in 14 aircraft leased to major
United States and international passenger carriers, $31 million on 13 aircraft
leased to regional carriers and $15 million on one aircraft leased to a major
air cargo carrier.

Foreign Loans

   As previously discussed, the Company divested its South Pacific banking
operations and the business of the Asia Division was curtailed. As of December
31, 2001, there were no foreign loans outstanding in the South Pacific.

   Additional information on foreign credit exposure is contained in the
"Foreign Operations" section of this report.

Geographic Distribution of the Loan Portfolio

   A geographic distribution of the loan portfolio is presented in Table 7
based on the geographic location of borrowers.

   The amounts reflected for the West Pacific include Guam and other locations
in the region where both Bank of Hawaii and First Savings have branches.

Investment Securities

   The Company's investment portfolio is managed to provide liquidity and
interest income, offset interest rate risk positions and provide collateral for
cash management needs. See Table 22 for the maturity distribution, market value
and weighted-average yield to maturity of securities.

Deposits

   Competition for deposits by banks and other financial institutions, as well
as securities brokerage firms, continues to impact the ability to attract and
retain deposits.

   Table 20 presents average deposits by type for the three years ended
December 31, 2001.

   As of December 31, 2001, deposits totaled $6.7 billion compared to $9.1
billion at the end of 2000. The decline of $2.4 billion, or 27%, is
attributable to the sales of the Pacific Century Bank franchise in Arizona and
California, approximately $1.0 billion, and South Pacific operations. In
addition the closure of the Asia business contributed to the decline in foreign
deposits.

   During the fourth quarter, domestic deposits continued to reflect positive
trends as demand and savings deposit balances increased.

                                      18

<PAGE>

Borrowings

   The decrease in short-term debt was due to lower funding needs resulting
from the decrease in assets. See Notes G and H to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for the detail of borrowings. Securities sold under agreement to
repurchase are offered to governmental entities as an alternative to deposits
and are supported by the same type of collateral.

Foreign Operations

   The South Pacific bank subsidiaries were sold during the fourth quarter of
2001 in line with the Company's strategic plan. Except for a representative
office in Japan, all Asian branches have been closed.

   The operations in Guam include Bank of Hawaii and First Savings' branches.
The U.S. dollar is used in these locations, accordingly, these operations are
not considered foreign for financial reporting purposes.

   Table 8 provides a summary of average assets, average liabilities, operating
revenue, and net income (loss) for the Company's foreign operations for the
last three years. The net income in 2001 included the net gain on sale of the
South Pacific subsidiaries and related restructuring costs, including foreign
currency conversion losses and severance payments. The net losses in 2000 and
1999 reflected significantly higher foreign loan loss provisions in comparison
to historical levels (see "Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses").

   Credit limits have been established for each country. These credit limits
are monitored and reviewed on a regular basis.

   The Company's foreign lending included both local currency and cross-border
lending. Local currency loans are those that are funded and will be repaid in
the currency of the borrower's country. Cross-border lending, on the other
hand, involves loans that will be repaid in a currency other than that of the
borrower's country. This type of lending involves greater risk because the
borrower's ability to repay is additionally dependent on changes in the
currency exchange rate.

Corporate Risk Profile

Credit Risk

   The Company's asset quality improved as evidenced by the continued
reductions in the level of internally criticized and classified credits, as
well as the level of non-performing assets. Strides have also been made to
improve portfolio quality through early identification and disengagement or
remediation of deteriorating borrowers as appropriate.

   The largest part of the Company's continuing business is based in Hawaii
where tourism has a significant influence on the economy. Immediately after the
tragic events of September 11, tourism was adversely affected. Thereafter, the
Company evaluated the impact of this event on its customers by performing a
forward looking review of individual borrowers in identified high impact
industries, where greater than twenty percent of revenues were tied to tourism.
As a result of this review, allocated reserves were increased for those
portfolio segments. Improvement in asset quality and loan reductions prior to
the event allowed for a reallocation without an incremental increase in the
provision for loan and lease losses. The two major industries that were
impacted were the hotel industry and the air transportation industry. As
previously discussed, at December 31, 2001, outstanding loans to national hotel
and management companies totaled $65 million with undrawn commitments of $59
million. The Company's total exposure to the air transportation industry at
December 31, 2001 was $158 million, consisting of $136 million in equity
interests in leveraged leases and $22 million in lending exposure, of which $5
million was undrawn.

  Non-Performing Assets

   Non-performing assets (NPAs) consist of non-accrual loans, including those
held for sale, restructured loans and foreclosed real estate.

   Total non-performing assets decreased to $79.7 million, or 1.41% of total
loans, at December 31, 2001. This represents a decrease of $103.3 million, or
56.4%, from December 31, 2000 non-performing assets that totaled $183.0
million, or 1.98% of total loans.

   The decrease in non-performing assets between December 31, 2000 and December
31, 2001 was largely due to loan sales, pay-offs, and necessary charge-offs as
management made significant progress on its commitment to improve asset
quality. Significant reductions since last year resulted from the sale of the
South Pacific subsidiaries ($20.1 million), the closure of the Asia Division
($10.6 million) and the sale of the Fiji branches ($3.1 million).

   Accruing loans past due 90 days or more totaled $4.9 million at December 31,
2001, down from $18.8 million at year-end 2000.

Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses

   The Company maintains the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses (Allowance) at
a level that it believes is adequate to absorb estimated inherent losses on all
loans and leases. The Allowance level is determined based on a continuing
assessment of problem credits, recent loss experience, changes in collateral
values, and current and anticipated economic conditions. For loans other than
consumer loans, a risk rating system is used to identify potential problem
loans. Loans are rated based on the degree of risk at origination by the
lending officer, and thereafter are reviewed periodically and revised as
appropriate. To ensure compliance with the internal risk rating system and the
timeliness of rating changes, the Credit Review department performs periodic
independent evaluations of this process.

   The Company performs a comprehensive quarterly analysis to determine the
adequacy of its Allowance. This analysis incorporates loss migration modeling
and transfer risk. The Company utilizes a methodology that establishes
allowances for both specific loans and pools of loans. Commercial loans and
leases are individually reviewed according to specified criteria to determine
specific loss exposure.

   Loss allocations for various loan pools are determined based on a loss
migration analysis. The migration model determines potential loss factors based
on historical loss experience for homogeneous loan portfolios and based on risk
ratings for risk-rated portfolios. The methodology also includes an evaluation
of the changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio, delinquency and
non-accrual trends, lending policies and procedures, and other relevant
factors. For foreign credits, reserves are further stratified to address
transfer risk. Reserve allocations for transfer risk is determined based on the
type of credit facility and internal country risk ratings.

   The Allowance at December 31, 2001 was $159.0 million or 2.81% of loans and
leases outstanding, compared to $246.2 million or 2.67% of outstandings at
December 31, 2000. At December 31, 2001 the Allowance to non-accrual loans was
262% compared to 137% at prior year-end. The increase in the coverage is
attributable to the decline in non-accrual loans.

   The Allowance decreased by net charge-offs taken as the Company exited
certain higher risk relationships by selling those loans at a loss. Additional
risk reduction resulted from exiting markets where loans were collected or sold
net of a discount that approximated the recorded Allowance related to the loans
sold.

   Recoveries totaled $47.6 million for the year-ended December 31, 2001
compared to $21.4 million in 2000. The increase was primarily in foreign loan
recoveries which totaled $24.1 million.

   Overall, the Allowance decreased due to strategic reductions in risk and the
divestitures. As a percentage of loans, the Allowance increased due to
continued economic uncertainty.

   See Note D to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the activity in the
Allowance for the last five years.

<PAGE>

   Table 12 presents an allocation of the Allowance for the last five years.
The allocated portion continued to be weighted toward the commercial loan
portfolio, which reflected a higher level of non-performing loans and the
potential for higher individual losses. The decline in the foreign allocation
was attributable to the divestitures. The leasing allocation increased due to
downgrades of the portfolio related to the transportation industry.

   The Company's determination of the level of the Allowance and,
correspondingly, the provision for loan and lease losses is dependent on
judgments and assumptions and, for this reason, the Company considers the
Allowance methodology a critical accounting policy. As part of the Company's
quarterly Allowance analysis, management reviews the calculated historical
charge-off and migration rates and applies adjustments as deemed appropriate.
The adjustments are based on: existing and emerging trends in and expectations
of portfolio performance; economic conditions and positioning in the cycle;
borrower, industry and geographical concentrations; seasoning of the portfolio;
changes in credit management including underwriting policies, charge-off
policies, and personnel; coverage tests of exposure, non-accruals and
charge-offs; and comparison to external data.

   At December 31, 2001 the Company performed additional stress testing of the
portfolio and the assumptions used in determining the Allowance. Based on this
information, adjustments were made to the Allowance allocation to account for
the possibility for downgrades of risk ratings and increased loss rates in the
consumer portfolio.

   The unallocated portion of the Allowance represents management's judgmental
determination of the amounts necessary for concentrations, economic uncertainty
and other factors. Although management has allocated a portion of the Allowance
to specific loan categories, the adequacy of the Allowance must be considered
in its entirety.

   Management considers the Allowance adequate to cover losses inherent in the
portfolio at December 31, 2001.

Market Risk

   The Company's market risk management process involves measuring, monitoring,
controlling and managing risks that can significantly impact the Company's
financial position and operating results. Market risks resulting from the
fluctuation of interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices and
equity prices are balanced with expected

                                      24

<PAGE>

returns to enhance earnings performance and shareholder value, while limiting
the volatility of each. The activities associated with these market risks are
categorized into "other than trading" and "trading."

Other Than Trading Activities

   In the normal course of business, elements of the Company's balance sheet
are exposed to varying degrees of market risk. The Company's primary market
risk exposures are interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk (see below). A
key element in the process of managing market risk involves oversight by senior
management and the Board of Directors as to the level of such risk assumed by
the Company in its balance sheet.

   The Board of Directors reviews and approves risk management policies,
including risk limits and guidelines and delegates to the Asset Liability
Management Committee (ALCO) oversight functions. The ALCO, consisting of senior
business and finance officers, monitors the Company's market risk exposure and
as market conditions dictate, modifies balance sheet positions or directs the
use of derivative instruments.

Interest Rate Risk

   The Company's balance sheet is sensitive to changes in the general level of
interest rates. This interest rate risk arises primarily from the Company's
normal business activities of making loans and taking deposits. Many other
factors also affect the Company's exposure to changes in interest rates. These
factors include general economic and financial conditions, customer
preferences, and historical pricing relationships.

   A key element in the Company's ongoing process to measure and monitor
interest rate risk is the utilization of a net interest income (NII) Monte
Carlo simulation model. This model is used to estimate the amount that NII will
change over a one-year time horizon under various interest rate scenarios.
These estimates are based on assumptions on the behavior of loan and deposit
volumes as a function of pricing, prepayment speeds on mortgage-related assets,
and principal amortization and maturities on other financial instruments. The
model specification includes imbedded optionality. While such assumptions are
inherently uncertain, management believes that these assumptions are
reasonable. As a result, the NII simulation model captures the dynamic nature
of the balance sheet and provides a sophisticated estimate rather than a
precise prediction of NII's exposure to higher or lower interest rates.

   Table 13 presents, as of December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, the estimate of
the change in NII from a gradual 200 basis point increase or decrease in
interest rates, moving in parallel fashion for the entire yield curve, over the
next 12-month period relative to the measured base case scenario for NII. The
resulting estimate in NII exposure was well within the approved ALCO guidelines

   To enhance and complement the results from the NII simulation model, the
Company also reviews other measures of interest rate risk. These measures
include the sensitivity of market value of equity and the exposure to basis
risk and non-parallel yield curve shifts. There are inherent limitations to
these measures but used along with the NII simulation model, the Company gets a
better overall insight for managing its exposure to changes in interest rates.

                                      25

   In managing interest rate risks, the Company uses several approaches to
modify its risk position. Approaches that are used to shift balance sheet mix
or alter the interest rate characteristics of assets and liabilities include
changing product pricing strategies, modifying investment portfolio
characteristics, or using financial derivative instruments. The use of
financial derivatives, as detailed in Note O to the Consolidated Financial
Statements, has been limited over the past several years.

Foreign Currency Risk

   By year-end 2001, the majority of the Company's operations throughout the
South Pacific and Asia were divested. These divestitures significantly reduced
the amount of capital exposed to foreign currency risk and the remaining
exposure is expected to decrease further. To estimate the potential loss from
foreign currency exposure for the remaining net investments in subsidiaries,
the Company continues to use a value-at-risk (VAR) calculation based on an
estimated variance-co-variance matrix. This VAR calculation determines the
potential loss within a 95% confidence interval. In other words, a loss greater
than VAR has approximately a 5% probability of occurring.

   Table 14 presents, as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, the Company's foreign
currency exposure from its remaining net investment in subsidiaries and branch
operations as measured by the VAR.

</TABLE>

   The average value-at-risk for the Japanese yen, Korean won, Pacific franc,
and other currencies was $1.4 million, $3.2 million, $3.6 million and $12.1
million, respectively for the year ended December 31, 2001, and was $1.8
million, $3.9 million, $5.9 million and $17.0 million, respectively for the
year ended December 31, 2000.

   The book value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries and branches is
net of a $37 million borrowing at December 31, 2000, denominated in euro and
foreign exchange hedge transactions of $26 million at December 31, 2000. There
were no borrowing or foreign exchange hedge transactions related to the foreign
subsidiaries and branches at December 31, 2001.

  Trading Activities

   The Company's trading activities include foreign currency and foreign
exchange contracts that expose the Company to a minor degree of foreign
currency risk. These transactions are executed on behalf of customers and for
the Company's own account. The Company, however, manages its trading account
such that it does not maintain significant foreign currency open positions. The
exposure from foreign currency trading positions measured by the VAR
methodology as of year-end 2001 continued to be immaterial.

Liquidity Management

   Liquidity is managed to ensure that the Company has continuous access to
sufficient, reasonably priced funding to conduct its business in a normal
manner. The Company's ALCO monitors sources and uses of funds

                                      26

<PAGE>

and modifies asset and liability positions as liquidity requirements change.
This process combined with the Company's ability to raise funds in money and
capital markets and through private placements provides flexibility in managing
the exposure to liquidity risk.

   To ensure that its liquidity needs are met, the Company actively manages
both the asset and liability sides of the balance sheet. The primary sources of
liquidity on the asset side of the balance sheet are available-for-sale
investment securities, interest bearing deposits, and cash flows from loans and
investments, as well as the ability to securitize certain assets. With respect
to liabilities, liquidity is generated through growth in deposits and the
ability to obtain wholesale funding in national and local markets through a
variety of sources. During 2001, the Company's divestiture program created
significant balance sheet liquidity. This liquidity has been used to repurchase
stock (see Capital Management) and reduce debt where possible. The Company has
not utilized off-balance sheet financing arrangements as a significant source
of liquidity. It is not expected that such arrangements will be used
significantly in the future.

   The Company's primary liquidity needs for contractual obligations and other
commitments as of December 31, 2001 are summarized below. These obligations do
not reflect maturities of customer time deposits, many of which have
historically been reinvested in other deposit products. See Note G to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on Short-Term
Borrowing; Note H for Long-Term Debt; and Note E for Capital and Operating
Lease obligations.

   The Company obtains short-term wholesale funding through federal funds,
securities sold under agreements to repurchase, and commercial paper. The
Company issues commercial paper in various denominations with maturities of
generally 90 days or less. During 2001, the Company issued commercial paper
only in the Hawaii marketplace.

                                      27

<PAGE>

   Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are financing transactions,
under which securities are pledged as collateral for short-term borrowings.
Nearly all of these transactions are with governmental entities. The Company's
balance sheet is unique given the high level of state and local government
funding. Historically, these governmental entities have provided a stable
source of funds.

   The Company maintained a $25 million, annually renewable line of credit for
working capital purposes. Fees are paid on the unused balance of the line.
During 2001, the line was not drawn upon. In January 2002, this line was
discontinued.

   Bank of Hawaii and First Savings are both members of the Federal Home Loan
Bank of Seattle (FHLB). The FHLB provides these institutions with an additional
source for short and long-term funding. Borrowings from the FHLB were $147
million and $518 million at the end of 2001 and 2000, respectively.

   Additionally, Bank of Hawaii maintains a $1 billion senior and subordinated
bank note program. Under this facility, Bank of Hawaii may issue additional
notes provided that at any time the aggregate amount outstanding does not
exceed $1 billion. Subordinated notes outstanding under this bank note program
totaled $244 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000.

Capital Management

   The Company manages its capital level over the long-term, to optimize
shareholder value, support asset growth, reflect risks inherent in its markets,
provide protection against unforeseen losses and comply with regulatory
requirements. Capital levels are reviewed relative to the Company's risk
profile and current and projected economic conditions. The Company's regulatory
capital ratios at year-end 2001 were: Tier I Capital Ratio of 19.76%, Total
Capital Ratio of 23.29%, and Leverage Ratio of 11.20%. These ratios exceed the
minimum regulatory standards to qualify as "well capitalized", which are: Tier
I Capital 6%; Total Capital 10%; and Leverage Ratio 5%. The Company's objective
is to hold sufficient capital on a regulatory basis to exceed the minimum
guidelines of a "well capitalized" financial institution.

   At year-end 2001, the Company's shareholders' equity was $1.25 billion, a
decrease of $54.3 million, or 4.2%, from year-end 2000. The decline in
shareholders' equity was a result of dividends paid of $56.6 million and
treasury stock purchases that totaled $195.7 million. These decreases were
offset by current year earnings, the issuance of common stock under the
dividend reinvestment plan and various stock-based employee benefit plans, and
unrealized valuation adjustments. Table 15 presents a five-year history of
activities and balances in the Company's capital accounts along with key
capital ratios.

   In 2001, the Company's Board of Directors approved share repurchase programs
that authorized the repurchase of a total of $270 million in common stock,
beginning in the third quarter of 2001. Through December 31, 2001 the Company
had repurchased 8.3 million shares under these programs at an average cost of
$23.57 per share for a total of $195.7 million. In January 2002, the Company's
Board of Directors approved an additional $300 million common stock repurchase
program. From January 1, 2002 through February 22, 2002, the Company
repurchased 672,100 shares at an average cost of $24.44 per share for a total
of $16.4 million.

   As of December 31, 2001, $100 million of 8.25% Capital Securities that
mature in 2026 were outstanding. These securities qualify as Tier I Capital for
regulatory accounting purposes, but are classified as long-term debt in the
Consolidated Statements of Condition. In addition, the Company had subordinated
debt of $148.4 million at the end of 2001 that qualify as total capital for
regulatory purposes.

Business Segments

   Business segment results are determined based on the Company's internal
financial management reporting process and organizational structure. This
process uses various techniques to assign balance sheet and income statement
amounts to business segments, including allocations of overhead, credit loss
provision, and capital. The new organizational structure announced in April
2001 changed the structure used to analyze financial performance. Unlike
financial accounting, there is no comprehensive, authoritative guidance for
management accounting that is equivalent to generally accepted accounting
principles. The management accounting process measures the performance of the
operating segments based on the management structure of the Company and is not
necessarily comparable with similar information for any other financial
institution.

   Note Q to the Consolidated Financial Statements provides additional
information about the Company's business segments, including segment financial
information for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999.

Retail Banking

   The Company's retail banking franchise and market share in Hawaii and
American Samoa are key strengths of the Company. Retail Banking provides
checking and savings products for the consumer and small business segments,
merchant services, installment, home equity and mortgage lending products, as
well as other products and services.

   In 2001, total revenue for the Retail Segment was relatively flat to the
prior year. Net interest income declined in 2001 from 2000 primarily due to a
reduction in the interest spread earned by the segment on its deposits. The
interest spread narrowed as a result of significant reductions in interest
rates during the year. Non-interest income was lower in 2001 due to mortgage
banking losses incurred in the fourth quarter, offset by increased mortgage
loan originations. Non-interest expense increased in 2001 as a result of higher
mortgage loan volume and higher expense allocations related to systems and
product development.

Commercial Banking

   The Commercial Banking segment offers corporate banking, commercial
products, leasing, commercial real estate lending and auto finance. The
Company's West Pacific operations are included in this segment. Total earning
assets in the Commercial Banking segment declined in 2001 from 2000 due to the
Company's managed reduction of credit risk. As a result, the provision for loan
and lease losses declined from prior periods. Net interest income also declined
in 2001 as a result of the lower levels of earning assets and the general
decline in interest rates in 2001.

Financial Services Group

   The Financial Services Group offers private banking, trust services, asset
management, investments such as mutual funds and stocks, financial planning,
and insurance. A significant portion of this segment's income is derived from
fees, which are generally based on the market values of assets under
management. The decline in net income in 2001 was attributable to increased
expenses associated with operational improvements.

Treasury and Other Corporate

   The primary component of this segment is the Treasury function, which
consists of corporate asset and liability management activities including
investment securities, federal funds purchased and sold, government deposits,
short and long-term borrowings, and managing interest rate and foreign currency
risks. Additionally, the net residual effect of transfer pricing of assets and
liabilities is included in Treasury. The increase in net interest income for
2001 compared to 2000 was due to the increased liquidity of the Company from
the divestitures.

Divested Businesses

   This segment included the financial results for the businesses that the
Company divested or closed in 2001. Revenues and expenses in this segment
declined from prior periods due to the timing of the sales of banking
operations and the closing of the Asia Division.

Corporate Restructuring Related Activities

   This segment reflected the 2001 implementation of the Company's strategic
plan to improve credit quality and to divest underperforming businesses. It
included the impact of the sales of the divested businesses and restructuring
and other related costs of the Company. It also includes losses associated with
accelerated resolution of credit problems undertaken in the first quarter of
2001.

   The Company utilizes "risk-adjusted return on capital" (RAROC) as a
measurement of business segment performance. RAROC is the ratio of net income
to risk-adjusted equity. Equity is allocated to business segments based on risk
factors inherent in the operations of each segment. Another management
performance measurement is "net income after capital charge" (NIACC). NIACC is
net income available to common shareholders less a charge for allocated
capital. The cost of capital is based on the estimated minimum rate of return
expected by the financial markets. The Company assumes a cost of capital that
is equal to the long-term government bond rate plus an additional level of
return for the average risk premium of an equity investment adjusted for the
Company's market risk. Over the past few years the charge for capital has
fluctuated between 12% and 15%.

   NIACC and RAROC results were as follows:

Fourth Quarter Results and Other Matters

   Net income for the fourth quarter of 2001 was $26.3 million, a decrease of
19.3% from the $32.6 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2000. Basic
earnings per share were $0.35 and $0.41 in the fourth quarter of 2001 and 2000,
respectively. Diluted earnings per share were $0.34 and $0.41 in the same
respective periods.

   Net interest income on a tax equivalent basis totaled $106.2 million in the
fourth quarter of 2001, $25.9 million, or 19.6% lower than the same period in
2000. This decline was primarily due to reduced business activity as a result
of the divestitures, the closure of the Asia Division, and the ongoing managed
reduction of loans to improve the Company's credit profile.

   The Company's net interest margin of 3.93% for the fourth quarter was down
from 4.08% in the comparable quarter last year. The decrease was primarily due
to loan reductions and asset sales, including the credit card portfolio, and
lower returns earned on the increased liquidity of the Company.

   The provision for loan and lease losses was $14.5 million for the fourth
quarter 2001, down from $25.8 million in the same quarter last year. The 2001
fourth quarter provision equaled net charge-offs. Included in loan losses was
approximately $10 million recognized in connection with loan sales.

   Non-interest income was $80.0 million for the fourth quarter, including
$28.7 million in sales gains net of investment write-downs. Adjusted for these
items, non-interest income decreased $19.1 million from the fourth quarter of
2000. This decrease was largely due to the intentional downsizing of certain
businesses, sales of the Company's credit card portfolio, Pacific Century Bank
branch franchise and South Pacific entities, and mortgage banking losses of
$8.5 million recorded during fourth quarter 2001. The mortgage banking losses
resulted from unhedged exposure to increases in interest rates.

<PAGE>

   Non-interest expense for the fourth quarter of 2001 was $141.5 million.
Excluding a total of $18.5 million of restructuring and other related costs,
non-interest expense was essentially flat compared to non-interest expense of
$122.9 million in the fourth quarter last year.

   Non-performing assets were reduced by 25.1% during the quarter, dropping
from $106.4 million at September 30, 2001 to $79.7 million at year-end 2001.
NPAs totaled $183.0 million at December 31, 2000. The decline was primarily due
to the sale of foreclosed assets.

report.

                          Forward-Looking Statements

   This report contains forward-looking statements regarding the Company's
beliefs, estimates, projections and assumptions, which are provided to assist
in the understanding of certain aspects of the Company's anticipated future
financial performance. We believe the assumptions underlying our
forward-looking statements are reasonable. However, any of the assumptions
could prove to be inaccurate and actual results may differ materially from
those projected for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to: the
Hawaii economy may not recover at the pace we anticipate; our refocused
emphasis on our Hawaii market may not achieve the customer and revenue gains we
anticipate; our credit markets may deteriorate and our credit quality may fall
short of our goals; we may not achieve the expense reductions we expect; we may
not be able to maintain our net interest margin; we may not be able to
implement our proposed equity repurchases in the amount or at the times
planned; customer acceptance of our business as restructured may be less than
expected; there may be economic volatility in the markets we serve; and there
may be changes in business and economic conditions, competition, fiscal and
monetary policies or legislation. Except where specified, we do not undertake
any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect later events
or circumstances.

                        REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

Shareholders and Board of Directors
Pacific Century Financial Corporation

   We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of condition of
Pacific Century Financial Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001
and 2000, and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders'
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 2001. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

   We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

   In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Pacific
Century Financial Corporation and subsidiaries at December 31, 2001 and 2000,
and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

Note A--Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

   The accounting principles followed by Pacific Century Financial Corporation
and its subsidiaries (the Company), and the methods of applying those
principles conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States and general practices within the banking industry. The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with these accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported
in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results may differ
from those estimates and such differences could be material to the financial
statements. Certain accounts in prior years have been reclassified to conform
with the 2001 presentation. The significant accounting policies are summarized
below.

  Organization/Consolidation

   The Company is a bank holding company providing a broad range of financial
products and services to customers in Hawaii, the West Pacific, and American
Samoa. During the year, the Company divested most of its business in Asia, the
South Pacific, and the U.S. Mainland as part of its strategic plan to provide
increased shareholder value. The majority of the Company's operations consist
of customary commercial and consumer banking services including, but not
limited to, lending, leasing, deposit services, trust and investment activities
and trade financing. The Company's principal subsidiary bank is Bank of Hawaii.
The Company also owns First Savings and Loan Association of America ("First
Savings"). The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and all majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation and minority
interests have been recognized.

   The Company has no investment in unconsolidated, Company sponsored special
purpose entities or other similar business structures. The Company has
investments in leveraged leases, as discussed in Note D.

  International Operations

   As of December 31, 2001, the Company had curtailed most of its international
operations. Bank of Hawaii and First Savings have operations that are conducted
in the West and South Pacific that are denominated in U.S. dollars. These
operations are classified as domestic.

  Acquisitions

   In May 2001, the Company acquired Hawaii Insurance Network LLP (HIN) through
the issuance of 65,146 shares of the Company's common stock. HIN specializes in
the sale of benefit programs such as health plans and disability products.

   In January 1999, the Company acquired Triad Insurance Agency, Inc. (Triad),
a Hawaii-based property/casualty insurance agency. Triad represents a number of
large U.S. property/casualty insurance companies for whom it acts as a
servicing agent. The merger, accounted for as a purchase, has expanded the
Company's range of financial services offered to customers.

   In August 1999, the Company acquired 5.8 million shares, or approximately
10%, of the outstanding shares of the Bank of Queensland Limited in Australia.
In 2001, the Company's ownership interest in the Bank of Queensland Limited was
sold.

  Accounting Changes

   During 2001, the Company adopted the following Statements of Financial
Accounting Standards (SFAS's):


          SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
       Activities (SFAS No. 133), as amended by SFAS No.'s Statements No. 137
       and 138 requires companies to recognize all of its derivative
       instruments as either assets or liabilities in the statement of
       financial position at fair value and was adopted on January 1, 2001. The
       accounting for changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of a
       derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and
       qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further, on the type of
       hedging relationship. For those derivative instruments that are

                                      43

<PAGE>

       designated and qualify as hedging instruments, a company must designate
       the hedging instrument, based upon the exposure being hedged, as a fair
       value hedge, cash flow hedge or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign
       operation. The adoption of SFAS No. 133 did not have a material impact
       on the Company's financial position or results of operations.

          For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair
       value hedge (i.e., hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of
       an asset or a liability or an identified portion thereof that is
       attributable to a particular risk), the gain or loss on the derivative
       instrument as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item
       attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in the same line item
       associated with the hedged item in current earnings during the period of
       the change in fair values (for example, in "interest expense" when the
       hedged item is fixed-rate debt).

          For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash
       flow hedge (i.e., hedging the exposure to variability in expected future
       cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk), the effective
       portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as
       a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings
       in the same line item associated with the forecasted transaction in the
       same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects
       earnings (for example, in "interest expense" when the hedged
       transactions are interest cash flows associated with floating-rate
       debt). The remaining gain or loss on the derivative instrument in excess
       of the cumulative change in the present value of future cash flows of
       the hedged item, if any, is recognized in other income/expense in
       current earnings during the period of change.

          For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a hedge
       of a net investment in a foreign currency, the gain or loss is reported
       in other comprehensive income as part of the cumulative translation
       adjustment to the extent it is effective. Any ineffective portions of
       net investment hedges are recognized in other income/expense in current
       earnings during the period of change.

          For derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, the
       gain or loss is recognized in other income/expense in current earnings
       during the period of change.

          SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial
       Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities (SFAS No. 140) was adopted on
       April 1, 2001. SFAS No. 140 revised the criteria for accounting for
       securitizations and other transfers of financial assets and collateral,
       and introduced new disclosures. Adoption of SFAS No. 140 did not have
       material impact on the Company's financial position or results of
       operations.

          SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations (SFAS No. 141), SFAS No. 141,
       effective June 30, 2001, requires that all business combinations
       initiated after June 30, 2001 be accounted for under the purchase method
       of accounting.

  Investment Securities

   Investment Securities Held to Maturity are those securities, which the
Company has the ability and positive intent to hold to maturity. These
securities are stated at cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and
accretion of discounts. In 2001, 2000 and 1999, there were no transfers from
investment securities held to maturity.

   Investment Securities Available for Sale are recorded at fair value with
unrealized gains and losses recorded as an unrealized valuation adjustment, net
of taxes, in other comprehensive income.

   Trading Securities are those securities that are purchased for the Company's
funding of liabilities associated with certain compensation plans. Securities
in the trading portfolio are carried at fair value with unrealized holding
gains and losses recognized currently in income. Trading Securities of
$3,759,016 and $3,844,000 as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, were
included in Other Assets on the Consolidated Statements of Condition. During
2001, 2000 and 1999, the net gain (loss) from the trading securities portfolio
was

                                      44

<PAGE>

$(1,399,564), $(627,000) and $361,000, respectively, and was recognized as a
component of investment securities gains and (losses) in the Consolidated
Statements of Income. Income from trading securities was $607,524, $464,000 and
$247,000 during 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, and was included as part of
other operating income.

   The Company uses the specific identification method to determine the cost of
all investment securities sold.

  Loans Held for Sale

   Loans Held for Sale are primarily residential mortgage loans. These loans
are recorded at the lower of cost or market on an aggregate basis.

  Loans

   Loans are carried at the principal amount outstanding net of unearned
income. Interest income is generally recognized on the accrual basis. Net loan
fees are deferred and amortized as an adjustment to yield.

   The Company's policy is to discontinue the accrual of income when a loan is
over 90 days delinquent, unless collection is probable based on specific
factors such as the type of borrowing agreement and/or collateral. At the time
a loan is placed on non-accrual, all accrued but unpaid interest is reversed
against current earnings. Subsequent payments received are generally applied to
reduce the principal balance.

  Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses

   The Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses (Allowance) is established through
provisions that are charged against income. Losses on uncollectable loans are
charged against the Allowance, and subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited
to the Allowance.

   The Allowance is maintained at a level believed adequate by management to
absorb estimated inherent losses. Management's periodic evaluation of the
adequacy of the Allowance is based on the Company's past loan loss experience,
known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse conditions that may affect
the borrower's ability to repay (including the timing of future payments), the
estimated value of any underlying collateral, composition of the loan
portfolio, current economic conditions and other factors. This evaluation is
inherently subjective as it requires material estimates including the amounts
and timing of expected cash flows that may be susceptible to significant
changes.

   A loan is considered impaired when it is probable that all amounts due will
not be collected in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan.
Impairment is measured based on discounted cash flows using the loan's initial
effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral for certain
collateral dependent loans. Cash receipts on impaired loans generally are
applied to reduce the carrying value of the loan. Large groups of smaller
balance homogeneous loans, such as residential mortgages and consumer loans,
are evaluated collectively for impairment based primarily on the historical
loss experience for each portfolio.

  Cash and Cash Equivalents

   For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include:
cash and non-interest bearing deposits, interest bearing deposits, securities
purchased under agreements to resell and funds sold. All amounts are readily
convertible to cash and have maturities less than ninety days.

   Under the terms of the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary
Control Act, the Company is required to place reserves with the Federal Reserve
Bank based on the amount of deposits held. During 2001 and 2000, the average
amount of these reserve balances was $17,716,000 and $7,171,000, respectively.

  Premises and Equipment

   Premises and equipment are stated at cost less allowances for depreciation
and amortization. Depreciation is computed using the straight line method over
lives of three to fifty years for premises and improvements, and three to ten
years for equipment.


                                      45

  Foreclosed Real Estate

   Foreclosed Real Estate consists of properties acquired through foreclosure
proceedings or acceptance of a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. These properties
are carried at the lower of cost or fair value based on current appraisals less
selling costs. Losses arising at the time of acquiring such property are
charged against the Allowance. Subsequent declines in property value are
recognized through charges to non-interest expense.

  Mortgage Servicing Rights

   Servicing assets are recognized when mortgage loans are originated and sold
with servicing rights retained. Servicing assets are also periodically
purchased. Servicing assets are recorded at their fair values on the date the
loans are sold or the servicing assets are purchased. The capitalized cost of
servicing assets are amortized over the estimated life of the related loans. An
impairment analysis is performed on a periodic basis and includes a review of
prepayment trends, delinquency and other relevant factors. For purposes of
measuring impairment, servicing assets are stratified by product type.
Impairment is recognized when the carrying value of the servicing assets for a
stratum exceed its fair value. The fair value of servicing assets is estimated
based on a review of servicing right values of loans with similar
characteristics.

  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

   Intangible assets include goodwill and identifiable intangible assets such
as core deposits resulting from acquisitions accounted for under the purchase
method. Goodwill and core intangibles have been amortized using the
straight-line method over periods of 15 to 25 years. These intangible assets
are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.

  Income Taxes

   The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return with the Bank of
Hawaii and its other domestic subsidiaries. Deferred income taxes are provided
to reflect the tax effect of temporary differences between financial statement
carrying amounts and the corresponding tax basis of assets and liabilities.
Deferred taxes are calculated by applying enacted statutory tax rates and tax
laws to future years in which temporary differences are expected to reverse.
The impact on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is
recognized in income in the period that the rate change is enacted. A deferred
tax valuation reserve is established if it is more likely than not that a
deferred tax asset will not be realized.

   The Company's tax sharing policy provides for the settlement of income taxes
between each relevant subsidiary as if the subsidiary had filed a separate
return. Payments are made to the Company by subsidiaries with tax liabilities,
and subsidiaries that generate tax benefits receive payments for those benefits
as used.

   For lease arrangements that are accounted for by the financing method,
investment tax credits are deferred and amortized over the lives of the
respective leases.

  Risk Management Instruments

   The Company utilizes off-balance sheet derivative financial instruments,
primarily as an end-user in connection with its risk management activities and,
to a lesser extent, as a service to accommodate the needs of customers. In the
initial year of adoption of SFAS No. 133, the Company has not implemented any
of the hedge accounting methods (i.e., fair value, cash flows or net investment
in foreign operations) currently addressed under this standard. All risk
management derivative instruments are carried at fair value and the associated
unrealized gains and losses are recognized currently in the Consolidated
Statements of Income. Over the past two years the Company has not used interest
rate swaps as a risk management tool, however it continues to use foreign
exchange contracts to mitigate foreign currency risk.

  Stock-Based Compensation

   The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation plans in accordance
with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 (APB No. 25) and related
interpretations. SFAS No. 123 "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,"
permits companies to elect to recognize stock-based compensation expense based
on the estimated fair value of the awards on the grant date or to continue to
use the accounting under APB No. 25. Included in Note M is the impact of the
fair value of employee stock-based compensation plans on net income and
earnings per share on a pro forma basis for awards granted in 2001, 2000 and
1999.

  Advertising Costs

   The nature of the Company's marketing programs generally do not include
direct-response advertising. The Company, therefore, recognizes its advertising
costs as incurred. Advertising costs were $6,029,000; $6,156,000 and $5,360,000
in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

  Earnings Per Share

   Basic earnings per share (EPS) is computed by dividing net income available
to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the dilutive impact of stock
options and stock appreciation rights and uses the average share price during
the period in determining the number of incremental shares to be added to the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding. For the years ended
December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 there were no adjustments to net income (the
numerator) for purposes of computing basic EPS. A reconciliation of the
weighted average common shares outstanding for computing diluted EPS for 2001,
2000 and 1999 follows:

  Regulatory Matters

   In January 2002, the Company announced that it has satisfied its obligations
under the Memorandum of Understanding imposed by its regulators during the
third quarter of 2000 and it has been removed. Under the Memorandum of
Understanding, the Company had agreed to take certain actions to strengthen and
maintain its operations and financial position, and to request prior approval
for the payments of dividends, increases in indebtedness, or repurchases of
common stock.

  Recent Accounting Standards

   In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS
No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, (SFAS No. 142). SFAS No. 142
eliminates amortization of goodwill associated with business combinations
completed after June 30, 2001. During a transition period from July 1, 2001
through December 31, 2001, goodwill associated with business combinations
completed prior to July 1, 2001 continued to be amortized through the income
statement. Effective January 1, 2002, periodic goodwill amortization and
expense recognition will be discontinued and goodwill will be assessed at least
annually for impairment at the reporting unit level by applying a fair-value
based test. SFAS No. 142 also provides additional guidance on acquired
intangibles that should be separately recognized and amortized. Under SFAS No.
142 intangibles with indefinite lives will no longer be amortized. The Company
adopted SFAS No. 142 on January 1, 2002. An initial impairment assessment was
completed and it was determined that a transition impairment charge will not be
required. Under SFAS No. 142 the elimination of amortization is expected to
increase net income by approximately $7.6 million in 2002.

                                      47

<PAGE>

   In August 2001, FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, (SFAS No. 144). SFAS No. 144 superceded FASB
Statement No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and
Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of (SFAS No. 121), and certain of the
accounting and reporting provisions of APB Opinion No. 30. For long-lived
assets to be held and used, SFAS No. 144 retained the requirements of SFAS No.
121 to (a) recognize an impairment loss only if the carrying value of
long-lived asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows and (b)
measure an impairment loss as the difference between the carrying amount and
fair value of the asset. For long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale, the
SFAS No. 121 model was also retained which requires an asset to be measured at
the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell and to cease
depreciation. SFAS No. 144 establishes criteria beyond that previously
specified in SFAS No. 121 to determine when a long-lived asset is held for
sale. SFAS No. 144 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2001 and is generally to be applied
prospectively. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of SFAS No. 144;
however, it is not expected that the adoption of SFAS No. 144 will have a
material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.

Note B--Divestiture Program and Restructuring Charges

   In April 2001, the Company announced a strategic plan designed to maximize
shareholder value by strengthening its Hawaii and West Pacific operations and
divesting most other holdings. The Company will maintain its operations in
Hawaii, the West Pacific, American Samoa, a representative office in Japan, and
a leasing office in Arizona.

   In March 2001, the Company sold its credit card portfolio.

   In April 2001, the Company's U.S. Mainland subsidiary, Pacific Century Bank,
N.A., sold its nine-branch Arizona franchise.

   In April 2001, the Company sold its entire investment in the Bank of
Queensland Limited in Australia. The Company's convertible notes were sold back
to the Bank of Queensland Limited and its common share investment was sold to a
private Australian investor.

   Between August 2001 and October 2001, the Company closed its Asian branches.

   In September 2001, the Company completed the sale of Pacific Century Bank,
N.A's 19 branch franchise in Southern California.

   In November 2001, the Company completed the sale of its operations in Papua
New Guinea and Vanuatu. The sale of its Fiji operations was finalized in
December 2001. The transaction included two branches in Papua New Guinea, two
in Vanuatu and three in Fiji.

   In December 2001, the Company sold its approximately 95% share interest in
its French Polynesia and New Caledonia operations. The sale included all 17
branches of Bank of Hawaii's subsidiary bank in French Polynesia, Banque de
Tahiti, and all eight branches of its subsidiary bank in New Caledonia, Bank of
Hawaii-Nouvelle Caledonie.

   The remaining accrual of $11.8 million, which is a component of other
liabilities, was comprised of $7.8 million in severance for 65 employees
primarily in the South Pacific, $0.4 million for lease terminations and $3.6
million for other costs associated with the divested businesses.

   In the third quarter of 1999, the Company recorded a restructuring charge of
$22.5 million in connection with a redesign program to enhance revenues,
improve efficiencies and reduce expenses. Implementation of this project was
completed on September 30, 2000. Included in the restructuring charge were
direct and incremental costs associated with the project, including severance
payments, lease termination costs and losses on the disposal of fixed assets.

   Total loans are net of unearned income totaling $204,549,906 and
$253,902,354 as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

   The Company's lending activities are concentrated in its primary geographic
markets of Hawaii, the West Pacific and American Samoa.

   Commercial and mortgage loans totaling $1,389,789,000 and $904,015,000 were
pledged to secure certain public deposits and Federal Home Loan Bank advances
at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

   The Company is the lessor in various leveraged lease agreements beginning
from as far back as 1987 under which airplanes, railcars and water craft, with
estimated economic lives ranging from 20 to 36 years are leased for terms up to
20 years. The Company's equity investment typically represents approximately
21.5 percent of the purchase price; with the remaining percentage being
furnished by third-party financing in the form of long-term debt that provides
for no recourse against the Company and is secured by a first lien on the
asset. At the end of the lease terms, the assets are turned back to the
Company. The residual value at that time is estimated to be a certain
percentage of the costs. For federal income tax purposes, the Company receives
the investment tax credit and has the benefit of tax deductions for
depreciation on the entire leased asset and for interest on the long-term debt.
During the early years of the leases those deductions exceed the lease rental
income, substantial income tax deductions are available to be applied against
the Company's other income. In the later years of the leases, rental income
will exceed the deductions and taxes will be payable. Deferred taxes are
provided to reflect this reversal.

   The $100 million 8.25% Capital Securities (the Securities) were issued in
1996 by Bancorp Hawaii Capital Trust I, a grantor trust wholly-owned by the
Company. The Securities bear a cumulative fixed interest rate of 8.25% and
mature on December 15, 2026. Interest payments are semi-annual. In addition,
the Company has entered into an expense agreement with the trust obligating the
Company to pay any costs, expenses or liabilities of the trust, other than
obligations of the trust to pay amounts due pursuant to the terms of the
Securities. The sole assets of the trust are Junior Subordinated Debt
Securities (the Debt) issued by the Company to the trust. The Debt is
redeemable prior to the stated maturity at the Company's option. The Securities
are subject to mandatory redemption upon repayment of the related Debt at their
stated maturity dates or their earlier redemption at a redemption price equal
to their liquidation amount plus accrued distributions to the date fixed for
redemption and the premium, if any, paid by the Company upon concurrent
repayment of the related Debt. The Company has issued guarantees for the
payment of distributions and payments on liquidation or redemption of the
Securities, but only to the extent of funds held by the trust. The guarantees
are junior subordinated obligations of the Company. Distributions to securities
holders may be deferred for up to five consecutive years. During any such
deferred period the Company's ability to pay dividends on its common shares
will be restricted. The Federal Reserve has announced that certain cumulative
preferred securities, having the characteristics of the Securities, qualify as
minority interest, which is included in Tier 1 capital for bank holding
companies.

   Privately placed notes issued by the Company, including fair value
adjustments, totaled $91 million at December 31, 2001. These notes carry seven
year terms and bear floating interest rates of 10 to 25 basis points above the
three-month LIBOR rate, which was 1.88% at December 31, 2001. No new notes were
issued in 2001.

   Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances bear interest at rates from 5.38% to
8.00% and mature from 2002 through 2006. Long-term FHLB advances that mature
within the next year were classified as current on the Consolidated Statements
of Condition. At December 31, 2001, loans totaling $496,520,000 and FHLB stock
totaling $101,884,000 were pledged to secure these advances.

   Total subordinated notes issued by Bank of Hawaii include $118,891,000
issued in 1993 and $124,585,000 issued in 1999 under the Bank's $1 billion note
programs that mature in 2003 and 2009, respectively. These notes bear a fixed
interest rate of 6.875%.

   Bank of Hawaii converted its existing revolving note program into a $1
billion revolving senior and subordinated note program. Under the terms of this
program Bank of Hawaii may issue additional notes provided that at any time the
aggregate amount outstanding does not exceed $1 billion.

Note I--Shareholders' Equity

   The Company's consolidated banking subsidiaries, Bank of Hawaii and First
Savings, are subject to federal regulatory restrictions that limit cash
dividends and loans to the Company. As of December 31, 2001, approximately
$564,234,000 of undistributed earnings of the Company's consolidated
subsidiaries are available for distribution to the Company without prior
regulatory approval.

   In evaluating capital adequacy, federal regulators require bank holding
companies and insured depository institutions to maintain three capital ratios
at specific minimum levels. Tier 1 Capital (common shareholders' equity reduced
by certain intangibles and increased for qualifying preferred shares and
minority interests) expressed as a percentage of average risk weighted assets
is the Tier 1 Capital Ratio. Total Capital (Tier 1 capital plus qualifying
portions of the reserve for loan and lease losses) expressed as a percentage of
average risk weighted assets is the Total Capital Ratio. The third ratio is the
Leverage Ratio which is Tier 1 Capital divided by average assets.

   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 requires
federal banking regulators to take "prompt corrective action" with respect to
depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For
purposes of applying the prompt corrective action framework, federal bank
regulators group institutions into five categories based on their capital
ratios: "well capitalized," "adequately capitalized," "under capitalized,"
"significantly undercapitalized" and "critically undercapitalized."
Institutions that fail to meet the applicable capital requirements are subject
to increased regulatory monitoring and certain other enforcement actions that
could include restricting dividend payments.

   As of December 31, 2001, the Company, Bank of Hawaii, and First Savings were
all well capitalized under the regulatory provisions for prompt and corrective
action. There were no conditions or events since year-end that management
believes have changed the Company's or its subsidiaries' capital ratings.

   Average assets include short-term interest-bearing deposits with foreign
branches of U.S. banks and large international banks. On average, these
deposits were $834,973,000, $354,391,000 and $577,257,000 during 2001, 2000 and
1999, respectively.

   To measure international profitability, the Company maintains an internal
transfer pricing system that makes certain income and expense allocations,
including interest expense for the use of domestic funds. Interest rates used
in determining charges on advances of funds are based on prevailing deposit
rates. Overhead is allocated based on services rendered by administrative units
to profit centers.

   As discussed in Note B, in 2001 the Company divested its South Pacific
banking operations and closed all branches in the Asia Division, except for a
representative office in Japan.

Note K--Contingent Liabilities

   The Company is a defendant in various legal proceedings and, in addition,
there are various other contingent liabilities arising in the normal course of
business. After consultation with legal counsel, management does not anticipate
that the disposition of these proceedings and contingent liabilities will have
a material effect upon the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Note L--Employee Benefits

   A deferred-compensation profit sharing plan (Profit Sharing Plan) is
provided for the benefit of all employees of the Company and its subsidiaries
who have met the Profit Sharing Plan's eligibility requirements. Contributions
to the Profit Sharing Plan are at the sole discretion of the Company's Board of
Directors. Participants in the Profit Sharing Plan receive up to 50% of their
annual allocation in cash. The remaining amounts are deferred and may be
invested in various options including mutual funds, a collective trust, and
common shares of the Company. The Company's contributions to the Profit Sharing
Plan totaled $3,687,000 in 2001, $4,569,000 in 2000, $6,849,000 in 1999. The
Profit Sharing Plan provides for a company match of $1.25 for each $1.00 in
401(k) contributions made by qualified employees up to a maximum of 2% of the
employee's compensation. For 2001, 2000 and 1999, matching contributions under
this plan totaled $2,945,000, $3,169,000 and $3,176,000, respectively.

   The Company has a defined-contribution money purchase plan (Money Purchase
Plan) under which it contributes 4% of an employee's compensation for employees
meeting certain eligibility and vesting requirements. The Money Purchase Plan
has a one year eligibility requirement and a five year vesting period. For
2001, 2000 and 1999, the Company contributed $5,122,000, $5,553,000 and
$5,898,000, respectively, to the Money Purchase Plan.

   The Company also has an Excess Profit Sharing Plan and an Excess Money
Purchase Plan, which cover certain employees for amounts exceeding the limits
under those plans.

   In 1995, the Company froze its non-contributory, qualified defined-benefit
retirement plan (Retirement Plan) and excess retirement plan (Excess Plan),
which covered employees of the Company and participating subsidiaries who met
certain eligibility requirements. The Company's funding policy is to contribute
annually an amount that falls within the minimum and maximum range deductible
for income tax purposes. Beginning December 31, 2000, the Retirement Plan no
longer provides for compensation increases in the determination of benefits.
Retirement Plan assets are managed by investment advisors in accordance with
investment policies established by the plan trustees.

   Retirement Plan investments primarily consist of marketable securities
including stocks, U.S. Government agency securities, a money market fund,
mutual funds, and a collective investment fund. The assets of the Retirement
Plan include securities of related parties (Pacific Capital Funds, a Pacific
Century Trust collective investment fund, and a Pacific Century Trust money
market fund). Pacific Century Trust is a division of Bank of Hawaii and either
manages or advises the Pacific Capital Funds and the Pacific Century Trust
collective investment fund and money market fund. The fair value of securities
of related parties as of December 31, 2001 was $22,600,000.

   The Excess Plan is a non-qualified excess retirement benefit plan which
covers certain employees of the Company and participating subsidiaries. The
unfunded Excess Plan recognizes the liability to participants for amounts
exceeding the limits allowed under the Retirement Plan.

   For the Excess Plan, the accumulated benefit obligation exceeded the plan
assets. Each of the projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit
obligation and accrued benefit liability were $5.2 million as of December 31,
2001 and $8.1 million as of December 31, 2000. Because the Excess Plan is
unfunded, it has no plan assets.

   The Company's Postretirement Benefit Plans provide retirees with group life,
dental and medical insurance coverage. The cost of providing postretirement
benefits are "shared costs" where both the employer and former employees pay a
portion of the premium. Most employees of the Company and its subsidiaries who
have met the eligibility requirements are covered by this plan. Beginning in
1993, the Company recognizes the transition obligation over 20 years. The
Company has no segregated assets to provide postretirement benefits.

   The medical cost trend rate for employees under the age of 65 was revised at
December 31, 1998 to 8.0% for 1999 and leveling thereafter to 6.0%. The medical
cost trend rate for employees over the age of 65 and the dental cost trend rate
were both revised at December 31, 1998 to a flat rate of 6.0% per year. A one
percent change in this assumption (with all other assumptions remaining
constant) would impact the service and interest cost components of the net
periodic postretirement benefit cost and the postretirement benefit obligation

Note M--Stock Compensation

   The Company Stock Option Plans (the Plans) are administered by the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The Plans provide
participants with the option to purchase shares of common stock at a specified
exercise price and dates not less than one year after the date the option was
granted and expiring ten years from the date of grant. The exercise price is
the fair market value of the shares on the date the option was granted. The
Plans also provide certain participants with stock options in tandem with stock
appreciation rights (SAR). A SAR entitles an optionee, in lieu of exercising
the stock option, to receive cash equal to the excess of the market value of
the shares as of the exercise date over the option price. The expense for the
SARs recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income was zero in 2001 and
2000 and $370,000 in 1999.

   The Company has a Director Stock Option Plan that grants restricted common
shares to directors and requires directors to retain shares exercised
throughout the service period as a director. The plan automatically grants
annually an option for 3,000 shares and a restricted stock grant for 200 shares
to each director of the Company. The exercise price is based on the closing
market price of the shares on the date that the option was granted.

                                      64

<PAGE>

   Each option expires on the tenth anniversary date of its grant and is
generally not transferable. If an optionee ceases to serve as a director for
any reason other than death, the option immediately terminates and any
restricted shares that were previously acquired are subject to redemption at a
price equal to the market value of the shares at the time of grant. As of
December 31, 2001, 121,000 options were outstanding under this plan.

   The following information relates to options outstanding for all the Plans
as of December 31, 2001:

/1/ The Black-Scholes option pricing model was used to develop the fair values
    of the grants.

   During 2001 the Company granted restricted stock of 778,300 shares with a
weighted average fair market value of $21.76 per share. The shares vest over
periods from three to five years from issuance, although accelerated vesting is
provided in certain instances. Shares are cancelled if an employee terminates
prior to the vesting date. During 2001, 50,500 shares were cancelled.

   At the time of grant all shares were considered outstanding. The Company is
recognizing compensation expense, measured as the quoted market price of the
stock on the grant date, straight-line over the vesting period. The unearned
compensation is shown as a separate component of stockholders' equity.
Dividends are paid on the restricted stock.

   Total compensation expense recognized by the Company for restricted stock in
2001 was $2,743,000.

sale of securities of $13,242,000, $(580,000) and $5,776,000 for 2001, 2000 and
1999, respectively. Deferred income taxes reflected the net tax effects of
temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities
for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.

   For financial statement purposes, the Company had deferred investment tax
credits for property purchased for lease to customers of zero, $2,224,000, and
$2,646,000 at December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively. In 2001, 2000
and 1999, investment tax credits included in the computation of the provision
for income taxes were $2,224,000, $422,000 and $331,000, respectively. The
Company has foreign tax credit carry forwards of approximately $5,400,000 at
December 31, 2001, which may be used to offset future federal income tax
expense. The foreign tax credit carry forwards will expire at the end of 2005.
Management expects to generate sufficient foreign source income to utilize the
foreign tax credit carry forwards.

   For financial statement purposes, no deferred income tax liability was
recorded for tax bad debt reserves that arose in tax years beginning before
December 31, 1987. Such tax bad debt reserves totaled approximately $18.2
million for which no provision for federal income taxes was provided. If these
amounts are used for purposes other than to absorb bad debt losses, they will
be subject to federal income taxes at the then applicable rates.

Note O--Derivative and Financial Instruments

   The Company is a party to derivative financial instruments in the normal
course of its business to meet the financing needs of its customers and to
manage its own exposure to fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates.
These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, standby
letters of credit, foreign exchange contracts, interest rate swaps, mortgage
banking loan commitments and interest rate options.

   As with any financial instrument, derivative instruments have inherent
risks. Adverse changes in interest rate, foreign exchange rates, commodity
prices and equity prices affect the Company's market risks. The market risks
are balanced with the expected returns to enhance earnings performance and
shareholder value, while limiting the volatility of each. The Company uses
various processes to monitor the overall market risk exposure, including
sensitivity analysis, value-at-risk valuations and other methodologies.

   The Company's exposure to derivative credit risk is defined as the
possibility of sustaining a loss due to the failure of the counterparty to
perform in accordance with the terms of the contract. Credit risks associated
with derivative financial instruments are similar to those relating to
traditional on-balance sheet financial instruments. The Company manages
derivative credit risk with the same standards and procedures applied to its
commercial lending activity.

   Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as
there is no violation of the terms or conditions established in the contract.
Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses
and may require payment of a fee. Since commitments may expire without being
drawn, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash
requirements. The Company evaluates each customer's credit worthiness on an
individual basis. The amount of collateral obtained is based on management's
credit evaluation of the customer. The type of collateral varies, but may
include cash, accounts receivable, inventory, and property, plant and
equipment. The amount of commitments outstanding is disclosed in Note P.

   Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company
to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. These guarantees
are primarily issued to support borrowing agreements. The credit risk involved
in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in
extending loan facilities to customers. The Company holds cash and deposits as
collateral on those commitments for which collateral is deemed necessary. The
amount of committed standby letters of credit is disclosed in Note P.

   The Company's primary market risks are foreign exchange and interest rate
risk. While the Company utilizes foreign exchange contracts to offset risk
related to an asset or liability that is accounted for at fair value in the
financial statements it has not designated any foreign exchange contracts as
fair value hedges under SFAS No. 133 for operational purposes. Management has
also not used a significant amount of derivative instruments to protect against
the risk of interest rate movements on the value of certain assets and
liabilities or on future cash flows of the Company and instead has tried to
manage interest rate risk with other assets or liabilities.

   From time to time the Company has utilized interest rate-swaps in managing
its exposure to interest rate risk. These financial instruments require the
exchange of fixed and floating rate interest payments based on the notional
amount of the contract for a specified period. In prior years, the Company used
interest rate swap agreements to effectively convert portions of its floating
rate loan portfolio to fixed rate. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, no swaps were
in effect.

                                      68

<PAGE>

   Interest rate options, which primarily consist of caps and floors, are
interest rate protection instruments that involve the obligation of the seller
to pay the buyer an interest rate differential in exchange for a premium paid
by the buyer. This differential represents the difference between current
interest rates and an agreed upon rate applied to a notional amount. Exposure
to loss on these options will increase or decrease over their respective lives
as interest rates fluctuate. The Company may transact interest rate options on
behalf of its customers. However, at December 31, 2001 and 2000, no interest
rate options were in effect.

   As discussed in Note A, on January 1, 2001 the Company adopted SFAS No. 133,
as amended, which requires all derivative instruments to be carried at fair
value on the Consolidated Statements of Condition and established new hedge
accounting principles. As of December 31, 2001, the Company did not designate
any derivative instruments as fair value, cash flows or net investment in
foreign operations hedges and all free standing and embedded derivatives
required to be bifurcated have been recorded at fair value in the results of
operations.

   The derivatives identified and recorded at fair value as of December 31,
2001 were as follows:

          The total notional value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding
       was $238.5 million and had a net fair value of $0.7 million.

          An embedded extended term option with a fixed interest rate on a
       commercial note for $40.0 million issued by the Company to a third party
       was bifurcated and the resulting fair value of the option was recorded
       as an addition to long term debt and a $1.3 million loss was recognized.
       The fair market value of the options was ($1.3 million).

          In the mortgage banking operations, the Company had a notional net
       loan sale commitment of $20.0 million with a fair market value of
       $(136,000). In addition, the Company had commitments to close mortgage
       loans at specific interest rates. The notional amount of these loan
       commitments was $145.5 million with a fair value of ($2.0 million).

Note P--Fair Values of Financial Instruments

   The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the
instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties,
other than in a forced liquidation sale. When possible, fair values are
measured based on quoted market prices for the same or comparable instruments.
Because many of the Company's financial instruments lack an available market
price, management must use its best judgment in estimating the fair value of
those instruments based on present value or other valuation techniques. Such
techniques are significantly affected by estimates and assumptions, including
the discount rate, future cash flows, economic conditions, risk
characteristics, and other relevant factors. These estimates are subjective in
nature and involve uncertain assumptions and, therefore, cannot be determined
with precision. Many of the derived fair value estimates cannot be
substantiated by comparison to independent markets and could not be realized in
immediate settlement of the instrument. Certain financial instruments and all
non-financial instruments are excluded from disclosure requirements.
Accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts presented do not represent the
underlying value of the Company.

   The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating
fair values of financial instruments:

      Cash and Cash Equivalents: The carrying amounts reported in the balance
   sheet for cash and short-term investments approximated the fair value of
   these assets.

      Investment Securities Held to Maturity, Investment Securities Available
   for Sale and Trading Securities: Fair values for investment securities were
   based on quoted market prices, where available. If quoted market prices were
   not available, fair values were based on quoted market prices of comparable
   instruments.

                                      69

<PAGE>

      Loans: Fair values of loans were determined by discounting the expected
   future cash flows of pools of loans with similar characteristics. Loans were
   first segregated by type such as commercial, real estate, consumer, and
   foreign and were then further segmented into fixed and adjustable rate and
   loan quality categories. Expected future cash flows were projected based on
   contractual cash flows, adjusted for estimated prepayments.

      Deposit Liabilities: Fair values of non-interest bearing and interest
   bearing demand deposits and savings deposits were equal to the amount
   payable on demand (e.g., their carrying amounts) because these products have
   no stated maturity. Fair values of time deposits were estimated using
   discounted cash flow analyses. The discount rates used were based on rates
   currently offered for deposits with similar remaining maturities.

      Short-Term Borrowings: The carrying amounts of securities sold under
   agreements to repurchase, funds purchased, commercial paper, and other
   short-term borrowings approximated their fair values.

      Long-Term Debt: Fair values of long-term debt were estimated using
   discounted cash flow analyses, based on the Company's current incremental
   borrowing rates for similar types of borrowings.

      Derivative and Financial Instruments: Fair values of derivative
   instruments (e.g., commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit,
   commercial letters of credit, foreign exchange and swap contracts, and
   interest rate swap agreements) were based on fees currently charged to enter
   into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the
   agreements and the counterparties' credit standing, current settlement
   values or quoted market prices of comparable instruments.

Note Q--Business Segments

   Business segment results are determined based on the Company's internal
financial management reporting process and organizational structure. This
process uses various techniques to assign balance sheet and income statement
amounts to business segments, including allocations of overhead, credit loss
provision, and capital. This process is dynamic and requires certain
allocations based on judgment and subjective factors. Unlike financial
accounting, there is no comprehensive, authoritative guidance for management
accounting that is equivalent to generally accepted accounting principles. The
management accounting process measures the performance of the operating
segments based on the management structure of the Company and is not
necessarily comparable with similar information for any other financial
institution.

   The new organizational structure announced in April 2001 changed the lines
of business that were used to analyze financial performance. Results for prior
periods have been reclassified to facilitate comparability of the business
segment results.

   Because business segment financial reports are prepared using accounting
practices that differ from accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States, certain amounts reflected therein do not agree with
corresponding amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

   The Company's business segments are as follows:

  Retail Banking

   The Company's Retail Banking franchise and market share in Hawaii and
American Samoa are key strengths of the Company. Retail Banking provides
checking and savings products for the consumer and small business segments,
merchant services, installment, home equity and mortgage lending products, as
well as other products and services.

  Commercial Banking

   The Commercial Banking segment offers corporate banking, commercial
products, leasing, commercial real estate lending and auto finance. The
Company's West Pacific operations are included in this segment.

  Financial Services Group

   The Financial Services Group offers private banking, trust services, asset
management, investments such as mutual funds and stocks, financial planning,
and insurance. A significant portion of this segment's income is derived from
fees, which are generally based on the market values of assets under management.

  Treasury and Other Corporate

   The primary component of this segment is the Treasury function, which
consists of corporate asset and liability management activities including
investment securities, federal funds purchased and sold, government deposits,
short and long-term borrowings, and managing interest rate and foreign currency
risks. Additionally, the net residual effect of transfer pricing of assets and
liabilities is included in Treasury, along with other minor unallocated
amounts. Eliminations of intercompany transactions are also reflected in this
segment.

  Divestitures and Corporate Restructuring Related Activities

   This information reflected the 2001 implementation of the Company's
strategic plan to improve credit quality and to divest underperforming
businesses. It includes the impact of the sales of the divested businesses and
restructuring and other related costs of the Company. It also includes losses
associated with the accelerated resolution of credit problems undertaken in the
first quarter of 2001.
