PART I

Item 1.  Business

General

Acme United Corporation (together with its subsidiaries the "Company") was
organized as a partnership in l867 and incorporated in l882 under the laws of
the State of Connecticut. During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company
restructured its European operations, closing its facility in England and moving
those operations to Germany. The Company's continuing operations are in the
United States, Canada and Germany. Financial information concerning net sales
and long-lived assets by geographic area appears in Note 11 of the notes to
consolidated financial statements.

The Company manufactures and sells cutting devices, measuring instruments and
safety products for school, office and home use in the United States, Canada and
Europe. In addition to local competitors in each country, the Company competes
with imported products from Asia.

Independent manufacturer representatives are primarily used to sell its line of
consumer products to wholesale, contract and retail stationery distributors,
office supply super stores, school supply distributors, and mass market
retailers. The Company had three customers with sales of 10% or more of total
sales.

                                      (2)

Other

Environmental Rules and Regulations - Environmental rules and regulations
regarding hazardous waste control and electroplating effluent have been complied
with and the Company believes no major financial impact is expected to result
from current and future compliance with these rules and regulations.

Employment - As of year-end, the Company employed 100 persons, most of whom are
full time and none of whom are covered by union contracts. Employee relations
are considered good and no foreseeable problems with the work force are evident.

Item 2.  Properties

Acme United Corporation is headquartered at 1931 Black Rock Turnpike, Fairfield,
Connecticut in 5,700 square feet of leased space. The Company owns and leases
manufacturing and warehousing facilities in the United States totaling 80,000
square feet and leases 44,000 square feet of warehousing space in Canada.
Manufacturing for Europe is presently being conducted at a 48,000 square foot
owned plant in Solingen, Germany.

Management believes that the Company's facilities, whether leased or owned, are
adequate to meet its current needs and should continue to be adequate for the
foreseeable future.

Properties owned by the Company in Fremont, North Carolina and Solingen, Germany
are collateralized by notes and mortgages. The leased facilities are occupied
under leases for terms ranging from less than one year to five years.

Item 3.  Legal Proceedings

The Company has been involved in certain environmental and other matters.
Additionally, the Company has been involved in numerous legal actions relating
to the use of certain latex products, which the Company distributes, but does
not manufacture. The Company is one of many defendants. The Company has been
released from the majority of the lawsuits. While one lawsuit remains, it is
still in the preliminary stage and it has not been determined whether the
Company's products were involved. Based on information available, the Company
believes there will not be a material adverse impact on financial position,
results of operations, or liquidity from these matters, either individually or
in aggregate.

Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
         of Operations

Operating results may be effected by certain accounting estimates and critical
accounting policies. The most sensitive and significant accounting estimates
and/or critical accounting policies in the financial statements relate to
revenue recognition, asset valuation allowances for deferred income tax assets,
obsolete inventories, potentially uncollectible accounts receivable, and
accruals for income taxes and customer rebates. Management critically evaluates
the potential realization of deferred incomes tax benefits as well as the likely
usefulness of inventories and the collectabliity of accounts receivable.
Accruals for customer rebates are based on executed contracts and anticipated
sales levels, which are monitored monthly. Accruals for income taxes or benefits
often require interpretations of complex tax rules and regulations, which may be
subsequently challenged. There have been no significant changes in estimates for
any period presented by the accompanying financial statements nor have there
been any changes in accounting principles or practices, which materially effect
them. Changes in accounting practices have been limited to the adoption of
required new standards; the impact of which has also been insignificant.

Special Event

During the second quarter of 2002, the Company initiated liquidation procedures
for Acme United Limited (AUL), a subsidiary located in the United Kingdom. Costs
and expenses for 2002 included restructuring charges related thereto of
$555,000. For the year ended December 31, 2001, AUL recorded a net loss of
$495,000 on net sales of $2.0 million, representing a sales decline of
approximately $1.2 million or 38% from the prior year. The restructuring charges
are comprised mainly of severance, lease termination costs, and inventory
write-offs. The Company expects to continue to retain the majority of AUL's
customers and sell products to them through its German subsidiary.


Results of Operations 2002 Compared with 2001

Net sales decreased $2,198,033, or 7% in 2002 to $30,883,570 compared to
$33,081,603 in 2001. Net sales in the United States decreased $655,000 or 3% due
to weak economic conditions. International net sales decreased $1,543,000 or
16%. This was primarily due to discontinuing certain product lines in the UK
business in an effort to focus more on the Company's core products.

Gross profit was 33.8% of net sales in 2002 compared to 32.5% of net sales in
2001. Excluding the inventory write-down associated with the AUL liquidation,
gross profit was 34.5% of net sales in 2002. The introduction of new products
and productivity gains on existing products were the main reasons for the
improved gross margins.

Selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG&A") were $9,528,080 in 2002
compared with $8,284,751 in 2001, an increase of $1,243,329 or 15%. SG&A
expenses were 31% of net sales compared to 25% in 2001. Planned investments in
new product development and the addition of key management positions in Canada
and Europe were the main reasons for the increase.

Operating income in 2002 was $556,006 compared with $2,469,589 in 2001.
Excluding restructuring charges, operating income was $1,111,351 in 2002, a
decrease of $1,358,238. The decrease was mainly due to the increased spending in
SG&A and lower sales in the UK, which was partially offset by improved
productivity in cost of sales.

Interest expense for 2002 was $605,344, compared with $790,910 for 2001, an
$185,566 decrease mainly attributable to the decline in debt and lower interest
rates. Total debt less available cash declined to $4.5 million at December 31,
2002 compared to $5.5 million at December 31, 2001.

Net other income was $146,614 in 2002 compared to net other income of $33,547 in
2001. The change from 2001 is principally due to non-recurring foreign exchange
transaction losses associated with a cross border loan in 2001.

In 2002, the Company recognized a significant one-time income tax benefit
associated liquidating AUL. The benefit recognized was substantially in excess
of income taxes computed at the statutory rate.

Results of Operations 2001 Compared with 2000

Net sales increased $1,161,008, or 4% in 2001 to $33,081,603 compared to
$31,920,595 in 2000. Net sales in the United States increased $2,465,547 or 12%
due to increased sales in the mass market and the superstores. International net
sales decreased $1,303,539 or 12% primarily due to discontinuing a distribution
agreement with a third party in England. On January 1, 2002, the Company adopted
Emerging Issues Task Force consensus No. 00-25, Vendor Income Statement
Characterization of Consideration Paid to a Reseller of the Vendors Products. In
connection with this adoption, expense related to payments made to customers was
classified as a reduction of sales. Expense relating to such payments totaled
$3,083,000 in 2001 compared to $2,492,000 in 2000.

Gross profit was 33% of net sales in 2001 compared to 30% of net sales in 2000.
The introduction of new products coupled with improved operating efficiencies in
North America were the main reasons for the improvement.

                                      (5)
<PAGE>

Selling, general and administrative expenses were $8,284,751 in 2001 compared
with $7,256,187 in 2000, an increase of $1,028,564 or 14%. SG&A expenses were
25.0% of net sales compared to 22.7% in 2000. The addition of key management
positions and lower pension income in 2001were the main reasons for the
increase.

Net other income was $33,547 in 2001 compared to net other expense of $406,211
in 2000. The change from 2000 is principally due to a gain on the sale of
marketable equity securities of $474,551 which was offset by a loss on disposal
of fixed assets and foreign exchange losses. In 2000, the expense related
primarily to losses on the disposal of fixed assets.

Interest expense decreased $136,039 in 2001 to $790,910 compared to $926,949 in
2000 due to lower borrowings and lower interest rates.

The Company's effective income tax rate increased to 25% in 2001 compared to 3%
in 2000. In 2001, the Company utilized approximately $2,491,000 of its federal
income tax net operating loss carryforwards putting it in a net deferred tax
liability position in the U.S. The Company had recorded a valuation allowance
for its deferred income tax assets in the prior year due to uncertainty of
realizing this benefit. In 2001, valuation allowance relating to U.S. tax
jurisdictions were reversed. The Company expects to utilize its remaining
federal and state net operating loss carryforwards in 2002. The Company expects
its tax rate in 2002 to approximate 38%.


Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company's working capital, current ratio and long term debt to equity ratio
follow:

                                                       2002          2001
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Working Capital                                     $8,515,910    $8,760,140
Current Ratio                                        2.33 to 1     2.14 to 1
Long - Term Debt to Equity Ratio                         24.0%         33.2%

The decrease in working capital and increase in the current ratio in 2002 is
attributable to management's efforts, in general, to improve asset management
and, more specifically, to reduce inventory levels. Inventories decreased
$2,119,000 or 24% in 2002 while the Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) increased
slightly from 67 in 2001 to 69 in 2002. Operating activities generated net cash
of approximately $1.6 million in 2002.

On August 2, 2002, the Company entered into a new revolving loan agreement (the
Agreement). The Agreement allows for borrowings up to a maximum of $10,000,000
based on a formula, which applies specific percentages to balances of accounts
receivable and inventories. All outstanding borrowings are due on July 31, 2005.
At December 31, 2002 $3,814,612 is outstanding and $2,567,978 is available under
the Agreement based on this formula. Throughout 2003, the Company expects to
have a minimum of $1,783,000 outstanding under the Agreement. As such, amounts
borrowed in excess of $1,783,000 are classified as part of the current portion
of long-term debt. Amounts outstanding under the Agreement bear interest at the
LIBOR rate plus 1.75 percent (3.13% at December 31, 2002).

On August 22, 2000 the Company borrowed $700,000 under a loan agreement with
another bank to refinance a mortgage. The loan is payable in monthly
installments of $6,928, including interest at the Federal Home Loan Bank of
Seattle fixed advanced rate, plus 3.0%, adjusting every five years, through
August 1, 2020 and a final installment of $500,800, plus interest, due on August
1, 2020. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the interest rate was 9.78%.

The Company, among other things, is restricted with respect to additional
borrowings, investments, mergers, distributions and property and equipment
purchases. Further, the Company is required to maintain specific amounts of
tangible net worth, and a specified debt service coverage ratio, and a fixed
charge coverage ratio, all as defined. The Company was in compliance with all
covenants as of or through December 31, 2002 and believes these financial
covenants will continue to be met for the remainder of the term of the debt.

                                      (6)
<PAGE>

Capital expenditures during 2002 were $484,088, which were, in part, financed
with debt. Capital expenditures in 2003 are not expected to be material.

Cash generated from operating activities, together with funds available under
the Agreement, is expected, under current conditions, to be sufficient to
finance the Company's planned operations in 2003.

Interest Rate Risk:

The Company's interest expense on debt is most sensitive to changes in the level
of United States interest rates. To mitigate the impact of these fluctuations,
the Company periodically evaluates alternative interest rate arrangements. In
2000, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a bank to
minimize exposure to interest rate changes for $3.5 million of debt. The swap
agreement expired on January 19, 2003.

Foreign Currency Risk:

The Company manufactures products in the United States and Germany. Further, the
Company engages in intracompany sales which are denominated in currencies other
than those of the operating entity making the sale. As such, these transactions
give rise to foreign currency risk. The Company's currency exposures vary, but
are concentrated in the Canadian dollar, British pound, and Euro.

At times, the Company utilizes forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge
specific transactions with third parties denominated in foreign currencies. The
terms of these forward foreign exchange contracts are typically under 90 days.
Because the contracts are acquired for specific transactions, they are an
effective hedge against fluctuations in the value of the foreign currency
underlying the transaction. Forward foreign exchange contracts for such
transactions were not material at December 31, 2002 and 2001. The Company does
not hedge intracompany sales nor does it enter into financial instruments for
speculation or trading purposes.

The Company and its foreign subsidiaries utilize bank loans to finance their
operations. To mitigate foreign currency risk, foreign loans are denominated in
the local currency of the foreign subsidiary wherever possible. In 2001, the
Company entered into a forward foreign exchange contract and currency option
agreement to hedge its U.S. denominated intercompany loan of $2.0 million to its
Canadian subsidiary.

Inflation

Inflation had a negligible effect on the Company's operations during 2002 and
2001. The Company estimates that inflationary effects, in the aggregate, were
generally recovered or offset through increased pricing or cost reductions in
both years.

Acme United Corporation and Subsidiaries
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.  Operations

The operations of Acme United Corporation (the Company) consist of a single
reportable segment, which operates in the United States, Canada, and Germany.
Principal products are scissors, shears, rulers, first aid kits, and related
products which are sold primarily to wholesale, contract and retail stationery
distributors, office supply super stores, school supply distributors, drug store
retailers and mass market retailers.

2.  Accounting Policies

Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

Principles of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, all of which are wholly owned. All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in
consolidation.

Translation of Foreign Currency - For foreign operations, assets and liabilities
are translated at rates in effect at the end of the year; revenues and expenses
are translated at average rates in effect during the year. Resulting translation
adjustments are made directly to accumulated other comprehensive loss. Foreign
currency transaction gains and losses are recognized in operations. Foreign
currency transaction gains (losses) which are included in other income (expense)
were $57,000 in 2002, $(153,000) in 2001 and $(8,000) in 2000.

Cash Equivalents - Investments with an original maturity of three months or less
at the date of purchase are considered cash equivalents.

Accounts Receivable - Accounts receivable are shown less an allowance for
doubtful accounts of $205,213 in 2002 and $209,508 in 2001.

Inventories - Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, determined by the
first in, first out method, or market.

Plant, Property and Equipment and Depreciation - Plant, property and equipment
is recorded at cost. Depreciation is computed by the straight-line method over
the estimated useful lives of the assets which range from 3 to 30 years. In 2000
and in connection with continued expansion of sourcing of production to
facilities outside the United States, the Company disposed of certain equipment
no longer in use at a loss of $343,138 and segregated other equipment for
transfer and installation in the foreign production facilities. The Company
temporarily suspended depreciation on the equipment segregated. Depreciation
thereon resumed when the equipment was placed in service in January, 2001. Had
depreciation continued in 2000, depreciation expense would have been higher by
approximately $200,000.

Asset Impairments - The Company evaluates the propriety of the carrying amounts
of its long-lived assets, including goodwill, at least annually, or when current
events and circumstances indicate a potential impairment. The Company believes
that there are no significant impairments of the carrying amounts of such assets
and no reduction in their estimated useful lives is warranted.

Intangible Assets - Intangible assets with a finite useful life are recorded at
cost upon acquisition and amortized over the term of the related contract.
Intangible assets held by the Company with a finite useful life include deferred
financing costs, patents, and trademarks. Deferred financing costs are amortized
over the term of the related debt. Patents and trademarks are amortized over
their estimated useful life. The weighted average amortization period of
intangible assets at December 31, 2002 is 12 years.

                                      (13)
<PAGE>

Goodwill - As of January 1, 2002, the Company adopted Financial Accounting
Standards Board Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (FAS
142) and as such no longer amortizes goodwill but rather tests it annually for
impairment. There was no impairment of goodwill at January 1, 2002. Had
Statement No. 142 been in effect as of the beginning of 2000, amortization
expense for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 would have been reduced
by $28,000, respectively, increasing net income by the same amount with no
effect on earnings per share.

Deferred Income Taxes - Deferred income taxes are provided on the differences
between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities and on
operating loss carryovers using enacted tax rates in effect in years in which
the differences are expected to reverse.

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - At December 31, 2002, the Company has
one stock-based employee compensation plan, which is described more fully in
Note 11. The Company has elected to adopt the disclosure only provisions of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, and continues to measure costs for its employee stock compensation
plans by using the accounting methods prescribed by APB Opinion No. 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, which allows that no compensation cost
be recognized unless the exercise price of the options granted is greater than
the fair market value of the Company's stock at date of grant. Accordingly, no
stock-based employee compensation cost is reflected in net income, as all
options granted had an exercise price equal to the market value of the
underlying common stock on the date of grant.

The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share
if the company had applied the fair value method under SFAS No. 123, Accounting
for Stock Based Compensation, to stock based employee compensation.

</TABLE>

Revenue Recognition - The Company recognizes revenue from sales of its products
when ownership transfers to the customers. Ownership transfers from the Company
to its customer upon shipment of the Company's products.

Research and Development - Research and development costs ($385,066 in 2002,
$147,115 in 2001 and $46,368 in 2000) are charged to operations as incurred.

Shipping Costs - Shipping costs ($1,272,115 in 2002, $1,189,930 in 2001, and
$1,117,645 in 2000) are included in selling, general and administrative
expenses.

Advertising Costs - The Company expenses the production costs of advertising the
first time the advertising takes place. Advertising costs ($766,058 in 2002,
$506,557 in 2001, and $464,326 in 2000) are included in selling, general and
administrative expenses.

Concentrations - The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its
customers and generally does not require collateral. Allowances for credit
losses are provided and have been within management's expectations. Net sales
for 2002, 2001 and 2000 include three major customers, Staples, Inc., Boise, and
United Stationers, Inc., which aggregate approximately 44%, 43%, and 34%,
respectively.

Consideration paid to a reseller - As of January 1, 2002, the Company also
adopted the Emerging Issues Task Force consensus No. 00-25, Vendor Income
Statement Characterization of Consideration Paid to a Reseller of a Vendor's
Products (EITF 00-25). As such, the Company recognizes consideration paid to a
reseller of its product as a reduction of the selling price of its products and,
therefore, reduces revenue in the Company's statement of operations. The
adoption of EITF 00-25 had no effect on net income or earnings per share.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31,
2001 and 2000 have been reclassified to conform to the new classification
resulting in a $3,083,000 and $2,492,000 decrease of selling, general and
administrative expenses and net sales for these respective periods.

Derivatives - As of January 1, 2001, the Company adopted Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities (Statement 133) which was issued in June, 1998 and its
amendments Statements 137, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities-Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133, and 138,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities, issued in
June, 1999 and June 2000, respectively (collectively referred to as Statement
133).
                                      (14)
<PAGE>

As a result of adoption of Statement 133, the Company recognizes all derivative
financial instruments, such as interest rate swap contracts, foreign exchange
contracts, and foreign currency option contracts, in the consolidated financial
statements at fair value regardless of the purpose or intent for holding the
instrument. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are
either recognized periodically in operations or in stockholders' equity as a
component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) depending on whether
the derivative financial instrument qualifies for hedge accounting, and if so,
whether it qualifies as a fair value hedge or cash flow hedge. Generally,
changes in fair values of derivatives accounted for as fair value hedges are
recorded in operations along with the portions of the changes in the fair values
of the hedged items that relate to the hedged risk(s). Changes in fair values of
derivatives accounted for as cash flow hedges, to the extent they are effective
as hedges, are recorded in other comprehensive(loss) income net of deferred
income taxes. Changes in fair value of derivatives used as hedges of the net
investment in foreign operations are reported in other comprehensive
income(loss) as part of the cumulative translation adjustment. Changes in fair
values of derivatives not qualifying as hedges are reported in operations.

The adoption of Statement 133 resulted in a cumulative effect of an accounting
change of $104,207 decrease to other comprehensive income.

Prior to January 1, 2001, the Company also used interest rate swap contracts and
foreign exchange contracts for hedging purposes. For interest rate swaps, the
net amounts paid or received and net amounts accrued through the end of the
accounting period were included in interest expense. Unrealized gains or losses
on interest rate swap contracts were not recognized in operations. For foreign
currency forward contracts hedging firm commitments, the effects of movements in
currency exchange rates on those instruments were recognized when the related
operating revenue was recognized. Realized gains and losses were included in
other assets and liabilities and recognized in operations when the future
transaction occurred or at the time the transaction was no longer expected to
occur.

6.  Pension and Profit Sharing

United States employees, hired prior to July 1, 1993, are covered by a funded,
defined benefit pension plan. The benefits are based on years of service and the
average compensation of the highest three consecutive years during the last ten
years of employment. In December 1995, the Company's Board of Directors approved
an amendment to the United States pension plan ceasing all future benefit
accruals as of February 1, 1996, without terminating the pension plan.

At December 31, 2002 and 2001, plan assets include 30,000 shares of the
Company's Common Stock having a market value of $112,800 and $117,000 at those
dates, respectively.

Other disclosures related to the pension plan follow:

In 2001, the pension plan made settlement distributions of $793,165 to certain
plan beneficiaries. Such payments resulted in a $102,386 settlement loss.

The Company also has a qualified, non-contributory profit sharing plan covering
substantially all United States employees. Annual Company contributions are
determined by the Compensation Committee. Through December 31, 2001,
contributions amounted to 2% of eligible employee earnings and a 50% match up to
the first 2% of employee contributions. For the year ended December 31, 2002,
contributions amounted to a 50% match up to the first 3% of employee
contributions. Total contribution expense under this plan approximated $53,000,
$51,000, $42,000 for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

The Company provides deferred income taxes on foreign subsidiary earnings, which
are not considered permanently reinvested. Earnings permanently reinvested would
become taxable upon the sale or liquidation of a foreign subsidiary or upon the
remittance of dividends. Foreign subsidiary earnings of $1,287,000 and
$1,258,000 are considered permanently reinvested as of December 31, 2002 and
2001, respectively, and the amount of deferred income taxes thereon cannot be
reasonably determined.

Due to the uncertain nature of the realization of the Company's deferred income
tax assets based on past performance and carry forward expiration dates, the
Company has recorded a valuation allowance for the amount of deferred income tax
assets which are not expected to be realized. This valuation allowance is
subject to periodic review, and if the allowance is reduced, the tax benefit
will be recorded in future operations as a reduction of the Company's tax
expense.

At December 31, 2002, the Company has tax operating loss carryforwards
aggregating $4,880,000 of which $1,237,000 relate to United States Federal
income taxes which expires in 2018 and $621,000 relate to state income taxes
which expires in 2008. Carry forwards applicable to Germany of $2,628,000 can be
carried forward indefinitely: Carry forwards applicable to Canada of $394,000
expires from 2005 - 2007.

the Agreement based on this formula. Throughout 2003, the Company expects to
have a minimum of $1,783,000 outstanding under the Agreement. As such, amounts
borrowed in excess of $1,783,000 are classified as part of the current portion
of long-term debt. Amounts outstanding under the Agreement bear interest at the
LIBOR rate plus 1.75 percent (3.13% at December 31, 2002).

The Company also transferred its interest rate swap agreement, which fixes the
effective interest rate at 7.18 percent for $3,500,000 of debt under the
Agreement. The swap agreement expires January 19, 2003.

On August 22, 2000 the Company borrowed $700,000 under a loan agreement with
another bank to refinance a mortgage. The loan is payable in monthly
installments of $6,928, including interest at the Federal Home Loan Bank of
Seattle fixed advanced rate, plus 3.0%, adjusting every five years, through
August 1, 2020 and a final installment of $500,800, plus interest, due on August
1, 2020. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the interest rate was 9.78%. The loan is
collateralized by a First Trust Deed and Assignment of Rents on the property
located 701 South Wilson Street in Fremont, North Carolina.

The Company, among other things, is restricted with respect to additional
borrowings, investments, mergers, and property and equipment acquisitions.
Further, the Company is required to maintain specific amounts of tangible net
worth, a specified debt service coverage ratio, and a fixed charge coverage
ratio, all as defined. The Company believes these financial covenants will
continue to be met.

Maturities of long-term debt for the next five years follow: 2003 - $2,730,977;
2004 - $1,165,137; 2005 - $46,073 - 2006 - $49,821 and 2007 $54,682.

Interest paid was $605,344 in 2002, $762,855 in 2001, and $822,399 in 2000.

9.  Commitments and Contingencies

The Company leases certain office, manufacturing and warehouse facilities and
various equipment under non-cancelable operating leases. Total rent expense was
$165,854 in 2002, $170,111 in 2001, and $203,135 in 2000. Minimum annual rental
commitments under non-cancelable leases with initial or remaining terms of one
year or more as of December 31, 2002 to their expiration follow: 2003 -
$154,840; 2004 - $104,892; 2005 - $88,920; 2006 - $58,997; and 2007 - $1,4550.

The Company has been involved in certain environmental and other matters.
Additionally, the Company has been involved in numerous legal actions relating
to the use of certain latex products, which the Company distributes, but does
not manufacture. The Company is one of many defendants. The Company has been
released from the majority of the lawsuits. While one lawsuit remains, it is
still in a preliminary stage and it has not been determined whether the
Company's products were involved. Based on information available, the Company
believes that there will not be a material adverse impact on financial position,
results of operations, or liquidity, from these matters, either individually or
in aggregate.

11.  Stock Option Plans

The Company's amended and restated stock option plan, which provides incentive
and nonqualified stock options for up to 790,000 shares of the Company's Common
Stock to officers and key employees (the Employee's Plan) terminated on February
24, 2002. Options previously granted under the Employee's Plan continue to vest
and to be exercisable in accordance with their terms, however, no new options
may be granted under the Employee's Plan. The Employee's Plan provided for the
purchase of shares of the Company's Common Stock at a price of not less than
100% of its fair market value at the date of grant. Generally, options granted
under the Employee's Plan prior to June 24, 1996 vested immediately or within a
year; after June 24, 1996, 25% of options granted vest immediately with the
balance vesting over the next three years. The term of options issued cannot
exceed 10 years from the date of grant.

Effective February 26, 2002, the Company adopted a new officers and key
employees stock option plan which provides incentive and nonqualified stock
options for up to 150,000 shares of the Company's Common Stock to officers and
key employees (the New Employee's Plan). The New Employee's Plan provided for
the purchase of shares of the Company's Common Stock at a price of not less than
100% of its fair market value at the date of grant. The term of options issued
cannot exceed 10 years from the date of grant.

The Company also has a stock option plan which provides nonqualified stock
options for up to 160,000 shares of the Company's Common Stock to non-salaried
directors (the Director's Plan). The original Director's Plan, as approved at
the 1996 Annual Meeting, granted 10,000 options to new directors elected to the
Board at the 1996 Annual Meeting and for subsequent Annual Meetings, which
vested one year after the grant date. The Director's Plan was amended in 1997 to
grant 10,000 options to directors elected at the 1997 Annual Meeting, who were
first elected prior to the 1996 Annual Meeting, which vested immediately. The
Director's Plan was amended again in 1998 to grant 2,500 options to each
director re-elected to the Board at the annual meeting. These options vest
immediately.

During 2002 and 2001, an additional 2,500 and 7,500 options were granted to each
director, respectively. The Director's Plan provides for the purchase of shares
of the Company's Common Stock at a price of not less than 100% of its fair value
at the date of grant.

A summary of changes in options issued under the Company's two stock option
plans follows:

</TABLE>

The weighted average remaining contractual life of outstanding stock options is
6 years.

The Company applies APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees
and related interpretations to recognize compensation expense under its stock
option plans. As such, no expense is recognized if, at the date of grant, the
exercise price of the option is at least equal to the fair market value of the
Company's Common Stock. No compensation expense related to the Company's stock
option plans was required to be recognized for its plans in 2002, 2001 and 2000.

The weighted average fair value at the date of grant for options granted during
2002, 2001, and 2000 is $1.82, $1.57, $1.44 per option, respectively.

The fair value of options at the date of grant was estimated using the
Black-Scholes model with the following weighted average assumptions:

For 2002, 2001, and 2000, 610,775, 721,898 and 579,133 stock options,
respectively, were excluded from diluted earnings per share calculations because
they would have been anti-dilative.

14.  Financial Instruments

The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating its
fair value disclosures for financial instruments:

Cash and cash equivalents: The carrying amount reported in the balance sheet for
cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value.

Accounts receivable and accounts payable: The carrying amounts reported in the
balance sheet for accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair
value.

Long-and short-term debt: The carrying amounts of the Company's borrowings under
its short-term notes payable and revolving credit arrangements approximate their
fair value. The fair values of the Company's long-term debt are estimated using
discounted cash flow analyses, based on the Company's current incremental
borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements.

Foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps: The fair values of the
Company's foreign currency contracts and interest rate swaps are estimated based
on dealer quotes.

The carrying amounts and fair values of the Company's financial instruments
follow (000's omitted):

Derivative Financial Instruments

Derivative financial instruments consist of interest rate swaps and in 2001
foreign exchange contracts. The Company uses such derivatives for fair value or
cash flow hedging purposes as part of its risk management strategy. Following is
a summary of the Company's risk management strategies and the effect of them on
the Company's consolidated financial statements.

Fair Value Hedging Strategy

At times, the Company utilizes forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge
certain firm commitments with third parties denominated in foreign currencies.
The terms of these forward foreign exchange contracts are typically under 90
days. Because the contracts are acquired for specific transactions, they are an
effective hedge against fluctuations in the value of the foreign currency
underlying the transaction. There were no forward foreign exchange contracts
held at December 31, 2002; those held at December 31, 2001 were not material.

The Company and its foreign subsidiaries utilize bank loans to finance their
operations. To mitigate foreign currency risk, foreign loans are denominated in
the local currency of the foreign subsidiary wherever possible. In 2001, the
Company entered into a forward foreign exchange contract and currency option
agreements to hedge its U.S. denominated intercompany loan of $2.0 million to
its Canadian subsidiary.

Ineffective portions of fair value hedges were not material in 2002.

                                      (25)
<PAGE>
Cash Flow Hedging Strategy

In 2000, the Company entered into interest-rate swap agreement that effectively
converted a portion of its floating-rate debt to a fixed-rate basis through
January 19, 2003, the loan maturity date, thus reducing the impact of
interest-rate changes on future income.

During 2002, 2001 and 2000, the Company recognized expense of $174,122, $95,471
and $4,875 respectively, related to the net amounts paid and accrued on interest
rate swaps, which are included in interest expense in each year's respective
consolidated statements of income. There was no ineffectiveness in 2002 relating
to the interest rate swap.

15.  Restructuring Charges

In 2002, restructuring charges of approximately $555,000 were recorded as a
result of certain strategic and operating changes initiated by the Company's
management related to liquidating Acme United Limited (AUL), a United Kingdom
subsidiary. The restructuring charges consisted of a write-down of inventories
of $206,000, accounting and legal costs of $95,000, lease cancellation costs of
$90,000, a write-off of goodwill of $69,000, severance costs of $55,000, other
closing costs of $22,000, a write-off of uncollectible accounts receivable of
$9,000 and write-offs of equipment of $9,000. As of December 31, 2002, the
restructuring was substantially complete and approximately $36,000 remained in
accrued restructuring charges, primarily related to accounting and legal costs.
The Company terminated five employees as part of the restructuring. There will
be no further terminations and all severance costs related to the restructuring
have been paid. The Company expects to continue to retain the majority of AUL's
customers and sell products to them through its German subsidiary.

Report of Ernst & Young LLP, Independent Auditors

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Acme United Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Acme United
Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders' equity, and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2002. Our
audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at
Item 14(a). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of
the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Acme United
Corporation and subsidiaries at December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the consolidated
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2002 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States. Also, in our opinion, the related
financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial
statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
