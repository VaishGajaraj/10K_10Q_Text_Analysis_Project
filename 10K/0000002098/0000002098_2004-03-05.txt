<DESCRIPTION>FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED 12/31/2003
<TEXT>

To my fellow shareholders:

Acme United generated strong results in 2003. Net sales were $35.0 million, an
increase of 13% over 2002. Pretax income increased by $2.2 million. Net income
was $1.2 million, an increase of 85%. Total debt less cash declined 22% to $3.5
million despite the repurchase of 3% of the Company's outstanding common stock
and internal financing of our growth.

Our sales increased due to successful new product introductions and market share
gains. Innovation is reinforced relentlessly and is part of our culture.
Products introduced during the past 36 months accounted for 23% of domestic
sales in 2003, and there is a 3-year pipeline of planned introductions.

Acme's patented titanium scissor line continues to make inroads in the market.
Our proprietary titanium steel blades increase the hardness of the cutting edge,
and provide durable sharp edges far beyond traditional scissors. The technology
is being applied to our new titanium paper trimmers, and a range of future new
introductions.

We successfully introduced a new line of patented measuring and math products
during 2003. Acme's commercial customers have enthusiastically purchased our new
line of professional grade aluminum rulers. Our back to school customers
endorsed our recently designed rulers, compasses, and protractors.

Acme expanded its line of safety products, and has become the primary
consolidator of these items in the commercial office market. Our line of
hearing, eye, and head protection continues to grow, and benefits from increased
priority in the workplace. We also introduced new first aid and disaster kits
late in the year, which have now been placed in broad distribution.

Gross margins increased to 38% in 2003 compared to 34% in the prior year. We
achieved operating efficiencies from increased volumes, productivity
enhancements, and new products.

Acme increased spending to improve the support of our customers. We upgraded our
forecasting software, expanded our electronic order entry capabilities, and
instituted weekly sales reviews at the store and warehouse levels for a number
of our customers. We increased our commitment to their advertising and
promotional programs. We built inventory levels to respond to surges in demand
and unanticipated sales. These investments will continue to increase as we
strive to become the best supplier globally of our products.

We opened our new subsidiary Acme United (Asia Pacific), Ltd. in Hong Kong in
November 2003. This is an important strategic step. The new office facilitates
global sales directly from Hong Kong, provides the platform for sales into
China, and enhances our direct import program to customers in the U.S. and
Canada. We expect to improve our product consolidation capabilities and
strengthen our logistics reach. The new subsidiary will also expand our
engineering and quality assurance activities in Asia.

I would like to thank our customers for their support during 2003, and commit
that we will work to become their best supplier of cutting, measuring, and
safety products.

Our employees made the objectives set forth last year happen. They worked with
great intensity and I thank them with enthusiasm.

We have an aggressive plan in 2004 and are committed to delivering another year
of performance and accomplishment.

Thank you for your support.


Sincerely,


Walter C. Johnsen
President and CEO

PART I

Item 1.  Business

General

Acme United Corporation (together with its subsidiaries the "Company") was
organized as a partnership in l867 and incorporated in l882 under the laws of
the State of Connecticut. During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company
restructured its European operations, closing its facility in England and moving
those operations to Germany. The Company's continuing operations are in the
United States, Canada, Germany and Hong Kong. Financial information concerning
net sales and long-lived assets by geographic area appears in Note 10 of the
notes to consolidated financial statements.

The Company manufactures and sells cutting devices, measuring instruments and
safety products for school, office and home use in the United States, Canada and
Europe. In addition to local competitors in each country, the Company competes
with imported products from Asia.

Independent manufacturer representatives are primarily used to sell its line of
consumer products to wholesale, contract and retail stationery distributors,
office supply super stores, school supply distributors, and mass market
retailers. The Company had three customers with sales of 10% or more of total
sales.

                                      (3)

regarding hazardous waste control and electroplating effluent have been complied
with and the Company believes no major financial impact is expected to result
from current and future compliance with these rules and regulations.

under leases for terms ranging from less than one year to five years.

Item 3.  Legal Proceedings

Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
         of Operations

Operating results may be effected by certain accounting estimates and critical
accounting policies. The most sensitive and significant accounting estimates
and/or critical accounting policies in the financial statements relate to
revenue recognition, customer rebates, asset valuation allowances for deferred
income tax assets, obsolete inventories, potentially uncollectible accounts
receivable, and accruals for income taxes. Accruals for customer rebates are
based on executed contracts and anticipated sales levels, which are monitored
monthly. Management critically evaluates the potential realization of deferred
income tax benefits as well as the likely usefulness of inventories and the
collectablity of accounts receivable. Accruals for income taxes or benefits
often require interpretations of complex tax rules and regulations, which may be
subsequently challenged. There have been no significant changes in estimates for
any period presented by the accompanying financial statements nor have there
been any changes in accounting principles or practices, which materially affect
them. Changes in accounting practices have been limited to the adoption of
required new standards; the impact of which has also been insignificant to
reported net income and financial position.

                                      (5)

Results of Operations 2003 Compared with 2002

Net sales increased $4,091,090, or 13% in 2003 to $34,974,660 compared to
$30,883,570 in 2002. Excluding the favorable effect of currency gains in Canada
and Europe net sales increased 10%. The sales increase was mainly driven by
growth in the U.S. due to the success of new products, market share gains and
new customers. International sales were down 9% in local currency principally
due to discontinuing certain product lines in the UK business and a generally
weak economy in Germany.

As of January 1, 2002, the Company adopted the Emerging Issues Task Force
consensus No. 00-25, Vendor Income Statement Characterization of Consideration
Paid to a Reseller of a Vendor's Products. In connection with this adoption,
expense related to payments made to customers is classified as a reduction of
sales for all years presented.

Gross profit was 38% of net sales in 2003 compared to 34% of net sales in 2002.
The introduction of new products coupled with improved product mix in the U.S.,
positive impacts from product rationalization efforts in Europe and overall
productivity gains were the main reasons for the improved gross margins.

Selling, general and administrative expenses were $10,646,395 in 2003 compared
with $9,528,080 in 2002, an increase of $1,118,315 or 12%. SG&A expenses were
30% of net sales compared to 31% in 2002. Major contributors to the increase
were market research, new product development and the addition of sales
executives in Canada and Europe.

Interest expense for 2003 was $235,265 compared with $605,344 for 2002, a
$370,079 decrease. This is attributable to the decline in average debt and lower
interest rates.


Net other income was $91,172 in 2003 compared to net other income of $146,614 in
2002. The change from 2002 primarily relates to the settlement of a $175,000
lawsuit in Germany in March of 2003 partially offset by gains on the sale of
fixed assets.

Income before income taxes was $2,342,271 in 2003 compared with $97,276 in 2002,
an increase of $2,244,995. Pretax income for the U.S. business was $3,142,489
compared to $942,776 in 2002. Pretax income for the Canadian business increased
from $50,000 in 2002 to $298,000 in 2003. The European operations lost
$1,100,000 in 2003 compare to a loss of $500,000, excluding restructuring
charges, in 2002. The higher loss was principally due to lower sales, a one-time
expense of $175,000 for settlement of a lawsuit in Germany and the adverse
effect of a weaker dollar on translated results.

Income tax expense for 2003 was $1,120,440 compared to an income tax benefit of
$562,218 in 2002. In 2002, the Company recognized a significant one-time income
tax benefit associated with liquidating its UK business. The benefit recognized
was substantially in excess of income taxes computed at the statutory rate. In
2003, consolidated income before income taxes includes losses of foreign
subsidiaries with no income tax benefit, resulting in a high effective income
tax rate.

Results of Operations 2002 Compared with 2001

Net sales decreased $2,198,033, or 7% in 2002 to $30,883,570 compared to
$33,081,603 in 2001. Net sales in the United States decreased $655,000 or 3% due
to weak economic conditions. International net sales decreased $1,543,000 or
16%. This was primarily due to discontinuing certain product lines in the UK
business in an effort to focus more on the Company's core products.

Gross profit was 33.8% of net sales in 2002 compared to 32.5% of net sales in
2001. Excluding the inventory write-down associated with the Acme United Limited
(UK) liquidation, gross profit was 34.5% of net sales in 2002. The introduction
of new products and productivity gains on existing products were the main
reasons for the improved gross margins.


Selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG&A") were $9,528,080 in 2002
compared with $8,284,751 in 2001, an increase of $1,243,329 or 15%. SG&A
expenses were 31% of net sales compared to 25% in 2001. Planned investments in
new product development and the addition of key management positions in Canada
and Europe were the main reasons for the increase.

                                      (6)
<PAGE>

Operating income in 2002 was $556,006 compared with $2,469,589 in 2001.
Excluding restructuring charges, operating income was $1,111,351 in 2002, a
decrease of $1,358,238. The decrease was mainly due to the increased spending in
SG&A and lower sales in the UK, which was partially offset by improved
productivity in cost of sales.

Interest expense for 2002 was $605,344, compared with $790,910 for 2001, a
$185,566 decrease mainly attributable to the decline in debt and lower interest
rates. Total debt less available cash declined to $4.5 million at December 31,
2002 compared to $5.5 million at December 31, 2001.


Net other income was $146,614 in 2002 compared to net other income of $33,547 in
2001. The change from 2001 is principally due to non-recurring foreign exchange
transaction losses associated with a cross border loan in 2001.

In 2002, the Company recognized a significant one-time income tax benefit
associated with liquidating Acme United Limited (UK). The benefit recognized was
substantially in excess of income taxes computed at the statutory rate.


Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company's working capital, current ratio and long term debt to equity ratio
follow:

                                                  2003          2002
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Working Capital                            $10,777,397    $8,515,910
Current Ratio                                     2.68          2.33
Long - Term Debt to Equity Ratio                 27.0%         24.0%

The increase in working capital and increase in the current ratio in 2003 is
attributable to a 10% increase in accounts receivables and inventories.
Inventory in constant currency increased by 15% due to sales growth and
increased safety stock. Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) decreased from 69 in 2002
to 63 in 2003 due to improved collection efforts. Operating activities generated
net cash of approximately $1.75 million in 2003 compared with $1.6 million in
2002.

On August 2, 2002, the Company entered into a new revolving loan agreement (the
Agreement). The Agreement allows for borrowings up to a maximum of $10,000,000
based on a formula, which applies specific percentages to balances of accounts
receivable and inventories. All outstanding borrowings are due on July 31, 2005.
At December 31, 2003 $4,109,612 is outstanding and $2,524,346 is available under
the Agreement based on this formula. Throughout 2004, the Company expects to
have a minimum of approximately $2,500,000 outstanding under the Agreement. As
such, amounts borrowed in excess of that amount are classified as part of the
current portion of long-term debt. Amounts outstanding under the Agreement bear
interest at the LIBOR rate plus 1.75 percent (2.87% at December 31, 2003).

On August 22, 2000 the Company borrowed $700,000 under a loan agreement to
refinance a mortgage. The loan is payable in monthly installments of $6,928,
including interest at the Federal Home Loan Bank of Seattle fixed advanced rate,
plus 3.0%, adjusting every five years, through August 1, 2020 and a final
installment of $500,800, plus interest, due on August 1, 2020. During the year
ended December 31, 2003, the company made prepayments on the loan amounting to
$279,999, which will reduce the final installment due on August 1, 2020. At
December 31, 2003 and 2002, the loan balance was $364,117 and $671,873, and the
interest rate was 9.78%, respectively. In order to reduce interest costs, it is
management's intension to payoff the loan in 2004.

The Company, among other things, is restricted with respect to additional
borrowings, investments, mergers and property and equipment purchases. Further,
the Company is required to maintain specific amounts of tangible net worth, and
a specified debt service coverage ratio, and a fixed charge coverage ratio, all
as defined by the agreement. The Company was in compliance with all covenants as
of or through December 31, 2003 and believes these financial covenants will
continue to be met for the remainder of the term of the debt.

                                      (7)
<PAGE>

Capital expenditures during 2003 were $424,537, which were, in part, financed
with debt. Capital expenditures in 2004 are not expected to differ materially
from recent years.

Cash generated from operating activities together with funds available under the
Agreement, is expected under current conditions to be sufficient to finance the
Company's planned operations in 2004.

Interest Rate Risk:

The Company's interest expense on debt is most sensitive to changes in the level
of United States interest rates. To mitigate the impact of these fluctuations,
the Company periodically evaluates alternative interest rate arrangements. In
2000, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a bank to
minimize exposure to interest rate changes for $3.5 million of debt. The swap
agreement expired on January 19, 2003.

Foreign Currency Risk:

The Company manufactures products in the United States. Further, the Company
engages in intracompany sales which are denominated in currencies other than
those of the operating entity making the sale. As such, these transactions give
rise to foreign currency risk. The Company's currency exposures vary, but are
concentrated in the Canadian dollar, British pound, and Euro.

At times, the Company utilizes forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge
specific transactions with third parties denominated in foreign currencies. The
terms of these forward foreign exchange contracts are typically under 90 days.
Because the contracts are acquired for specific transactions, they are an
effective hedge against fluctuations in the value of the foreign currency
underlying the transaction. Forward foreign exchange contracts for such
transactions were not material at December 31, 2003 and 2002. The Company does
not hedge intracompany sales nor does it enter into financial instruments for
speculation or trading purposes.

The Company and its foreign subsidiaries utilize bank loans to finance their
operations. To mitigate foreign currency risk, foreign loans are denominated in
the local currency of the foreign subsidiary wherever possible. In 2001, the
Company entered into a forward foreign exchange contract and currency option
agreement to hedge its U.S. denominated intercompany loan of $2.0 million to its
Canadian subsidiary.

Inflation

Inflation had a negligible effect on the Company's operations during 2003 and
2002. The Company estimates that inflationary effects, in the aggregate, were
generally recovered or offset through increased pricing or cost reductions in
both years.

Acme United Corporation and Subsidiaries
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.  Operations

The operations of Acme United Corporation (the Company) consist of a single
reportable segment, which operates in the United States, Canada, Germany and
Hong Kong. Principal products are scissors, shears, rulers, first aid kits, and
related products which are sold primarily to wholesale, contract and retail
stationery distributors, office supply super stores, school supply distributors,
drug store retailers and mass market retailers.

2.  Accounting Policies

Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

Principles of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, all of which are wholly owned. All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in
consolidation.

Translation of Foreign Currency - For foreign operations, assets and liabilities
are translated at rates in effect at the end of the year; revenues and expenses
are translated at average rates in effect during the year. Resulting translation
adjustments are made directly to accumulated other comprehensive loss. Foreign
currency transaction gains and losses are recognized in operations. Foreign
currency transaction gains (losses) which are included in other income (expense)
were $105,984 in 2003, $57,000 in 2002, and $(153,000) in 2001.

Cash Equivalents - Investments with an original maturity of three months or less
at the date of purchase are considered cash equivalents.

Accounts Receivable - Accounts receivable are shown less an allowance for
doubtful accounts of $199,101 in 2003 and $205,213 in 2002.

Inventories - Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, determined by the
first in, first out method, or market.

Plant, Property and Equipment and Depreciation - Plant, property and equipment
is recorded at cost. Depreciation is computed by the straight-line method over
the estimated useful lives of the assets which range from 3 to 30 years.

Asset Impairments - The Company evaluates the propriety of the carrying amounts
of its long-lived assets, including goodwill, at least annually, or when current
events and circumstances indicate a potential impairment. The Company believes
that there are no significant impairments of the carrying amounts of such assets
and no reduction in their estimated useful lives is warranted.

Intangible Assets - Intangible assets with a finite useful life are recorded at
cost upon acquisition and amortized over the term of the related contract.
Intangible assets held by the Company with a finite useful life include deferred
financing costs, patents, and trademarks. Deferred financing costs are amortized
over the term of the related debt. Patents and trademarks are amortized over
their estimated useful life. The weighted average amortization period of
intangible assets at December 31, 2003 is 12 years.

Goodwill - As of January 1, 2002, the Company adopted Financial Accounting
Standards Board Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (FAS
142) and as such no longer amortizes goodwill but rather tests it annually for
impairment. There was no impairment of goodwill at January 1, 2003. Had
Statement No. 142 been in effect as of the beginning of 2001, amortization
expense for the year ended December 31, 2001 would have been reduced by $28,000,
increasing net income by the same amount with no effect on earnings per share.

                                      (14)
<PAGE>

Deferred Income Taxes - Deferred income taxes are provided on the differences
between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities and on
operating loss carryovers using enacted tax rates in effect in years in which
the differences are expected to reverse.

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - At December 31, 2003, the Company has
one stock-based employee compensation plan, which is described more fully in
Note 11. The Company has elected to adopt the disclosure only provisions of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, and continues to measure costs for its employee stock compensation
plans by using the accounting methods prescribed by APB Opinion No. 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, which allows that no compensation cost
be recognized unless the exercise price of the options granted is greater than
the fair market value of the Company's stock at date of grant. Accordingly, no
stock-based employee compensation cost is reflected in net income, as all
options granted had an exercise price equal to the market value of the
underlying common stock on the date of grant. The following table illustrates
the effect on net income and earnings per share if the company had applied the
fair value method under SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation,
to stock based employee compensation.

Revenue Recognition - The Company recognizes revenue from sales of its products
when ownership transfers to the customers. Ownership transfers from the Company
to its customer upon shipment of the Company's products. When right of return
exists, the Company recognizes revenue in accordance with SFAS 48, Revenue
Recognition When Right of Return Exists.

Research and Development - Research and development costs ($347,130 in 2003,
$385,066 in 2002 and $147,115 in 2001) are charged to operations as incurred.

Shipping Costs - Shipping costs ($1,439,615 in 2003, $1,272,115 in 2002, and
$1,189,930 in 2001) are included in selling, general and administrative
expenses.

Advertising Costs - The Company expenses the production costs of advertising the
first time the advertising takes place. Advertising costs ($669,065 in 2003,
$766,058 in 2002, and $506,557 in 2001) are included in selling, general and
administrative expenses.

Concentrations - The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its
customers and generally does not require collateral. Allowances for credit
losses are provided and have been within management's expectations. Net sales to
the Company's three major customers, Staples, Inc., Boise, and United
Stationers, Inc., represented approximately 41% of net sales in 2003, 44% in
2002, and 43% in 2001.

Consideration paid to a reseller - As of January 1, 2002, the Company also
adopted the Emerging Issues Task Force consensus No. 00-25, Vendor Income
Statement Characterization of Consideration Paid to a Reseller of a Vendor's
Products (EITF 00-25). As such, the Company recognizes consideration paid to a
reseller of its product as a reduction of the selling price of its products and,
therefore, reduces revenue in the Company's statement of operations. The
adoption of EITF 00-25 had no effect on net income or earnings per share.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31,
2001 have been reclassified to conform to the new classification resulting in a
$3,083,000 decrease of selling, general and administrative expenses and net
sales for that period.

Derivatives - As of January 1, 2001, the Company adopted Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities (Statement 133) which was issued in June, 1998 and its
amendments Statements 137, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities-Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133, and 138,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities, issued in
June, 1999 and June 2000, respectively (collectively referred to as Statement
133).

As a result of adoption of Statement 133, the Company recognizes all derivative
financial instruments, such as interest rate swap contracts, foreign exchange
contracts, and foreign currency option contracts, in the consolidated financial
statements at fair value regardless of the purpose or intent for holding the
instrument. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are
either recognized periodically in operations or in stockholders' equity as a
component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) depending on whether
the derivative financial instrument qualifies for hedge accounting, and if so,
whether it qualifies as a fair value hedge or cash flow hedge. Generally,
changes in fair values of derivatives accounted for as fair value hedges are
recorded in operations along with the portions of the changes in the fair values
of the hedged items that relate to the hedged risk(s). Changes in fair values of
derivatives accounted for as cash flow hedges, to the extent they are effective
as hedges, are recorded in other comprehensive(loss) income net of deferred
income taxes. Changes in fair value of derivatives used as hedges of the net
investment in foreign operations are reported in other comprehensive
income(loss) as part of the cumulative translation adjustment. Changes in fair
values of derivatives not qualifying as hedges are reported in operations.

The adoption of Statement 133 resulted in a cumulative effect of an accounting
change of $104,207 decrease to other comprehensive income.

Prior to January 1, 2001, the Company also used interest rate swap contracts and
foreign exchange contracts for hedging purposes. For interest rate swaps, the
net amounts paid or received and net amounts accrued through the end of the
accounting period were included in interest expense. Unrealized gains or losses
on interest rate swap contracts were not recognized in operations. For foreign
currency forward contracts hedging firm commitments, the effects of movements in
currency exchange rates on those instruments were recognized when the related
operating revenue was recognized. Realized gains and losses were included in
other assets and liabilities and recognized in operations when the future
transaction occurred or at the time the transaction was no longer expected to
occur.

Reclassifications - Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform
to the current year presentation.

6.  Pension and Profit Sharing

United States employees, hired prior to July 1, 1993, are covered by a funded,
defined benefit pension plan. The benefits are based on years of service and the
average compensation of the highest three consecutive years during the last ten
years of employment. In December 1995, the Company's Board of Directors approved
an amendment to the United States pension plan ceasing all future benefit
accruals as of February 1, 1996, without terminating the pension plan. The
Company uses a December 31 measurement date for the pension plan.

The plan asset weighted average allocation at December 31, by asset category,
are as follows:

Asset Category                              2003             2002
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Equity                                       67%              65%
Fixed Income                                 28%              31%
Other                                         5%               4%

Total                                       100%             100%
===================================================================

The Company's investment policy is to minimize risk by balancing investments
between equity and fixed income, utilizing a weighted average approach of 65%
equity securities, 30% fixed income funds, and 5% cash investments. Plan funds
are invested in long term obligations with a history of moderate to low risk.

At December 31, 2003 and 2002, equity securities include 30,000 shares of the
Company's Common Stock having a market value of $162,000 and $112,800 at those
dates, respectively.

</TABLE>

In 2001, the pension plan made settlement distributions of $793,165 to certain
plan beneficiaries. Such payments resulted in a $102,386 settlement loss.

Acme United Corporation employs a building block approach in determining the
long-term rate of return for plan assets. Historical markets are studied and
long-term historical relationships between equities and fixed income are
preserved congruent with the widely-accepted capital market principle that
assets with higher volatility generate return over the long run. Current market
factors such as inflation and interest rates are evaluated before long-term
capital market assumptions are determined. The long-term portfolio return is
established via a building block approach and proper consideration of
diversification and rebalancing. Peer data and historical returns are reviewed
to check for reasonability and appropriateness.

Acme United expects to contribute approximately $29,000 to its pension plan in
2004.

The Company also has a qualified, non-contributory profit sharing plan covering
substantially all United States employees. Annual Company contributions are
determined by the Compensation Committee. Through December 31, 2001,
contributions amounted to 2% of eligible employee earnings and a 50% match up to
the first 2% of employee contributions. For the years ended December 31, 2003
and 2002, contributions amounted to a 50% match up to the first 6% of employee
contributions. Total contribution expense under this plan approximated $61,000,
$57,000, $51,000 for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

The Company provides deferred income taxes on foreign subsidiary earnings, which
are not considered permanently reinvested. Earnings permanently reinvested would
become taxable upon the sale or liquidation of a foreign subsidiary or upon the
remittance of dividends. Foreign subsidiary earnings of $1,666,000 and
$1,287,000 are considered permanently reinvested as of December 31, 2003 and
2002, respectively, and the amount of deferred income taxes thereon cannot be
reasonably determined.

                                      (20)

Due to the uncertain nature of the realization of the Company's deferred income
tax assets based on past performance and carry forward expiration dates, the
Company has recorded a valuation allowance for the amount of deferred income tax
assets which are not expected to be realized. This valuation allowance is
subject to periodic review, and if the allowance is reduced, the tax benefit
will be recorded in future operations as a reduction of the Company's tax
expense. For the year ended December 31, 2003, the valuation allowance on the
Canadian net operating loss was reversed creating an income tax benefit in the
current period of $157,753.

At December 31, 2003, the Company has tax operating loss carry forwards
aggregating $4,024,000. The portion applicable to Germany of $3,884,000 can be
carried forward indefinitely. Carry forwards applicable to Canada of $57,000
expire from 2005 - 2007.

8. Debt

Long term debt consists of:

=============================================================================

On August 2, 2002, the Company entered into a new revolving loan agreement (the
Agreement). The Agreement allows for borrowings up to a maximum of $10,000,000
based on a formula, which applies specific percentages to balances of accounts
receivable and inventories. All outstanding borrowings are due July 31, 2005. At
December 31, 2003, $4,109,612 is outstanding and $2,524,346 is available under
the Agreement based on this formula. Throughout 2004, the Company expects to
have a minimum of $2,530,000 outstanding under the Agreement. As such, amounts
borrowed in excess of $2,530,000 are classified as part of the current portion
of long-term debt. Amounts outstanding under the Agreement bear interest at the
LIBOR rate plus 1.75 percent (2.87% at December 31, 2003).

The Company also transferred its interest rate swap agreement, which fixes the
effective interest rate at 7.18 percent for $3,500,000 of debt under the
Agreement. The swap agreement expired January 19, 2003.

On August 22, 2000 the Company borrowed $700,000 under a loan agreement with
another bank to refinance a mortgage. The loan is payable in monthly
installments of $6,928, including interest at the Federal Home Loan Bank of
Seattle fixed advanced rate, plus 3.0%, adjusting every five years, through
August 1, 2020 and a final installment of $500,800, plus interest, due on August
1, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company made prepayments
on the loan amounting to $279,999, which will reduce the final installment due
on August 1, 2020. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the interest rate was 9.78%.
The loan is collateralized by a First Trust Deed and Assignment of Rents on the
property located 701 South Wilson Street in Fremont, North Carolina.

The Company, among other things, is restricted with respect to additional
borrowings, investments, mergers, and property and equipment acquisitions.
Further, the Company is required to maintain specific amounts of tangible net
worth, a specified debt service coverage ratio, and a fixed charge coverage
ratio, all as defined. The Company believes these financial covenants will
continue to be met.
.
Maturities of long-term debt for the next five years follow: 2004 - $2,035,349;
2005- $2,245,598; 2006 - $87,809 - 2007 - $96,908 and 2008 $105,716.

Interest paid was $235,265 in 2003, $605,344 in 2002, and $790,910 in 2001.

various equipment under non-cancelable operating leases. Total rent expense was
$252,294 in 2003, $165,854 in 2002, and $170,111 in 2001. Minimum annual rental
commitments under non-cancelable leases with initial or remaining terms of one

11.  Stock Option Plans

The Company's amended and restated stock option plan, which provides incentive
and nonqualified stock options for up to 790,000 shares of the Company's Common
Stock to officers and key employees (the Employee's Plan) terminated on February
24, 2002. Options previously granted under the Employee's Plan continue to vest
and to be exercisable in accordance with their terms, however, no new options
may be granted under the Employee's Plan. The Employee's Plan provided for the
purchase of shares of the Company's Common Stock at a price of not less than
100% of its fair market value at the date of grant. Generally, options granted
under the Employee's Plan prior to June 24, 1996 vested immediately or within a
year; after June 24, 1996, 25% of options granted vest immediately with the
balance vesting over the next three years. The term of options issued cannot
exceed 10 years from the date of grant.

Effective February 26, 2002, the Company adopted a new officers and key
employee's stock option plan which provides incentive and nonqualified stock
options for up to 150,000 shares of the Company's Common Stock to officers and
key employees (the New Employee's Plan). The New Employee's Plan provided for
the purchase of shares of the Company's Common Stock at a price of not less than
100% of its fair market value at the date of grant. The term of options issued
cannot exceed 10 years from the date of grant.

The Company also has a stock option plan which provides nonqualified stock
options for up to 160,000 shares of the Company's Common Stock to non-salaried
directors (the Director's Plan). The original Director's Plan, as approved at
the 1996 Annual Meeting, granted 10,000 options to new directors elected to the
Board at the 1996 Annual Meeting, which vested one year after the grant date.
The Director's Plan was amended in 1997 to grant 10,000 options to directors
elected at the 1997 Annual Meeting, who were first elected prior to the 1996
Annual Meeting, which vested immediately. The Director's Plan was amended again
in 1998 to grant 2,500 options to each director re-elected to the Board at the
annual meeting. These options vest immediately.

                                      (22)
<PAGE>

During 2003 and 2002, an additional 2,500 options were granted to each director.
Also during 2003, 10,000 options were issued to one new director. The Director's
Plan provides for the purchase of shares of the Company's Common Stock at a
price of not less than 100% of its fair value at the date of grant.

plans follows:

</TABLE>

The weighted average remaining contractual life of outstanding
stock options is 6 years.

The Company applies APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees
and related interpretations to recognize compensation expense under its stock
option plans. As such, no expense is recognized if, at the date of grant, the
exercise price of the option is at least equal to the fair market value of the
Company's Common Stock. No compensation expense related to the Company's stock
option plans was required to be recognized for its plans in 2003, 2002 and 2001.

The weighted average fair value at the date of grant for options granted during
2003, 2002, and 2001 is $1.79, $1.82, $1.57 per option, respectively.

14.  Financial Instruments

The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating its
fair value disclosures for financial instruments:

Cash and cash equivalents: The carrying amount reported in the balance sheet for
cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value.


Accounts receivable and accounts payable: The carrying amounts reported in the
balance sheet for accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair
value.

Long-and short-term debt: The carrying amounts of the Company's borrowings under
its short-term notes payable and revolving credit arrangements approximate their
fair value. The fair values of the Company's long-term debt are estimated using
discounted cash flow analyses, based on the Company's current incremental
borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements.

Foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps: The fair values of the
Company's foreign currency contracts and interest rate swaps are estimated based
on dealer quotes.

Derivative Financial Instruments

At December 31, 2002, derivative financial instruments consist of interest rate
swaps. The Company uses such derivatives for fair value or cash flow hedging
purposes as part of its risk management strategy. Following is a summary of the
Company's risk management strategies and the effect of them on the Company's
consolidated financial statements. The Company's interest rate swap agreement
expired in January, 2003.

Fair Value Hedging Strategy

At times, the Company utilizes forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge
certain firm commitments with third parties denominated in foreign currencies.
The terms of these forward foreign exchange contracts are typically under 90
days. Because the contracts are acquired for specific transactions, they are an
effective hedge against fluctuations in the value of the foreign currency
underlying the transaction. There were no forward foreign exchange contracts
held at December 31, 2003 or 2002.

The Company and its foreign subsidiaries utilize bank loans to finance their
operations. To mitigate foreign currency risk, foreign loans are denominated in
the local currency of the foreign subsidiary wherever possible.

Ineffective portions of fair value hedges were not material in 2003.

Cash Flow Hedging Strategy

In 2000, the Company entered into interest-rate swap agreement that effectively
converted a portion of its floating-rate debt to a fixed-rate basis through
January 19, 2003, the agreement maturity date, thus reducing the impact of
interest-rate changes on future income.

During 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company recognized expense of $26,874, $174,122
and $95,471 respectively, related to the net amounts paid and accrued on
interest rate swaps, which are included in interest expense in each year's
respective consolidated statements of income. For the year ended December 31,
2003, interest rate swap was judged to be effective.


15.  Restructuring Charges

In 2002, restructuring charges of approximately $555,000 were recorded as a
result of certain strategic and operating changes initiated by the Company's
management related to liquidating Acme United Limited (AUL), a United Kingdom
subsidiary. The restructuring charges consisted of a write-down of inventories
of $206,000, accounting and legal costs of $95,000, lease cancellation costs of
$90,000, a write-off of goodwill of $69,000, severance costs of $55,000, other
closing costs of $22,000, a write-off of uncollectible accounts receivable of
$9,000 and write-offs of equipment of $9,000. As of December 31, 2002, the
restructuring was substantially complete and approximately $36,000 remained in
accrued restructuring charges, primarily related to accounting and legal costs.
The Company terminated five employees as part of the restructuring. There will
be no further terminations and all severance costs related to the restructuring
have been paid. The Company expects to continue to retain the majority of AUL's
customers and sell products to them through its German subsidiary. As of
December 31, 2003, approximately $1,000 remained in accrued restructuring
charges.

audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at
Item 15(a). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of
the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Acme United
Corporation and subsidiaries at December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the consolidated
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2003 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States. Also, in our opinion, the related
financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial
statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
information set forth therein.
