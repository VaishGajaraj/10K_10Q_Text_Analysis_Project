"FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS." In addition to historical information, this Annual
Report on Form 10-K contains  forward-looking  statements that involve risks and
uncertainties,  including  the risk factors  explained  in the section  entitled
Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis of  Financial  Condition  and Results of
Operations  ("MD&A"),  that could cause our actual results to differ  materially
from  those  reflected  in the  forward-looking  statements.  When  used in this
report,  words or phrases about the future such as "expected  to," "could have,"
"will  continue,"   "anticipates,"   "estimates,"  or  similar  expressions  are
"forward-looking  statements"  as defined in the Private  Securities  Litigation
Reform  Act of  1995.  Statements  in MD&A and  elsewhere  in this  report  that
speculate about future events are "forward-looking  statements." Forward-looking
statements  are our best  prediction  at the time that  they are  made,  and you
should  not  rely on them.  If a  circumstance  occurs  that  causes  any of our
forward-looking  statements  to be  inaccurate,  we do not have an obligation to
announce publicly the change to our expectations, or to make any revision to the
forward-looking statements.

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

GENERAL

Franklin Resources,  Inc. ("FRI" or the "Company"),  is a diversified  financial
services  company,  which is registered as a bank holding company under the Bank
Holding  Company Act of 1956,  as amended  (the "BHC  Act"),  and as a financial
holding company under the  Gramm-Leach-Bliley  Act (the "GLB Act").  Through our
wholly-owned direct and indirect subsidiary companies,  we provide a broad range
of investment advisory,  investment  management and related services to open-end
investment  companies,   including  our  own  family  of  retail  mutual  funds,
institutional  accounts,  high  net-worth  families,  individuals  and  separate
accounts  in the  United  States  (the  "U.S.")  and  internationally.  Our  249
"sponsored   investment   products"  include  a  broad  range  of  domestic  and
global/international equity, hybrid, fixed-income, and money market mutual funds
as well as other  investment  products,  which are sold to the public  under the
Franklin,  Templeton, Mutual Series, Bissett and Fiduciary Trust brand names. As
of September 30, 2002, we had $247.8 billion in assets under our management with
approximately  9.6 million  shareholder  accounts  worldwide.  In support of our
primary business segment, investment management, we also provide certain related
services,   including  transfer  agency,  fund   administration,   distribution,
shareholder processing,  custodial, trustee and other fiduciary services. In our
secondary  business  segment,  banking/finance,  we provide  clients with select
retail,  private  banking,  consumer loan and other credit services  through our
bank  subsidiaries.  The common stock of FRI is traded in the U.S.  primarily on
the New York Stock  Exchange and the Pacific  Exchange  under the ticker  symbol
"BEN" and under the ticker symbol "FKR" on the London Stock  Exchange.  The term
"Franklin(R)  Templeton(R)  Investments"  as used in this  document,  refers  to
Franklin Resources, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.

COMPANY HISTORY AND ACQUISITIONS

Franklin  Templeton  Investments and its  predecessors  have been engaged in the
financial   services  business  since  1947.   Franklin   Resources,   Inc.  was
incorporated  in  Delaware  in  November  1969.  We  originated  our mutual fund
business with the Franklin  family of funds,  which is now known as the Franklin
Funds(R).  We expanded our business,  in part, by acquiring companies engaged in
the investment advisory and investment management business.

In October 1992, we acquired  substantially all of the assets and liabilities of
the investment  adviser to the Templeton,  Galbraith & Hansberger Ltd. financial
services  business.  This acquisition added the Templeton family of funds to our
Company.  The  Templeton  funds are known for  their  international  and  global
investment objectives and value style of investing.

In November 1996, we acquired certain assets and liabilities of Heine Securities
Corporation,  which provided investment  management services to various accounts
and  investment  companies,  including  Mutual  Series  Fund Inc.,  now known as
Franklin Mutual Series Fund Inc. ("Mutual Series").  The Mutual Series funds are
primarily value oriented equity funds.

We  expanded  our  business in Korea in July 2000 when we  purchased  all of the
remaining  outstanding shares of a Korean asset management  company, in which we
previously  held a partial  interest.  With  over $2  billion  in  assets  under
management in Korea, we are now one of the larger foreign money managers in that
country.

We acquired all of the  outstanding  shares of Bissett &  Associates  Investment
Management,  Ltd.  ("Bissett")  in October 2000 for  approximately  $95 million.
Bissett now  operates as part of our  Canadian  subsidiary,  Franklin  Templeton
Investments  Corp.  ("FTIC").  With the addition of Bissett,  we added Bissett's
family of mutual  funds to our  existing  Canadian  based funds and expanded our
investment  advisory  services  throughout  Canada to a broad  range of clients,
including   institutional   clients  such  as  pension  plans,   municipalities,
universities, charitable foundations and private clients.

In April  2001,  we  acquired  Fiduciary  Trust  Company  International,  a bank
organized  under the New York State  Banking Law  ("Fiduciary").  Following  the
acquisition,  Fiduciary became a wholly-owned  subsidiary of Franklin Resources,
Inc. The stock transaction was valued at approximately  $776 million at closing.
Fiduciary  has a  reputation  as one  of the  leading  providers  of  investment
management and related trust and custody services to  institutional  clients and
high net-worth families and individuals.  With the acquisition of Fiduciary,  we
also added Fiduciary's U.S. and non-U.S. mutual funds to our product line.

On July 26, 2002, our 75% owned subsidiary,  Templeton Asset Management  (India)
Private  Limited,  acquired  all of the  outstanding  shares of Pioneer  ITI AMC
Limited  ("Pioneer")  for  approximately  $55.4  million.  Pioneer  is an Indian
investment  management  company with  approximately $800 million in assets under
management as of the purchase date. The acquisition  makes us one of the largest
private  sector fund  companies in India,  with  combined  assets at the time of
acquisition,  of  approximately  $1.6 billion and more than 850,000  shareholder
accounts.

LINES OF BUSINESS

I.   INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AND RELATED SERVICES

We derive  substantially all of our revenues from providing  investment advisory
and  investment  management,  distribution  and  administrative  services to our
various family of funds,  high  net-worth  clients,  institutional  accounts and
separate accounts. Our revenues depend to a large extent on the amount of assets
under management. Underwriting and distribution revenues, also a large source of
revenue,  consist of sales  charges and  commissions  derived  from sales of our
sponsored  investment  products and  distribution and service fees. When used in
this  report  "Franklin  Templeton  mutual  funds" or  "funds"  means all of the
Franklin,  Templeton,  Mutual  Series,  Bissett,  and  Fiduciary  mutual  funds;
"sponsored investment products" means all of the Franklin Templeton mutual funds
together  with  closed-end   investment  companies,   foreign-based   investment
products,  and  other  U.S.  and  international  private,  institutional,   high
net-worth and separate accounts.

A.   ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT ("AUM")
     -------------------------------

Investment  management fees, our most substantial  source of revenue,  are based
upon the dollar  value of assets under  management,  because we earn most of our
revenues  from fees  linked to the  amount  of  assets in the  accounts  that we
advise.  As of  September  30,  2002,  the type of assets  under  management  by
investment objective held by investors on a worldwide basis was:

Broadly  speaking,  the  change in the net  assets of the  sponsored  investment
products depends upon two factors:  (1) the level of sales (inflows) as compared
to the level of redemptions (outflows);  and (2) the increase or decrease in the
market value of the securities held in the portfolio of  investments.  In recent
years,  we  have  become  subject  to an  increased  risk of  asset  volatility,
resulting from changes in the domestic and global  financial and equity markets.
In addition,  because we generally  derive  higher  revenues and income from our
equity assets,  a shift in assets from equity to  fixed-income  and hybrid funds
reduces total revenue and thus, net income. Despite such volatility,  we believe
that we are more  competitive as a result of the greater  diversity of sponsored
investment products available to our customer base.

B.   TYPES OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AND RELATED SERVICES
     ---------------------------------------------------

A majority of our  revenues are derived from  providing  investment  management,
advisory,  distribution,  transfer agency and related  services for the Franklin
Templeton  mutual  funds.  We  advise,   manage  and  implement  the  investment
activities of and provide other administrative services necessary to operate our
registered investment companies,  the related U.S.-open-end and closed-end funds
or series and our many non-U.S. based sponsored investment products.

Templeton  Global Advisors Limited  ("TGAL"),  a registered  investment  adviser
under the Advisers Act, provides investment advisory,  portfolio management, and
administrative services to certain of the Templeton funds;

Templeton  Investment  Counsel,  LLC ("TICL"),  a registered  investment advisor
under the Advisers Act, provides investment  advisory,  portfolio management and
administrative  services  to certain  of the  Templeton  funds and  sub-advisory
services to certain of the Franklin Funds; and

Franklin  Templeton  Asset  Strategies,  LLC ("FTAS"),  a registered  investment
adviser under the Advisers Act and a registered  Commodity  Pool Operator  under
the Commodity Exchange Act, provides investment  advisory,  portfolio management
and administrative services to certain of our sponsored investment products with
mandates in alternative investments.

Our subsidiary  companies  conduct research and provide the investment  advisory
services and determine which securities the funds will purchase, hold or sell as
directed by each fund's board of trustees, directors or administrative managers.
In addition, the subsidiary companies take all steps necessary to implement such
decisions,  including  selecting  brokers and  dealers,  executing  and settling
trades  in  accordance  with  detailed  criteria  set  forth  in the  management
agreement for each fund, and applicable law and practice.  In addition,  certain
of our  subsidiary  companies  also provide  similar  investment  management and
administrative  services  to  a  number  of  non-U.S.  open-end  and  closed-end
investment  companies,  as well as other  U.S.  and  international  private  and
institutional accounts,  including certain of our sponsored investment companies
organized in Luxembourg and Ireland.

Our investment  advisory services include  fundamental  investment  research and
valuation analyses, including original economic, political, industry and company
research, company visits and inspections, and the utilization of such sources as
company public records and activities,  management interviews,  company prepared
information,  and other publicly available  information,  as well as analyses of
suppliers, customers and competitors. In addition, research services provided by
brokerage firms are used to support our findings.

Investment  management and related services are provided  pursuant to agreements
in effect  with  each of our  U.S.-registered  open-end  and  closed-end  funds.
Comparable  agreements  are in  effect  with  foreign-registered  funds and with
private accounts.  In general, the management agreements for our U.S.-registered
open-end  and  closed-end   funds  must  be  renewed  each  year,  and  must  be
specifically  approved  at  least  annually  by a vote of such  funds'  board of
trustees or  directors  or by a vote of the holders of a majority of such funds'
outstanding voting securities. Foreign-registered funds have various termination
rights, review and renewal provisions that are not discussed in this report.

Under the majority of investment management  agreements,  the funds pay us a fee
payable monthly in arrears based upon a fund's average daily net assets.  Annual
fee rates under the various global investment  management  agreements  generally
range  from  0.15% to a maximum  of 2.25% and are often  reduced  as net  assets
exceed various threshold levels. The funds generally pay their own expenses such
as legal, custody and audit fees, reporting costs, board and shareholder meeting
costs, SEC and state registration fees and similar expenses.

We use a "master/feeder"  fund structure in limited  situations.  This structure
allows an investment  adviser to manage a single  portfolio of securities at the
"master  fund"  level  and have  multiple  "feeder  funds"  invest  all of their
respective   assets  into  the  master  fund.   Individual   and   institutional
shareholders  invest in the "feeder  funds" which can offer a variety of service
and distribution  options.  An advisory fee is charged at the master fund level,
and administrative and shareholder servicing fees are charged at the feeder fund
level.

Our investment  management  agreements  permit us to serve as an adviser to more
than one fund so long as our ability to render  services to each of the funds is
not impaired,  and so long as purchases and sales for various  advised funds are
made on an equitable basis.  Our management  personnel and the fund directors or
boards of trustees  regularly review the fund advisory and other  administrative
fee structures in light of fund

                                       7

performance,  the level and range of services provided,  industry conditions and
other relevant  factors.  Advisory and other  administrative  fees are generally
waived or voluntarily  reduced when a new fund is established and then increased
to  contractual  levels  within an  established  timeline or as net asset values
reach certain levels.

Each U.S. investment management or advisory agreement between Franklin Templeton
Investments  and  each  fund  automatically  terminates  in  the  event  of  its
"assignment", as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the " '40 Act").
In addition,  either party may  terminate the  agreement  without  penalty after
written notice ranging from 30 to 60 days. If management agreements representing
a significant  portion of our assets under management were terminated,  it would
have a material  adverse impact on our Company.  To date, none of our management
agreements  with any of our retail  Franklin  Templeton  mutual  funds have been
involuntarily terminated.

2.   UNDERWRITING AND DISTRIBUTION

A large  portion  of our  revenues  under the  investment  management  operating
segment is generated  from providing  underwriting  and  distribution  services.
Franklin/Templeton Distributors, Inc. ("FTDI"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Company,  acts as the principal underwriter and distributor of shares of most of
our  U.S.-registered  open-end  mutual  funds.   Templeton/Franklin   Investment
Services,  Inc. acts as principal  underwriter  and distributor of the shares of
FTI Funds, a Fiduciary product  distributed in the U.S. We earn underwriting and
distribution  fees primarily by distributing  the funds pursuant to distribution
agreements  between FTDI and the funds.  Under each distribution  agreement,  we
offer and sell the fund's  shares on a  continuous  basis and pay certain  costs
associated with underwriting and distributing the funds,  including the costs of
developing and producing sales  literature and printing of  prospectuses,  which
may be then either partially or fully reimbursed by the funds.

Most of our U.S. and  non-U.S.-registered  retail funds are  distributed  with a
multi-class  share  structure.  We  adopted  this  share  structure  to  provide
investors with greater sales charge alternatives for their investments.  Class A
shares  represent  a  traditional  fee  structure  whereby the  investor  pays a
commission at the time of purchase unless minimum  investment  criteria are met.
Class B shares,  which are  available  in many of our  funds  globally,  have no
front-end  sales charges but instead have a declining  schedule of sales charges
(called  contingent  deferred  sales  charges) if the investor  redeems within a
number of years  from  original  purchase  date.  Class C shares  have a pricing
structure combining aspects of conventional  front-end,  back-end and level-load
pricing. Class R shares with reduced sales charges are available for purchase by
certain retirement plan accounts.

Globally, we offer Advisor Class shares in many of our Franklin Templeton mutual
funds  and in the U.S.  we offer Z Class  shares  in  Mutual  Series  funds on a
limited basis,  both of which have no sales charges.  FTI Funds,  managed by our
subsidiary FII, offers three series of funds with no sales charges.  The Advisor
and Z Class shares are sold to our  officers,  directors  and current and former
employees,  and are also offered to institutions and investment advisory clients
(both affiliated and unaffiliated),  as well as individuals  generally investing
$5 million or more. We also sell money market funds to investors without a sales
charge.  Under the terms and  conditions  described in the  prospectuses  or the
statements  of  additional  information  for some funds,  certain  investors can
purchase  shares at net asset value or at reduced  sales  charges.  In addition,
investors may generally  exchange  their shares of a fund at net asset value for
shares within the same class of another  Franklin  Templeton mutual fund without
having to pay additional sales charges.

Our  insurance  product  funds  offered  for sale in the U.S.  generally  have a
two-class share  structure,  Class 1 and Class 2, which are offered at net asset
value without a sales load directly to the insurance  company separate  accounts
(the  shareholder).  The only difference between the two classes is that Class 2
shares are assessed a  distribution  and service fee ("12b-1 fee") (as described
below)  payable  to those who sell and  distribute  Class 2 shares  and  provide
services to shareholders and contract owners (e.g., FTDI), the insurance company
or others.  These 12b-1 fees are generally  assessed quarterly at an annual rate
of 0.25% of the average daily net assets of the class.

The following table  summarizes the sales charges and  distribution  and service
fee structure for various  share  classes of our  U.S.-registered  retail mutual

(a)  Reductions in the maximum sales charges may be available depending upon the
     amount  invested  and the type of  investor.  In some  cases  noted in each
     fund's prospectus or statement of additional information, certain investors
     may  invest  in Class A shares  at net  asset  value  (with  no  load).  In
     connection with certain of these no-load purchases, FTDI may make a payment
     out of its own resources to a broker/dealer involved with that sale.
(b)  For Net  Asset  Value  ("NAV")  purchases  over $1  million,  a  contingent
     deferred sales charge ("CDSC") of 1.00% may apply to shares redeemed within
     one year of investment for purchases made prior to February 1, 2002. A CDSC
     of 1.00% may apply to shares redeemed within 18 months  effective  February
     1, 2002.
(c)  Class B  shares  convert  to  Class A  shares  after  eight  (8)  years  of
     ownership.
(d)  FTDI pays a 2.00% dealer commission to brokers of record of Class C Shares,
     which consists of a 1.00% sales charge assessed to the investor at the time
     of sale, and 1.00% of which is paid by FTDI. FTDI recovers a portion of the
     amount it pays to brokers by retaining  certain 12b-1 fees assessed  during
     the first 12 months and from collecting  contingent  deferred sales charges
     on any redemptions made within 18 months of the time of sale.
(e)  When the Company  entered into  management  contracts for the Mutual Series
     funds, the outstanding shares of Mutual Series funds were reclassified as Z
     Class shares on October 31, 1996.  Current  Shareholders who held shares of
     any Mutual  Series  funds on October  31,  1996 may  continue to purchase Z
     Class shares of any Mutual Series fund.  Shareholders of the Z Class shares
     may also  exchange into Advisor  Class shares of other  Franklin  Templeton
     mutual funds if otherwise  meeting the Advisor  Class  shares'  eligibility
     requirements. Alternatively, Z Class shareholders may exchange into Class A
     shares of other Franklin  Templeton mutual funds at net asset value,  which
     are subject to 12b-1 fees. FTDI may make a payment out of its own resources
     to a broker/dealer involved in selling Z Class shares.

Our non-U.S.-registered funds, including the Tax Class shares offered in Canada,
have various  sales  charges and fee  structures  that are not discussed in this
report.

The  distribution  agreements with the funds  generally  provide for FTDI to pay
commission   expenses  for  sales  of  fund  shares  to  broker/dealers.   These
broker/dealers  receive  various  sales  commissions  and other  fees from FTDI,
including fees from investors and the funds, for services in matching  investors
with funds whose  investment  objectives  match such  investors'  goals and risk
profiles.   Broker/dealers  may  also  receive  fees  for  their  assistance  in
explaining  the operations of the funds,  in servicing the  investor's  account,
reporting and various other  distribution  services.  Franklin  Templeton mutual
fund  shares  are  sold  primarily   through  a  large  network  of  independent
intermediaries,  including  broker/dealers,  banks and other similar  investment
advisers. We are heavily dependent upon these distribution channels and business
relationships.  There is increasing  competition  for access to these  channels,
which  has  caused  our  distribution  costs to rise  and  could  cause  further
increases  in the  future as  competition  continues  and  service  expectations
increase.  As of  September  30, 2002,  over 4,000 local,  regional and national
securities  brokerage  firms  offered  shares  of the  U.S.-registered  Franklin
Templeton  mutual funds for sale to the investing  public.  In the U.S., we have
approximately  85 general  wholesalers  and 8 retirement  plan  wholesalers  who
interface with the broker/dealer community.

Most of the U.S.-registered  Franklin Templeton mutual funds, with the exception
of certain  Franklin  Templeton  money market funds,  have adopted  distribution
plans  (the  "Plans")  under  Rule  12b-1  promulgated  under the '40 Act ("Rule
12b-1").  The Plans are  established  for an  initial  term of one (1) year and,
thereafter,  must  be  approved  annually  by the  particular  fund's  board  of
directors and by a majority of its disinterested  fund  directors/trustees.  All
such Plans are  subject  to  termination  at any time by a majority  vote of the
disinterested directors or by the particular fund shareholders. The Plans permit
the funds to bear certain expenses relating to the distribution of their shares,
such as expenses for marketing,  advertising,  printing and sales promotion. The
implementation  of the Plans provided for a lower fee on Class A shares acquired
prior to the adoption of such Plans.  Fees from the Plans are paid  primarily to
third-party dealers who provide service to the shareholder accounts,  and engage
in distribution  activities.  FTDI may also receive reimbursement from the funds
for  various  expenses  that FTDI  incurs in  distributing  the  funds,  such as
marketing,  advertising,  printing  and sales  promotion  subject  to the Plans'
limitations  on  amounts.  Each fund has a  percentage  limit for these  type of
expenses based on average daily net assets under management.

Class B and C shares are  generally  more costly to us in the year of sale,  but
they  allow  us  to  be  competitive  by  increasing  our  presence  in  various
distribution  channels.  We have arranged to finance Class B and certain Class C
share  deferred  commissions  arising  from  our  U.S.,  Canadian  and  European
operations through Lightning Finance Company Limited, a company in which we have
an ownership interest. The repayment of the financing advances is limited to the
cash flows  generated by the funds' 12b-1 Plans and by any  contingent  deferred
sales charges collected in connection with early  redemptions  (within six years
after purchase on Class B shares).

G.   SUMMARY OF OUR SPONSORED INVESTMENT PRODUCTS
     --------------------------------------------

Our sponsored  investment  products are offered to retail,  institutional,  high
net-worth and separate accounts,  which include individual investors,  qualified
groups, trustees,  tax-deferred (such as IRAs) or money purchase plans, employee
benefit and profit sharing plans,  trust companies,  bank trust  departments and
institutional investors in over 128 countries.

1.   INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES

The  sponsored  investment  products  that we offer  accommodate  a  variety  of
investment goals, including growth, growth at a reasonable price, value, capital
appreciation,  growth and income,  income,  tax-free income and  preservation of
capital.  In seeking to  achieve  such  objectives,  each  portfolio  emphasizes
different investment securities.

Our equity investment products include some that are value-oriented, others that
reflect a growth style of investing  and some that use a  combination  of growth
and value.  Value investing focuses on identifying  companies which our research
analysts and portfolio  managers  believe are  undervalued  based on a number of
factors.  Portfolios that seek capital  appreciation  invest primarily in equity
securities in a wide variety of international and U.S. markets;  some seek broad
national  market  exposure,  while  others  focus on  narrower  sectors  such as
precious  metals,   health  care,  emerging  technology,   large-cap  companies,
small-cap  companies,  real estate  securities and utilities.  Growth  investing
relies on the review of  macro-economic,  industry and sector trends to identify
companies that exhibit superior growth potential  relative to industry peers and
the broad market. Unlike other management styles that focus on short-term market
trends,  our growth  portfolio  investment  management team invests in companies
demonstrating  long-term growth potential,  based mainly on proprietary in-house
analysis and research.

Portfolios seeking income generally focus on taxable and tax-exempt money market
instruments,   tax-exempt  municipal  bonds,  global  fixed-income   securities,
fixed-income debt securities of corporations and of the U.S.  government and its
agencies  and  instrumentalities   such  as  the  Government  National  Mortgage
Association,  the Federal National  Mortgage  Association,  and the Federal Home
Loan Mortgage  Corporation,  and of the various  states in the U.S. Still others
focus on  investments  in  particular  countries  and regions,  such as emerging
markets.

Again, we also provide investment management and related services to a number of
closed-end  investment  companies  whose shares are traded on various major U.S.
and some  international  stock  exchanges.  In addition,  we provide  investment
management,   marketing  and   distribution   services  to  SICAV  ("Societe  d'
Investissement a Capital  Variable") funds and umbrella unit trusts organized in
Luxembourg and Ireland,

                                       13

respectively,  which are distributed in international  market places, as well as
to locally organized funds in various countries outside the U.S.

Our sponsored  investment  products also include  portfolios managed for some of
the world's largest corporations,  endowments,  charitable foundations,  pension
funds,  wealthy  individuals and other  institutions.  We use various investment
techniques  to  focus  on  specific  client  objectives  for  these  specialized
portfolios.

</TABLE>
(a) Does not include the Franklin  Templeton Global Fund, the Fiduciary Emerging
Markets Bond Fund, nor  fund-of-funds  mutual funds. For purposes of this table,
we consider the sales region to be where a fund is based and primarily  sold and
not necessarily  the region where a particular fund is invested.  Many funds are
also  distributed  across  different sales regions (e.g.  SICAV funds are based,
primarily sold in and therefore  considered to be within the  U.K./Europe  sales
region,  although also  distributed in the Asia Pacific sales  region),  but are
only designated a single sales region in the table.

3.   FUND INTRODUCTIONS, MERGERS AND LIQUIDATIONS

From  time to time,  as  market  conditions  or  investor  demand  warrants,  we
introduce new funds,  merge existing funds or liquidate  existing funds.  During
the fiscal year ended  September 30, 2002,  we added and  introduced a number of
funds both within the U.S. and internationally.

In the U.S.,  we expanded  our  product  line by  launching  new funds and share
classes,  including those targeted to our institutional clients. We introduced a
new R share  class for our  retirement  business  in the U.S.  We also added two
donor-advised  fund  alternatives  for our clients,  including  one for Franklin
Templeton  retail  clients  and the  other  for high  net-worth  clients  of our
subsidiary, Fiduciary.

Internationally,  through our indirect  wholly-owned  investment  management and
advisory subsidiaries and joint ventures, we continued to expand our business in
and  launched  new funds and  investment  products  to target  country  specific
markets.  Through our  acquisition  of Pioneer,  we not only added new funds and
investment  products in India, but also became that country's largest non-Indian
mutual fund manager.  In Canada,  we added new wrap  investment  portfolios  and
launched a series of funds known as the  Quotential  Program,  which consists of
fund-of-fund  mutual funds. In other parts of Asia,  including Korea,  Japan and

                                       18
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<PAGE>

Singapore, we launched a variety of fixed-income and hybrid funds. In Europe, we
introduced funds in, among other regions,  Ireland, the United Kingdom, Germany,
Sweden,  Switzerland and France. We also added an additional share class for our
Luxembourg-domiciled  SICAV  funds  and a  Euro-denominated  share  class of the
Mutual European Fund.

During the fiscal year ended  September 30, 2002, the following fund mergers and
liquidations  took place:  3 variable  annuity funds merged into other  variable
annuity  funds;  4 FTI Funds were merged  into 3 Franklin  Funds and 1 Templeton
Fund; 2  Dublin-domiciled  FTI Funds were  liquidated;  2 closed-end  funds were
merged  into 1  open-end  fund and 1  closed-end  fund was merged  into  another
closed-end fund.

II.  BANKING/FINANCE OPERATIONS
     --------------------------

Our secondary business segment is  banking/finance,  which offers select retail,
consumer, private banking and credit related services.

Our  subsidiary,  Fiduciary,  is a New York state  chartered  bank and  provides
private banking services primarily to high net-worth clients who maintain trust,
custody  and or  investment  management  accounts  with  Fiduciary.  Fiduciary's
private  banking and credit  products  include,  among others,  loans secured by
marketable  securities,  foreign exchange  services,  deposit accounts and other
credit  services.  As discussed in Investment  Management and Related  Services,
Fiduciary  also offers  investment  management,  trust and  estate,  custody and
related  services to institutional  accounts and high net-worth  individuals and
families.

Franklin Capital Corporation ("FCC") is a subsidiary of FRI, which was formed to
expand our lending activities related primarily to the purchase,  securitization
and servicing of retail  installment  sales contracts  ("automobile  contracts")
originated by independent  automobile  dealerships.  FCC, headquartered in Utah,
conducts  its  business  primarily  in the Western  region of the U.S.  and is a
finance  company  organized and licensed under the laws of Utah. As of September
30, 2002,  FCC's total assets  included $103 million of  outstanding  automobile
contracts.  During fiscal 2002, FCC securitized  approximately $544.8 million of
automobile  contract  receivables for which it maintains  servicing rights.  FCC
continues to service $530.9 million of receivables that have been securitized to
date. See Note 6 in the Notes to the Financial Statements.

Our  securitized   consumer  receivables  business  is  subject  to  marketplace
fluctuation and competes with businesses with  significantly  larger portfolios.
Auto loan and credit card portfolio  losses can be influenced  significantly  by
trends in the economy and credit  markets  which  reduce  borrowers'  ability to
repay loans. A more detailed  analysis of loan losses and  delinquency  rates in
our consumer lending and dealer auto loan business is contained in Note 5 in the
Notes to the Financial Statements.

Our subsidiary  Franklin Templeton Bank & Trust,  F.S.B.  ("FTB&T"),  with total
assets of $192.3  million,  as of  September  30,  2002,  provides  FDIC insured
deposit  accounts and general  consumer loan products such as credit card loans,
fund-secured  loans and auto loans.  FTB&T  (formerly  known as  Franklin  Bank)
became  chartered  as a federal  savings  bank on May 1, 2000 when the Office of
Thrift  Supervision  approved  FTB&T's  application to convert from a California
state banking  charter to a Federal thrift  charter.  Immediately  following the
conversion  of FTB&T's  state  charter  to a federal  thrift  charter,  Franklin
Templeton Trust Company, a California  chartered trust company,  was merged into
FTB&T and continues to perform its prior activities as a division of FTB&T.

Our other banking subsidiaries include, FTI-Banque Fiduciary Trust, a Swiss bank
based in Geneva,  Switzerland,  which provides an array of private banking trust
and investment  services to clients outside of the U.S., and FTCI (Cayman) Ltd.,
a licensed bank and trust company in the Cayman Islands.

REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS

Virtually all aspects of our business,  including  those  conducted  through our
various  subsidiaries,  are  subject  to various  federal,  state,  and  foreign
regulation,  and  supervision.  Domestically,  we are subject to regulation  and
supervision  by, among others,  the SEC, the National  Association of Securities
Dealers  ("NASD"),  the

                                       19
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<PAGE>
Federal  Reserve Board (the "FRB"),  the Federal Deposit  Insurance  Corporation
("FDIC"),  the  Office  of Thrift  Supervision  and the New York  State  Banking
Department.  Globally,  we are subject to regulation and  supervision  by, among
others, the Ontario and Alberta  Securities  Commissions in Canada, the Monetary
Authority of Singapore,  the Financial Services Authority in the United Kingdom,
the Central Bank of Ireland, the Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong,
the Korean  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Economy  and the  Financial  Supervisory
Commission in Korea,  and the Securities  Exchange Board of India.  The Advisers
Act imposes numerous  obligations on our  subsidiaries,  which are registered as
investment   advisers,   including  record  keeping,   operating  and  marketing
requirements,  disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities.
The '40 Act imposes  similar  obligations on the  investment  companies that are
advised by our subsidiaries.  The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and
impose  sanctions for  violations  of the Advisers Act and the '40 Act,  ranging
from fines and censure to termination of an investment  adviser's  registration.
FRI and many of the investment companies advised by our various subsidiaries are
also subject to the recently enacted Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

Since 1993,  the NASD Conduct  Rules have limited the amount of aggregate  sales
charges  which  may be paid in  connection  with the  purchase  and  holding  of
investment company shares sold through brokers.  The effect of the rule might be
to limit the amount of fees that could be paid  pursuant to a fund's  12b-1 Plan
to FTDI, our principal  underwriting  and distribution  subsidiary,  which earns
underwriting  commissions  on the  distribution  of fund shares in the U.S. Such
limitations  would  apply in a situation  where a fund has no, or  limited,  new
sales for a prolonged  period of time.  None of the  Franklin  Templeton  mutual
funds are in, or close to, that situation at the present time.

Following the  acquisition  of Fiduciary,  in fiscal 2001,  the Company became a
bank  holding  company  under  the BHC Act and is  subject  to  supervision  and
regulation  by the FRB.  Pursuant to the GLB Act, as a  qualifying  bank holding
company,  we also  became a  financial  holding  company,  which  enables  us to
affiliate  with a far broader range of financial  companies  than had previously
been  permitted  for  bank  holding  companies.   Permitted  affiliates  include
securities brokers,  underwriters and dealers,  investment managers, mutual fund
distributors, insurance companies and companies engaged in other activities that
are  "financial  in  nature  or  incidental  thereto"  or  "complementary"  to a
financial activity. The FRB has issued interim rules specifying that organizing,
sponsoring,  and managing a mutual fund are activities  that are permissible for
financial holding companies under certain guidelines. A bank holding company may
elect to become a  financial  holding  company  if, as in our case,  each of its
subsidiary  banks  and  other  depository   institution   subsidiaries  is  well
capitalized,  is well managed and has at least a "satisfactory" rating under the
Community Reinvestment Act (the "CRA").

The FRB may impose limitations,  restrictions, or prohibitions on the activities
or  acquisitions  of a financial  holding  company if the FRB believes  that the
Company does not have the  appropriate  financial  and  managerial  resources to
commence or conduct an activity,  make an acquisition,  or retain ownership of a
company.  The  GLB  Act  establishes  the  FRB as the  umbrella  supervisor  for
financial holding companies and adopts an administrative  approach to regulation
that  requires  the FRB to defer to the  actions  and  requirements  of the U.S.
"functional"  regulators  of  subsidiary  broker/dealers,  investment  advisers,
investment companies,  insurance companies,  and other regulated  non-depository
institutions.

FRB policy provides that, as a matter of prudent banking, a bank holding company
generally  should not pay dividends unless its net income is sufficient to fully
fund the dividends and the prospective rate of earnings  retention appears to be
consistent with the capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition
of the holding company and its bank and thrift institution  subsidiaries.  As we
are a bank holding company,  this policy may be applied to us even though we are
also a financial holding company.

Almost every aspect of the operations and financial condition of our banking and
thrift  subsidiaries are subject to extensive  regulation and supervision and to
various  requirements  and restrictions  under Federal and state law,  including
requirements  governing  capital  adequacy,  management  practices,   liquidity,
branching, earnings, loans, dividends,  investments,  reserves against deposits,
and the provision of services.  Under Federal law, a depository  institution  is
prohibited from paying a dividend if the depository institution

                                       20
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<PAGE>

would  thereafter  be  "undercapitalized"  as  determined  by the  Federal  bank
regulatory agencies.  The relevant Federal banking regulatory agencies,  and the
state banking regulatory  agencies,  also have authority to prohibit a bank or a
bank holding  company from  engaging in what,  in the opinion of the  regulatory
body, constitutes an unsafe or unsound practice.

Each of our banking  subsidiaries is subject to  restrictions  under Federal law
that limit transactions with FRI and its non-bank subsidiaries,  including loans
and other  extensions  of  credit,  investments  or asset  purchases.  These and
various  other  transactions,  including  any  payment  of  money to FRI and its
non-bank  subsidiaries,  must be on terms and  conditions  that are,  or in good
faith  would  be,  offered  to  companies  that are not  affiliated  with  these
companies.

Federal banking agencies are required to take prompt  supervisory and regulatory
actions with respect to institutions that do not meet minimum capital standards.
There  are  five  defined   capital  tiers,   the  highest  of  which  is  "well
capitalized."  A  depository  institution  is generally  prohibited  from making
capital distributions,  including paying dividends, or paying management fees to
a holding  company if the  institution  would  thereafter  be  undercapitalized.
Undercapitalized  institutions  may not  accept,  renew  or roll  over  brokered
deposits.  To  remain  a  financial  holding  company,  each  company's  banking
subsidiaries  must be well  capitalized  and well  managed.  As of September 30,
2002,  our  bank  and  thrift  subsidiaries  continued  to be  considered  "well
capitalized" and "well managed". See "MD&A".

The FRB has adopted various capital guidelines for bank holding  companies.  The
GLB Act authorizes the FRB to establish  consolidated  capital  requirements for
financial holding companies. The GLB Act prohibits the FRB from imposing capital
requirements  on  functionally  regulated  non-bank  subsidiaries of a financial
holding company, such as broker/dealers and investment advisers. The FRB has not
published  consolidated  capital  requirements  specific  to  financial  holding
companies, but may do so in the future.

The Federal banking agencies have broad enforcement powers,  including the power
to terminate  deposit  insurance,  impose  substantial fines and other civil and
criminal penalties and appoint a conservator or receiver. Failure to comply with
applicable laws,  regulations and supervisory  agreements could subject FRI, our
thrift  and  banking  subsidiaries,  as well as  officers,  directors  and other
so-called   "institution-affiliated   parties"   of  these   organizations,   to
administrative  sanctions and potentially  substantial civil money penalties. In
addition,  the  appropriate  Federal  banking  agency  may  appoint  the FDIC as
conservator  or  receiver  for a banking  institution,  or the FDIC may  appoint
itself if any one or more of a number of circumstances exist.

COMPETITION

The  financial  services  industry is highly  competitive  and has  increasingly
become a global  industry.  There are  approximately  8,300 open-end  investment
companies of varying sizes,  investment policies and objectives whose shares are
being  offered to the public in the U.S. Due to our  international  presence and
varied  product mix, it is difficult to assess our market  position  relative to
other  investment  managers on a worldwide basis, but we believe that we are one
of the more widely diversified  investment  managers in the U.S. We believe that
our equity and  fixed-income  asset mix coupled  with our global  presence  will
serve our  competitive  needs well over the long term.  We  continue to focus on
service to customers, performance of investment products and extensive marketing
activities  with  our  strong  broker/dealer  and  other  financial  institution
distribution network as well as high net-worth customers.

We face strong competition from numerous investment management,  stock brokerage
and  investment  banking firms,  insurance  companies,  banks,  savings and loan
associations  and other  financial  institutions,  which  offer a wide  range of
financial and investment management services to the same institutional accounts,
separate  accounts and high net-worth  customers that we are seeking to attract.
In  recent  years,  there  has been a trend of  consolidation  in the  financial
services  industry,  resulting in stronger  competitors  with greater  financial
resources than us.

We rely largely on  intermediaries  to sell and  distribute  Franklin  Templeton
mutual  fund  shares.  In  addition  to  offering  our  products,  many of these
intermediaries  also have  mutual  funds  under  their own  names  that  compete
directly  with our  products.  These  intermediaries  could  decide  to limit or
restrict  the sale of our
                                       21
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<PAGE>

fund  shares,  which  could  lower our future  sales and cause our  revenues  to
decline.  We have and continue to pursue sales  relationships  with all types of
intermediaries  to  broaden  our  distribution   network.  We  have  experienced
increased  costs  related  to  maintaining  our  distribution  channels  and  we
anticipate that this trend will continue.

We have  implemented  an award  winning  Internet  platform to compete  with the
rapidly developing and evolving capabilities being offered with this technology.
Together  with several large  financial  services  companies,  we made a capital
investment in the  development of an  industry-wide  Internet  portal,  known as
Advisorcentral.com,  which provides our broker,  dealer and  investment  advisor
customers with the ability to view their clients' holdings using one log-in ID.

As investor  interest in the mutual fund  industry  has  increased,  competitive
pressures have increased on sales charges of broker/dealer distributed funds. We
believe that,  although this trend will continue,  a significant  portion of the
investing public still relies on the services of the  broker/dealer or financial
adviser community, particularly during weaker market conditions.

We believe that we are well positioned to deal with changes in marketing  trends
as a result of our  already  extensive  advertising  activities  and broad based
marketplace  recognition.  We conduct  significant  advertising  and promotional
campaigns  through  various  media  sources to  promote  brand  recognition.  We
advertise  in major  national  financial  publications,  as well as on radio and
television  to promote  brand name  recognition  and to assist our  distribution
network.  Such activities  included  purchasing  network and cable  programming,
sponsorship   of  sporting   events,   and  extensive   newspaper  and  magazine
advertising.

Diverse  and  strong  competition  affects  the  banking/finance  segment of our
business as well, and limits the fees that can be charged for our services.  For
example,  in the banking segment we compete with many types of institutions  for
consumer  loans,   including  the  finance   subsidiaries  of  large  automobile
manufacturers,  which have offered  special  incentives to stimulate  automobile
sales,  including  no-interest loans. These product offerings by our competitors
limit the interest rates that we can charge on consumer loans.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT INDUSTRY SEGMENTS

Information  on our  operations in various  geographic  areas of the world and a
breakout of business segment  information is contained in Note 9 in the Notes to
the Consolidated Financial Statements.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

We have used,  registered,  and/or  applied to register  certain  trademarks and
service marks to distinguish our sponsored investment products and services from
those of our competitors in the U.S. and in foreign countries and jurisdictions,
including  Franklin(R),   Templeton(R),   Bissett(R),   Mutual  Series(R),   and
FiduciaryTM. We enforce our trademark, service mark and trade name rights in the
U.S. and abroad.

EMPLOYEES

As of  September  30, 2002,  we employed  approximately  6,700  employees in our
offices located in 28 countries. We consider our relations with our employees to
be satisfactory.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

We conduct our  worldwide  operations  using a  combination  of leased and owned
facilities.  While we believe we have sufficient  facilities to conduct business
during fiscal 2003, we will continue to lease, acquire and dispose of facilities
throughout the world as necessary.

We lease space domestically in California,  Delaware,  Florida,  New Jersey, New
York,  Utah and the  District of  Columbia,  and  internationally  in Abu Dhabi,
Australia,  Belgium,  Brazil, Canada, England,  France,  Germany,  Holland, Hong
Kong,  India,  Italy,  Japan,  Korea,  Luxembourg,   Poland,  Russia,  Scotland,
Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden,  Switzerland,  Taiwan, and Turkey. As of
September 30, 2002,  we leased and occupied  approximately  1.68 million  square
feet of space.  We also subleased to third parties a total of 0.4 million square
feet of space.

In  addition,  we own 6  buildings  near  Sacramento,  California,  as well as 5
buildings in St. Petersburg, Florida, 2 buildings in Nassau, Bahamas, as well as
space in office  buildings in Argentina,  China and Singapore.  The buildings we
own consist of  approximately  1.06 million  square feet.  Since we operate on a
unified  basis,  corporate  activities,  fund  related  activities,   accounting
operations,  sales,  real estate and banking  operations,  auto loans and credit
cards,  management  information  system  activities,   publishing  and  printing
operations,  shareholder  service  operations and other business  activities and
operations take place in a variety of such locations. In fiscal 2002 we sold two
of our buildings, one located in St. Petersburg,  Florida for $7 million and one
located in Rancho Cordova, California for $10 million.

We lease our corporate headquarters in San Mateo, California from a lessor trust
under an operating  lease that expires in fiscal 2005. In  connection  with this
lease, we are  contingently  liable for  approximately  $145 million in residual
guarantees,  representing  approximately 85% of the total  construction costs of
$170 million.  The lease includes  renewal  options that can be exercised at the
end of the initial  lease  period,  and  purchase  options that can be exercised
prior to the  expiration of the lease term. We are monitoring the project of the
Financial  Accounting  Standards Board to address accounting for special purpose
entities to determine  the effect,  if any, it may have on our  treatment of the
owner-lessor trust described above.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

There have been no material  developments in the litigation  previously reported
in our Form 10-Q for the  period  ended  June 30,  2002 as filed with the SEC on
August 12, 2002.  We are involved  from time to time in  litigation  relating to
claims  arising in the normal  course of business.  Management is of the opinion
that the  ultimate  resolution  of such  claims will not  materially  affect our
business or financial position.

ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

During the fourth  quarter of the fiscal year covered by this report,  no matter
was submitted to a vote of security holders.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

In this  section,  we  discuss  our  results  of  operations  and our  financial
condition.  We also make some statements relating to the future which are called
"forward-looking statements." Although we do our best to make clear and accurate
forward-looking  statements,  the  actual  results  and  outcomes  could  differ
significantly from those that we discuss in this document.  For this reason, you
should  not rely too  heavily  on these  forward-looking  statements  and should
review the "Risk  Factors"  section,  where we discuss these  statements in more
detail.

GENERAL

We derive the majority of our  operating  revenues,  operating  expenses and net
income from providing  investment advisory and related services to retail mutual
funds, institutional,  high net-worth and private accounts, and other investment
products.  This is our main business activity and operating segment.  The mutual
funds and other  products  that we advise,  collectively  called  our  sponsored
investment  products,  are  distributed to the public globally via five distinct
names:

* Franklin      * Templeton    * Mutual Series    * Fiduciary Trust    * Bissett

Our  sponsored  investment  products  include  a broad  range  of  domestic  and
global/international equity, hybrid, fixed-income and money market mutual funds,
as well as other  investment  products  that  meet a wide  variety  of  specific
investment needs of individuals and institutions.

The level of our  revenues  depends  largely  on the level and  relative  mix of
assets under  management.  To a lesser  degree,  our revenues also depend on the
level of mutual fund sales and the number of mutual fund  shareholder  accounts.
The fees  charged for our services  are based on  contracts  with our  sponsored
investment  products or our  clients.  These  arrangements  could  change in the
future.

Our  secondary   business  and  operating   segment  is   banking/finance.   Our
banking/finance group offers selected  retail-banking services to high net-worth
individuals, foundations and institutions and consumer lending.

At September  30, 2002, we employed  approximately  6,700 people in 28 countries
serving customers on six different continents.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The table below  presents the  highlights of our  operations  for the last three
fiscal years.

/1/ EBITDA margin is earnings before interest, taxes on income, depreciation and
the  amortization of intangibles  divided by total  revenues.  The effect of the
September 2002 $60.1 million  other-than-temporary  decline in investments value
is  excluded  from  EBITDA.   Our  September  2002  EBITDA   margin,   including
other-than-temporary decline in investments value, is 28%.

Net income  decreased by 11% and diluted  earnings per share decreased by 14% in
fiscal  2002  mainly  due to lower  investment  and other  income  related to an
other-than-temporary  decline in the value of certain  investments and increased
operating expenses, partially offset by higher revenues. Net income decreased by

14% and diluted  earnings per share decreased by 16% in fiscal 2001,  mainly due
to increased operating expenses offset by slightly higher revenue and investment
income.

/2/  Investment  management  fees from  approximately  50% of our  assets  under
management at September 30, 2002 are calculated using daily average assets under
management.

Our assets under management at September 30, 2002 were $247.8 billion, 1% higher
than a year ago. The simple monthly  average value of these assets during fiscal
2002 was $263.2  billion as compared  to $243.4  billion in fiscal  2001,  an 8%
increase.  The year over year  change in simple  monthly  average  assets  under
management  generally is more  indicative of investment  management  fee revenue
trends than the year over year change in year-end assets.

The mix of assets under  management  is shown below,  followed by industry  data
showing average effective  investment  management fees using data from Lipper(R)
Inc. Our actual effective fee rates may vary from these rates.

/3/  Calculated  by  Franklin  Templeton  Investments  based  on  asset-weighted
averages of management fee rates provided by Lipper(R) Inc.  Industry  effective
investment management fee rates are calculated using all U.S.-based,  open-ended
funds that reported  expense data to Lipper(R) Inc. as of the funds' most recent
annual report date, and for which  management fee rates were greater or equal to
zero. Industry effective fee rates reflect the investment management expenses of
retail and  institutional  funds drawn from all distribution  channels,  without
exception. The averages reflect combined retail and institutional funds data and
include all share classes,  and all distribution  channels,  without  exception.
Variable annuities are not included.

The  change  in the  mix of  assets  under  management  was  largely  due to the
inclusion  of  the  assets  under   management   of  Fiduciary   Trust   Company
International ("Fiduciary") beginning in fiscal 2001 and the market depreciation
in equity assets in 2002 and 2001. Approximately 64% of Fiduciary's assets under
management  were classified as hybrid assets at the time of acquisition in April
2001.  This  change in mix  lowered  our  overall  effective  fee rate on assets
managed,  as a  greater  percentage  of  assets  under  management  are  in  the
fixed-income and hybrid  categories which generally carry a lower management fee
than equity assets.  The effective  investment  management fee rate  (investment
management  fees divided by simple  monthly  average  assets  under  management)
declined to 0.56% for the 2002 fiscal year  compared to 0.58% in fiscal 2001 and
0.61% in fiscal 2000.

At September 30, 2002 assets under  management by  shareholder  location were as

During  fiscal 2002 and 2001,  our  sponsored  investment  products  experienced
overall net cash inflows, including reinvested dividends, in contrast to the net
cash outflows  experienced  in fiscal 2000.  Gross  product sales  increased 24%
while  redemptions  decreased  2% in 2002.  Our  acquisition  of Pioneer ITI AMC
Limited  ("Pioneer"),  an Indian  investment  management  company,  in July 2002
increased  our assets  under  management  by $0.8 billion as of the date of this
acquisition.  In 2001, the acquisition of Bissett in

<PAGE>

October 2000  increased our assets under  management  by $3.7  billion,  and the
Fiduciary  acquisition  in April 2001  increased our assets under  management by
$45.8 billion, as of the dates of those acquisitions.

Despite an overall  decline in domestic and global equity  markets in the latter
half of 2002, our assets under  management  increased from fiscal 2001 primarily
as a result of strong net sales  during the year and less  depreciation  than in
2001.  In fiscal  2001,  assets  under  management  increased  mainly due to the
Fiduciary  and  Bissett  acquisitions  and  net  inflows,  partially  offset  by
depreciation.

</TABLE>

SUMMARY

In fiscal  2002,  total  operating  revenues  increased  7% over the prior year.
Investment  management and underwriting  and distribution  fees increased due to
both  higher net sales and  higher  average  assets  under  management.  We also
benefited  from the  inclusion of  Fiduciary  revenues for a full fiscal year in
2002, as well as higher net gains related to auto loan securitizations  included
in Other, net revenue.

In fiscal 2001,  total  operating  revenues  increased  1%. The  acquisition  of
Fiduciary in April 2001 provided higher  investment  management fees from higher
average assets under  management.  We also  experienced  higher banking revenues
included in other, net offset by reduced shareholder servicing fees.

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FEES

Investment  management  fees,  accounting  for 58% of our operating  revenues in
fiscal 2002,  include both investment  advisory and  administration  fees. These
fees are generally calculated under contractual  arrangements with our sponsored
investment  products  as a  percentage  of the  market  value  of  assets  under
management.  Annual  rates vary by  investment  objective  and type of  services
provided.  In return for these  fees,  we provide a  combination  of  investment
advisory, administrative and other management services.

Investment  management  fees increased 4% in fiscal 2002 mainly due to increased
net sales, which increased assets under management,  and the impact of including
Fiduciary for a full fiscal year. This increase was partially  offset by a shift
in our  asset  mix  toward  fixed-income  investment  products,  which  led to a
decrease in our effective investment management fee rate.

Investment management fees increased 1% in fiscal 2001 from the prior year. This
increase was  primarily due to the Fiduciary  acquisition,  which  increased the
simple monthly  average assets under  management in the latter half of the year,
partially  offset by a shift in our asset mix  toward  fixed-income  and  hybrid
investment products, which carry lower effective fee rates.

UNDERWRITING AND DISTRIBUTION FEES

We earn underwriting fees from the sale of some classes of sponsored  investment
products on which  investors  pay a sales  commission  at the time of  purchase.
Sales at reduced or zero  commissions  are offered on some classes of shares and
for sales to  shareholders  or  intermediaries  that  exceed  specified  minimum


                                       28
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<PAGE>

amounts.  Therefore,  underwriting  fees will change  with the overall  level of
gross sales and the relative mix of sales between different share classes.

Our sponsored  investment  products pay  distribution  fees in return for sales,
marketing  and  distribution  efforts on their behalf.  While other  contractual
arrangements  exist  in  international  jurisdictions,  in  the  United  States,
distribution  fees include 12b-1 fees.  These fees are subject to maximum payout
levels based on a percentage  of the assets in each fund.  We pay a  significant
portion of  underwriting  and  distribution  fees to the financial  advisors and
other intermediaries who sell our sponsored investment products to the public on
our behalf. See the description of underwriting and distribution expenses below.

Overall,  underwriting  and  distribution  fees  increased  12% in fiscal  2002.
Underwriting  fees increased 24% consistent with a 24% increase in gross product
sales and  distribution  fees  increased  5%  consistent  with an 8% increase in
simple monthly average assets under management.

Underwriting  and  distribution  fees  remained  constant  in fiscal  2001 as an
overall increase in product sales was offset by a greater  percentage of overall
sales  being  made at no or lower  commission  levels.  Distribution  fees  also
remained constant as the increase in average assets under management was related
to the Fiduciary  acquisition.  The Fiduciary  assets under  management  are not
subject  to  distribution   fees;   therefore,   these  assets  did  not  affect
distribution  fee income as would be expected  with a year over year increase in
average assets under management.

SHAREHOLDER SERVICING FEES

Shareholder  servicing fees are generally fixed charges per shareholder  account
that vary with the particular  type of fund and the service being  rendered.  In
some instances,  sponsored  investment  products are charged these fees based on
the level of assets  under  management.  We  receive  fees as  compensation  for
providing transfer agency services, which include providing customer statements,
transaction  processing,  customer  service  and tax  reporting.  In the  United
States,  transfer  agency service  agreements  provide that accounts closed in a
calendar  year  remain  billable  through  the second  quarter of the  following
calendar  year at a reduced  rate.  In  Canada,  such  agreements  provide  that
accounts  closed in the previous  calendar year remain  billable for four months
after the end of the  calendar  year.  Accordingly,  the level of fees will vary
with the growth in new  accounts  and the level of closed  accounts  that remain
billable.

Shareholder  servicing  fees  decreased  4% in fiscal 2002 and 6% in fiscal 2001
consistent with a decrease in the quarterly average number of billable accounts.
Our acquisition of Pioneer added approximately 0.7 million shareholder accounts.

OTHER, NET

Other,  net  consists  mainly of  revenues  from the  banking/finance  operating
segment and  Fiduciary's  custody  services.  Revenues from the  banking/finance
operating  segment  include  interest  income on loans,  servicing  income,  and
investment income on banking/finance investment securities,  which are offset by
interest expense and the provision for anticipated loan losses.

Other,  net  increased  86% in fiscal 2002.  This increase was mainly due to the
inclusion of Fiduciary's  banking and custody  activities for a full fiscal year
in 2002 and increased gains recognized on auto loan portfolio sales.  Other, net
increased 90% in fiscal 2001. This increase was primarily due to the addition of
the Fiduciary  banking and custody  activities  from the date of  acquisition of
Fiduciary to those of Franklin  Bank and Trust,  F.S.B.,  and  Franklin  Capital
Corporation.

</TABLE>


SUMMARY

Operating expenses increased 5% during fiscal 2002. This increase was mainly due
to  increased   underwriting  and  distribution   fees  consistent  with  higher
underwriting and distribution  revenue, and higher compensation and benefits and
technology  and occupancy  costs  primarily due to the inclusion of  Fiduciary's
activity  for a full  fiscal  year  in  2002.  The  increase  in  these  expense
categories was offset in part by a decline in amortization of intangible  assets
on  discontinuation  of  the  amortization  of  goodwill  and   indefinite-lived
intangible  assets.  In fiscal 2001,  operating  expenses  increased  10% mainly
caused by increased compensation and benefits,  information systems,  technology
and occupancy costs, the addition of the operating costs of Fiduciary, increased
underwriting and distribution expenses and increased  amortization of intangible
assets.

UNDERWRITING AND DISTRIBUTION

Underwriting and distribution  includes expenses paid to financial  advisers and
other third parties for selling,  distributing and providing ongoing services to
investors in our sponsored investment products.

Underwriting  and distribution  expenses  increased 12% in fiscal 2002 and 2% in
fiscal 2001  consistent  with similar trends in  underwriting  and  distribution
revenues.

COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS

Compensation  and  benefits  increased  5% during  fiscal 2002 due mainly to the
inclusion of Fiduciary's  activity for a full fiscal year,  including  retention
bonuses  committed to the Fiduciary staff. This increase was partially offset by
an overall  decline in  employees  as well as the  decision  made by  management
during the quarter ended December 2001 to reduce employee salaries by 5% or 10%,
depending on specific salary categories. In May 2002, we reinstated salaries for
employees  whose  salaries  were reduced by 5% and, in July 2002,  we reinstated
employee salaries in the 10% reduction category. We employed approximately 6,700
people at September  30, 2002 compared to  approximately  6,900 at the same time
last year. Our  acquisition  of Pioneer added  approximately  180 employees.  In
order to hire and retain our key  employees,  we are  committed  to keeping  our
salaries  and  benefit  packages  competitive,  which  means  that the  level of
compensation and benefits may increase more quickly or decrease more slowly than
our revenues.

Compensation  and benefits  increased 15% during fiscal 2001.  This increase was
mainly due to the addition of  approximately  790 Fiduciary  employees  from the
date of acquisition,  retention bonuses for Fiduciary  employees,  annual salary
increases, and an increase in employee benefit and recruiting costs.

INFORMATION SYSTEMS, TECHNOLOGY AND OCCUPANCY

Information  systems,  technology  and occupancy  costs  increased 12% in fiscal
2002.  This  increase was mainly due to the  inclusion  of costs  related to the
outsourcing  of the  management  of  our  data  center  and  distributed  server
operations and added technology and occupancy costs of the Fiduciary acquisition
for a full fiscal year in 2002.

Information  systems,  technology  and occupancy  costs  increased 23% in fiscal
2001. This increase was primarily due to continued expenditure on new technology
initiatives,  an investment in the technology infrastructure of the company, the
charges and costs in connection  with the  outsourcing  of the management of our
data center and  distributed  server  operations,  and the added  technology and
occupancy costs of the Fiduciary acquisition. We also experienced an increase in
occupancy costs related to our expansion in Asia,  Canada, and Europe as well as
costs related to the relocation to our new worldwide  headquarters in San Mateo,
California.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</TABLE>

Information  systems and technology  costs  capitalized in fiscal 2002 were less
than  amounts  capitalized  in  fiscal  2001  as we  slowed  down  a  number  of
initiatives,  realized  synergies  from previous  investments  in technology and
delayed  the  start of other  technology  projects  given the  current  economic
slowdown and our focus on cost control and management.

ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION

Advertising and promotion increased 1% during fiscal 2002 and 5% in fiscal 2001.
Increases in both years resulted mainly from increased promotion and advertising
activity to educate the sales channels and the investing public about the strong
relative investment performance of our sponsored investment products.

AMORTIZATION OF DEFERRED SALES COMMISSIONS

Certain  fund share  classes,  including  class B, are sold  without a front-end
sales  charge  to  shareholders,  while  at  the  same  time,  our  distribution
subsidiaries pay a commission on the sale. In the United States,  class A shares
are  sold  without  a  front-end  sales  charge  to  shareholders  when  minimum
investment  criteria  are met  while  our U.S.  distribution  subsidiary  pays a
commission on such sales.  Class C shares are sold with a front-end sales charge
that is lower than the  commission  paid by the U.S.  distributor.  We defer and
amortize all up-front commissions paid by our distribution subsidiaries.

We have arranged to finance certain of these deferred  commission assets ("DCA")
arising  from our U.S.,  Canadian  and  European  operations  through  Lightning
Finance  Company  Limited  ("LFL"),  a  company  in which  we have an  ownership
interest.  In the United States, LFL has entered into a financing agreement with
our U.S.  distribution  subsidiary and we maintain a continuing  interest in the
assets  until  resold by LFL.  As a result,  we retain DCA sold to LFL under the
U.S.  agreement in our  financial  statements  and amortize  them over an 8-year
period until resold by LFL in a securitization,  which generally occurs at least
once annually.  LFL sold approximately $61.5 million U.S. DCA in fiscal 2002 and
approximately   $20.3  million  U.S.  DCA  in  fiscal  2001  in   securitization
transactions.  In contrast to the U.S. arrangement,  LFL has entered into direct
agreements with the Canadian and European sponsored investment products, and, as
a result, we do not record DCA from these sources in our financial statements.

                                       31
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<PAGE>

Amortization of deferred sales  commissions  decreased 2% in fiscal 2002 and 18%
in fiscal 2001.  These  changes were mainly a result of changes in sales mix and
our current financing  arrangements.  As the balance of DCA on our balance sheet
changes, so does the amortization expense.

AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Amortization  of intangible  assets  decreased 70% in fiscal 2002. This decrease
was due to the adoption of Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 142
"Goodwill and Other  Intangible  Assets" ("SFAS 142"), on October 1, 2001. Under
the new accounting standard, we ceased to amortize goodwill and indefinite-lived
intangible  assets.  This  resulted in a reduction  in  amortization  expense of
approximately  $50 million in fiscal  2002 as  compared  to the prior  year.  We
completed our  impairment  testing as specified in SFAS 142 in March 2002 and we
determined  that there was no  impairment  to the goodwill and  indefinite-lived
assets recorded in our financial statements as of October 1, 2001.  Amortization
of intangible  assets  increased 52% in fiscal 2001, due to the  amortization of
goodwill  and other  intangible  assets  related to the  purchase of Bissett and
Fiduciary.

OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE)

Other  income  (expense)  includes  investment  and other  income  and  interest
expense. Investment and other income is comprised primarily of the following:

*    dividends from investments
*    interest income from investments in bonds and government securities
*    realized gains and losses on investments
*    foreign currency exchange gains and losses
*    miscellaneous income, including gain or loss on disposal of property.

Other  income  (expense)  was a net expense in fiscal 2002 mainly due to a $60.1
million  other-than-temporary  decline  in  value  of  some  of our  investments
recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. In contrast, in fiscal 2001, we
recognized  net realized  gains of  approximately  $34.2  million on the sale of
certain  sponsored  investment  products held for investment  purposes and other
realized gains of $24.6 million  related to the sale of our former  headquarters
building in San Mateo.

Other  income  (expense)  increased  65% in fiscal  2001  from the  prior  year,
primarily due to net realized gains related to our sponsored investment products
and the sale of our former headquarters building in San Mateo.

TAXES ON INCOME

Our effective  income tax rate for fiscal 2002  increased to 25% compared to 24%
in fiscal 2001 and 2000. As a multi-national  corporation, we provide investment
management services to a wide range of international  investment products, often
managed from locations  outside the United States.  Some of these  jurisdictions
have  lower tax  rates  than the  United  States.  The mix of income  (primarily
investment  management fees) subject to these lower rates,  when aggregated with
income originating in the United States,  produces a lower overall effective tax
rate than existing U.S. Federal and state tax rates. The effective tax rate will
continue to be reflective of the relative contributions of foreign earnings that
are  subject to reduced  tax rates and that are not  currently  included in U.S.
taxable income.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

At September 30, 2002, we had $980.6  million in cash and cash  equivalents,  as
compared to $596.2  million at  September  30, 2001.  Cash and cash  equivalents
include  cash,  U.S.  Treasury  bills and other debt  instruments  with original
maturities of three month or less and other highly liquid  investments  that are
readily  convertible  into  cash,  including  money  market  funds.  The  mix of
short-term  instruments and, in particular,  the maturity schedules of some debt
instruments,  affect  the level  reported  in cash and cash  equivalents  and in
investments,  available-for-sale in any given year. Liquid assets, which consist
of  cash  and

                                       32
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<PAGE>

cash  equivalents,   investments   available-for-sale  and  current  receivables
increased to $2,826.0  million at September  30, 2002 from  $2,273.1  million at
September 30, 2001.

At September  30,  2002,  approximately  $850 million was  available to us under
unused  commercial paper and medium-term note programs.  In addition,  in fiscal
2001 we filed a shelf  registration  statement  with the Securities and Exchange
Commission  permitting the issuance of debt and equity  securities of up to $300
million. Our committed revolving credit facilities at September 30, 2002 totaled
$420 million, of which, $210 million was under a 364-day facility. The remaining
$210  million  facility  is under a five-year  facility  and will expire in June
2007.  In addition,  our  Fiduciary  subsidiary  has $350  million  available in
uncommitted bank lines under the Federal Reserve Funds system.

Our ability to access the capital markets in a timely manner depends on a number
of factors  including our credit  rating,  the condition of the global  economy,
investors'  willingness  to purchase  our  securities,  interest  rates,  credit
spreads and the equity market valuation  levels.  In extreme  circumstances,  we
might not be able to access this liquidity readily.

Outstanding  debt  increased to $603.0 million at September 30, 2002 compared to
$574.4 million at September 30, 2001. As of September 30, 2002  outstanding debt
consists  of $514.2  million  in  principal  and  accrued  interest  related  to
outstanding  convertible  notes that we issued in May 2001 and $88.8  million of
other long-term debt. As of September 30, 2001, outstanding debt included $504.7
million  related to the  convertible  notes and $69.7 million of other long-term
debt. Each of the $1,000  (principal  amount at maturity)  convertible  notes is
convertible  into  9.3604  shares  of  our  common  stock.  We  may  redeem  the
convertible  notes for cash on or after May 11, 2006 at their accreted value. We
may have to repurchase the  convertible  notes at their accreted  value,  at the
option of the holders, on May 11 of 2003, 2004, 2006, 2011, 2016, 2021 and 2026.
In this event,  we may choose to pay the purchase price in cash or shares of our
common stock. The amount of convertible  notes that will be redeemed depends on,
among other factors,  the performance of our common stock.  Other long-term debt
consists primarily of deferred  commission  liability  recognized in relation to
the  U.S.  DCA  financed  by  LFL  that  has  not  yet  been  sold  by  LFL in a
securitization  transaction.  The increase in outstanding debt in fiscal 2002 is
due to additional financing activity of our mutual fund Class B shares sales and
the  accretion  of the  convertible  notes to maturity,  partially  offset by an
increase in DCA sold by LFL.

We have  arranged  with LFL for  non-recourse  financing  of  sales  commissions
advanced on sales of our B and C shares globally.  The sales commissions that we
have financed through LFL during fiscal 2002 were  approximately  $135.3 million
compared to $84.7 million in fiscal 2001.

Since September 1998, our  banking/finance  operating segment has entered into a
number of auto loan  securitization  transactions with qualified special purpose
entities,  which then issue asset-backed  securities to private  investors.  The
outstanding  loan balances held by these  special  purpose  entities were $530.9
million as of September  30, 2002 and $210.8  million as of September  30, 2001.
Our ability to access the  securitization  market will directly affect our plans
to finance the auto loan portfolio in the future.

We expect that the main uses of cash will be to:

*    expand our core business
*    make strategic acquisitions
*    acquire shares of our common stock
*    fund property and equipment purchases
*    pay operating expenses of the business
*    enhance our technology infrastructure
*    improve our business processes
*    pay shareholder dividends

We believe  that we can meet our present and  reasonably  foreseeable  operating
cash needs and future commitments through the following:

*    our existing liquid assets
*    the continuing cash flow from operations
*    our borrowing capacity under current credit facilities
*    our ability to issue debt or equity securities
*    our mutual fund sales commission financing arrangement.

In  particular,  we expect to finance future  investment in our  banking/finance
activities  through  operating  cash flows,  debt,  increased  deposit  base, or
through the securitization of a portion of the receivables from consumer lending
activities.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS

As described in Note 11 to the financial  statements,  our largest commitment at
September 30, 2002 relates to our convertible debt outstanding.

In addition,  at September 30, 2002, the  banking/finance  operating segment had
commitments to extend credit aggregating $281.5 million, mainly under its credit
card lines.  Standby letters of credit issued to Fiduciary  clients totaled $7.4
million and expire  through  December  2003.  The standby  letters of credit are
secured by marketable securities.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Our financial  statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with
generally accepted  accounting  principles in the United States. The preparation
of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that
impact our financial  position and results of  operations.  These  estimates and
assumptions  are affected by our  application of accounting  policies.  Below we
describe certain critical  accounting  policies that we believe are important to
understanding our results of operations and financial position.


                                       34
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<PAGE>

In addition,  please  refer to Note 1 to the  financial  statements  for further
discussion of our accounting policies.  Estimates, by their nature, are based on
judgment and available information. Differences between actual results and these
estimates could have a material impact on our financial statements.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS

At September 30, 2002 our assets included intangible assets as follows:


(in thousands)                                               NET CARRYING AMOUNT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Goodwill                                                              $1,321,939
Intangible assets - definite-lived                                       221,942
Intangible assets - indefinite-lived                                     475,304
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Total                                                                 $2,019,185
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Under Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other
Intangible  Assets",  we are  required  to test the fair value of  goodwill  and
indefinite-lived  intangibles  for  impairment at least once a year. As of March
31, 2002, we completed the impairment  testing of goodwill and  indefinite-lived
intangible assets and we determined that there was no impairment to the goodwill
and  indefinite-lived  assets recorded in our books and records as of October 1,
2001. While we believe that our testing was appropriate,  it involved the use of
estimates and  assumptions.  Using  different  assumptions  may have resulted in
recognizing some impairment of goodwill and  indefinite-lived  intangible assets
in our financial statements.

We  are  also   required  to  consider  if  any   impairment   has  occurred  to
definite-lived  intangible assets. Based on our review and evaluation, we do not
believe any impairment has occurred.

INCOME TAXES

As a  multinational  corporation,  we operate in various  locations  outside the
United  States.  We have made no provision for U.S.  taxes on $1,894  million of
cumulative  undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as those earnings are
intended  to be  reinvested  for an  indefinite  period of time.  Changes to our
policy of  reinvesting  foreign  earnings may have a  significant  effect on our
financial condition and results of operation.

VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS

We record  substantially  all  investments  in our financial  statements at fair
value or amounts that  approximate fair value.  Where  available,  we use prices
from independent  sources such as listed market prices or broker or dealer price
quotations.  For  investments in illiquid and privately held  securities that do
not  have  readily  determinable  fair  values,  we  estimate  the  value of the
securities based upon available information.  However, even where the value of a
security is derived from an independent  market price or broker or dealer quote,
some  assumptions may be required to determine the fair value.  For example,  we
generally assume that the size of positions in securities that we hold would not
be large enough to affect the quoted price of the securities when sold, and that
any such sale would happen in an orderly manner.  However, these assumptions may
be incorrect and the actual value realized on sale could differ from the current
carrying value.

We evaluate our investments for other-than-temporary  decline in value. This may
exist when the fair value of an  investment  security has been below the current
value for an extended  period of time. As most of our investments are carried at
fair value, if an other-than-temporary  decline in value is determined to exist,
the  unrealized  investment  loss  recorded  net  of tax  in  accumulated  other
comprehensive  income is realized  as a charge to net  income,  in the period in
which the other  -than-temporary  decline in value is determined.  During fiscal
2002, we recognized  $60.1  million for an  other-than-temporary  decline in the
value of certain investments. While we believe that we have accurately estimated
the amount of other-than-temporary decline in value in our portfolio,  different
assumptions  could  result in changes to the recorded  amounts in our  financial
statements.

LOSS CONTINGENCIES

We are involved in various lawsuits and claims  encountered in the normal course
of business. When such a matter arises and periodically  thereafter,  we consult
with our legal  counsel and  evaluate the merits of the claim based on the facts
available at that time. In management's  opinion,  an adequate  accrual has been
made as of  September  30,  2002 to provide  for any losses  that may arise from
these matters.

SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES

Special purpose entities ("SPEs") consist of corporations,  trusts, partnerships
and other entities that are  established  for a limited  purpose.  In the United
States, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has currently undertaken
a project to address accounting for SPEs. We will continue to monitor the FASB's
project to determine the effect, if any, it will have on our treatment of any of
the SPEs described below.

LIGHTNING FINANCE COMPANY LIMITED. We finance certain DCA arising from our U.S.,
Canadian  and  European  operations  through  LFL, a company in which we have an
ownership  interest.  In the United  States,  LFL has  entered  into a financing
agreement  with our U.S.  distribution  subsidiary  and we maintain a continuing
interest  in the assets  until  resold by LFL.  As a result,  we retain DCA sold
under the U.S.  agreement in our financial  statements and amortize them over an
8-year period, until resold by LFL in a securitization.  In contrast to the U.S.
arrangement,  LFL has  entered  into direct  agreements  with the  Canadian  and
European  sponsored  investment  products,  and we do not  record DCA from these
sources in our financial statements.

AUTO LOAN  SECURITIZATION  TRUSTS. We have entered into auto loan securitization
transactions   with  a  number  of  qualified   SPEs  and  have  recorded  these
transactions as sales. In addition, we retained interest-only strips receivable,
representing our contractual right to receive interest and other cash flows from
the pool of securitized  loans after payment of required  amounts to the holders
of  the  securities  and  certain  costs  associated  with  the  securitization.
Interest-only  strips are valued based on the present value of estimated  future
cash flows.

LESSOR TRUST. We lease our corporate headquarters in San Mateo,  California from
a lessor  trust  under an  operating  lease that  expires in fiscal  2005,  with
additional renewal options for a further period of up to 10 years. In connection
with this lease, we are contingently  liable for  approximately  $145 million in
residual  guarantees,  representing  approximately 85% of the total construction
costs of $170  million.  The lease  agreement is not expected to impact our cash
flows or  financial  condition  materially  during the initial  five-year  lease
period.   The  lease  is  treated  as  an  operating   lease,  as  none  of  the
capitalization criteria under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.13,
"Accounting for Leases", were met at the inception of the lease.

COLLATERALIZED DEBT OBLIGATIONS.  We provide investment  management services to,
and have made investments in, a number of Collateralized Debt Obligation ("CDO")
SPEs. These CDOs were established as a vehicle for our clients and invest mainly
in debt  instruments.  Our ownership  interest in the CDOs is not  sufficient to
meet  consolidation  requirements and they are reported at fair value as further
described in Note 1 to the financial statements.

RISK FACTORS

"FORWARD-LOOKING  STATEMENTS". When used in this Annual Report, words or phrases
about  the  future  such  as  "expected  to,"  "will  continue,"  "anticipates,"
"estimates," or similar expressions are "forward-looking  statements" as defined
in the Private  Securities  Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Statements about our
future cash needs,  our anticipated uses of cash, the expected sources of future
cash  inflows,  and the  anticipated  costs  related to the  September  11, 2001
tragedy,  are also  "forward-looking  statements." These types of statements are
subject to certain risks and uncertainties, such as the factors described in the
risk  factors  outlined  below.  These risks and  uncertainties  could cause our
actual  results to differ  materially  from those  reflected in  forward-looking
statements.  Forward-looking statements are our best prediction at the time that
they are made,  and you should  not rely on them.  Rather,  you should  read the
forward-looking  statements in  conjunction  with the risk  disclosures  in this
Annual Report. If a circumstance  occurs that causes any of our  forward-looking
statements to be  inaccurate,  we have no  obligation  to announce  publicly the
change in our expectations, or to revise the forward-looking statements.

WE FACE STRONG  COMPETITION  FROM NUMEROUS AND SOMETIMES  LARGER  COMPANIES.  We
compete with  numerous  investment  management  companies,  stock  brokerage and
investment  banking  firms,   insurance  companies,   banks,  savings  and  loan
associations and other financial institutions.  Continuing  consolidation in the
financial  services  industry  has created  stronger  competitors  with  greater
financial   resources   and  broader   distribution   channels   than  our  own.
Additionally,  competing  securities dealers whom we rely upon to distribute our
mutual  funds also sell their own  proprietary  funds and  investment  products,
which could limit the  distribution  of our investment  products.  To the extent
that existing or potential customers,  including  securities dealers,  decide to
invest  in or  distribute  the  products  of our  competitors,  the sales of our
products as well as our market share, revenues and net income could decline.

CHANGES  IN THE  DISTRIBUTION  CHANNELS  ON WHICH WE  DEPEND  COULD  REDUCE  OUR
REVENUES AND HINDER OUR GROWTH.  We derive  nearly all of our fund sales through
broker/dealers and other similar investment advisors. Increasing competition for
these distribution  channels has caused our distribution costs to rise and could
cause further increases in the future.  Higher  distribution costs lower our net
revenues and earnings.  Additionally, if one of the major financial advisors who
distribute  our  products  were to  cease  their  operations,  it  could  have a
significant adverse impact on our revenues and earnings.  Moreover,  our failure
to maintain strong business  relationships  with these advisors would impair our
ability to distribute and sell our products,  which would have a negative effect
on our level of assets under  management,  related revenues and overall business
and financial condition.

WE HAVE BECOME SUBJECT TO AN INCREASED RISK OF ASSET  VOLATILITY FROM CHANGES IN
THE GLOBAL EQUITY MARKETS.  We have become subject to an increased risk of asset
volatility from changes in the domestic and global  financial and equity markets
due to the  continuing  threat of terrorism and the recent reports of accounting
irregularities  at certain  public  companies.  Declines in these  markets  have
caused in the past, and would cause in the future,  a decline in our revenue and
income.

THE LEVELS OF OUR ASSETS UNDER  MANAGEMENT,  WHICH IN TURN IMPACT REVENUES,  ARE
SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT FLUCTUATIONS.  Global economic conditions, changes in the
equity market place, interest rates,  inflation rates, the yield curve and other
factors that are difficult to predict  affect the mix,  market values and levels
of our assets under management.  Changing market conditions may cause a shift in
our asset mix towards fixed-income products and a related decline in our revenue
and income, since we generally derive higher fee revenues and income from equity
assets than from  fixed-income  products we manage.  Similarly,  our securitized
consumer receivables business is subject to marketplace fluctuation.

WE  FACE  RISKS  ASSOCIATED  WITH  CONDUCTING  OPERATIONS  IN  NUMEROUS  FOREIGN
COUNTRIES.  We sell  mutual  funds and offer  investment  advisory  and  related
services in many different regulatory jurisdictions around the world, and intend
to  continue  to expand  our  operations  internationally.  Regulators  in these
jurisdictions  could  change  their  policies  or laws in a  manner  that  might
restrict or otherwise  impede our ability to distribute  or register  investment
products in their respective markets.

<PAGE>

OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE THE WIDELY VARIED SEGMENTS OF OUR BUSINESS
CAN BE IMPEDED BY SYSTEMS AND OTHER  TECHNOLOGICAL  LIMITATIONS.  Our  continued
success in effectively managing and growing our business globally depends on our
ability to integrate the varied accounting, financial and operational systems of
our international business with that of our domestic business.

OUR  INABILITY TO MEET CASH NEEDS COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE  EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND BUSINESS  OPERATIONS.  Our ability to meet  anticipated cash needs
depends  upon  factors  including  our  asset  value,  our  creditworthiness  as
perceived by lenders and the market value of our stock.  Similarly,  our ability
to securitize and hedge future loan portfolios and credit card receivables,  and
to obtain continued  financing for Class B and C shares,  is also subject to the
market's perception of those assets,  finance rates offered by competitors,  and
the general  market for private debt. If we are unable to obtain these funds and
financing,  we may be forced to incur unanticipated costs or revise our business
plans.

WE FACE COMPETITION IN HIRING AND RETAINING QUALIFIED  EMPLOYEES.  Our continued
success will depend upon our ability to attract and retain qualified  personnel.
If we are not able to  attract  and  retain  qualified  employees,  our  overall
business condition and revenues could suffer.

OUR  EMERGING  MARKET   PORTFOLIOS  AND  RELATED   REVENUES  ARE  VULNERABLE  TO
MARKET-SPECIFIC POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC RISKS. Our emerging market portfolios and
revenues derived from managing these portfolios are subject to significant risks
of loss from  political  and  diplomatic  developments,  currency  fluctuations,
social   instability,    changes   in   governmental   polices,   expropriation,
nationalization,  asset  confiscation  and  changes  in  legislation  related to
foreign ownership. Foreign trading markets, particularly in some emerging market
countries are often smaller,  less liquid, less regulated and significantly more
volatile than the U.S. and other established markets.

DIVERSE AND STRONG  COMPETITION  LIMITS THE INTEREST RATES THAT WE CAN CHARGE ON
CONSUMER LOANS.  We compete with many types of institutions  for consumer loans,
which  can  provide  loans  at  significantly  below-market  interest  rates  in
connection with automobile sales. Our inability to compete  effectively  against
these  companies or to maintain our  relationships  with the various  automobile
dealers  through  whom we offer  consumer  loans  could  limit the growth of our
consumer loan business.  Economic and credit market  downturns  could reduce the
ability of our  customers  to repay loans,  which could cause our consumer  loan
portfolio losses to increase.

THE  SEPTEMBER  11, 2001 WORLD TRADE  CENTER  TRAGEDY MAY  ADVERSELY  AFFECT OUR
ABILITY TO ACHIEVE THE BENEFITS WE EXPECT FROM THE ACQUISITION OF FIDUCIARY. The
September 11, 2001 tragedy at the World Trade Center resulted in the destruction
of our Fiduciary headquarters, loss of 87 of our employees, additional operating
expenses to re-establish and relocate our operations,  and asset write-offs, all
of which could adversely  affect or delay our ability to achieve the anticipated
benefits from the acquisition.  Our insurance  coverage may not cover all losses
on claims for  property,  damage,  extra  expenses  and  business  interruptions
arising out of the  destruction of the World Trade Center.  For the next several
years,  insurance costs are likely to increase materially and we may not be able
to obtain the same types or amounts of coverage.

THE FIDUCIARY  ACQUISITION COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR COMBINED FINANCIAL RESULTS
OR THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. If the benefits of the acquisition over
time do not exceed the costs  associated  with the  acquisition,  including  any
dilution to our shareholders resulting from the issuance of shares in connection
with the acquisition, our financial results, including earnings per share, could
be  adversely  affected.  Revenue and cost  synergies  from the  acquisition  of
Fiduciary  may not be  fully  realized  and may  take  longer  to  realize  than
originally anticipated.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO FEDERAL  RESERVE  BOARD  REGULATION.  Upon  completion  of our
acquisition  of  Fiduciary,  we became a bank  holding  company  and a financial
holding company subject to the supervision and regulation of the Federal Reserve
Board. We are subject to the restrictions,  limitations,  or prohibitions of the
Bank  Holding  Company Act of 1956 and the  Gramm-Leach  Bliley Act. The Federal
Reserve  Board  may  impose  additional   limitations  or  restrictions  on  our
activities,  including if the Federal Reserve Board believes that we do not have
the  appropriate  financial and  managerial  resources to commence or conduct an
activity or

make an  acquisition.  The  Federal  Reserve  Board  may also  take  actions  as
appropriate to enforce applicable federal law.

TECHNOLOGY  AND OPERATING  RISK COULD  CONSTRAIN OUR  OPERATIONS.  We are highly
dependent on the integrity of our  technology,  operating  systems and premises.
Although we have in place certain  disaster  recovery  plans,  we may experience
system  delays  and  interruptions  as a  result  of  natural  disasters,  power
failures,  acts of war, and third party failures,  which could negatively impact
our operations.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

In the normal course of business,  our  financial  position is subject to market
risk: the potential  loss due to changes in the value of  investments  resulting
from adverse changes in interest rates,  foreign  exchange and/or equity prices.
Management is responsible for managing this risk. Our Risk Management  Committee
is  responsible  for  providing a framework  to assist  management  to identify,
assess and manage market and other risks.

We are exposed to changes in interest rates mainly through our debt transactions
and portfolio debt holdings available-for-sale,  which are carried at fair value
in our financial statements.  As of September 30, 2002, a significant percentage
of our  outstanding  debt is at fixed  interest  rates.  In our  banking/finance
operating  segment,  we monitor  the net  interest  rate  margin and the average
maturity of interest earning assets, as well as funding sources. In addition, we
have  considered  the  potential  impact of the  effect  on the  banking/finance
operating   segment,   our   outstanding   debt  and  portfolio  debt  holdings,
individually  and  collectively,  of a 100 basis  point (1%)  movement in market
interest rates. We do not expect this change would have a material impact on our
operating revenues or results of operations in either scenario.

We are also exposed to equity price fluctuations through securities we hold that
are carried at fair  value.  To mitigate  this risk,  we maintain a  diversified
investment portfolio.

We operate  mainly in the United  States,  but also  provide  services  and earn
revenues  in Canada,  the  Bahamas,  Europe,  Asia,  South  America,  Africa and
Australia.  A significant  portion of these  revenues and  associated  expenses,
however,  are denominated in U.S.  dollars.  Therefore,  our exposure to foreign
currency fluctuations in our revenues and expenses is not material at this time.
This  situation  may  change in the  future as our  business  continues  to grow
outside the United States.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

We derive the majority of our revenues and net income from providing  investment
management,  administration,  distribution and related services to the Franklin,
Templeton, Mutual Series, Fiduciary Trust and Bissett funds, institutional, high
net-worth and other investment products (our "Sponsored  Investment  Products").
Services to our Sponsored  Investment Products are provided under contracts that
set forth the level and nature of the fees to be charged for these services. The
majority of our  revenues  relate to mutual fund  products  which are subject to
contracts  that are  periodically  reviewed and  approved by each mutual  fund's
Board of  Directors/Trustees  and/or  its  shareholders.  Currently,  no  single
Sponsored  Investment  Product's  revenues  represent  more  than  10% of  total
revenues.

BASIS OF  PRESENTATION.  The consolidated  financial  statements are prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of
America,  which require us to estimate some amounts.  Actual  amounts may differ
from these  estimates.  Certain  comparative  amounts  for prior years have been
reclassified to conform to the fiscal 2002 financial statement presentation.

The  consolidated   financial   statements  include  the  accounts  of  Franklin
Resources,  Inc.  and  its  majority-owned   subsidiaries  ("Franklin  Templeton
Investments").  All material  intercompany  accounts and transactions  have been
eliminated   except   that  we  have  not   eliminated   the   Receivable   from
banking/finance group and Payable to parent from our Consolidated Balance Sheets
which  represent  balances   outstanding  related  to  the  funding  of  banking
activities,  including  auto and credit card loan  financing.  In addition,  the
related intercompany  interest expense is included in Other, net revenue and the
intercompany  interest  income is included in Investment and other income in our
Consolidated   Statements  of  Income,  see  Note  9.  This  treatment  provides
additional information on funding sources available to the banking/finance group
and on its operations.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS include cash on hand, demand deposits with banks, debt
instruments  with  original  maturities of three months or less and other highly
liquid investments,  including money market funds, which are readily convertible
into cash.

INVESTMENT SECURITIES, AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE are carried at fair value. Fair values
for  investments  in our  Sponsored  Investment  Products  are based on the last
reported net asset  value.  Fair values for other  investments  are based on the
last reported price on the exchange on which they are traded. Realized gains and
losses  are  included  in  investment   income   currently   based  on  specific
identification.  Unrealized  gains and losses are recorded net of tax as part of
accumulated other comprehensive income until realized.

When the cost of an investment  exceeds its fair value, we review the investment
for an  other-than-temporary  decline in value. In making the  determination  of
whether the decline is  other-than-temporary,  we use a  systematic  methodology
that includes  consideration  of the duration and extent to which the fair value
is less than cost, the financial  condition of the investee,  including industry
and sector performance,  and our intent and ability to hold the investment. When
a decline in fair value of an  available-for-sale  security is  determined to be
other-than-temporary,  the  unrealized  loss recorded net of tax in  Accumulated
other comprehensive income is realized as a charge to Net income.

DERIVATIVES.  We do not  hold or  issue  derivative  financial  instruments  for
trading purposes.  Periodically,  we enter into interest-rate swap agreements to
reduce  variable  interest-rate  exposure with respect to our commercial  paper,
designated  as cash flow hedges,  and to hedge  exposures or modify the interest
rate  characteristics of fixed-rate  borrowings with maturities in excess of one
year,  designated  as fair value  hedges.  As of  September  30,  2002,  we held
interest rate swaps with a total  notional  amount of $43 million and these were
reported at their fair value of $2.7 million.

We periodically  enter into spot and forward currency  contracts as principal to
facilitate client transactions and, on limited occasions,  hold currency options
for our own account.  It is our policy that  substantially all forward contracts
be  covered  no later than the close of  business  each day.  Gains or losses on
these  contracts

                                       48

are reflected in the  Consolidated  Statements of Income.  The gross fair market
value of all contracts outstanding that had a positive fair market value totaled
$2.7 million at September  30, 2002.  This  represents a credit  exposure to the
extent that  counterparties fail to settle their contractual  obligations.  This
risk is mitigated by the use of master netting agreements,  careful valuation of
counterparty credit standings, diversification and limits.

We occasionally  sell put options over our common stock.  During fiscal 2002, we
sold put options giving the purchaser the right to sell up to 3.5 million shares
of our common  stock to us at specified  prices upon  exercise of the options if
certain  conditions are met. We received premiums of approximately  $7.0 million
that were recorded in stockholders' equity as Capital in excess of par value. At
September 30, 2002, 3 million  common stock put options were  outstanding,  with
designated expiration dates in January, March, June and July of 2003.

LOANS RECEIVABLE.  Our banking/finance  group offers retail-banking and consumer
lending services.  We accrue interest on loans using the simple interest method.
The majority of retail-banking  loans are at variable rates,  which are adjusted
periodically.

ALLOWANCE  FOR LOAN LOSSES.  An allowance  for loan losses on our consumer  loan
portfolio is maintained at a level sufficient to absorb probable losses inherent
in the loan  portfolio.  Probable  losses are  estimated  for the consumer  loan
portfolio   based  on  contractual   delinquency   status  and  historical  loss
experience.  The  allowance  on our consumer  portfolio  is based on  aggregated
portfolio segment evaluations, generally by loan type, and reflects our judgment
of  portfolio  risk  factors  such as economic  conditions,  bankruptcy  trends,
product  mix,  geographic  concentrations  and other  similar  items.  A loan is
charged to the allowance for loan losses when it is deemed to be  uncollectible,
taking into consideration the value of the collateral,  the financial  condition
of the borrower and other factors. Recoveries on loans previously charged-off as
uncollectible  are credited to the allowance for loan losses.  The allowance for
loan  losses on our auto  loan  portfolio  includes  a  portion  of  acquisition
discounts from our purchase of automobile  installment loan contracts,  commonly
referred to as dealer holdbacks.  This allocation represents our estimate of the
losses expected over the life of the loan.

We have not recorded  allowance for possible  loan losses on our  retail-banking
loans and advances as these loans are generally  payable on demand and are fully
secured  by assets  under our  custody.  Advances  on  customers'  accounts  are
generally  secured  or  subject to rights of offset  and,  consistent  with past
experience, no loan losses are anticipated.

Past due loans 90 days or more in both our consumer  lending and  retail-banking
portfolios are reviewed  individually to determine whether they are collectible.
If warranted,  after  considering  collateral level and other factors,  loans 90
days past due are placed on non-accrual status.

INVESTMENTS, OTHER  include  investments  that we intend to hold for a period in
excess of one year.

Investments  are  accounted  for using the equity method of accounting if we are
able to exercise  significant  influence,  but not control,  over the  investee.
Significant  influence  is  generally  considered  to  exist  when an  ownership
interest in the voting  stock of the  investee is between 20% and 50%,  although
other factors,  such as  representation on the investee's Board of Directors and
the impact of commercial arrangements are also considered in determining whether
the equity method of accounting is  appropriate.  Lower  thresholds are used for
our investments in limited  partnerships  in determining  whether we are able to
exercise  significant  influence.  Companies  in which we hold in  excess of 50%
ownership interest are consolidated in our financial statements.

Investments  are  accounted  for  under  the cost  method  if we are not able to
exercise  significant  influence  over the investee.  In addition,  investments,
other  include debt  instruments  carried at fair value in  accordance  with our
treatment  of   investment   securities,   available-for-sale.   These   include
collateralized  debt  obligations  ("CDOs")  which are valued based on cash flow
projections.

                                       49
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<PAGE>

Investments, other are adjusted for other-than-temporary declines in value. When
a decline in fair value of an investment  carried at fair value is determined to
be other-than-temporary,  the unrealized loss recorded net of tax in Accumulated
other  comprehensive  income is realized as charge to net income. When a decline
in  fair  value  of  an   investment   carried  at  cost  is  determined  to  be
other-than-temporary,  the investment is written down to fair value and the loss
in value is included in earnings.

DEFERRED  SALES  COMMISSIONS.  Sales  commissions  paid  to  brokers  and  other
investment  advisors in  connection  with the sale of shares of our mutual funds
sold without a front-end sales charge are capitalized and amortized over periods
not  exceeding  eight years - the periods in which we estimate that they will be
recovered from  distribution  plan payments and from  contingent  deferred sales
charges.

PROPERTY  AND  EQUIPMENT  are  recorded  at  cost  and  are  depreciated  on the
straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.  Expenditures for repairs
and  maintenance  are charged to expense when  incurred.  We amortize  leasehold
improvements on the straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives or the
lease term, whichever is shorter.

SOFTWARE  DEVELOPED FOR INTERNAL USE. Some internal and external  costs incurred
in  connection  with  developing  or  obtaining  software  for  internal use are
capitalized. These capitalized costs are included in Property and equipment, net
on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and are amortized beginning when the software
project  is  complete  and the  application  is put  into  production,  over the
estimated useful life of the software.

INTANGIBLE  ASSETS  AND  GOODWILL.  Intangible  assets  consist  mainly  of  the
estimated value of mutual fund management  contracts and customer base resulting
from our  acquisition of the assets and  liabilities  of Templeton,  Galbraith &
Hansberger  Ltd. in October 1992 and Heine  Securities  Corporation  in November
1996, as well as the purchase of the following companies:

*    Bissett and Associates  Investment  Management Ltd.  ("Bissett") in October
     2000;
*    Fiduciary Trust Company International ("Fiduciary") in April 2001; and
*    Pioneer ITI AMC Limited in July 2002.

We amortize intangible assets over their estimated useful lives,  ranging from 5
to 15 years, using the straight-line  method,  unless the asset is determined to
have an indefinite useful life. Amounts assigned to indefinite-lived  intangible
assets mainly represent the value of contracts to manage mutual fund assets, for
which there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period.

Goodwill  represents  the excess  cost of a business  acquisition  over the fair
value of the net assets  acquired.  In  accordance  with  Statement of Financial
Accounting  Standards No. 142,  "Goodwill and Other  Intangible  Assets"  ("SFAS
142"), indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized.

We review  intangible assets and goodwill at least annually to determine whether
the  value  of  the  assets  is  impaired  and  the  amortization   periods  are
appropriate. If an asset is impaired, the difference between the carrying amount
of the asset reflected on the financial statements and its current fair value is
recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs.

Intangible  assets subject to  amortization  are reviewed for impairment at each
reporting period on the basis of the expected future undiscounted operating cash
flows without interest  charges to be derived from these assets.  For intangible
assets with  indefinite  lives,  fair value is determined  based on  anticipated
discounted  cash flows.  Goodwill is impaired  when the  carrying  amount of the
reporting  unit  exceeds  the  implied  fair  value of the  reporting  unit.  In
estimating  the fair value of the reporting  unit,  we use valuation  techniques
based on  discounted  cash flows  similar to models  employed in  analyzing  the
purchase  price of an  acquisition  target.  Goodwill  has been  assigned to our
investment  management operating segment. See Note 8 for additional  information
regarding intangible assets and goodwill.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<PAGE>

DEMAND AND INTEREST BEARING DEPOSITS.  The fair value of demand deposits are, by
definition,  equal to their carrying amounts. The interest-bearing  deposits are
variable rate and short-term and,  therefore,  the carrying amounts  approximate
their fair values.

REVENUES. We recognize investment  management fees,  shareholder servicing fees,
investment  income and  distribution  fees as  earned,  over the period in which
services are rendered.  Investment  management  fees are  determined  based on a
percentage of assets under management. Shareholder servicing fees are calculated
based on the number of accounts  serviced.  We record  underwriting  commissions
related to the sale of shares of our Sponsored  Investment Products on the trade
date.

ADVERTISING  AND  PROMOTION.  We expense costs of  advertising  and promotion as
incurred.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION. Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are
translated at current exchange rates as of the end of the accounting period, and
related revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates in effect
during the period.  Net exchange gains and losses resulting from translation are
excluded from income and are recorded as part of Accumulated other comprehensive
income.  Foreign currency  transaction  gains and losses are reflected in income
currently.

DIVIDENDS.  For the years ended  September 30, 2002,  2001 and 2000, we declared
dividends to common stockholders of $0.28, $0.26 and $0.24 per share.

STOCK-BASED  COMPENSATION.  As allowed  under the  provisions  of  Statement  of
Financial   Accounting   Standards   No.  123,   "Accounting   for   Stock-Based
Compensation" ("SFAS 123"), we have elected to apply Accounting Principles Board
Opinion  No.  25,  "Accounting  for Stock  Issued  to  Employees,"  and  related
interpretations  in  accounting  for  our  stock-based  plans.  Accordingly,  no
compensation costs are recognized with respect to stock options granted, or with
respect to shares issued under the Employee Stock  Investment Plan. We recognize
compensation expense for the matching  contribution that we may elect to make in
connection  with the Employee Stock  Investment  Plan over the 18-month  holding
period and for the full cost of  restricted  stock  grants in the year that they
are earned.

ACCUMULATED  OTHER   COMPREHENSIVE   INCOME  is  reported  in  our  consolidated
statements  of  stockholders' equity and  includes net income,  minimum  pension
liability  adjustment,   unrealized  gains  (losses)  on  investment  securities
available-for-sale, net of income taxes and currency translation adjustments.

The changes in net unrealized  gains (losses) on investment  securities  include
reclassification  adjustments  relating to the net realized gains on the sale of
investment  securities  of $5.7 million,  $34.2 million and $9.9 million  during
fiscal 2002,  2001 and 2000.  The tax effect of the change in  unrealized  gains
(losses) on investment  securities was $(1.7) million,  $(18.4) million and $7.1
million during fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000.

NOTE 2 - ACQUISITIONS

On July 26, 2002, our 75% owned subsidiary,  Templeton Asset Management  (India)
Private  Limited,  acquired all of the issued and outstanding  shares of Pioneer
ITI AMC  Limited  ("Pioneer"),  an Indian


                                       51
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<PAGE>

investment  management  company with  approximately $0.8 billion in assets under
management  as of the purchase  date.  This all-cash  transaction  was valued at
approximately $55.4 million.  Our consolidated  financial statements include the
operating results of Pioneer from July 26, 2002. We recognized goodwill of $38.7
million and  indefinite-lived  management  contracts of $13.1  million from this
acquisition.

On April 10, 2001, we acquired Fiduciary. Each share of Fiduciary's common stock
was exchanged  for 2.7744 shares of our common stock,  resulting in the issuance
in the aggregate of  approximately  20,187,000  shares of our common stock.  The
value of the shares issued in exchange for Fiduciary  was  approximately  $775.8
million.  We  accounted  for this  transaction  using  the  purchase  method  of
accounting.  The excess of the purchase price,  including our acquisition costs,
over the fair value of the net assets  acquired  resulted  in goodwill of $559.5
million. Net assets acquired included $235.5 million of other intangible assets.
As of  September  30, 2001,  we wrote off the net  intangible  asset  related to
Fiduciary's  headquarters lease of $8.2 million as a result of the September 11,
2001 terrorist  attack.  See Note 20. The estimated life of the other intangible
assets is 15 years.

On October 2, 2000,  we  acquired  all of the issued and  outstanding  shares of
Bissett,  a Canadian asset  management  company.  The all-cash  transaction  was
valued at approximately  $95 million.  Intangible  assets of  approximately  $89
million with lives  ranging from 15 to 40 years were recorded as a result of the
acquisition.  We accounted for this transaction  using the purchase method.  Our
consolidated  financial statements include the operating results of Bissett from
October 2, 2000.

We have  not  presented  proforma  combined  results  of  operations  for  these
acquisitions,  because the results of operations as reported in the accompanying
consolidated statements of income would not have been materially different.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</TABLE>

When  we  sell  auto  loans  in  a  securitization  transaction,  we  record  an
interest-only  strip  receivable,  representing our contractual right to receive
interest and other cash flows from the pool of  securitized  loans after payment
of  required  amounts  to  the  holders  of the  securities  and  certain  costs
associated with the  securitization.  The gross sales proceeds  include the fair
value of the interest-only strips.

We generally  estimate fair value based on the present value of future  expected
cash flows.  The key assumptions  used in the present value  calculations of our
securitization transactions at the date of securitization were as follows:

<TABLE>

                                                         2002               2001              2000
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<S>                                                     <C>                <C>               <C>
Excess cash flow discount rate (annual rate)              12%                12%               12%
Cumulative life loss rate                               3.30%              3.53%             3.00%
Pre-payment speed assumption (average   monthly rate)   1.75%              1.50%             1.50%
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</TABLE>

We  determined  these  assumptions  using  data  from  comparable  transactions,
historical   information  and   management's   estimate.   Interest-only   strip
receivables  are  generally  restricted  assets and subject to limited  recourse
provisions.  The carrying value of the  interest-only  strips  included in other
banking/finance  assets as of  September  30,  2002 was $29.1  million and as of
September 30, 2001 was $10.8 million.

                                       55
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<PAGE>

We  generally  estimate  the fair  value  of the  interest-only  strips  at each
period-end based on the present value of future expected cash flows,  consistent
with the methodology used at the date of securitization.

The following shows the sensitivity of the  interest-only  strip  receivables at
September 30, 2002 and 2001 to adverse  changes in the key economic  assumptions
used to measure fair value, which are hypothetical:

This  sensitivity  analysis  shows  the  hypothetical  effect of a change in the
assumptions  used  to  determine  the  fair  value  of the  interest-only  strip
receivable.   Actual  future  market   conditions  may  differ   materially  and
accordingly,  these  forward-looking  statements  should not be  considered  our
projections of future events or losses.

With   respect  to   retained   servicing   responsibilities   relating  to  the
securitization  trusts,  we receive  annual  servicing fees ranging from 1.0% to
2.0% of the loans securitized.  We also receive the rights to future cash flows,
if any,  arising after the investors in the  securitization  trust have received
their contracted return.

The   following  is  a  summary  of  cash  flows   received  from  and  paid  to
securitization trusts during fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000:

We  adopted  SFAS 142 on  October  1,  2001.  SFAS  142  addresses  the  initial
recognition  and measurement of intangible  assets  acquired  outside a business
combination and the recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangible
assets   after   acquisition.   Under  the  new   standard,   all  goodwill  and
indefinite-lived  intangible  assets,  including  those acquired  before initial
application  of the  standard,  will not be  amortized

but will be tested for impairment at least annually.  Accordingly, on October 1,
2001,  we ceased  amortization  on goodwill and  indefinite-lived  assets.  This
resulted in the following amortization expense reduction:

All of our goodwill and  intangible  assets,  including  those  arising from the
purchase  of  Fiduciary  in April  2001,  relate  to our  investment  management
operating  segment.  Indefinite-lived  intangible  assets represent the value of
management contracts with our Sponsored Investment Products. The following table

As of March 31,  2002,  we  completed  the  impairment  testing of goodwill  and
indefinite-lived intangible assets under the guidance set out in SFAS 142 and we
determined   that  there  was  no  impairment  in  the  value  of  goodwill  and
indefinite-lived assets recorded in our books and records as of October 1, 2001.

NOTE 9 - SEGMENT INFORMATION

We have two operating segments:  investment  management and banking/finance.  We
based our operating segment selection process primarily on services offered. The
investment  management segment derives substantially all of its revenues and net
income from providing investment advisory, fund administration, distribution and
related  services to our  Sponsored  Investment  Products.  The  banking/finance
segment  offers  consumer  lending  and  selected   retail-banking  services  to
individuals.

Financial  information  for our two  operating  segments  for  the  years  ended
September  30, 2002,  2001 and 2000 is  presented in the table below.  Operating
revenues of the banking/finance segment are reported net of interest expense and
provision for loan losses.

Inter-segment  interest  payments  from  the  banking/finance   segment  to  the
investment  management  segment  are based on  market  rates  prevailing  at the
inception of each loan. As further described in Note 1,  inter-segment  interest
income and expense are not eliminated in our Consolidated  Statements of Income.
The investment  management segment incurs  substantially all of our depreciation
and amortization costs and expenditures on long-lived assets.

We conduct operations in the following principal  geographic areas of the world:
the United States, Canada, the Bahamas,  Europe, Asia, South America, Africa and
Australia. For segment reporting purposes, we have

                                       59

In May 2001,  we received  approximately  $490 million in net proceeds  from the
sale of $877 million  principal  amount at maturity of  zero-coupon  convertible
senior notes due 2031 (the "Convertible  Notes").  The Convertible  Notes, which
were offered to qualified  institutional  buyers only, carry an interest rate of
1.875% per annum, with an initial  conversion premium of 43%. Each of the $1,000
(principal  amount at maturity)  Convertible  Notes is  convertible  into 9.3604
shares of our common stock. We may redeem the  Convertible  Notes for cash on or
after  May 11,  2006 at their  accreted  value.  We may have to  repurchase  the
Convertible Notes at their accreted value, at the option of the holders,  on May
11 of 2003,  2004, 2006, 2011, 2016, 2021 and 2026. In this event, we may choose
to pay the purchase price in cash or shares of our common stock.

At September 30, 2002,  the amount  included in long-term debt in respect of the
Convertible Notes was $514.2 million including principal outstanding and accrued
interest.  In the maturity  schedule  above,  we have  classified this amount as
maturing  after  September  2007, as the final  maturity  date is May 2031.  The
amount of  convertible  notes that will be  redeemed  depends  on,  among  other
factors, the performance of our common stock.

At September  30,  2002,  approximately  $850 million was  available to us under
unused  commercial  paper and  medium-term  note programs and an additional $300
million was available under a shelf  registration  statement with the Securities
and Exchange  Commission  permitting the issuance of debt and equity securities.
We did not have any commercial paper  outstanding or medium-term notes issued at
September 30, 2002.

Our  committed  revolving  credit  facilities at September 30, 2002 totaled $420
million, of which, $210 million was under a 364-day facility. The remaining $210
million  facility  was under a five-year  facility and

facilities include various restrictive  covenants,  including:  a capitalization
ratio,  interest  coverage  ratio,  minimum  working  capital and limitations on
additional  debt.  In  addition,  our  Fiduciary  subsidiary  has  $350  million
available in uncommitted bank lines under the Federal Reserve Funds system.

During fiscal 2002, we recognized a $60.1 million  other-than-temporary  decline
in value of investments.  Substantially all of our dividend income was generated
by investments in our Sponsored Investment Products. We realized a gain of $32.9
million on the sale of our  former  headquarters  building  in San Mateo in July
2000. That gain was amortized over 12 months, the period of our leaseback on the
building.

At  September  30,  2002,  there were  approximately  $43 million of foreign net
operating loss carry-forwards, approximately $27 million of which expire between
2003 and 2010 with the remaining  carry-forwards  having an indefinite  life. In
addition,  there were  approximately  $725 million in state net  operating  loss
carry-forwards  that expire between 2003 and 2022. There were also approximately
$10 million in federal  foreign tax credit  carry-forwards  which will expire in
2004. A valuation  allowance has been recognized on some deferred tax assets due
to  the   uncertainty   of  realizing   the  benefit  of  the  loss  and  credit
carry-forwards.

We have  made no  provision  for U.S.  taxes on  $1,894  million  of  cumulative
undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as those earnings are intended to
be reinvested for an indefinite  period of time.  Determination of the potential
amount of  unrecognized  deferred  U.S.  income  tax  liability  related to such
reinvested  income  is  not  practicable  because  of the  numerous  assumptions
associated  with this  hypothetical  calculation;  however,  foreign tax credits
would be available to reduce some portion of this amount.

The  following  is a  reconciliation  between  the amount of tax  expense at the
Federal  statutory  rate and taxes on income as reflected in operations  for the
years ended September 30, 2002, 2001 and 2000:

NOTE 14 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

We lease office space and equipment under long-term operating leases expiring at
various dates through fiscal year 2017. Lease expense  aggregated $34.8 million,
$41.3 million and $43.1  million for the fiscal years ended  September 30, 2002,
2001 and 2000.  Future  minimum lease payments  under  non-cancelable  operating
leases are not material.

We are contingently liable for approximately $145 million in residual guarantees
under an operating  lease for our global  corporate  headquarters  in San Mateo,
California.  This represents about 85% of the total  construction  costs of $170
million.  The lease is  classified  as an  operating  lease under  Statement  of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 13, "Accounting for Leases".

We are  involved in various  claims and legal  proceedings  that are  considered
normal in our  business.  While it is not feasible to predict or  determine  the
final  outcome of these  proceedings,  we do not believe that they should have a
material  adverse  effect on our  financial  position,  results of operations or
liquidity.

In February  2001,  we signed an agreement to outsource  management  of our data
center and distributed  server operations.  Under the agreement,  we may end the
agreement  any time after March 2004 by  incurring  a  termination  charge.  The
maximum  termination charge payable depends on the termination date, the service
levels prior to our  termination  of the  agreement,  and costs incurred to wind
down the services.  Based on September 30, 2002 service levels, this termination
fee would approximate  $37.2 million.  We do not consider it likely that we will
incur  this  cost.  Under  the  terms  of the  agreement,  we must  also  pay an
additional transition charge of approximately $2.7 million in March 2003.

NOTE 15 - EMPLOYEE STOCK AWARD AND OPTION PLANS

We sponsor a Universal  Stock  Incentive  Plan ("USIP") and an Annual  Incentive
Compensation Plan ("AICP").  Under the terms of these plans,  eligible employees
may receive cash and stock awards based on the performance of Franklin Templeton
Investments  and that of the  individual  employee.  The USIP  provides  for the
issuance  of  up  to  26  million   shares  of  our  common  stock  for  various
stock-related  awards,  including those related to the AICP. As of September 30,
2002 and prior to  considering  fiscal 2002  grants,  we had  approximately  4.8
million shares  available for grant under the USIP,  including  those related to
the AICP.  In addition to the annual award of stock under the plan, we may award
options and other  forms of  stock-based  compensation  to some  employees.  The
Compensation  Committee  of the  Board of  Directors  determines  the  terms and
conditions of awards under the plans.  Total  compensation  cost  recognized for
stock-based  compensation  during fiscal 2002,  2001 and 2000 was $34.2 million,
$28.5 million and $28.9 million.

Information regarding stock options is as follows:

The range of exercise prices for these outstanding options at September 30, 2002

NOTE 16 - EMPLOYEE STOCK INVESTMENT PLAN

We have a qualified,  non-compensatory  Employee Stock  Investment Plan ("ESIP")
which allows participants who meet certain eligibility criteria to buy shares of
our common stock at 90% of their market value on defined dates. Our stockholders
approved 4 million  shares of common stock for issuance under the ESIP. The ESIP
is open to substantially  all employees of U.S.  subsidiaries and some employees
of non-U.S.  subsidiaries. At September 30, 2002, approximately 1,248,000 shares
had been  purchased on a cumulative  basis under the ESIP at a  weighted-average
price of $32.14.

In connection with the ESIP, we may, at our election, provide matching grants to
participants  in the ESIP of whole or  partial  shares  of common  stock.  While
reserving the right to change this determination, we have indicated that we will
provide one half-share for each share held by a participant for a minimum period
of 18 months.  We made our first  matching  grant in fiscal 2000.  During fiscal
2002, 2001, and 2000, we issued approximately  85,000,  81,000 and 84,000 shares
at an average market price of $35.47, $45.04 and $35.52.

NOTE 17 - OTHER COMPENSATION AND BENEFIT PLANS

Fiduciary has a noncontributory retirement plan (the "retirement plan") covering
substantially  all its  employees  who were  hired  before  our  acquisition  of
Fiduciary,  have attained age 21 and  completed  one year of service.  Fiduciary
also maintains a nonqualified  supplementary  executive retirement plan ("SERP")
to pay defined benefits that are in excess of limits imposed by Federal tax law,
to  participants  in the  retirement  plan  who  attain  age 55 and 10  years of
service.  In addition to these pension  retirement plans,  Fiduciary  sponsors a
defined benefit healthcare plan that provides  post-retirement  medical benefits
to  full-time

                                       65

Following the acquisition of Fiduciary,  we established an $85 million retention
pool aimed at retaining  key Fiduciary  employees,  under which  employees  will
receive  both  cash  payments  and  options.   Salaried   employees  who  remain
continuously employed through the applicable dates are eligible for compensation
under the  program.  Excluding  the value of options  granted,  the value of the
retention plan is $68 million,  and is being expensed over a period ranging from
one to five years.  We  expensed  $26 million and $24 million in fiscal 2002 and
2001,  including the acceleration of retention payments related to the September
11, 2001 events as described in Note 20.

NOTE 18 - FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The fair  value of a  financial  instrument  represents  the amount at which the
instrument could be exchanged in a current  transaction between willing parties,
other than in a forced sale or liquidation.  The methods and assumptions used to
estimate fair values of our financial  instruments are described below. See Note
1.

Due to the  short-term  nature and  liquidity of Cash and cash  equivalents  and
Receivables,  the carrying amounts of these assets in the  Consolidated  Balance
Sheets approximated fair value.

Investment  securities,  available-for-sale  are carried at fair market value as
required by generally accepted accounting principles.

Loans receivable,  net are valued using interest rates that consider the current
credit and interest rate risk inherent in the loans and the current economic and
lending conditions.  The amounts in the Consolidated Balance Sheets approximated
fair value.

Deposits of the banking/finance  segment are valued using interest rates offered
by comparable  institutions on deposits with similar remaining  maturities.  The
amounts in the Consolidated Balance Sheets approximated fair value.

                                       66
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<PAGE>

Interest-rate swap agreements and foreign exchange contracts are carried at fair
value.

Debt is valued using  publicly-traded debt with similar maturities,  credit risk
and interest rates.  The amounts in the Consolidated  Balance Sheet  approximate
fair values.

Guarantees and letters of credit have fair values based on the face value of the
underlying instrument.

NOTE 19 - BANKING REGULATORY RATIOS

Following the  acquisition  of Fiduciary in April 2001, we became a bank holding
company and a financial  holding company subject to various  regulatory  capital
requirements  administered  by the  federal  banking  agencies.  Failure to meet
minimum  capital  requirements  can  initiate  certain  mandatory,  and possibly
additional,  discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have
a direct material  effect on our financial  statements.  Under capital  adequacy
guidelines,  we must meet specific capital guidelines that involve  quantitative
measures of our assets,  liabilities,  and  certain  off-balance  sheet items as
calculated  under  regulatory  accounting  practices.  Our  capital  amounts and
classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about
components, risk weightings and other factors.

Quantitative  measures  established  by  regulation to ensure  capital  adequacy
require us to maintain a minimum  Tier 1 capital  and Tier 1 leverage  ratio (as
defined  in the  regulations),  as well as minimum  Tier 1 and Total  risk-based
capital ratios (as defined in the regulations).  Based on our calculations as of
September  30, 2002 and 2001,  we exceeded  the  capital  adequacy  requirements
applicable to us as listed below.

                                                                 MINIMUM FOR OUR

NOTE 20 - SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 EVENT

On September 11, 2001, the headquarters of our subsidiary company, Fiduciary, at
Two World Trade Center was destroyed in the  terrorist  attacks on New York City
(the  "September  11,  2001  Event").  We have  since  leased  office  space for
Fiduciary in midtown Manhattan,  to resume permanent  operations.  The following
table shows the financial  impact of the event  recognized at September 30, 2002
and 2001:

(in thousands)                                                                2002              2001
----------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------- ----------------
<S>                                                                        <C>               <C>
Cumulative September 11, 2001 costs recognized as of end of period         $64,853           $50,185
September 11, 2001 expense, net                                                 --             7,649
----------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------- ----------------
</TABLE>

Approximately  $19.9 million of the cumulative  estimated costs recognized as of
September 30, 2002 pertain to the  write-off of an  intangible  asset related to
leased office space and to the  write-off of property and equipment  lost in the
September  11,  2001  Event.  In  addition,  as of  September  30,  2002  we had
recognized a $16.5 million charge related to employee  benefit  expenses.  These
expenses include the acceleration of payments under the employee retention bonus
plan related to the acquisition of Fiduciary, and other payments made in respect
of  victims of the  tragedy.  Cumulative  insurance  proceeds  received  through
September  30, 2002 were $38.6  million and included  $28.6  million  related to
property  and  equipment.  At  September  30,  2002,  we were in the  process of
pursuing a number of additional claims with our insurance carriers.

NOTE 21 - NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

In  October  2001,   Statement  of  Financial   Accounting  Standards  No.  144,
"Accounting  for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived  Assets" ("SFAS 144"),
was issued. This statement addresses financial  accounting and reporting for the
impairment or disposal of long-lived  assets and broadens the definition of what
constitutes  a  discontinued  operation  and how the  results of a  discontinued
operation  are to be measured  and  presented.  The  provisions  of SFAS 144 are
effective  for  financial  statements  issued for fiscal years  beginning  after
December 15, 2001,  and we early adopted this  statement on October 1, 2001. The
impact of the adoption of SFAS 144 on our reported operating results,  financial
position and existing financial statement disclosure was not material.

In April 2002,  Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 145, "Rescission
of FASB  Statements  No. 4, 44, and 64,  Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and
Technical  Corrections" ("SFAS 145"), was issued. SFAS 145 rescinds Statement of
Financial   Accounting  Standards  No.  4,  "Reporting  Gains  and  Losses  from
Extinguishment  of Debt",  and an  amendment  of that  Statement,  Statement  of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 64,  "Extinguishments of Debt Made to Satisfy
Sinking-Fund  Requirements."  SFAS  145 also  rescinds  Statement  of  Financial
Accounting  Standards  No.  44,  "Accounting  for  Intangible  Assets  of  Motor
Carriers." SFAS 145 amends Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 13,
"Accounting  for  Leases," to eliminate  an  inconsistency  between the required
accounting for sale-leaseback  transactions and the required accounting for some
lease   modifications   that  have   economic   effects   that  are  similar  to
sale-leaseback  transactions.  SFAS 145 also amends other existing authoritative
pronouncements  to make various  technical  corrections,  clarify  meanings,  or
describe  their  applicability  under  changed  conditions.  This  statement  is
effective for financial  statements  issued for fiscal years beginning after May
15,  2002.  We believe  that the  adoption  of SFAS 145 will not have a material
impact on our results of operations or financial condition.

In June 2002,  Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 146 "Accounting
for Exit or Disposal  Activities"  ("SFAS 146"), was issued.  SFAS 146 addresses
significant  issues  regarding the  recognition,  measurement,  and reporting of
costs  that  are  associated  with  exit  and  disposal  activities,   including
restructuring  activities that are currently accounted for under Emerging Issues
Task Force ("EITF") Issue No. 94-3, "Liability  Recognition for Certain Employee
Termination  Benefits  and Other  Costs to Exit an Activity  (including  Certain
Costs Incurred in a  Restructuring)."  The scope of SFAS 146 also includes costs
related to  terminating a contract  that is not a capital lease and  termination
benefits that employees who are involuntarily terminated receive under the terms
of a one-time benefit  arrangement that is not an ongoing benefit arrangement or
an  individual  deferred-compensation  contract.  SFAS 146 will be effective for
exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002 but early
application is  encouraged.  The provisions of EITF Issue No. 94-3 will continue
to apply for an exit activity initiated under an exit plan that met the criteria
of EITF  Issue  No.  94-3  prior  to the  adoption  of SFAS  146.  Adopting  the
provisions of SFAS 146 will change,  on a prospective  basis, the timing of when
restructuring  charges are recorded from a commitment  date approach to when the
liability is incurred.  We intend to adopt the new standard effective October 1,
2002 and we do not expect this adoption to have a material impact on our results
of operations or financial condition.

In  October  2002,   Statement  of  Financial   Accounting   Standards   No.147,
"Acquisition of Certain Financial  Institutions"  ("SFAS 147"), was issued. This
statement,  which provides  guidance on the accounting for the  acquisition of a
financial  institution,  applies to all acquisitions except those between two or
more mutual  enterprises.  This statement is effective for financial  statements
issued for fiscal years  beginning after September 30, 2002. We believe that the
adoption  of SFAS  147  will  not  have a  material  impact  on our  results  of
operations or financial condition.

                        REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Franklin Resources, Inc.:

In our opinion,  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance sheets and the related
consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity and comprehensive income
and cash flows  present  fairly,  in all  material  respects,  the  consolidated
financial position of Franklin Resources, Inc. and its subsidiaries at September
30, 2002 and 2001, and the  consolidated  results of their  operations and their
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended  September  30, 2002,
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America.  These financial  statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management;  our  responsibility  is to express  an  opinion on these  financial
statements  based on our  audits.  We  conducted  our audits of these  financial
statements  in  accordance  with auditing  standards  generally  accepted in the
United  States of America,  which  require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable  assurance about whether the financial  statements are free of
material  misstatement.  An audit includes examining,  on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and  disclosures in the financial  statements,  assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall  financial  statement  presentation.  We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

ITEM 14. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

(a)  EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE  CONTROLS AND  PROCEDURES.  The Company  maintains
disclosure  controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in the Company's filings under the Securities  Exchange
Act of 1934 is recorded,  processed,  summarized and reported within the periods
specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such
information  is  accumulated  and  communicated  to  the  Company's  management,
including its principal  executive officer and principal  financial officer,  as
appropriate,  to allow  timely  decisions  regarding  required  disclosure.  The
Company's  management,   including  the  principal  executive  officer  and  the
principal financial officer, recognizes that any set of controls and procedures,
no matter how well designed and operated,  can provide only reasonable assurance
of achieving the desired control objectives.

Within 90 days prior to the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K,  the
Company  has  carried  out an  evaluation,  under the  supervision  and with the
participation  of the Company's  management,  including the Company's  principal
executive  officer  and  the  Company's  principal  financial  officer,  of  the
effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's  disclosure  controls
and procedures.  Based on such  evaluation,  the Company's  principal  executive
officer and principal financial officer concluded that the Company's  disclosure
controls and procedures are effective.

(b) CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS.  There have been no significant changes in the
Company's internal controls or in other factors that could significantly  affect
the internal  controls  subsequent to the date of their evaluation in connection
with the preparation of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
