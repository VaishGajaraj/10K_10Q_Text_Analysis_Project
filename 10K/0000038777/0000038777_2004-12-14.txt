FORWARD-LOOKING  STATEMENTS. In addition to historical information,  this Annual
Report on Form 10-K contains  forward-looking  statements that involve risks and
uncertainties,  including  the risk factors  explained  in the section  entitled
Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis of  Financial  Condition  and Results of
Operations  ("MD&A"),  that could cause our actual results to differ  materially
from  those  reflected  in the  forward-looking  statements.  When  used in this
report,  words or phrases about the future such as "expected to",  "could have",
"will  continue",   "anticipates",   "estimates"  or  similar   expressions  are
"forward-looking  statements"  as defined in the Private  Securities  Litigation
Reform  Act of  1995.  Statements  in MD&A and  elsewhere  in this  report  that
speculate about future events are "forward-looking statements".  Forward-looking
statements  are our best  prediction  at the time that  they are  made,  and you
should  not  rely on them.  If a  circumstance  occurs  that  causes  any of our
forward-looking  statements  to be  inaccurate,  we do not have an obligation to
announce publicly the change to our expectations, or to make any revision to the
forward-looking statements.

ITEM 1.   BUSINESS.

GENERAL

Franklin Resources,  Inc. ("FRI" or the "Company"),  is an investment management
company,  which is registered  as a bank holding  company under the Bank Holding
Company  Act of 1956,  as amended  (the "BHC Act"),  and as a financial  holding
company  under  the   Gramm-Leach-Bliley   Act  (the  "GLB  Act").  Through  our
wholly-owned direct and indirect subsidiary companies,  we provide a broad range
of investment advisory,  investment  management and related services to open-end
and closed-end  investment  companies (including our own family of retail mutual
funds),  institutional  accounts,  high  net-worth  families,   individuals  and
separate  accounts in the United  States (the "U.S.") and  internationally.  Our
"sponsored   investment   products"  include  a  broad  range  of  domestic  and
global/international equity, hybrid, fixed-income, and money market mutual funds
as well as other  investment  products,  which are sold to the public  under the
Franklin,  Templeton, Mutual Series, Bissett, Fiduciary Trust and Darby Overseas
brand names. As of September 30, 2004, we had $361.9 billion in assets under our
management  with  approximately  15.3  million  billable   shareholder  accounts
worldwide. In support of our primary business and operating segment,  investment
management, we also provide certain related services, including transfer agency,
fund administration,  distribution,  shareholder processing,  custodial, trustee
and other fiduciary  services.  In our secondary business and operating segment,
banking/finance, we provide clients with select retail-banking and consumer loan
services through our bank subsidiaries. The common stock of FRI is traded in the
U.S.  primarily  on the New York Stock  Exchange  (the  "NYSE")  and the Pacific
Exchange  under the ticker symbol "BEN" and under the ticker symbol "FRK" on the
London Stock Exchange,  and is included in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index.  The
term "Franklin(R)  Templeton(R) Investments" as used in this document, refers to
Franklin Resources, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.

COMPANY HISTORY AND ACQUISITIONS

Franklin  Templeton  Investments and its  predecessors  have been engaged in the
investment  management  business  since  1947.  Franklin  Resources,   Inc.  was
incorporated  in  Delaware  in  November  1969.  We  originated  our mutual fund
business with the Franklin  family of funds,  which is now known as the Franklin
Funds(R).  We expanded our business,  in part, by acquiring companies engaged in
the investment advisory and investment management business.

In October 1992, we acquired  substantially all of the assets and liabilities of
the  investment  adviser,  investment  management  and other  financial  service
businesses of Templeton,  Galbraith & Hansberger Ltd. This acquisition added the
Templeton  family of funds to our  Company.  The  Templeton  funds are known for
their  international  and  global  investment  objectives  and  value  style  of
investing.

In November 1996, we acquired certain assets and liabilities of Heine Securities
Corporation,  which provided investment  management services to various accounts
and  investment  companies,  including  Mutual  Series  Fund Inc.,  now known as
Franklin Mutual Series Fund Inc. ("Mutual Series").  The Mutual Series funds are
primarily value oriented equity funds.

We  expanded  our  business in Korea in July 2000 when we  purchased  all of the
remaining  outstanding  shares of a Korean asset management  company,  Ssangyong
Templeton  Investment  Trust  Management Co., Ltd.


                                       4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<PAGE>

(currently known as Franklin Templeton Investment Trust Management Co., Ltd.) in
which we  previously  held a partial  interest.  With  assets  under  management
exceeding  $3  billion  in Korea,  we are now one of the  larger  foreign  money
managers in that country.

We acquired all of the  outstanding  shares of Bissett &  Associates  Investment
Management,  Ltd.  ("Bissett")  in October 2000 for  approximately  $95 million.
Bissett now  operates as part of our  Canadian  subsidiary,  Franklin  Templeton
Investments  Corp.  ("FTIC").  With the addition of Bissett,  we added Bissett's
family of mutual  funds to our  existing  Canadian  based funds and expanded our
investment  advisory  services  throughout  Canada to a broad  range of clients,
including   institutional   clients  such  as  pension  plans,   municipalities,
universities, charitable foundations and private clients.

In April  2001,  we  acquired  Fiduciary  Trust  Company  International,  a bank
organized  under the New York State Banking Law ("Fiduciary  Trust").  Following
the  acquisition,  Fiduciary Trust became a wholly-owned  subsidiary of Franklin
Resources,  Inc. The stock transaction was valued at approximately  $776 million
at closing.  Fiduciary Trust has a reputation as one of the leading providers of
investment  management and related trust and custody  services to  institutional
clients and high net-worth  families and  individuals.  With the  acquisition of
Fiduciary Trust, we also added Fiduciary Trust's U.S. and non-U.S.  mutual funds
to our product line.

In July 2002, our 75% owned  subsidiary,  Franklin  Templeton  Asset  Management
(India) Private Limited,  acquired all of the outstanding  shares of Pioneer ITI
AMC Limited ("Pioneer") for approximately  $55.4 million.  Pioneer was an Indian
investment  management  company which had  approximately  $800 million in assets
under management as of the purchase date. The acquisition has made us one of the
largest private sector fund companies in India,  with assets under management of
over $4 billion, and approximately 850,000 shareholder accounts at September 30,
2004.

In October 2003, we acquired Darby Overseas Investments, Ltd. and Darby Overseas
Partners,  L.P.  (collectively,  "Darby") for $75.9  million.  We had previously
owned 12.66% of Darby, and with the completion of the acquisition, we now have a
100% ownership interest. Darby, based in Washington,  D.C., sponsors and manages
funds  for  institutional  investors  and high  net-worth  clients  that  invest
primarily  in  emerging   markets,   private   equity  and   mezzanine   finance
transactions, including specialized sector funds.

LINES OF BUSINESS

I.   INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AND RELATED SERVICES
     ------------------------------------------

We derive  substantially all of our revenues from providing investment advisory,
investment management,  distribution and administrative  services to our various
family of funds,  high net-worth  clients,  institutional  accounts and separate
accounts.  Our  revenues  depend to a large extent on the amount of assets under
management.  Underwriting  and  distribution  revenues,  also a large  source of
revenue,  consist of sales  charges and  commissions  derived  from sales of our
sponsored  investment  products and  distribution and service fees. When used in
this  report  "Franklin  Templeton  mutual  funds" or  "funds"  means all of the
Franklin,  Templeton,  Mutual Series,  Bissett and Fiduciary Trust mutual funds;
"sponsored investment products" means all of the Franklin Templeton mutual funds
together  with  closed-end   investment  companies,   foreign-based   investment
products,  and  other  U.S.  and  international  private,  institutional,   high
net-worth and separate accounts.

A.   ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT ("AUM")
     -------------------------------

Investment  management  fees, a large source of our revenue,  are based upon the
dollar value of assets in the accounts that we advise. As of September 30, 2004,
the type of assets under management by investment objective held by investors on
a worldwide basis was:
<TABLE>
<CAPTION>


TYPE OF ASSETS                                                          VALUE IN BILLIONS        % TOTAL OF AUM
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<S>                                                                                <C>                      <C>
EQUITY
------
Growth potential, income potential or various combinations thereof.                $199.3                   55%

FIXED-INCOME
------------
Both long and short-term.                                                           $96.8                   27%

HYBRID
------
Asset allocation, balanced, flexible and income-mixed funds.                        $59.0                   16%

MONEY MARKET
------------
Short-term liquid assets.                                                            $6.8                    2%
</TABLE>

Broadly  speaking,  the  change in the net  assets of the  sponsored  investment
products depends primarily upon two factors: (1) the level of sales (inflows) as
compared  to the  level  of  redemptions  (outflows);  and (2) the  increase  or
decrease  in the  market  value  of the  securities  held  in the  portfolio  of
investments.  We are  subject to the risk of asset  volatility,  resulting  from
changes in the domestic and global  financial and equity  markets.  In addition,
because we generally derive higher revenues and income from our equity assets, a
shift in assets from  equity to  fixed-income  and hybrid  funds  reduces  total
revenue and thus, net income. Despite such risk of asset volatility,  we believe
that we are more  competitive as a result of the greater  diversity of sponsored
investment products available to our customer base.

B.   TYPES OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AND RELATED SERVICES
     ---------------------------------------------------

A majority of our  revenues are derived from  providing  investment  management,
advisory,  distribution,  transfer agency and related  services for the Franklin
Templeton open-end and/or closed-end funds. We advise,  manage and implement the
investment activities of, and provide other administrative services necessary to
operate,  our  U.S.-registered  open-end and closed-end  funds or series and our
many non-U.S. based sponsored investment products.

1.   Fund Advisory Services

management services pursuant to investment management agreements with each fund.

Templeton Investment Counsel, LLC ("TIC"), a registered investment adviser under
the  Advisers  Act,  provides  investment  advisory,  portfolio  management  and
administrative services to certain of the Templeton funds, sub-advisory services
to certain of the Franklin  funds and  advisory  services to  institutional  and
private accounts.

Our investment adviser  subsidiaries  conduct investment  research and determine
which  securities  the  U.S.-registered   open-end  and  closed-end  funds  will
purchase,  hold or sell under the  supervision and oversight of the fund's board
of trustees,  directors or administrative  managers. In addition, the investment
advisers  subsidiaries  take all steps  necessary to implement  such  decisions,
including  selecting  brokers and  dealers,  executing  and  settling  trades in
accordance with detailed criteria set forth in the management agreement for each
fund, internal policies,  and applicable law and practice. In addition,  certain
of  our  subsidiary   companies  provide  similar   investment   management  and
administrative  services  to  a  number  of  non-U.S.  open-end  and  closed-end
investment  companies,  as well as other  U.S.  and  international  private  and
institutional accounts,  including certain of our sponsored investment companies
organized in Luxembourg and Ireland.

Our investment  advisory services include  fundamental  investment  research and
valuation analyses, including original economic, political, industry and company
research, company visits and inspections, and the utilization of such sources as
company public records and activities,  management interviews,  company prepared
information,  and other publicly available  information,  as well as analyses of
suppliers, customers and competitors. In addition, research services provided by
brokerage firms are used to support our findings.

Investment  management and related services are provided  pursuant to agreements
in effect  with  each of our  U.S.-registered  open-end  and  closed-end  funds.
Comparable  agreements are in effect with  foreign-registered  funds and private
and  institutional  accounts.  In general,  the  management  agreements  for our
U.S.-registered  open-end and closed-end  funds must be renewed each year (after
an initial two year term),  and must be specifically  approved at least annually
by a vote  of such  funds'  board  of  trustees  or  directors  as a  whole  and
separately by the  trustees/directors  that are not  interested  persons of such
funds' under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the " '40 Act") or by a vote of
the  holders  of a  majority  of  such  funds'  outstanding  voting  securities.
Foreign-registered  funds and private and  institutional  accounts  have various
termination  rights, and review and renewal provisions that are not discussed in
this report.

Under the majority of  investment  management  agreements,  the  U.S.-registered
open-end and closed-end funds pay us a fee payable monthly in arrears based upon
a fund's  average  daily net assets.  Annual fee rates under the various  global
investment  management  agreements  generally  range  from 0.15% to a maximum of
2.50% and are often reduced as net assets exceed various threshold  levels.  The
funds  generally pay their own expenses  such as legal,  custody and audit fees,
reporting costs, board and shareholder  meeting costs,  United States Securities
and  Exchange  Commission  ("SEC")  and  state  registration  fees  and  similar
expenses.

We use a "master/feeder"  fund structure in certain  situations.  This structure
allows an investment  adviser to manage a single  portfolio of securities at the
"master  fund" level and have multiple  "feeder  funds" that invest all of their
respective   assets  into  the  master  fund.   Individual   and   institutional
shareholders  invest in the "feeder  funds" which can offer a variety of service
and distribution  options.  An advisory fee is charged at the master fund level,
and administrative and shareholder servicing fees are charged at the feeder fund
level.

Our investment  management  agreements  permit us to serve as an adviser to more
than one fund so long as our ability to render  services to each of the funds is
not  impaired,  and so long as purchases and sales of portfolio  securities  for
various advised funds are made on an equitable basis.  Our management  personnel
and the fund directors or trustees  regularly review the fund advisory and other
administrative fee structures in light of fund performance,  the level and range
of services provided,  industry conditions and other relevant factors.  Advisory
and other administrative fees are generally waived or voluntarily reduced when a
new fund is  established  and then  increased to  contractual  levels  within an
established timeline or as net asset values reach certain levels.

Each U.S.  investment  management or advisory  agreement  between certain of our
subsidiary companies and each fund automatically  terminates in the event of its
"assignment", as defined in the '40 Act. In addition, either party may terminate
the agreement  without  penalty after written notice ranging from 30 to 60 days.
If management agreements  representing a significant portion of our assets under
management  were  terminated,  it would  have a material  adverse  impact on our
Company.  To date,  none of our  management  agreements  with any of our  retail
Franklin Templeton mutual funds have been involuntarily terminated.

2.   Underwriting and Distribution

A significant portion of our revenues under the investment  management operating
segment are generated from providing  underwriting  and  distribution  services.
Franklin/Templeton Distributors, Inc. ("FTDI"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Company,  acts as the principal underwriter and distributor of shares of most of
our U.S.-registered open-end mutual funds. We earn underwriting and distribution
fees primarily by  distributing  the funds pursuant to  distribution  agreements
between FTDI and the funds. Under each distribution agreement, we offer and sell
the fund's shares on a continuous  basis and pay certain costs  associated  with
underwriting and  distributing the funds,  including the costs of developing and
producing  sales  literature  and  printing of  prospectuses,  which may be then
either partially or fully reimbursed by the funds.

Most of our U.S. and  non-U.S.-registered  retail funds are  distributed  with a
multi-class  share  structure.  We  adopted  this  share  structure  to  provide
investors with greater sales charge alternatives for their investments.  Class A
shares  represent  a  traditional  fee  structure  whereby the  investor  pays a
commission at the time of purchase unless minimum  investment  criteria are met.
Class B  shares,  which  are  available  in many of our  funds in the  U.S.  and
globally,  have no front-end sales charges but instead have a declining schedule
of sales charges  (called  contingent  deferred  sales  charges) if the investor
redeems within a number of years from the original  purchase date. The boards of
the funds  that offer  Class B shares  have  approved  a  proposal  to cease the
offering of Class B shares to new investors and existing  shareholders  desiring
to make additional purchases. Existing Class B shareholders would continue to be
permitted to exchange  shares into Class B shares of different  funds.  Existing
Class B shareholders  would also be permitted to continue to reinvest  dividends
in  additional  Class B shares.  The cessation of purchases of Class B shares by
new investors and existing  shareholders will be effective in the first calendar
quarter  of 2005 and may have a  negative  effect  on the  overall  sales of the
funds' shares.  Class C shares have no front-end  sales  charges,  but do have a
back-end  sales  charge  for  redemptions  within  12  months  from  the date of
purchase.  Class R shares with reduced  sales charges are available for purchase
by certain retirement plan accounts in the U.S. only.

Globally, we offer Advisor Class shares in many of our Franklin Templeton mutual
funds  and in the U.S.  we offer Z Class  shares  in  Mutual  Series  funds on a
limited basis, both of which have no sales charges. Franklin Global Trust offers
seven series of funds,  managed by our  subsidiary  FII,  which are sold with no
sales charge to high net-worth or institutional  clients of Fiduciary Trust. The
Advisor and Z Class  shares are  available  to our current and former  officers,
trustees,   directors,   and  full-time  employees,  and  are  also  offered  to
institutions and investment advisory clients (both affiliated and unaffiliated),
as well as individuals  generally  investing $5 million or more. In the U.S., we
also sell money  market  funds to investors  without a sales  charge.  Under the
terms  and  conditions  described  in  the  prospectuses  or the  statements  of
additional  information for some funds, certain investors can purchase shares at
net  asset  value or at  reduced  sales  charges.  In  addition,  investors  may
generally  exchange  their shares of a fund at net asset value for shares within
the same class of another  Franklin  Templeton mutual fund without having to pay
additional sales charges.

Some of our  insurance  product  funds  offered  for  sale in the  U.S.  offer a
three-class  share  structure,  Class 1, Class 2, and Class 3 shares,  which are
offered  at net asset  value  without a sales  load  directly  to the  insurance
company separate  accounts (the  shareholder).  The only difference  between the
three classes is that Class 2 and Class 3 shares are assessed a distribution and
service fee ("12b-1  fee") (as  described  below)  payable to those who sell and
distribute  Class 2 and Class 3 shares and provide  services to shareholders and
contract owners (e.g., FTDI), the insurance company or others.  These 12b-1 fees
are generally assessed quarterly at an annual rate of 0.25% of the average daily
net assets of the class.  Two of the insurance  funds also offer Class 3 shares,
which are the same as Class 2 shares, except that they assess a 1.00% redemption
fee when  variable  contract  owners  redeem  funds  from an  insurance  company
sub-account held for less than 60 days.

Globally,  we offer other types of share classes based on the local needs of the
investors in a  particular  market.  In the majority of cases,  investors in any
class of shares within the U.S. or globally may exchange their shares for a like
class of shares in another fund, subject to certain fees that may apply.

</TABLE>
(a)  Reductions in the maximum sales charges may be available depending upon the
     amount  invested  and the type of  investor.  In some  cases  noted in each
     fund's prospectus or statement of additional information, certain investors
     may  invest  in Class A shares  at net  asset  value  (with  no  load).  In
     connection with certain of these no-load purchases, FTDI may make a payment
     out of its own resources to a broker/dealer involved with that sale.
(b)  For Net  Asset  Value  ("NAV")  purchases  over $1  million,  a  contingent
     deferred sales charge ("CDSC") of 1.00% may apply to shares redeemed within
     18 months.
(c)  Class B  shares  convert  to  Class A  shares  after  eight  (8)  years  of
     ownership.  Effective in the first calendar quarter of 2005, Class B shares
     will  no  longer  be  offered  to  new  investors  and  existing   Class  B
     shareholders desiring to make additional purchases.
(d)  FTDI pays a 1.00%  broker/dealer  commission to broker/dealers of record of
     Class  C  shares.  FTDI  recovers  a  portion  of the  amount  it  pays  to
     broker/dealers by retaining certain 12b-1 fees assessed during the first 12
     months  and  from  collecting  contingent  deferred  sales  charges  on any
     redemptions made within 12 months of the time of sale.
(e)  When the Company  entered into  management  contracts for the Mutual Series
     funds, the outstanding shares of Mutual Series funds were reclassified as Z
     Class shares on October 31, 1996.  Current  shareholders who held shares of
     any Mutual  Series  funds on October  31,  1996 may  continue to purchase Z
     Class shares of any Mutual Series fund. Z Class  shareholders  may exchange
     into Class A shares of other Franklin  Templeton  mutual funds at net asset
     value,  which are subject to 12b-1 fees. FTDI may make a payment out of its
     own resources to a broker/dealer involved in selling Z Class shares.
                                       10
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<PAGE>

(f)  The types of investors that may purchase Class R shares  include,  employer
     sponsored  retirement  plans;  any trust or plan  established  as part of a
     qualified  tuition program under Section 529 of the Internal  Revenue Code;
     and investors who open a Franklin  Templeton IRA rollover account with less
     than $1 million other than a current or former Franklin  Templeton employee
     or as the result of a spousal  rollover or a Qualified  Domestic  Relations
     Order or with direct rollover proceeds of a Defined  Contribution  Services
     Plan.  FTDI pays a 1.00%  broker/dealer  commission  to  broker/dealers  of
     record of Class R shares.  FTDI recovers a portion of the amount it pays to
     broker/dealers by retaining certain 12b-1 fees assessed during the first 12
     months.

Our non-U.S.-registered funds, including the Tax Class shares offered in Canada,
have various  sales  charges and fee  structures  that are not discussed in this
report.

The distribution  agreements with the U.S.-registered  Franklin Templeton mutual
funds  generally  provide for FTDI to pay commission  expenses for sales of fund
shares to broker/dealers. These broker/dealers receive various sales commissions
and other fees from FTDI, including fees from the investors in the funds and the
funds themselves, for services in matching investors with funds whose investment
objectives  match such investors'  goals and risk profiles.  Broker/dealers  may
also receive fees for their  assistance  in  explaining  the  operations  of the
funds,  in  servicing  the  investor's  account,  reporting  and  various  other
distribution services.  Franklin Templeton mutual fund shares are sold primarily
through a large network of independent intermediaries, including broker/dealers,
banks and other similar financial advisers.  We are heavily dependent upon these
distribution  channels and  business  relationships.  FTDI may make  payments to
certain broker/dealers who provide marketing support services, which may include
business planning assistance,  advertising,  educating  broker/dealer  personnel
about the Franklin  Templeton  mutual funds and shareholder  financial  planning
needs,  placement on the  broker/dealer's  list of offered funds,  and access to
sales meetings,  sales  representatives  and management  representatives  of the
broker/dealer.  There is increasing  competition  for access to these  channels,
which  has  caused  our  distribution  costs to rise  and  could  cause  further
increases  in the  future as  competition  continues  and  service  expectations
increase.  As of September 30, 2004,  over 3,700 local,  regional,  and national
securities  brokerage  firms  offered  shares  of the  U.S.-registered  Franklin
Templeton  mutual funds for sale to the investing  public.  In the U.S., we have
approximately  76 general  wholesalers  and eight Franklin  Templeton  Portfolio
Advisors,   Inc.  and  retirement  plan   wholesalers  who  interface  with  the
broker/dealer community.

Most of the U.S.-registered  Franklin Templeton mutual funds, with the exception
of certain  Franklin  Templeton  money market funds,  have adopted  distribution
plans  (the  "Plans")  under  Rule  12b-1  promulgated  under the '40 Act ("Rule
12b-1").  The Plans are  established  for an  initial  term of one (1) year and,
thereafter,  must  be  approved  annually  by the  particular  fund's  board  of
directors or trustees and by a majority of its directors or trustees who are not
interested  persons  of the  fund  under  the '40 Act (the  "disinterested  fund
directors/trustees"). All such Plans are subject to termination at any time by a
majority vote of the disinterested fund  directors/trustees or by the particular
fund  shareholders.  Fees  from the  Plans  are paid  primarily  to  third-party
broker/dealers  who provide service to the shareholder  accounts,  and engage in
distribution  activities.  The Plans permit the funds to bear  certain  expenses
relating to the  distribution  of their shares,  such as expenses for marketing,
advertising,  printing and sales promotion.  FTDI may also receive reimbursement
from the funds for various  expenses that FTDI incurs in distributing the funds,
such as  marketing,  advertising,  printing and sales  promotion  subject to the
Plans' limitations on amounts.  Each fund has a percentage limit for these types
of expenses based on average daily net assets under management.

Similar  arrangements exist with the distribution of our global funds and in all
cases the  distributor  of the funds in the local  market  arranges for and pays
commissions.

Class B and C shares are  generally  more costly to us in the year of sale,  but
they  allow  us  to  be  competitive  by  increasing  our  presence  in  various
distribution  channels.  Historically,  we have  arranged to finance Class B and
certain Class C share deferred  commissions  arising from our U.S., Canadian and
European  operations  through  Lightning  Finance Company Limited,  a company in
which we have a 49% ownership interest.  The repayment of the financing advances
is  limited  to the cash  flows  generated  by the Plans  and by any  contingent
deferred sales charges collected in connection with early redemptions. Effective
in the first calendar  quarter of 2005, Class B shares will no longer be offered
to new investors and existing Class B shareholders  desiring to make  additional
purchases.

(a)  The fees  referenced  above  generally  apply;  however,  there are certain
     individual  funds that may apply a different fee  structure,  including the
     Franklin  Rising  Dividends  Fund whose 12b-1 fee is 0.50%,  certain equity
     funds  whose 12b-1 fees are 0.35% and certain  taxable  fixed-income  funds
     whose 12b-1 fees are 0.15%.
(b)  Certain fixed-income funds now pay 4.00%.
(c)  FTDI  receives a fee equal to 1.00%,  of which 0.25% is paid to the broker/
     dealer on the account  and the  remaining  0.75% is remitted  directly to a
     third party for financing initial broker/dealer commissions.  After 8 years
     from the date of the investment,  Class B shares are converted into Class A
     shares.  Effective in the first  calendar  quarter of 2005,  Class B shares
     will  no  longer  be  offered  to  new  investors  and  existing   Class  B
     shareholders  desiring to make  additional  purchases.  Payments  under the
     funds' Rule 12b-1 plans will continue for existing  Class B shares  subject
     to maximum  asset-based  sales  charges under the National  Association  of
     Securities Dealers (the "NASD") rules.
(d)  FTDI  receives a fee equal to 0.65%,  of which 0.15% is paid to the broker/
     dealer on the account  and the  remaining  0.50% is remitted  directly to a
     third party for financing initial broker/dealer commissions.  After 8 years
     from the date of the investment,  Class B shares are converted into Class A
     shares.  Effective in the first  calendar  quarter of 2005,  Class B shares
     will  no  longer  be  offered  to  new  investors  and  existing   Class  B
     shareholders  desiring to make  additional  purchases.  Payments  under the
     funds' Rule 12b-1 plans will continue for existing  Class B shares  subject
     to maximum asset-based sales charges under NASD rules.
(e)  FTDI  retains a fee equal to 0.75% and pays 0.25% to the  broker/dealer  on
     the  average  assets  in the  account  for the  first  twelve  (12)  months
     following  the  sale,  after  which  the  full  12b-1  fee is  paid  to the
     broker/dealer.
(f)  FTDI  retains a fee equal to 0.50% and pays 0.15% to the  broker/dealer  on
     the assets in the account for the first  twelve (12) months  following  the
     sale, after which it is paid to the broker/dealer.
(g)  With respect to Class R shares, broker/dealers may be eligible to receive a
     12b-1 fee of 0.35% starting in the 13th month.  During the first 12 months,
     the full 12b-1 fee will be paid to FTDI to partially offset commission paid
     at the time of  purchase.  Starting  in the 13th month,  FTDI will  receive
     0.15%.  Broker/dealers  may be eligible to receive the full 0.50% 12b-1 fee
     starting at the time of purchase if they forego the prepaid  commission  of
     1%.

Our various foreign subsidiaries provide underwriting and distribution  services
for our non-U.S.-registered  mutual funds, and pay various sales commissions and
other payments to qualifying broker/dealers and other intermediaries who are not
discussed in this report.

FTDI and/or its affiliates may make the following additional payments out of its
own assets to securities  broker/dealers  that sell shares of Franklin Templeton
mutual funds:

MARKETING SUPPORT PAYMENTS. FTDI may make payments to certain broker/dealers who
are  holders or dealers of record for  accounts  in one or more of the  Franklin
Templeton mutual funds. A broker/dealer's marketing support services may include
business planning assistance,  advertising,  educating  broker/dealer  personnel
about the Franklin  Templeton  mutual funds and shareholder  financial  planning
needs,  placement on the  broker/dealer's  list of offered funds,  and access to
sales meetings,  sales  representatives  and management  representatives  of the
broker/dealer. FTDI compensates broker/dealers differently depending upon, among
other factors,  sales and assets levels,  redemption  rates and the level and/or
type of marketing  and  educational  activities  provided by the  broker/dealer.
Except  as  described  below,  in the case of any one  broker/dealer,  marketing
support  payments  will not  exceed  the sum of  0.10%  of that  broker/dealer's
current  year's  total sales of Franklin  Templeton  mutual  funds and 0.05% (or
0.03%) of the total  assets,  respectively,  of  equity  or fixed  income  funds
attributable to that broker/dealer, on an annual basis.

                                       12
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<PAGE>
TRANSACTION  SUPPORT  PAYMENTS.  FTDI may pay  ticket  charges  of up to $20 per
purchase or exchange  order placed by a  broker/dealer  or one time payments for
ancillary  services  such as setting up funds on a  broker/dealer's  mutual fund
trading system.

OTHER PAYMENTS.  From time to time, FTDI, at its expense, may provide additional
compensation to  broker/dealers  which sell or arrange for the sale of shares of
the funds. Such compensation may include financial  assistance to broker/dealers
that enable FTDI to  participate  in and/or  present at conferences or seminars,
sales or training  programs  for invited  registered  representatives  and other
employees, client and investor events and other broker/dealer-sponsored  events.
These payments may vary depending upon the nature of the event.

FTDI routinely  sponsors due diligence  meetings for registered  representatives
during which they receive updates on various Franklin Templeton mutual funds and
are afforded the  opportunity  to speak with portfolio  managers.  To the extent
permitted by their firm's policies and procedures,  registered  representatives'
expenses in attending these meetings may be covered by FTDI.

Other  compensation may be offered to the extent not prohibited by state laws or
any self-regulatory  agency, such as the NASD. FTDI makes payments for events it
deems appropriate, subject to FTDI guidelines and applicable law.

3.  Shareholder Services

Our subsidiary,  Franklin Templeton Investor  Services,  LLC ("FTIS"),  provides
shareholder   record   keeping   services   and  acts  as  transfer   agent  and
dividend-paying agent for the U.S.-registered Franklin Templeton open-end funds.
FTIS is  registered  with  the SEC as a  transfer  agent  under  the  Securities
Exchange Act of 1934.  FTIS is compensated  under an agreement with each fund on
the basis of an annual per account fee,  which varies with the fund and the type
of services being provided,  and is reimbursed for  out-of-pocket  expenses.  In
addition, certain funds compensate FTIS based on assets under management.  Other
subsidiaries  provide the same  services to the mutual funds offered for sale in
Canada,  Europe,  Asia,  and other  regions  internationally,  under similar fee
arrangements.

FTIS may also pay  servicing  fees,  that will be  reimbursed  by the funds,  in
varying  amounts to certain  financial  institutions  (primarily  to help offset
their  costs  associated  with client  account  maintenance  support,  statement
preparation and transaction  processing) that (i) maintain omnibus accounts with
the fund in the  institution's  name on behalf of numerous  beneficial owners of
fund shares;  or (ii) provide support for fund  shareholder  accounts by sharing
account data with FTIS through the National Securities Clearing Corporation (the
"NSCC")  networking  system.  FTIS  will  also  receive a fee from the funds for
services  provided in support of beneficial  owners and NSCC  networking  system
accounts.

4.  Administrative Services

Generally,   the  funds   themselves  have  no  paid   employees.   Through  our
subsidiaries, including Franklin Templeton Companies, LLC and Franklin Templeton
Services, LLC ("FTS"), we provide and pay the salaries of personnel who serve as
officers of our  U.S.-registered  open-end and closed-end  funds,  including the
administrative personnel as necessary to conduct such funds' day-to-day business
operations.   These  personnel  provide  information,   ensure  compliance  with
securities regulations, maintain accounting systems and controls, prepare annual
reports and perform other  administrative  activities.  FTS is compensated under
separate  agreements  with  most of the funds on the  basis of a  percentage  of
assets under management.

H.  SUMMARY OF OUR SPONSORED INVESTMENT PRODUCTS
    --------------------------------------------

Our sponsored  investment  products are offered to retail,  institutional,  high

approximately 137 countries.

1.  Investment Objectives

The  sponsored  investment  products  that we offer  accommodate  a  variety  of
investment  goals,  spanning the spectrum of our clients' risk  tolerance - from
capital  appreciation  with  our  more   growth-oriented   products  to  capital
preservation  with our  fixed-income  offerings.  In  seeking  to  achieve  such
objectives,  each  portfolio  emphasizes  different  strategies  and  invests in
different types of securities.

Our equity investment products include some that are considered  value-oriented,
others that are considered  growth-oriented,  and some that use a combination of
growth  and  value  characteristics,  generally  identified  as  blend  or  core
products.  Value  investing  focuses on identifying  companies that our research
analysts and portfolio  managers  believe are  undervalued  based on a number of
different  factors,  usually  put in the  context of  historical  ratios such as
price-to-earnings  or  price-to-book  value.  Our growth  portfolios  maintain a
philosophy of  identifying  future drivers of growth that are not reflected in a
company's  current stock price by the determination of our research analysts and
portfolio  managers.  Paramount to all of our different  equity  products is the
incorporation  of  independent,  fundamental  research  through our own in-house
staff of analysts. Our approach across the variety of equity products emphasizes
bottom-up stock selection within a disciplined  portfolio  construction process,
and is based on our ongoing  assessment  of risk and return at the  security and
portfolio levels.

Portfolios  seeking  income  generally  focus  on one or more  of the  following
securities:   taxable  and  tax-exempt  money  market  instruments,   tax-exempt
municipal bonds, global fixed-income securities, fixed-income debt securities of
corporations  and  of  the  U.S.  government  and  its  sponsored  agencies  and
instrumentalities  such as the Government  National  Mortgage  Association,  the
Federal  National  Mortgage  Association,  and the  Federal  Home Loan  Mortgage
Corporation,  or of the  various  states  in the  U.S.  Still  others  focus  on
investments in particular countries and regions, such as emerging markets.

We also  provide  investment  management  and  related  services  to a number of
closed-end  investment  companies  whose shares are traded on various major U.S.
and some  international  stock  exchanges.  In addition,  we provide  investment
management,   marketing   and   distribution   services   to   SICAV   ("Societe
d'Investissement  a Capital  Variable") funds and umbrella unit trusts organized
in Luxembourg and Ireland, respectively,  which are distributed in international
market  places,  as well as to  locally  organized  funds in  various  countries
outside the U.S.

Our sponsored  investment  products also include  portfolios managed for some of
the world's largest corporations,  endowments,  charitable foundations,  pension
funds,  wealthy  individuals and other  institutions.  We use various investment
techniques  to  focus  on  specific  client  objectives  for  these  specialized
portfolios.

product assets under management.

Franklin  Templeton  Variable  Insurance  Products Trust, our insurance products
trust,  offers 21 funds to U.S.  investors,  with assets of $15.7  billion as of
September  30, 2004.  Our  insurance  product  funds are available as investment
options  through  variable  insurance  contracts.  Most of these funds have been
fashioned  after  some of our more  popular  U.S.  retail  funds  offered to the
general public and are managed, in most cases, by the same investment adviser.

Our U.S.  closed-end and interval funds accounted for $5.2 billion of our assets
under management.  U.S. wrap fee,  partnership,  and trust accounts made up $7.4
billion of our assets under management.  On a Company-wide basis,  institutional
separate and high net-worth accounts accounted for $74.1 billion of assets under
management.

In addition, $53.1 billion of our assets under management were held in funds and
open-end and closed-end accounts that are sold outside of the United States, and
whose  investment  objectives vary, but are primarily  international  and global
equity-oriented.

The  following  table shows the various  types of our  U.S.-registered  open-end
funds and dedicated  insurance  product  funds as of September 30, 2004,  and is
categorized using the Investment  Company Institute ("ICI")  definitions,  which
are more detailed than the broad investment  objective  definitions used in MD&A
and in our Consolidated Financial Statements.

</TABLE>

(a)  Does not include the Franklin Templeton Global Fund, the Fiduciary Emerging
     Markets Bond Fund plc, nor fund-of-fund  mutual funds. For purposes of this
     table,  we  consider  the  sales  region  to be where a fund is  based  and
     primarily sold and not  necessarily  the region where a particular  fund is
     invested.  Many funds are also  distributed  across different sales regions
     (e.g., SICAV funds are based, primarily sold in and therefore considered to
     be within the U.K./Europe  sales region,  although also  distributed in the
     Asia Pacific sales region),  but are only  designated a single sales region
     in the table.

3.  Fund Introductions, Mergers and Liquidations

In an effort to address changing market  conditions and evolving investor needs,
we periodically  introduce new funds, merge existing funds or liquidate existing
funds.  During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004, we added and introduced
a number of funds in the U.S., Canada and other regions internationally.

In the U.S.,  product line  optimization was a key focus during the fiscal year.
Recognizing  investor  preferences and general industry trends,  we continued to
promote  existing  core  offerings  as  well  as  diversified  asset  allocation
portfolios. We added a new portfolio to our Franklin Templeton Allocator Series,
a group of  fund-of-fund  mutual funds that invest in many of our core products.
We also expanded the  distribution  of our  alternative  products to address the
rising  demand  in the  retail  channel.  We  continued  to  work  closely  with
institutional  clients,   providing  separate  account  management  as  well  as
customized investment solutions for many high net worth investors.

In Canada, we introduced the Bissett Income Trust & Dividend Fund, together with
the  Bissett  Canadian  Short Term Bond  Fund,  to meet the  growing  demand for
income-oriented  products in the Canadian investment  marketplace.  We added the
Templeton  China Tax Class fund  managed  by Mark  Mobius to take  advantage  of
growth  opportunities  in China,  Hong  Kong and  Taiwan.  Other  new  offerings
included  a new  Canadian  growth  portfolio  and  tax  class  versions  for the
Quotential  Program,  one of the  best  selling  broker/dealer-distributed

                                       20
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<PAGE>

wrap  programs  in Canada.  Additionally,  we added the Bissett All
Canadian Focus Fund, that uses a pre-determined quantitative screening model and
the Franklin Templeton Canadian Small Cap Fund.

In other regions  internationally,  we strategically launched new core funds and
investment  products that  addressed the unique needs of local  markets.  In the
United Kingdom,  we continued to expand our local product  offering  through the
introduction  of two  new  funds.  While  in  India,  two  new  sub  funds  were
introduced,  that were designed to provide investors with choices in their asset
allocation models. In other country specific markets, including Korea, Singapore
and Italy, we initiated new locally demanded products to support those expanding
businesses.

During the fiscal year ended  September 30, 2004, the following fund mergers and
liquidations  occurred:  1 variable  insurance fund merged into another variable
insurance  fund;  1  U.S.-registered  open-end  fund  was  merged  into  another
U.S.-registered open-end fund; 3 U.S.-registered mutual funds were liquidated; 7
non-U.S.-registered  open-end  funds were merged into other  non-U.S.-registered
open-end funds and 26 non-U.S.-registered open-end funds were liquidated.

II. BANKING/FINANCE OPERATIONS
    --------------------------

Our  secondary  business  segment  is   banking/finance,   which  offers  select
retail-banking and consumer lending services.

Our subsidiary, Fiduciary Trust, is a New York state chartered bank and provides
private banking services primarily to high net-worth clients who maintain trust,
custody and/or investment  management  accounts with Fiduciary Trust.  Fiduciary
Trust's private banking and credit products include, among others, loans secured
by marketable securities,  foreign exchange services, deposit accounts and other
banking  services.  As discussed in Investment  Management and Related Services,
Fiduciary Trust also offers investment management, trust and estate, custody and
related  services to institutional  accounts and high net-worth  individuals and
families.

Franklin  Capital  Corporation  ("FCC") is a subsidiary  of FRI,  which  engages
primarily in the purchase,  securitization  and servicing of retail  installment
sales contracts  ("automobile  contracts")  originated by independent automobile
dealerships.  FCC is  incorporated  and  headquartered  in Utah and conducts its
business  primarily in the Western  region of the U.S. As of September 30, 2004,
FCC's total assets included $105.0 million of outstanding  automobile contracts.
During fiscal 2004, FCC securitized  approximately  $482.2 million of automobile
contract  receivables for which it maintains  servicing  rights. As of September
30, 2004, FCC serviced $768.9 million of receivables  that have been securitized
to date. See Note 7 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Our  securitized   automobile  contracts  business  is  subject  to  marketplace
fluctuation and competes with businesses with  significantly  larger portfolios.
Auto loan  portfolio  losses can be  influenced  significantly  by trends in the
economy and credit markets,  which reduce  borrowers'  ability to repay loans. A
more  detailed  analysis of loan losses and  delinquency  rates in our  consumer
lending and dealer auto loan business is contained in Note 6 in the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Our subsidiary  Franklin Templeton Bank & Trust,  F.S.B.  ("FTB&T"),  with total
assets of $145.2  million,  as of  September  30,  2004,  provides  FDIC insured
deposit  accounts and general  consumer loan products such as credit card loans,
unsecured loans, loans secured by marketable  securities,  mortgage loans, debit
card products and auto loans.  FTB&T  (formerly  known as Franklin  Bank) became
chartered  as a federal  savings  bank on May 1, 2000 when the  Office of Thrift
Supervision  approved  FTB&T's  application  to convert from a California  state
banking  charter  to  a  federal  thrift  charter.   Immediately  following  the
conversion  of FTB&T's  state  charter  to a federal  thrift  charter,  Franklin
Templeton Trust Company, a California  chartered trust company,  was merged into
FTB&T and  continues to perform its prior  activities as a division of FTB&T and
Franklin Templeton Fiduciary Bank & Trust, Ltd. ("FTFB&T"),  a licensed bank and
trust company in the Bahamas.

Our other banking  subsidiaries  include,  among others,  FTCI (Cayman)  Ltd., a
licensed bank and trust company in the Cayman Islands and FTFB&T.

REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS

Virtually all aspects of our business,  including  those  conducted  through our
various  subsidiaries,  are  subject  to various  federal,  state,  and  foreign
regulation  and  supervision.  Domestically,  we are subject to  regulation  and
supervision by, among others,  the SEC, the NASD, the Federal Reserve Board (the
"FRB"), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"), the Office of Thrift
Supervision and the New York State Banking Department.  Globally, we are subject
to regulation and supervision by, among others, the Office of the Superintendent
of Financial Institutions as well as provincial financial services regulators in
Canada,  and the  Ontario  and  Alberta  Securities  Commissions,  the  Monetary
Authority of Singapore,  the Financial Services Authority in the United Kingdom,
the Central Bank of Ireland, the Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong,
the Korean Ministry of Finance and Economy, the Financial Supervisory Commission
and the Financial  Supervisory  Services in Korea, the Securities Exchange Board
of India, the China Securities Regulatory Commission,  the Taiwan Securities and
Futures  Commission,  the  Ministry of  Finance,  and the  Commerce  Department,
Ministry of  Economic  Affairs in Taiwan.  The  Advisers  Act  imposes  numerous
obligations  on our  subsidiaries,  which are registered in the United States as
investment   advisers,   including  record  keeping,   operating  and  marketing
requirements,  disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities.
The '40 Act imposes  similar  obligations on the  investment  companies that are
advised by our subsidiaries.  The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and
impose  sanctions for  violations  of the Advisers Act and the '40 Act,  ranging
from fines and censure to termination of an investment adviser's registration.

As part of various investigations by the SEC, the U.S. Attorney for the Northern
District of California,  the New York Attorney General,  the California Attorney
General,  the U.S.  Attorney for the District of  Massachusetts,  the Securities
Division of the Office of the Secretary of the  Commonwealth  of  Massachusetts,
the Florida Department of Financial Services and the Commissioner of Securities,
the  West  Virginia  Attorney  General,   the  Vermont  Department  of  Banking,
Insurance,   Securities,   and  Health  Care  Administration  and  the  National
Association of Securities  Dealers,  relating to certain practices in the mutual
fund  industry,  including  late trading,  market  timing and marketing  support
payments to  securities  broker/dealers  who sell fund  shares,  the Company and
certain of its subsidiaries, as well as certain current or former executives and
employees of the Company,  received requests for information and/or subpoenas to
testify or produce  documents.  The Company and its current  employees  provided
documents  and  information  in response to these  requests  and  subpoenas.  In
addition,  the  Company  has  responded,   and  in  one  instance  is  currently
responding,  to  requests  for  similar  kinds of  information  from  regulatory
authorities  in some of the foreign  countries  where the Company  conducts  its
global  asset  management  business.  See  also  Note  13 in  the  Notes  to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

FRI and many of the investment companies advised by our various subsidiaries are
also  subject to the  federal  and state laws  affecting  corporate  governance,
including the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act of 2002, as well as rules adopted by the SEC.
As a NYSE  listed  company,  we are  also  subject  to the  rules  of the  NYSE,
including the corporate governance standards.

Since 1993,  the NASD Conduct  Rules have limited the amount of aggregate  sales
charges  which  may be paid in  connection  with the  purchase  and  holding  of
investment company shares sold through broker/dealers. The effect of the rule is
to limit the amount of fees that could be paid  pursuant to a fund's  12b-1 Plan
to FTDI, our principal  underwriting  and distribution  subsidiary,  which earns
underwriting  commissions  on the  distribution  of fund  shares  in the  United
States.

Following the  acquisition  of Fiduciary  Trust in fiscal year 2001, the Company
became a bank holding  company  under the BHC Act and is subject to  supervision
and regulation by the FRB.  Pursuant to the GLB Act, a bank holding  company may
elect to become a financial  holding company if each of its subsidiary banks and
other depository institution  subsidiaries is well capitalized,  is well managed
and has at least a  "satisfactory"  rating under the Community  Reinvestment Act
("CRA").  Because we are a qualifying bank holding company under the GLB Act, we
also became a financial  holding  company,  which enables us to affiliate with a
far broader range of financial  companies than had previously been permitted for
bank  holding  companies.   Permitted  affiliates  include  securities  brokers,
underwriters  and  dealers,   investment  managers,  mutual  fund  distributors,
insurance companies and companies engaged in other activities that are financial
in nature or incidental to a financial  activity.  The FRB's regulations specify
that organizing,  sponsoring, and managing a mutual fund are activities that are
permissible for financial holding companies under certain guidelines.

                                       22
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<PAGE>

The FRB may impose limitations,  restrictions, or prohibitions on the activities
or  acquisitions  of a financial  holding  company if the FRB believes  that the
Company does not have the  appropriate  financial  and  managerial  resources to
commence or conduct an activity,  make an acquisition,  or retain ownership of a
company.  The  GLB  Act  establishes  the  FRB as the  umbrella  supervisor  for
financial holding companies and adopts an administrative  approach to regulation
that generally  requires the FRB to defer to the actions and requirements of the
U.S. "functional" regulators of subsidiary broker/dealers,  investment advisers,
investment companies,  insurance companies,  and other regulated  non-depository
institutions.

Under federal law, a depository institution is prohibited from paying a dividend
if  the  depository   institution  would  thereafter  be  "undercapitalized"  as
determined by the federal bank regulatory agencies. FRB policy provides that, as
a matter of prudent  banking,  a bank holding company  generally  should not pay
dividends  unless its net income is  sufficient  to fully fund the dividends and
the  prospective  rate of earnings  retention  appears to be consistent with the
capital  needs,  asset  quality and overall  financial  condition of the holding
company  and its  bank and  thrift  institution  subsidiaries.  As we are a bank
holding  company,  this  policy may be  applied to us even  though we are also a
financial holding company.

Almost every aspect of the operations and financial condition of our banking and
thrift  subsidiaries are subject to extensive  regulation and supervision and to
various  requirements  and restrictions  under federal and state law,  including
requirements  governing  capital  adequacy,  management  practices,   liquidity,
branching, earnings, loans, dividends,  investments,  reserves against deposits,
and the provision of services.  The relevant federal banking regulatory agencies
and the state banking regulatory agencies have authority to prohibit a bank or a
bank holding  company from  engaging in what,  in the opinion of the  regulatory
body, constitutes an unsafe or unsound practice.

Each of our banking  subsidiaries is subject to  restrictions  under federal law
that limit transactions with FRI and its non-bank subsidiaries,  including loans
and other  extensions  of  credit,  investments  or asset  purchases.  These and
various  other  transactions,  including  any  payment  of  money to FRI and its
non-bank  subsidiaries,  must be on terms and  conditions  that are,  or in good
faith  would  be,  offered  to  companies  that are not  affiliated  with  these
companies.

Federal banking agencies are required to take prompt  supervisory and regulatory
actions with respect to institutions that do not meet minimum capital standards.
There  are  five  defined   capital  tiers,   the  highest  of  which  is  "well
capitalized".  A  depository  institution  is generally  prohibited  from making
capital distributions,  including paying dividends, or paying management fees to
a holding  company if the  institution  would  thereafter  be  undercapitalized.
Undercapitalized  institutions  may not  accept,  renew  or roll  over  brokered
deposits.  To  remain  a  financial  holding  company,  each  company's  banking
subsidiaries  must be well  capitalized  and well  managed.  As of September 30,
2004,  our  bank  and  thrift  subsidiaries  continued  to be  considered  "well
capitalized" and "well managed".  If a banking subsidiary of a financial holding
company has not received a rating of at least  "satisfactory" on its most recent
CRA  examination,  the FRB may prohibit  the  financial  holding  company or its
banking subsidiary from engaging in additional financial activities. Each of our
banking subsidiaries currently has a CRA rating of satisfactory or better.

The FRB has adopted various capital guidelines for bank holding  companies.  The
GLB Act  generally  prohibits  the FRB from  imposing  capital  requirements  on
functionally  regulated  non-bank  subsidiaries of a financial  holding company,
such as broker/dealers and investment advisers.

The federal banking agencies have broad enforcement powers,  including the power
to terminate  deposit  insurance,  impose  substantial fines and other civil and
criminal penalties and appoint a conservator or receiver. Failure to comply with
applicable laws,  regulations and supervisory  agreements could subject FRI, our
thrift  and  banking  subsidiaries,  as well as  officers,  directors  and other
so-called   "institution-affiliated   parties"   of   these   organizations   to
administrative  sanctions and potentially  substantial civil money penalties. In
addition,  the  appropriate  federal  banking  agency  may  appoint  the FDIC as
conservator  or  receiver  for a banking  institution,  or the FDIC may  appoint
itself if any one or more of a number of circumstances exist.

COMPETITION

The  financial  services  industry is highly  competitive  and has  increasingly
become a global  industry.  There are  approximately  8,100 open-end  investment
companies of varying sizes,  investment policies and objectives whose shares are
being  offered to the public in the U.S. Due to our  international  presence and
varied  product

                                       23

<PAGE>

mix, it is difficult to assess our market position  relative to other investment
managers on a worldwide basis, but we believe that we are one of the more widely
diversified  investment  managers  in the U.S.  We  believe  that our equity and
fixed-income  asset  mix  coupled  with  our  global  presence  will  serve  our
competitive  needs  well  over  the  long  term.  We  continue  to  focus on the
performance  of our  investment  products,  service to customers  and  extensive
marketing   activities  with  our  strong   broker/dealer  and  other  financial
institution distribution network as well as high net-worth customers.

We face strong competition from numerous investment management,  stock brokerage
and  investment  banking firms,  insurance  companies,  banks,  savings and loan
associations  and other  financial  institutions,  which  offer a wide  range of
financial and investment management services to the same institutional accounts,
separate  accounts and high net-worth  customers that we are seeking to attract.
In  recent  years,  there  has been a trend of  consolidation  in the  financial
services  industry,  resulting in stronger  competitors  with greater  financial
resources than us.

We rely largely on  intermediaries  to sell and  distribute  Franklin  Templeton
mutual  fund  shares.  In  addition  to  offering  our  products,  many of these
intermediaries  also have  mutual  funds  under  their own  names  that  compete
directly  with our  products.  These  intermediaries  could  decide  to limit or
restrict  the sale of our fund  shares,  which could lower our future  sales and
cause  our   revenues  to  decline.   We  have  and  continue  to  pursue  sales
relationships  with all types of  intermediaries  to  broaden  our  distribution
network.  We  have  experienced  increased  costs  related  to  maintaining  our
distribution channels and we anticipate that this trend will continue.

We have  implemented  an award  winning  Internet  platform to compete  with the
rapidly developing and evolving capabilities being offered with this technology.
Together  with several large  financial  services  companies,  we made a capital
investment in the  development of an  industry-wide  Internet  portal,  known as
Advisorcentral.com,  which provides our  broker/dealer  and  investment  adviser
customers with the ability to view their clients' holdings using one log-in ID.

As investor  interest in the mutual fund  industry  has  increased,  competitive
pressures have increased on sales charges of broker/dealer distributed funds. We
believe that,  although this trend will continue,  a significant  portion of the
investing public still relies on the services of the  broker/dealer or financial
adviser community, particularly during weaker market conditions.

We believe that we are well positioned to deal with changes in marketing  trends
as a result of our  already  extensive  advertising  activities  and broad based
marketplace  recognition.  We conduct  significant  advertising  and promotional
campaigns  through  various  media  sources to  promote  brand  recognition.  We
advertise  in major  national  financial  publications,  as well as on radio and
television  to promote  brand name  recognition  and to assist our  distribution
network.  Such  activities  include  purchasing  network and cable  programming,
sponsorship   of  sporting   events,   and  extensive   newspaper  and  magazine
advertising.

Diverse  and  strong  competition  affects  the  banking/finance  segment of our
business as well, and limits the fees that can be charged for our services.  For
example,  in the banking segment we compete with many types of institutions  for
consumer  loans,   including  the  finance   subsidiaries  of  large  automobile
manufacturers,  which have offered  special  incentives to stimulate  automobile
sales,  including  no-interest loans. These product offerings by our competitors
limit the interest rates that we can charge on consumer loans.

breakout of business segment information is contained in Note 18 in the Notes to

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

ITEM 2.   PROPERTIES.

We conduct our  worldwide  operations  using a  combination  of leased and owned
facilities.  While we believe we have sufficient  facilities to conduct business
during fiscal 2005, we will continue to lease, acquire and dispose of facilities
throughout the world as necessary.

We lease space  domestically  primarily in  California,  Connecticut,  Delaware,
Florida,  Georgia,  New Jersey,  New York, Utah,  Washington,  Wisconsin and the
District  of  Columbia,  and  internationally  in various  locations,  including
Australia,  Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, England,  France, Germany,  Holland,
Hong Kong, India,  Ireland,  Italy, Japan, Korea,  Luxembourg,  Poland,  Russia,
Scotland, Spain, Sweden,  Switzerland,  Taiwan, Turkey, United Arab Emirates and
Venezuela.  As of  September  30,  2004,  we leased and  occupied  approximately
939,000 square feet of space. We have also leased and subsequently  subleased to
third parties a total of 305,000 square feet of space.

In  addition,  we own 4 buildings  in San Mateo,  California,  5 buildings  near
Sacramento,  California, 5 buildings in St. Petersburg,  Florida, 2 buildings in
Nassau,  Bahamas,  4 buildings in India, as well as space in office buildings in
Argentina,  China  and  Singapore.  During  this  past  year we  acquired  the 4
buildings  in San  Mateo,  California  that  we  previously  occupied  under  an
operating  lease with a related  lessor  trust.  The buildings we own consist of
approximately  1.64  million  square  feet.  We have  leased  to  third  parties
approximately  100,000 square feet of excess owned space.  Since we operate on a
unified  basis,  corporate  activities,  fund  related  activities,   accounting
operations,  sales,  retail-banking and consumer lending operations,  management
information system activities,  publishing and printing operations,  shareholder
service operations and other business  activities and operations take place in a
variety of such locations.

ITEM 3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

On September  20,  2004,  Franklin  Resources,  Inc.  announced  that two of its
subsidiaries,  Franklin  Advisers,  Inc.  (as  used in this  section,  "Franklin
Advisers") and Franklin Templeton Alternative  Strategies,  Inc.("FTAS") reached
an agreement with the Securities  Division of the Office of the Secretary of the
Commonwealth  of  Massachusetts  (the "State of  Massachusetts")  related to the
previously-reported  administrative  complaint  filed on February  4, 2004.  The
administrative complaint concerned one instance of market timing.

Under  the  terms  of the  settlement  consent  order  issued  by the  State  of
Massachusetts,  Franklin Advisers and FTAS consented to the entry of a cease and
desist order and agreed to pay a $5 million  administrative fine to the State of
Massachusetts (the  "Massachusetts  Consent Order").  Franklin  Resources,  Inc.
recorded this expense in the quarter ended September 30, 2004. The Massachusetts
Consent  Order  included  two  different  sections:  "Statements  of  Fact"  and
"Violations  of  Massachusetts  Securities  Laws."  Franklin  Advisers  and FTAS
admitted the facts in the Statements of Fact.

On October 25, 2004, the State of  Massachusetts  filed a second  administrative
complaint, alleging that Franklin Resources, Inc.'s Form 8-K filing (in which it
described  the  Massachusetts  Consent  Order and stated that  "Franklin did not
admit or deny  engaging  in any  wrongdoing")  failed to state that FAV and FTAS
admitted the Statements of Fact portion of the Massachusetts  Consent Order (the
"Second  Complaint").  Franklin Resources,  Inc. reached a second agreement with
the State of Massachusetts on November 19, 2004, resolving the Second Complaint.
As a result of the November 19, 2004 settlement,  Franklin Resources, Inc. filed
a new Form 8-K.  The terms of the original  settlement  did not change and there
was no monetary fine associated with this second settlement.

In addition,  Franklin Resources,  Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries (as used
in this section,  together, the "Company") and certain Franklin Templeton mutual
funds (the "Funds") current and former officers,  employees,  and directors have
been  named  in  multiple  lawsuits  in  different  federal  courts  in  Nevada,
California,  Illinois,  New York,  and Florida,  alleging  violations of various
federal  securities laws and seeking,  among other things,  monetary damages and
costs.  Specifically,  the lawsuits claim breach of duty with respect to alleged
arrangements to permit market timing and/or late trading activity,  or breach of
duty with  respect  to the  valuation  of the  portfolio  securities  of certain
Templeton  Funds managed by Company  subsidiaries,  resulting in alleged  market
timing activity. The majority of these lawsuits duplicate,  in whole or in part,
the allegations  asserted in the first  Massachusetts  administrative  complaint
described above. The lawsuits are styled as class actions, or derivative actions
on behalf  of either  the named  Funds or the  Company.  Additionally,  Franklin
Templeton  Investments  Corp.  ("FTIC") was recently  served with a class action
market timing complaint in Quebec, Canada, entitled Huneault v. AGF Funds, Inc.,
et al.,  Case No.  500-06-000256-046,  filed on October 25, 2004 in the Superior
Court for the Province of Quebec, District of Montreal.

To date,  more than 240 similar  lawsuits  against at least 19 different  mutual
fund  companies  have been  filed in  federal  district  courts  throughout  the
country.  Because these cases  involve  common  questions of fact,  the Judicial
Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (the "Judicial Panel") ordered the creation of
a multidistrict  litigation in the United States District Court for the District
of Maryland,  entitled "In re Mutual Funds  Investment  Litigation" (the "MDL").
The Judicial Panel then  transferred  similar cases from different  districts to
the MDL for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings.

As of December 13, 2004, the following  lawsuits are pending against the Company
(and in some instances,  against certain of the Funds) and have been transferred
to the MDL:

Kenerley v.  Templeton  Funds,  Inc.,  et al.,  Case No.  03-770  GPM,  filed on
November 19, 2003 in the United States District Court for the Southern  District
of Illinois; Cullen v. Templeton Growth Fund, Inc., et al., Case No. 03-859 MJR,
filed on December 16, 2003 in the United States  District Court for the Southern
District of Illinois and transferred to the United States District Court for the
Southern  District  of Florida on March 29,  2004;  Jaffe v.  Franklin  AGE High

Court for the Northern District of California;  Hertz v. Burns, et al., Case No.
04 CV 02489, filed on March 30, 2004 in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York.

Plaintiffs  in the MDL filed  consolidated  amended  complaints on September 29,
2004.  It is  anticipated  that  defendants  will file motions to dismiss in the
coming months.

As previously  reported,  various  subsidiaries of Franklin Resources,  Inc., as
well as certain Templeton Funds, have also been named in multiple lawsuits filed
in state  courts  in  Illinois,  alleging  breach of duty  with  respect  to the
valuation of the portfolio securities of certain Templeton Funds managed by such
subsidiaries as follows:

Bradfisch v.  Templeton  Funds,  Inc., et al., Case No. 2003 L 001361,  filed on
October 3, 2003 in the  Circuit  Court of the Third  Judicial  Circuit,  Madison
County, Illinois;  Woodbury v. Templeton Global Smaller Companies Fund, Inc., et
al.,  Case No. 2003 L 001362,  filed on October 3, 2003 in the Circuit  Court of
the Third Judicial Circuit, Madison County,  Illinois;  Kwiatkowski v. Templeton
Growth Fund,  Inc., et al., Case No. 03 L 785, filed on December 17, 2003 in the
Circuit Court of the Twentieth  Judicial  Circuit,  St. Clair County,  Illinois;
Parise v.  Templeton  Funds,  Inc.,  et al.,  Case No.  2003 L 002049,  filed on
December 22, 2003 in the Circuit Court of the Third  Judicial  Circuit,  Madison
County, Illinois.

These lawsuits are state court actions and are not subject to the MDL.

In  addition,  the  Company,  as well as certain  current  and former  officers,
employees,  and  directors,  have  been  named  in  multiple  lawsuits  alleging
violations of various  securities  laws and pendent state law claims relating to
the  disclosure  of directed  brokerage  payments  and/or  payment of  allegedly
excessive advisory, commission, and distribution fees. These lawsuits are styled
as class actions and derivative  actions brought on behalf of certain Funds, and
are as follows:

Stephen Alexander IRA v. Franklin Resources,  Inc., et al., Case No. 04-982 JLL,
filed on March 2, 2004 in the United States  District  Court for the District of
New Jersey;  Strigliabotti  v. Franklin  Resources,  Inc., et al., Case No. C 04
0883 SI,  filed on March 4, 2004 in the  United  States  District  Court for the
Northern District of California;  Tricarico v. Franklin Resources, Inc., et al.,
Case No.  CV-04-1052  JAP, filed on March 4, 2004 in the United States  District
Court for the District of New Jersey;  Miller v. Franklin Mutual Advisors,  LLC,
et al.,  Case No.  04-261  DRH,  filed on April 16,  2004 in the  United  States
District  Court for the  Southern  District of Illinois and  transferred  to the
United  States  District  Court for the District of New Jersey on August 5, 2004
(plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed this action, without prejudice, on October 22,
2004); Wilcox v. Franklin  Resources,  Inc., et al., Case No. 04-2258 WHW, filed
on May 12,  2004 in the United  States  District  Court for the  District of New
Jersey;   Bahe,   Custodian  CGM  Roth  Conversion  IRA  v.   Franklin/Templeton
Distributors,  Inc. et al., Case No.  04-11195 PBS, filed on June 3, 2004 in the
United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.

The United States District Court for the District of New Jersey consolidated for
pretrial purposes three of the above lawsuits (Stephen Alexander IRA, Tricarico,
and Wilcox)  into a single  action,  entitled  "In re Franklin  Mutual Funds Fee
Litigation."  Plaintiffs in those three lawsuits  filed a  consolidated  amended
complaint on October 4, 2004.

Management  strongly  believes  that  the  claims  made in each of the  lawsuits
identified  above are without  merit and intends to  vigorously  defend  against
them.

investigations  in  Note  13,  "Commitments  and  Contingencies  -  Governmental
Investigations,  Proceedings and Actions",  of Notes to  Consolidated  Financial
Statements included in Part II of this report.

Except for the matters described above, there have been no material developments
in the litigation previously reported in our Form 10-Q for the period ended June
30, 2004, as filed with the SEC on August 13, 2004. We are involved from time to
time in litigation  relating to claims arising in the normal course of business.
Management  is of the opinion that the ultimate  resolution  of such claims will
not materially affect our business or financial position.

ITEM 4.   SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

During the fourth  quarter of the fiscal year covered by this report,  no matter
was submitted to a vote of our security holders.

ITEM 7.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
          RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

In this  section,  we  discuss  our  results  of  operations  and our  financial
condition. In addition to historical  information,  we also make some statements
relating to the future,  which are called  "forward-looking  statements".  These
forward-looking  statements  involve a number of risks,  uncertainties and other
important  factors  that could cause our actual  results and  outcomes to differ
materially  from any future  results or  outcomes  expressed  or implied by such
forward-looking  statements. For this reason, you should not rely too heavily on
them and  should  review the "Risk  Factors"  section,  where we  discuss  these
statements in more detail.

GENERAL

We derive the majority of our  operating  revenues,  operating  expenses and net
income from providing  investment advisory and related services to retail mutual
funds,  institutional  accounts,  high net-worth  clients,  private accounts and
other investment  products.  This is our primary business activity and operating
segment. The mutual funds and other products that we advise, collectively called
our sponsored investment products,  are distributed to the public globally under
six distinct names:

* Franklin
* Templeton
* Mutual Series
* Bissett
* Fiduciary Trust
* Darby Overseas


                                       32
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<PAGE>

Our sponsored investment products include a broad range of  global/international
equity,  U.S. domestic,  hybrid,  fixed-income and money market mutual funds, as
well  as  other  investment  products  that  meet a  wide  variety  of  specific
investment needs of individuals and institutions.

The level of our  revenues  depends  largely  on the level and  relative  mix of
assets under  management.  To a lesser  degree,  our revenues also depend on the
level of mutual fund sales and the number of mutual fund  shareholder  accounts.
The fees  charged for our services  are based on  contracts  with our  sponsored
investment  products or our  clients.  These  arrangements  could  change in the
future.

Our  secondary   business  and  operating   segment  is   banking/finance.   Our
banking/finance group offers selected  retail-banking services to high net-worth
individuals,  foundations and institutions,  and consumer lending services.  Our
consumer lending  activities include automotive lending related to the purchase,
securitization,  and servicing of retail installment sales contracts  originated
by independent  automobile  dealerships,  consumer credit and debit cards,  real
estate equity lines, and home equity/mortgage loans.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Fiscal 2004 was challenging  for the mutual fund industry as various  regulatory
bodies  continued their  investigations  of certain industry  practices.  We are
working  with a number of  government  regulators  who are looking  into matters
involving  frequent trading  (commonly  referred to as "market timing") policies
and practices,  marketing support payments to securities broker/dealers who sell
fund shares, and other industry concerns.

Despite the scrutiny,  key performance  measures  continued to improve in fiscal
2004.  Our diluted  earnings per share grew to $2.80 in fiscal 2004, as compared
to $1.97 in fiscal 2003 and $1.65 in fiscal 2002. Our operating margin increased
to 27% in fiscal 2004, as compared to 25% in fiscal 2003 and 23% in fiscal 2002.
Market appreciation and excess sales over redemptions increased our assets under
management  to an all-time  record of $361.9  billion at September  30, 2004, as
compared to $301.9 billion at September 30, 2003 and $247.8 billion at September
30, 2002. Our effective  investment  management fee rate (investment  management
fees divided by simple  monthly  average assets under  management)  was 0.58% in
fiscal 2004, as compared to 0.55% in fiscal 2003 and 0.56% in fiscal 2002.

As  our  client  base  broadens  geographically,  we  remain  attentive  to  the
specialized needs of these clients and continue to expand the investment choices
available to them. To that end, on October 1, 2003, we completed the acquisition
of  Darby  Overseas  Investments,   Ltd.  and  Darby  Overseas  Partners,   L.P.
(collectively  "Darby"),  a group specializing in private equity,  mezzanine and
emerging markets fixed-income  products. In fiscal 2002, we acquired Pioneer ITI
AMC Limited ("Pioneer"), an Indian investment management company.

---------------------------------- ----------- ------------- ------------- -------------- -----------
</TABLE>

Net income  increased by 41% and diluted  earnings per share increased by 42% in
fiscal  2004.  The  increase  was  primarily  due to higher  operating  revenues
consistent  with a 26%  increase  in our simple  monthly  average  assets  under
management,  higher gross sales on which commissions are earned, and an increase
in billable  shareholder  accounts.  These  increases were  partially  offset by
higher underwriting and distribution expenses,  higher compensation and benefits
expense, the provision for governmental investigations,  proceedings and actions
and a higher  effective  tax rate in fiscal  2004 as compared to the prior year.
The decline in diluted weighted-average shares outstanding from 254.7 million in
fiscal 2003 to 252.2 million in fiscal 2004, also contributed to the increase in
diluted  earnings per common  share.  The  decrease in diluted  weighted-average

<PAGE>

shares  outstanding  resulted from stock  repurchases,  especially in the latter
half of fiscal  2003,  partially  offset by an  increase  in  dilution  from the
assumed  conversion  of stock  options  granted as the price of our common stock
increased during fiscal 2004.

Net income  increased by 16% and diluted  earnings per share increased by 19% in
fiscal 2003  primarily due to higher  operating  revenues  consistent  with a 3%
increase in our simple  monthly  average  assets  under  management,  as well as
higher investment and other income in fiscal 2003 due to an other-than-temporary
decline in the value of certain investments in fiscal 2002.

/1   Investment  management  fees from  approximately  45% of our  assets  under
     management at September 30, 2004 were calculated using daily average assets
     under management.

Our assets under  management  at  September  30, 2004 were $361.9  billion,  20%
higher than they were a year ago, due to excess sales over  redemptions of $22.4
billion and market appreciation of $38.9 billion, primarily in the first half of
fiscal 2004. Simple monthly average assets under management, which are generally
more  indicative of investment  management fee revenue trends than the year over
year change in ending assets under management, increased 26% during fiscal 2004.

The simple  monthly  average mix of assets under  management  for the last three
fiscal years is shown below.

</TABLE>

/1   Industry  asset-weighted average management fee rates were calculated using
     information available from Lipper(R) Inc. at September 30, 2004 and include
     all U.S.-based,  open-ended  funds that reported  expense data to Lipper(R)
     Inc.  as of the  funds'  most  recent  annual  report  date,  and for which
     expenses  were greater or equal to zero.  The averages  combine  retail and
     institutional  funds data and  include all share  classes and  distribution
     channels, without exception. Variable annuity products are not included.

For  the  2004  fiscal  year,  our  effective  investment  management  fee  rate
(investment  management  fees  divided by simple  monthly  average  assets under
management)  increased to 0.58% from 0.55% in fiscal 2003. The change in the mix
of assets under management,  resulting from higher excess sales over redemptions
and  appreciation  for equity as compared to fixed-income  products,  led to the
increase in the effective  investment  management  fee rate.  Generally,  equity
products carry higher management fees than fixed-income products.

For the 2003 fiscal year, our effective investment  management fee rate declined
to 0.55%  from  0.56% in fiscal  2002.  The  change  in the mix of assets  under
management,  resulting from higher  relative  excess sales over  redemptions and
appreciation for fixed-income as compared to equity products,  led to the slight
decrease in the effective investment management fee rate.

Assets under management by sales office location were as follows:

Approximately  73%  of  our  assets  under  management  at  September  30,  2004
originated  from our U.S.  sales offices and  approximately  69% of our revenues
originated in the United States in fiscal 2004.  Due to the global nature of our
business  operations,  investment  advisory and  administrative  services may be
performed in locations unrelated to the location of the shareholder.

billion in assets under  management,  related to private  equity,  mezzanine and
emerging markets fixed-income products as of the acquisition date, on October 1,
2003.  Our  acquisition  of Pioneer,  in July 2002,  increased  our assets under
management by $0.8 billion as of the date of this acquisition.

Our products  experienced  $38.9  billion in  appreciation  in fiscal  2004,  as
compared  to $42.0  billion  in fiscal  2003 and  market  depreciation  of $11.9

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FEES

Investment  management  fees,  accounting  for 57% of our operating  revenues in
fiscal 2004,  include both investment  advisory and  administration  fees. These
fees are generally calculated under contractual  arrangements with our sponsored
investment  products  as a  percentage  of the  market  value  of  assets  under
management.  Annual  rates vary by  investment  objective  and type of  services
provided.  In return for these  fees,  we provide a  combination  of  investment
advisory, administrative and other management services.

Investment  management  fees increased 32% in fiscal 2004  consistent with a 26%
increase in simple monthly  average  assets under  management and an increase in
our effective  investment  management fee rate resulting from a shift in average
asset mix toward equity products,  which generally carry a higher management fee
than fixed-income assets.

Investment  management  fees  increased 2% in fiscal 2003  consistent  with a 3%
increase in simple monthly average assets under management,  partially offset by
a slight decline in our effective investment  management fee rate resulting from
a shift in average asset mix toward fixed-income products.

UNDERWRITING AND DISTRIBUTION FEES

We earn underwriting fees from the sale of some classes of sponsored  investment
products on which  investors  pay a sales  commission  at the time of  purchase.
Sales  commissions  are reduced or  eliminated on some classes of shares and for
sales to shareholders or  intermediaries  that exceed specified minimum amounts.
Therefore,  underwriting  fees will change with the overall level of gross sales
and the relative mix of sales between different share classes.

Many of our sponsored  investment  products pay distribution  fees in return for
sales,   marketing  and  distribution  efforts  on  their  behalf.  While  other
contractual  arrangements  exist in international  jurisdictions,  in the United
States,  distribution  fees  include  "12b-1  fees".  These fees are  subject to
maximum payout levels based on a percentage of the assets in each fund and other
regulatory  limitations.  We  pay a  significant  portion  of  underwriting  and
distribution fees to the financial  advisers and other  intermediaries  who sell
our  sponsored  investment  products  to the  public  on  our  behalf.  See  the
description of underwriting and distribution expenses below.

Overall,  underwriting  and  distribution  fees  increased  35% in fiscal  2004.
Underwriting fees increased 33% primarily due to a 19% increase in gross product
sales  along with a change in the sales mix.  Distribution  fees  increased  36%
consistent with a 26% increase in simple monthly average assets under management
and a change in the asset and share class mix.

Underwriting  and  distribution  fees increased 7% in fiscal 2003.  Underwriting
fees  increased  8%  primarily  due to a 12%  increase in gross  product  sales,
partially  offset by a change in the sales mix.  Distribution  fees increased 6%
consistent with a 3% increase in simple monthly average assets under  management
and a change in the asset and share class mix.

SHAREHOLDER SERVICING FEES

Shareholder  servicing fees are generally fixed charges per shareholder  account
that vary with the particular  type of fund and the service being  rendered.  In
some instances,  sponsored  investment  products are charged these fees based on
the level of assets  under  management.  We  receive  fees as  compensation  for
providing transfer agency services,  including  providing  customer  statements,
transaction  processing,  customer  service  and tax  reporting.  In the  United
States,  transfer  agency service  agreements  provide that accounts closed in a
calendar  year  remain  billable  through  the second  quarter of the  following
calendar  year at a reduced  rate.  In  Canada,  such  agreements  provide  that
accounts  closed in the calendar year remain  billable for four months after the
end of the  calendar  year.  Accordingly,  the  level of fees will vary with the
growth in new accounts and the level of closed accounts that remain billable.

Shareholder  servicing fees increased 12% in fiscal 2004. The increase  reflects
an 18%  increase  in  simple  monthly  average  billable  shareholder  accounts,
primarily due to the overall increase in number of shareholder accounts billable
under  revised  shareholder  service fee  agreements  in the United  States that
became effective on January 1, 2003,  partially offset by a decline in fee rates
chargeable  on  accounts  closed  in  the  prior  calendar  year,   under  these
agreements.

Shareholder  servicing fees increased 14% in fiscal 2003. The increase  reflects
an increase in the overall number of billable  shareholder  accounts,  partially
offset by a decline  in fee rates  chargeable  on  accounts  closed in the prior
calendar year,  under revised  shareholder  service fee agreements in the United
States that became  effective  on January 1, 2003.  The 0.7 million  shareholder
accounts  added in July  2002 as a result of the  acquisition  of  Pioneer  also
contributed to the increase in average billable accounts in fiscal 2003.

CONSOLIDATED SPONSORED INVESTMENT PRODUCTS INCOME, NET

Consolidated   sponsored  investment  products  income,  net  reflects  the  net
operating income of  majority-owned  sponsored  investment  products,  including
dividends  received.  The  increase in fiscal  2004  reflects an increase in the
number of products that have been consolidated in our results of operations.

OTHER, NET

Other,  net consists  primarily of revenues from the  banking/finance  operating
segment  as  well  as  income  from   custody   services.   Revenues   from  the
banking/finance  operating  segment include interest income on loans,  servicing
income, and investment income on banking/finance  investment securities, and are
reduced by interest expense and the provision for probable loan losses.

Other,  net decreased 8% in fiscal 2004 due to lower  realized  gains on sale of
automotive loans and decreased interest income on investments,  partially offset
by a decrease in the provision for probable loan losses  related to our consumer
lending portfolio and lower interest expense.  Other, net increased 5% in fiscal
2003 as a result of higher net interest  income and auto loan servicing  income,
partially offset by lower custody fees.

UNDERWRITING AND DISTRIBUTION

Underwriting and distribution  includes expenses paid to financial  advisers and
other third parties for selling,  distributing and providing ongoing services to
investors in our sponsored  investment  products.  Underwriting and distribution
expenses  increased  35% in fiscal  2004 and 7% in fiscal 2003  consistent  with
similar trends in underwriting and distribution revenues.

COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS

Compensation  and  benefits  increased  18% during  fiscal  2004.  The  increase
resulted  primarily  from an  increase  in bonus  expense  under the Amended and
Restated Annual Incentive Compensation Plan, which awards cash and stock bonuses
based,  in  part,  on our  performance.  In  addition,  merit  salary  increases
effective in October 2003 and additional  compensation and benefit costs related
to the  acquisition of Darby in October 2003 increased costs in fiscal 2004. The
increase  was partly  reduced  by the  decline of  retention  bonus  commitments
related to the acquisition of Fiduciary Trust Company International  ("Fiduciary
Trust")  in April  2001,  as we  fulfilled  cash  payout  obligations  under the
employee retention and transition  compensation program that were required to be
paid  within  approximately  two  years of the  acquisition  date.  We  employed
approximately  6,700 people at September  30, 2004 as compared to about 6,500 at
September 30, 2003. In order to attract and retain talented individuals,  we are
committed to keeping our salaries and benefit packages competitive,  which means
that the level of  compensation  and  benefits  may  increase  more  quickly  or
decrease more slowly than our revenues.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<PAGE>

Compensation  and  benefits  increased  1%  during  fiscal  2003.   Although  we
experienced a decrease in retention bonus commitments related to the acquisition
of Fiduciary  Trust,  we also  experienced  increases in employee  insurance and
other benefits costs in fiscal 2003. We employed  approximately  6,500 people at
September 30, 2003 compared to approximately 6,700 at September 30, 2002.

INFORMATION SYSTEMS, TECHNOLOGY AND OCCUPANCY

Information systems, technology and occupancy costs decreased 4% in fiscal 2004.
This decrease was primarily due to lower  depreciation  levels for equipment and
software related to a decrease in purchases of information system and technology
equipment as certain of our technology  equipment is periodically  replaced with
new  equipment  under  our  technology  outsourcing  agreement,  as  well  as  a
stabilization in the number and the scope of new technology project initiatives.
The decline in information  systems and technology  expense was partly offset by
an  increase  in  outside  data  services  as well as an  increase  in  building
depreciation  related  to  the  consolidation  of  our  headquarters  campus  in
accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 46,  "Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities  (revised  December  2003)"  ("FIN  46-R") in our results of  operation
effective December 31, 2003 and subsequent purchase of the property in September
2004. Information systems, technology and occupancy costs decreased 3% in fiscal
2003. This decrease was primarily due to lower depreciation levels for equipment
and software.

Details of capitalized  information  systems and  technology  costs for the last
three fiscal years were as follows:

ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION

Advertising and promotion  increased 21% during fiscal 2004 and decreased 14% in
fiscal 2003. The increase in fiscal 2004 was due to the  elimination of directed
brokerage  effective  November  28,  2003  and  higher  expenditures  on  direct
advertising campaigns and marketing materials.  We are committed to investing in
advertising  and promotion in response to changing  business  conditions,  which
means that the level of advertising and promotion expenditures may increase more
rapidly or decrease more slowly than our revenues.

AMORTIZATION OF DEFERRED SALES COMMISSIONS

Certain  fund share  classes,  including  Class B, are sold  without a front-end
sales charge to  shareholders,  although  our  distribution  subsidiaries  pay a
commission on the sale. In the United States,  Class A shares are sold without a
front-end sales charge to shareholders when minimum investment criteria are met,
and Class C shares are sold without a front-end sales charge  effective  January
1, 2004. However,  our U.S.  distribution  subsidiary pays a commission on these
sales. We defer and amortize all up-front  commissions  paid by our distribution
subsidiaries  in excess of  commissions  we receive from  shareholders,  over 12
months to 8 years depending on share class or financing arrangements.

We have  arranged  to  finance  our Class B and  certain of our Class C deferred
commission  assets  ("DCA")  arising  from  our  U.S.,   Canadian  and  European
operations through Lightning Finance Company Limited ("LFL"), a company in which
we have a 49% ownership  interest.  In the United States, LFL has entered into a
financing  agreement  with our U.S.  distribution  subsidiary  and we maintain a
continuing  interest in the assets until  resold by LFL. As a result,  we retain
DCA sold to LFL  under  the  U.S.  agreement  in our  financial  statements  and
amortize them over an 8-year period, or until sold by LFL to  third-parties.  In
contrast to the U.S.  arrangement,  LFL has entered into direct  agreements with
our Canadian and European sponsored investment products, and, as a result, we do
not record DCA from these sources on our Consolidated Balance

Sheets.  The  boards of the funds  that  offer  Class B shares  have  approved a
proposal to cease the offering of Class B shares to new  investors  and existing
shareholders   desiring  to  make   additional   purchases.   Existing  Class  B
shareholders  would  continue to be  permitted  to exchange  shares into Class B
shares of different funds. Existing Class B shareholders would also be permitted
to continue to reinvest dividends in additional Class B shares. The cessation of
purchases of Class B shares by new investors and existing  shareholders  will be
effective in the first calendar  quarter of 2005 and may have a negative  effect
on the overall sales of the funds' shares.

Amortization of deferred sales commissions increased 35% in fiscal 2004 from the
prior year  primarily due to increased  gross  product  sales.  Amortization  of
deferred  sales  commissions  increased  9% in fiscal  2003 from the prior  year
primarily due to increased  gross product sales and because LFL did not sell any
U.S.  DCA  in a  securitization  transaction  in  fiscal  2003,  while  it  sold
approximately $61.5 million U.S. DCA in fiscal 2002.

AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Amortization of intangible  assets  increased 4% in fiscal 2004 and decreased 1%
in fiscal 2003, primarily due to foreign currency movements in intangible assets
not  denominated  in U.S.  dollars.  As of March 31, 2004, we completed our most
recent   annual   impairment   test  of  goodwill   and   indefinite-lived   and
definite-lived intangible assets, and we determined that there was no impairment
to these assets as of October 1, 2003.

PROVISION FOR GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS, PROCEEDINGS AND ACTIONS

In fiscal 2004, we recognized  charges to income  aggregating  to $105.0 million
($80.6 million,  net of taxes) related to ongoing  governmental  investigations,
proceedings and actions. See also Risk Factors below.

SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 RECOVERY, NET

In January 2004, we received $32.5 million from our insurance carrier for claims
related to the September 11, 2001  terrorist  attacks that  destroyed  Fiduciary
Trust's  headquarters.  These proceeds  represented  final recoveries for claims
submitted to our insurance  carrier.  We realized a gain of $30.3 million ($18.3
million,  net of taxes).  All remaining  contingencies  related to our insurance
claims have been resolved.

OTHER INCOME (EXPENSES)

Other income  (expenses)  includes net realized and unrealized  investment gains
(losses) of consolidated  sponsored  investment  products,  investment and other
income, and interest expense. Investment and other income is comprised primarily
of dividends,  interest  income and realized gains and losses from  investments,
income from  investments  accounted for using the equity  method of  accounting,
minority interest expense, and foreign currency exchange gains and losses.

Net other income  increased to $63.0 million in fiscal 2004 as compared to $52.1
million  in  fiscal  2003  due  to  higher  net  investment   gains  related  to
consolidated  sponsored investment products and higher dividends,  interest, net
realized gains and equity method income from our  investments.  The increase was
partially offset by higher interest expense related to the issuance of five-year
senior  notes in  April  2003  and  minority  interest  expense  related  to the
consolidated sponsored investment products.

Net other  income was $52.1  million in fiscal 2003 as compared to a net expense
of $7.2  million  in  fiscal  2002 due to a $60.1  million  other-than-temporary
decline in value of some of our investments  recognized in the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2002.

TAXES ON INCOME

As a multi-national  corporation, we provide investment management services to a
wide range of international  investment  products,  often managed from locations
outside the United States. Some of these jurisdictions have lower tax rates than
the United  States.  The mix of pre-tax  income  (primarily  from our investment
management  business)  subject to these lower rates, when aggregated with income
originating  in the United States,  produces a lower overall  effective tax rate
than existing U.S.  Federal and state tax rates.  Our effective  income tax rate
for fiscal  2004  increased  to 29%  compared  to 28% in fiscal  2003 and 25% in
fiscal  2002.  The  effective  tax rate

                                       40
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

will continue to reflect the relative contributions of foreign earnings that are
subject to reduced tax rates and that are not currently included in U.S. taxable
income, as well as other factors.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</TABLE>

Liquid assets, which consist of cash and cash equivalents,  investments (trading
and  available-for-sale)  and current  receivables,  increased from fiscal 2003,
primarily  due  to  cash  provided  by  operating  activities.   Cash  and  cash
equivalents  include cash, debt  instruments  with maturities of three months or
less at the purchase date and other highly liquid  investments  that are readily
convertible into cash,  including money market funds.  Cash and cash equivalents
increased  in fiscal 2004 as we held a larger  portion of liquid  assets in debt
instruments,  primarily term deposits,  with  maturities of three months or less
from the purchase  date,  resulting in an increase in cash and cash  equivalents
and a decrease in investment securities, available-for-sale.

The increase in total debt outstanding from September 30, 2003 relates to $170.0
million of commercial paper issued in September 2004 to purchase the assets of a
lessor trust that held our corporate  headquarter  campus.  The lessor trust had
previously  been  consolidated  in our financial  statements in December 2003 in
accordance  with the guidance of FIN 46-R.  In addition,  other  long-term  debt
increased as our long-term  financing  liability  recognized in relation to U.S.
DCA financed by LFL, has  increased in fiscal 2004, as LFL has not sold any U.S.
DCA in a securitization transaction since fiscal 2002.

The increase in operating  cash flows in fiscal 2004 included  $706.7 million in
net income and $215.5 million in proceeds from the  securitization of loans held
for sale,  net of  originations.  The increase in investing cash flows in fiscal
2004 related  primarily to excess  liquidations of investments over purchases of
$1,061.2 million.  Financing  activities in fiscal 2004 included the issuance of
$170.0  million of  commercial  paper and $128.9  million in common stock option
exercises.  In addition,  during the year ended September 30, 2004, we purchased
and retired 1.3 million  shares of our common stock at a cost of $67.6  million.
At September 30, 2004,  approximately 13.2 million shares remained available for
repurchase  under board  authorizations.  We purchased  and retired 15.3 million
shares at a cost of $580.6  million,  and 3.7 million shares at a cost of $115.9
million in the years ended September 30, 2003 and 2002.

CAPITAL RESOURCES

We believe  that we can meet our present and  reasonably  foreseeable  operating
cash needs and future  commitments  through  existing liquid assets,  continuing
cash flows from operations,  borrowing capacity under current credit facilities,
the ability to issue debt or equity securities, and mutual fund sales commission
financing arrangements. In particular, we expect to finance future investment in
our  banking/finance  activities through operating cash flows,  debt,  increased
deposit base,  and through the  securitization  of a portion of the  receivables
from consumer lending activities.

As of September  30, 2004, we had $300.0  million of debt and equity  securities
available to be issued under shelf  registration  statements  filed with the SEC
and $330.0 million of additional  commercial  paper available for issuance.  Our
committed  revolving  credit  facilities  at September  30, 2004 totaled  $420.0
million,  of which, $210.0 million was under a 364-day facility expiring in June
2005. The remaining $210.0 million  facility is under a five-year  facility that
will  expire  in  June  2007.   In  addition,   at  September   30,  2004,   our
banking/finance  operating  segment had $523.6 million in available  uncommitted
short-term  bank lines  under the  Federal  Reserve  Funds  system,  the Federal
Reserve Bank discount  window,  and Federal Home Loan Bank short-term  borrowing
capacity.  Our ability to access the capital  markets in a timely manner depends
on a number of factors including our credit rating,  the condition of the global
economy,  investors'  willingness to purchase our  securities,  interest  rates,
credit  spreads  and  the  valuation  levels  of  equity  markets.   In  extreme
circumstances, we might not be able to access this liquidity readily.

Our  investment  management  segment  finances  Class B and certain  Class C DCA
arising from our U.S.,  Canadian and European  operations through LFL, a company
in which we have a 49% ownership interest.  Class B and C sales commissions that
we have financed  globally  through LFL during fiscal 2004,  were  approximately
$163.4  million  compared to $161.3  million in fiscal  2003.  LFL's  ability to
access credit facilities and the securitization  market will directly affect our
existing financing arrangements.

Our banking/finance operating segment finances its automotive lending activities
through  operational  cash  flows,  inter-segment  loans and by selling its auto
loans in  securitization  transactions  with qualified special purpose entities,
which then issue  asset-backed  securities  to private  investors.  Beginning in
fiscal 2005,  automotive lending activities may also be financed by issuing auto
loan backed variable funding notes to institutional  investors, and as a result,
we expect  that  inter-segment  lending  activities  may  decrease.  Gross  sale
proceeds  from auto loan  securitization  transactions  were  $488.5  million in
fiscal  2004 and  $464.4  million  in fiscal  2003.  Our  ability  to access the
securitization  market will  directly  affect our plans to finance the auto loan
portfolio in the future.

USES OF CAPITAL

We expect that the main uses of cash will be to expand our core  business,  make
strategic  acquisitions,  acquire shares of our common stock,  fund property and
equipment purchases, pay operating expenses of the business,  enhance technology
infrastructure and business processes,  pay shareholder  dividends and repay and
service debt.

In May 2001, we received  approximately  $490.0 million in net proceeds from the
sale of $877.0 million  principal amount at maturity of zero-coupon  convertible
senior notes due 2031 (the "Convertible  Notes").  The Convertible  Notes, which
were offered to qualified  institutional  buyers only, carry an interest rate of
1.875% per annum, with an initial  conversion premium of 43%. Each of the $1,000
(principal  amount at maturity)  Convertible  Notes is  convertible  into 9.3604
shares  of our  common  stock,  when the  price  of our  stock  reaches  certain
thresholds.  To date, we have repurchased Convertible Notes with a face value of
$5.9 million  principal  amount at maturity,  for their  accreted  value of $3.5
million,  in cash. We may redeem the remaining  Convertible Notes for cash on or
after May 11, 2006 or make additional repurchases, at the option of the holders,
on May 11 of 2006,  2011,  2016,  2021 and 2026. In this event, we may choose to
pay the accreted value of the Convertible  Notes in cash or shares of our common
stock.  The amount  that the  holders  may redeem in the future  will depend on,
among other factors, the performance of our common stock.

/1   Operating  lease  obligations  are  presented  net of  future  receipts  on
     contractual  sublease  arrangements  totaling $44.3 million as of September
     30, 2004.
/2   Purchase  obligations  include  contractual  amounts  that  will  be due to
     purchase  goods  and  services  to be  used  in our  operations  and may be
     cancelled at earlier times than those  indicated  under certain  conditions
     that may include  termination  fees. In  particular,  under an agreement to
     outsource  management of our data center and distributed  server operations
     that we can  terminate  any time after July 1, 2006,  we estimate  that the
     termination fee payable in July 2006, not including  costs  associated with
     assuming  equipment  leases,  would  approximate  $14.3  million  and would
     decrease  each month for the  subsequent  two years,  reaching a payment of
     approximately $2.2 million in July 2008.
/3   Defined benefit plan obligation  relates to our expected  contribution to a
     noncontributory  retirement plan and a nonqualified  supplemental plan that
     will be made when the final approval of the noncontributory retirement plan
     termination is received from the Internal Revenue Service.
/4   Capital contribution  commitments relate to our contractual  commitments to
     fund certain of our sponsored investment products.

CONTINGENT OBLIGATIONS

In relation to the auto loan  securitization  transactions  that we have entered
into with a number of qualified  special purpose  entities,  we are obligated to
cover shortfalls in amounts due to the holders of the notes up to certain levels
as specified under the related agreements. As of September 30, 2004, the maximum
potential  amount of future  payments was $23.6  million  relating to guarantees
made prior to January 1, 2003. In addition,  our  consolidated  balance sheet at
September  30, 2004  included a $0.6 million  liability  to reflect  obligations
arising from auto securitization transactions subsequent to December 31, 2002.

At  September  30,  2004,  the  banking/finance  operating  segment  had  issued
financial standby letters of credit totaling $2.5 million on which beneficiaries
would be able to draw upon in the  event of  non-performance  by our  customers,
primarily in relation to lease and lien obligations of these banking  customers.
These standby  letters of credit,  issued prior to January 1, 2003, were secured
by marketable  securities  with a fair value of $2.1 million as of September 30,
2004 and commercial real estate.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

As discussed  above, we obtain  financing for sales  commissions  that we pay to
broker/dealers  on Class B and  certain  Class C shares  through  LFL, a company
established  in  Ireland  to  provide  DCA  financing.  We hold a 49%  ownership
interest  in LFL and we account  for this  ownership  interest  using the equity
method of  accounting.  Our exposure to loss related to our investment in LFL is
limited to the carrying value of our investment and loans, and interest and fees
receivable  from LFL. At September 30, 2004,  those amounts  approximated  $53.2
million.  During fiscal 2004, we  recognized a pre-tax  charge of  approximately
$1.8 million for our share of its net loss over this period.


                                       43
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<PAGE>

As discussed above, our  banking/finance  operating segment  periodically enters
into  auto loan  securitization  transactions  with  qualified  special  purpose
entities,  which then issue asset-backed  securities to private  investors.  Our
main objective in entering in securitization transactions is to obtain financing
for auto loan activities.  Securitized loans held by the  securitization  trusts
totaled $768.9 million at September 30, 2004 and $680.7 million at September 30,
2003.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Our financial  statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with
generally accepted  accounting  principles in the United States. The preparation
of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that
impact our financial  position and results of  operations.  These  estimates and
assumptions  are affected by our  application of accounting  policies.  Below we
describe certain critical  accounting  policies that we believe are important to
understanding  our results of operations  and financial  position.  In addition,
please  refer to Note 1 to the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  for further
discussion of our accounting policies.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

At September 30, 2004 our assets included intangible assets as follows:

(in millions)
                                                             NET CARRYING AMOUNT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Goodwill                                                                $1,381.8
Intangible assets - definite-lived                                         191.7
Intangible assets - indefinite-lived                                       479.8
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOTAL                                                                   $2,053.3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We make  significant  estimates and assumptions  when valuing goodwill and other
intangibles  in  connection  with the initial  purchase  price  allocation of an
acquired  entity,  as well as when  evaluating  impairment of  intangibles on an
ongoing basis.

Under Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other
Intangible  Assets",  we are  required  to test the fair value of  goodwill  and
indefinite-lived  intangibles  when there is an indication of impairment,  or at
least once a year.  Goodwill impairment is indicated when the carrying amount of
a reporting unit exceeds its implied fair value, calculated based on anticipated
discounted  cash flows.  In estimating the fair value of the reporting  unit, we
use  valuation  techniques  based on  discounted  cash  flows  similar to models
employed in analyzing the purchase price of an acquisition target.

Intangible  assets  subject to  amortization  are reviewed for impairment on the
basis of the expected future undiscounted operating cash flows, without interest
charges,  to be derived from these assets. We review  definite-lived  intangible
assets for  impairment  when there is an indication of  impairment,  or at least
once a year.

During the quarter ended March 31, 2004, we completed our annual impairment test
of goodwill and  indefinite-lived  and  definite-lived  intangible assets and we
determined that there was no impairment to these assets as of October 1, 2003.

In performing our analysis,  we used certain assumptions and estimates including
those related to discount rates and the expected  future period of cash flows to
be derived from the assets, based on, among other factors, historical trends and
the  characteristics  of the  assets.  While we  believe  that our  testing  was
appropriate,  if these estimates and assumptions change in the future, we may be
required  to  record  impairment  charges  or  otherwise  increase  amortization
expense.

INCOME TAXES

As a  multinational  corporation,  we operate in various  locations  outside the
United  States.  As of September 30, 2004, and based on tax laws in effect as of
this  date,  it is our  intention  to  continue  to  indefinitely  reinvest  the
undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries.  As a result, we have not made a
provision for U.S.  taxes and have not recorded a deferred tax liability on $2.5
billion of cumulative undistributed earnings recorded by


                                       44
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<PAGE>

foreign  subsidiaries  as of  September  30,  2004.  Changes  to our  policy  of
reinvesting  foreign  earnings may have a  significant  effect on our  financial
condition and results of operation.

The  American  Jobs  Creation  Act of 2004 (the  "Act") was  signed  into law on
October  22,  2004.  Under a provision  of the Act,  we may elect to  repatriate
certain  earnings  of our  foreign-based  subsidiaries  at a reduced tax rate in
either of our fiscal years ending  September  30, 2005 or September 30, 2006. We
are currently evaluating the effect of this repatriation provision;  however, we
do not expect to complete this evaluation  until after the U.S.  Congress or the
U.S.  Department  of the  Treasury  issue  additional  guidance  regarding  this
provision.  The range of possible amounts we are considering for repatriation is
between zero and $1.9 billion and the potential  range of income tax  associated
with amounts subject to the reduced rate is between zero and $117.0 million.

VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS

We record  substantially  all  investments  in our financial  statements at fair
value or amounts that  approximate fair value.  Where  available,  we use prices
from independent  sources such as listed market prices or broker or dealer price
quotations.  For  investments in illiquid and privately held  securities that do
not  have  readily  determinable  fair  values,  we  estimate  the  value of the
securities based upon available information.  However, even where the value of a
security is derived from an independent  market price or broker or dealer quote,
some  assumptions may be required to determine the fair value.  For example,  we
generally assume that the size of positions in securities that we hold would not
be large enough to affect the quoted price of the securities when sold, and that
any such sale would happen in an orderly manner.  However, these assumptions may
be incorrect and the actual value realized on sale could differ from the current
carrying value.

We  evaluate  our  investments  for  other-than-temporary  decline in value on a
periodic basis. This may exist when the fair value of an investment security has
been below the  current  value for an  extended  period of time.  As most of our
investments  are carried at fair value,  if an  other-than-temporary  decline in
value is determined to exist, the unrealized investment loss recorded net of tax
in accumulated other comprehensive income is realized as a charge to net income,
in the period in which the other-than-temporary  decline in value is determined.
In fiscal 2002, we recognized $60.1 million for an other-than-temporary  decline
in the value of certain  investments.  We classify securities as trading when it
is  management's  intent at the time of purchase to sell the  security  within a
short  period of time.  Accordingly,  we record  unrealized  gains and losses on
these securities in our consolidated income.

While  we   believe   that  we  have   accurately   estimated   the   amount  of
other-than-temporary  decline in value in our portfolio,  different  assumptions
could result in changes to the recorded amounts in our financial statements.

LOSS CONTINGENCIES

We are involved in various lawsuits and claims  encountered in the normal course
of business. When such a matter arises and periodically  thereafter,  we consult
with our legal  counsel and  evaluate the merits of the claim based on the facts
available at that time. In management's  opinion,  an adequate  accrual has been
made as of September 30, 2004 to provide for any probable  losses that may arise
from these matters.  See also "Legal Proceedings"  included in Part I, Item 3 of
this report and "Risk Factors" below.

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

Under FIN 46-R,  a variable  interest  entity  ("VIE") is an entity in which the
equity investment holders have not contributed sufficient capital to finance its
activities  or the  equity  investment  holders do not have  defined  rights and
obligations  normally  associated with an equity  investment.  FIN 46-R requires
consolidation  of a VIE by the enterprise that has the majority of the risks and
rewards of ownership, referred to as the primary beneficiary.

Evaluating  whether  related  entities are VIEs and determining if we qualify as
the primary beneficiary of these VIEs, is highly complex and involves the use of
estimates and  assumptions.  To determine our interest in the expected losses or
residual  returns of each VIE, we performed an expected cash flow analysis using
certain discount rate and volatility  assumptions based on available  historical
information  and  management's  estimates.  Based  on our  analysis,  we did not
consolidate any VIEs in our financial statements as of September 30, 2004. While
we believe that our testing and approach  were  appropriate,  future  changes in
estimates and assumptions may affect our decision and lead to the  consolidation
of one or more VIEs in our financial statements.

IMPACT OF INFLATION

Our  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  and  related  Notes are  presented  in
historical  dollars  without  considering  the  effect  of  inflation.  Since  a
significant  portion of our assets are liquid in nature, the potential effect of
inflation is  mitigated.  In addition,  the majority of our revenues and related
expenses  are  denominated  in U.S.  dollars,  a  currency  that  has  not  been
significantly  affected by the impact of changes in prices in recent  years.  To
the extent that a potential  rise in inflation may affect the securities and the
consumer  lending markets,  it may adversely  affect our financial  position and
results of operation in the future.

RISK FACTORS

WE FACE STRONG  COMPETITION  FROM NUMEROUS AND SOMETIMES  LARGER  COMPANIES.  We
compete with  numerous  investment  management  companies,  stock  brokerage and
investment  banking  firms,   insurance  companies,   banks,  savings  and  loan
associations and other financial institutions.  Continuing  consolidation in the
financial  services  industry  has created  stronger  competitors  with  greater
financial   resources   and  broader   distribution   channels   than  our  own.
Additionally,   competing  securities   broker/dealers  whom  we  rely  upon  to
distribute our mutual funds also sell their own proprietary funds and investment
products,  which could limit the distribution of our investment products. To the
extent   that   existing   or   potential   customers,    including   securities
broker/dealers,   decide  to  invest  in  or  distribute  the  products  of  our
competitors, the sales of our products as well as our market share, revenues and
net income could decline.

                                       47
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<PAGE>

CHANGES  IN THE  DISTRIBUTION  CHANNELS  ON WHICH WE  DEPEND  COULD  REDUCE  OUR
REVENUES AND HINDER OUR GROWTH.  We derive  nearly all of our fund sales through
broker/dealers and other similar investment advisers. Increasing competition for
these distribution channels and recent regulatory  initiatives,  have caused our
distribution  costs to rise and could  cause  further  increases  in the future.
Higher distribution costs lower our net revenues and earnings.  Additionally, if
one of the major  financial  advisers who  distribute our products were to cease
their operations, it could have a significant adverse impact on our revenues and
earnings.  Moreover,  our failure to maintain strong business relationships with
these  advisers  would impair our ability to  distribute  and sell our products,
which  would have a  negative  effect on our level of assets  under  management,
related revenues and overall business and financial condition.

WE HAVE  BECOME  SUBJECT TO AN  INCREASED  RISK OF  VOLATILITY  OF THE ASSETS WE
MANAGE  CAUSED BY CHANGES IN THE FINANCIAL  AND EQUITY  MARKETS.  We have become
subject to an increased  risk of asset  volatility  from changes in the domestic
and  global  financial  and  equity  markets  due to the  continuing  threat  of
terrorism. Declines in these markets have caused in the past, and would cause in
the future, a decline in our revenue and income.

THE LEVELS OF OUR ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT, WHICH IMPACT REVENUES, ARE SUBJECT TO
SIGNIFICANT  FLUCTUATIONS.  Global  economic  conditions,  changes in the equity
market place, interest rates, inflation rates, the yield curve and other factors
that are  difficult to predict  affect the mix,  market values and levels of our
assets under  management.  Changing  market  conditions may cause a shift in our
asset mix towards fixed-income products and a related decline in our revenue and
income,  since we  generally  derive  higher fee revenues and income from equity
assets than from  fixed-income  products we manage.  Similarly,  our securitized
consumer receivables business is subject to marketplace  fluctuation,  including
economic and credit market downturns.

WE  FACE  RISKS  ASSOCIATED  WITH  CONDUCTING  OPERATIONS  IN  NUMEROUS  FOREIGN
COUNTRIES.  We sell  mutual  funds and offer  investment  advisory  and  related
services in many different regulatory jurisdictions around the world, and intend
to  continue  to expand  our  operations  internationally.  Regulators  in these
jurisdictions  could  change  their  policies  or laws in a  manner  that  might
restrict or otherwise  impede our ability to distribute  or register  investment
products in their respective markets.

OUR  ABILITY TO  SUCCESSFULLY  INTEGRATE  WIDELY  VARIED  BUSINESS  LINES CAN BE
IMPEDED BY SYSTEMS AND OTHER TECHNOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS. Our continued success in
effectively  managing and growing our  business  both  domestically  and abroad,
depends  on  our  ability  to  integrate  the  varied   accounting,   financial,
information and operational systems of our various businesses on a global basis.

OUR  INABILITY TO MEET CASH NEEDS COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE  EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND BUSINESS  OPERATIONS.  Our ability to meet  anticipated cash needs
depends  upon  factors  including  our  asset  value,  our  creditworthiness  as
perceived by lenders and the market value of our stock.  Similarly,  our ability
to securitize and hedge future loan portfolios and credit card receivables,  and
to obtain continued financing for certain Class C shares, is also subject to the
market's perception of those assets,  finance rates offered by competitors,  and
the general  market for private debt. If we are unable to obtain these funds and
financing,  we may be forced to incur unanticipated costs or revise our business
plans.

CERTAIN OF THE PORTFOLIOS WE MANAGE,  INCLUDING OUR EMERGING MARKET  PORTFOLIOS,
AND RELATED  REVENUES ARE  VULNERABLE TO  MARKET-SPECIFIC  POLITICAL OR ECONOMIC
RISKS.  Our emerging market  portfolios and revenues derived from managing these
portfolios  are  subject  to  significant  risks  of  loss  from  political  and
diplomatic developments,  currency fluctuations,  social instability, changes in
governmental  polices,  expropriation,  nationalization,  asset confiscation and
changes in legislation  related to foreign  ownership.  Foreign trading markets,
particularly in some emerging market  countries are often smaller,  less liquid,
less  regulated  and  significantly  more  volatile  than  the  U.S.  and  other
established markets.

DIVERSE AND STRONG  COMPETITION  LIMITS THE INTEREST RATES THAT WE CAN CHARGE ON
CONSUMER LOANS.  We compete with many types of institutions  for consumer loans,
which  can  provide  loans  at  significantly  below-market  interest  rates  in
connection  with  automobile  sales or in some cases zero  interest  rates.  Our
inability  to compete  effectively  against  these  companies or to maintain our
relationships with the various automobile dealers through whom we offer consumer
loans could limit the growth of our consumer loan business.  Economic and credit
market downturns could reduce the ability of our customers to repay loans, which
could cause our consumer loan portfolio losses to increase.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO FEDERAL  RESERVE  BOARD  REGULATION.  Upon  completion  of our
acquisition of Fiduciary  Trust in April 2001, we became a bank holding  company
and a financial holding company subject to the supervision and regulation of the
Federal  Reserve  Board  (the  "FRB").  We  are  subject  to  the  restrictions,
limitations,  or  prohibitions  of the Bank Holding  Company Act of 1956 and the
Gramm-Leach-Bliley   Act.  The  FRB  may  impose   additional   limitations   or
restrictions  on our  activities,  including if the FRB believes  that we do not
have the appropriate  financial and managerial  resources to commence or conduct
an activity or make an acquisition.

TECHNOLOGY AND OPERATING RISK AND LIMITATIONS COULD CONSTRAIN OUR OPERATIONS. We
are highly dependent on the integrity of our technology,  operating  systems and
premises.  Although we have in place certain  disaster  recovery  plans,  we may
experience  system delays and  interruptions  as a result of natural  disasters,
power failures,  acts of war, and third party failures,  which could  negatively
impact our operations.

GOVERNMENTAL  INVESTIGATIONS,  SETTLEMENTS OF SUCH  INVESTIGATIONS,  ONGOING AND
PROPOSED  GOVERNMENTAL  ACTIONS, AND REGULATORY  EXAMINATIONS OF THE COMPANY AND
ITS BUSINESS ACTIVITIES AS WELL AS CIVIL LITIGATION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO
SUCH MATTERS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT,  INCREASE COSTS
AND  NEGATIVELY  IMPACT THE  PROFITABILITY  OF THE COMPANY AND FUTURE  FINANCIAL
RESULTS.  As part of  various  investigations  by the  Securities  and  Exchange
Commission  ("SEC"),  the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California,
the New  York  Attorney  General,  the  California  Attorney  General,  the U.S.
Attorney  for the  District of  Massachusetts,  the  Securities  Division of the
Office of the  Secretary  of the  Commonwealth  of  Massachusetts,  the  Florida
Department of Financial  Services and the  Commissioner of Securities,  the West
Virginia  Attorney  General,  the  Vermont  Department  of  Banking,  Insurance,
Securities,  and Health Care  Administration  and the  National  Association  of
Securities Dealers,  Inc. ("NASD"),  relating to certain practices in the mutual
fund  industry,  including  late trading,  market  timing and marketing  support
payments to securities dealers who sell fund shares,  Franklin  Resources,  Inc.
and  certain  of its  subsidiaries  (as  used in  this  section,  together,  the
"Company"), as well as certain current or former executives and employees of the
Company,  received  requests  for  information  and/or  subpoenas  to testify or
produce documents.  The Company and its current employees provided documents and
information  in response to these  requests  and  subpoenas.  In  addition,  the
Company responded, and in one instance is currently responding,  to requests for
similar kinds of information from regulatory  authorities in some of the foreign
countries where the Company conducts its global asset management business.

Franklin  Templeton  Investments Corp.  ("FTIC"),  a Company  subsidiary and the
investment  manager of Franklin  Templeton's  Canadian  mutual  Funds,  has been
cooperating  with and  responding to requests for  information  from the Ontario
Securities  Commission  (the  "OSC")  relating  to the OSC's  review of frequent
trading  practices  within the Canadian  mutual fund  industry.  On December 10,
2004,  FTIC  received  a  letter  indicating  that  the  staff  of  the  OSC  is
contemplating  enforcement  proceedings  against  FTIC  before  the OSC.  In its
letter,  the OSC staff expressed the view that, over the period of February 1999
to February 2003, there were certain accounts that engaged in a frequent trading
market timing  strategy in certain funds being managed by FTIC.  The letter also
gave FTIC the  opportunity  to respond to the issues raised in the letter and to
provide the OSC staff with additional information relevant to these matters. The
Company  expects  to enter into  discussions  with the OSC staff in an effort to
resolve the issues raised in the OSC's review.  The Company  cannot  predict the
likelihood of whether  those  discussions  will result in a  settlement,  or the
terms of any such settlement.

On December 9, 2004, the staff of the NASD informed the Company that it has made
a  preliminary  determination  to recommend a  disciplinary  proceeding  against
Franklin/Templeton  Distributors,  Inc.  ("FTDI"),  alleging  that FTDI violated
certain NASD rules by the use of directed brokerage commissions to pay for sales
and marketing  support.  FTDI has also received a separate  letter from the NASD
staff advising FTDI of the NASD staff's preliminary determination to recommend a
disciplinary  proceeding  against FTDI alleging  violation of certain NASD rules
relating to FTDI's Top  Producers  program.  The Company  believes that any such
charges are unwarranted.

On August 2, 2004,  Franklin  Resources,  Inc.  announced  that its  subsidiary,
Franklin Advisers,  Inc. ("Franklin Advisers") reached an agreement with the SEC
that  resolved  the  issues   resulting  from  the   previously   disclosed  SEC
investigation  into market timing  activity.  In connection with that agreement,
the  SEC  issued  an  "Order  instituting  administrative  and  cease-and-desist
proceedings  pursuant to sections  203(e) and 203(k) of the Investment  Advisers
Act of 1940 and sections  9(b) and 9(f) of the  Investment  Company Act of 1940,
making  findings and imposing  remedial  sanctions and a cease and desist order"
(the "Order").  The SEC's Order


                                       49
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<PAGE>


concerned the activities of a limited number of third parties that ended in 2000
and  those  that were the  subject  of the  first  Massachusetts  administrative
complaint described below.

Under the terms of the SEC's Order,  pursuant to which Franklin Advisers neither
admitted nor denied any of the findings  contained  therein,  Franklin  Advisers
agreed to pay $50 million to be  distributed to  shareholders  of certain of the
Franklin  Templeton  mutual  funds  ("Funds"),  of which $20 million was a civil
penalty.  The  settlement  was  provided  for as part of a charge of $60 million
($45.6  million,  net of taxes)  recorded in the fiscal  quarter ended March 31,
2004.  This  charge  represented  the  Company's  estimate  of  the  anticipated
settlement and related legal and distribution costs.

The Order required Franklin Advisers to, among other things:

     *    Enhance and periodically  review  compliance  policies and procedures,
          and establish a corporate ombudsman;
     *    Establish a new internal position whose responsibilities shall include
          compliance matters related to conflicts of interests; and
     *    Retain an  Independent  Distribution  Consultant  to develop a plan to
          distribute the $50 million settlement to Fund shareholders.

The Order  further  provided  that in any  related  investor  actions,  Franklin
Advisers would not benefit from any offset or reduction of any investor's  claim
by the amount of any distribution from the  above-described  $50 million to such
investor  that is  proportionately  attributable  to the civil  penalty  paid by
Franklin Advisers.

On September  20,  2004,  Franklin  Resources,  Inc.  announced  that two of its
subsidiaries,   Franklin  Advisers,  Inc.  and  Franklin  Templeton  Alternative
Strategies,  Inc. ("FTAS"), reached an agreement with the Securities Division of
the Office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts  (the "State of
Massachusetts")  related to the  previously-disclosed  administrative  complaint
filed on February 4, 2004. The administrative  complaint  concerned one instance
of market timing that was also a subject of the August 2, 2004  settlement  that
Franklin Advisers reached with the SEC, as described above.

Under  the  terms  of the  settlement  consent  order  issued  by the  State  of
Massachusetts,  Franklin Advisers and FTAS consented to the entry of a cease and
desist order and agreed to pay a $5 million  administrative fine to the State of
Massachusetts (the  "Massachusetts  Consent Order").  Franklin  Resources,  Inc.
recorded this expense in the quarter ended September 30, 2004. The Massachusetts
Consent  Order  included  two  different  sections:  "Statements  of  Fact"  and
"Violations  of  Massachusetts  Securities  Laws."  Franklin  Advisers  and FTAS
admitted the facts in the Statements of Fact.

On October 25, 2004, the State of  Massachusetts  filed a second  administrative
complaint, alleging that Franklin Resources, Inc.'s Form 8-K filing (in which it
described  the  Massachusetts  Consent  Order and stated that  "Franklin did not
admit  or deny  engaging  in any  wrongdoing")  failed  to state  that  Franklin
Advisers and FTAS admitted the  Statements of Fact portion of the  Massachusetts
Consent  Order (the "Second  Complaint").  Franklin  Resources,  Inc.  reached a
second agreement with the State of Massachusetts on November 19, 2004, resolving
the Second Complaint. As a result of the November 19, 2004 settlement,  Franklin
Resources,  Inc. filed a new Form 8-K. The terms of the original  settlement did
not  change  and  there  was  no  monetary  fine  associated  with  this  second
settlement.

On November 17, 2004,  Franklin  Resources,  Inc. announced that FTDI reached an
agreement  with the  CAGO,  resolving  the  issues  resulting  from  the  CAGO's
investigation  concerning  sales and  marketing  support  payments.  The Company
believes  that the  settlement of the CAGO matter is in the best interest of the
Company  and its Fund  shareholders.  Under  the terms of the  settlement,  FTDI
neither  admitted nor denied the allegations in the CAGO's  complaint and agreed
to pay $2 million as a civil penalty,  $14 million to Franklin  Templeton  funds
and $2 million to the CAGO for its investigative costs.

As a result of the CAGO settlement,  the results for the quarter and fiscal year
ended  September 30, 2004 announced on October 28, 2004 were adjusted to include
an additional  charge to income of $18.5 million  ($12.2  million,  net of tax).
This  adjustment  was made in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting
principles in the United States,  which require the Company to update  estimates
when  additional  information  becomes  available after the end of the reporting
period but prior to the  issuance of the  financial  statements  with respect to
loss contingencies that existed as of the date of the financial statements.

On December 13, 2004, Franklin  Resources,  Inc. announced that its subsidiaries
FTDI and Franklin  Advisers  reached an agreement  with the SEC,  resolving  the
issues  resulting  from the SEC's  investigation  concerning  marketing  support
payments to securities  dealers who sell Fund shares.  In  connection  with that
agreement,   the  SEC   issued  an   "Order   Instituting   Administrative   and
Cease-and-Desist  Proceedings,  Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions
Pursuant to Section  203(e) and 203(k) of the  Investment  Advisers Act of 1940,
Sections 9(b) and 9(f) of the Investment  Company Act of 1940, and Section 15(b)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Order").

The Company  believes that the settlement of this matter is in the best interest
of the Company and its Fund shareholders. Under the terms of the Order, in which
FTDI and Franklin  Advisers neither  admitted nor denied the findings  contained
therein,  they  agreed  to pay the  Funds a  penalty  of $20  million  and $1 in
disgorgement.  FTDI and  Franklin  Advisers  also  agreed to  implement  certain
measures   and   undertakings   relating  to  marketing   support   payments  to
broker-dealers  for the  promotion  or sale of  Fund  shares,  including  making
additional  disclosures in the Funds'  Prospectuses and Statements of Additional
Information.  The Order  further  requires  the  appointment  of an  independent
distribution consultant,  at the Company's expense, who shall develop a plan for
the distribution of the penalty and disgorgement to the Funds. A charge of $21.5
million ($17.3 million,  net of taxes) was recorded by the Company in its fiscal
quarter ended June 30, 2004 related to this matter.

INTERNAL  INQUIRIES.  The Company also  conducted its own internal  fact-finding
inquiry with the  assistance  of outside  counsel to determine  whether any Fund
shareholders,  including  Company  employees,  were  permitted to engage in late
trading  or in  market  timing  transactions  contrary  to the  policies  of the
affected Fund and, if so, the circumstances and persons involved.  The Company's
internal inquiry  regarding  market timing and late trading is complete.  We did
not find any late trading,  though we identified  various  instances of frequent
trading.  One officer of a subsidiary of Franklin Resources,  Inc. was placed on
administrative  leave  and  subsequently  resigned  from his  position  with the
Company in December 2003.

We found no instances  of  inappropriate  mutual fund  trading by any  portfolio
manager, investment analyst or officer of Franklin Resources, Inc. As previously
disclosed,  the Company  identified some instances of frequent trading in shares
of certain Funds by a few current or former  employees in their personal  401(k)
plan  accounts.  These  individuals  included  one trader and one officer of the
Funds.  Pending  our  further  inquiry,  these two  individuals  were  placed on
administrative leave and the officer resigned from his positions with the Funds.
The independent directors of the Funds and the Company also retained independent
outside  counsel  to review  these  matters  and to report  their  findings  and
recommendations.  Based on independent  counsel's findings and  recommendations,
the Company reinstated the trader.  The independent  counsel concluded that some
instances of the former Fund officer's trading violated Company policy,  and the
Company was prepared to institute appropriate disciplinary action. Subsequently,
the former Fund officer  resigned  from his  employment  with the  Company.  The
Company does not believe  there were any losses to the Funds as a result of this
trading.

CLASS ACTION AND OTHER LAWSUITS. The Company has been named in shareholder class
and other actions  related to some of the matters  described  above.  See "Legal
Proceedings" included in Part I, Item 3 of this report. Management believes that
the claims  made in the  lawsuits  are without  merit and intends to  vigorously
defend  against them. It is possible that the Company may be named in additional
similar civil actions related to some of the matters described above.

REGULATORY OR LEGISLATIVE  ACTIONS AND REFORMS,  PARTICULARLY THOSE SPECIFICALLY
FOCUSED ON THE MUTUAL FUND  INDUSTRY,  COULD  ADVERSELY  IMPACT OUR ASSETS UNDER
MANAGEMENT,  INCREASE  COSTS AND  NEGATIVELY  IMPACT  THE  PROFITABILITY  OF THE
COMPANY AND FUTURE FINANCIAL RESULTS. Pending regulatory and legislative actions
and reforms  affecting the mutual fund industry may  significantly  increase the
Company's costs of doing business and/or negatively impact its revenues,  either
of which  could  have a  material  negative  impact on the  Company's  financial
results.

ITEM 7A.   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

In the normal course of business,  our  financial  position is subject to market
risk: the potential  loss due to changes in the value of  investments  including
those resulting from adverse changes in interest rates,  foreign exchange and/or
equity prices.  Management is responsible for managing this risk. Our Enterprise
Risk  Management  Committee is  responsible  for providing a framework to assist
management to identify, assess and manage market and other risks.


                                       51

Our  banking/finance  operating segment is exposed to interest rate fluctuations
on its loans receivable,  debt securities held, and deposit liabilities.  In our
banking/finance  operating segment,  we monitor the net interest rate margin and
the average maturity of interest earning assets, as well as funding sources.  In
addition,  as of September 30, 2004, we have considered the potential  impact of
the effect on the banking/finance  operating segment balances,  individually and
collectively, of a 100 basis point (1%) movement in market interest rates. Based
on our analysis,  we do not expect that this change would have a material impact
on our operating revenues or results of operations in either scenario.

Our investment  management  operating  segment is exposed to changes in interest
rates through its  investment in debt  securities and its  outstanding  debt. We
minimize the impact of interest rate fluctuations  related to our investments in
debt  securities  by managing the  maturities of these  securities,  and through
diversification.  Our  exposure to  interest  rate  changes  related to our debt
issuances is not material since a significant percentage of our outstanding debt
is at fixed interest rates.

We are subject to foreign  exchange  risk  through our  foreign  operations.  We
operate  primarily  in the United  States,  but also  provide  services and earn
revenues  in Canada,  the  Bahamas,  Europe,  Asia,  South  America,  Africa and
Australia.   Our  exposure  to  foreign  exchange  risk  is  minimized  since  a
significant portion of these revenues and associated expenses are denominated in
U.S. dollars.  This situation may change in the future as our business continues
to grow outside the United States.

We are exposed to equity price fluctuations  through securities we hold that are
carried at fair value and through  investments held by majority-owned  sponsored
investment  products that we  consolidate.  To mitigate this risk, we maintain a
diversified  investment portfolio.  Our exposure to equity price fluctuations is
also  minimized  as we sponsor a broad range of  investment  products in various
global jurisdictions.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

We derive the majority of our revenues and net income from providing  investment
management,  administration,  distribution and related services to the Franklin,
Templeton,  Mutual Series,  Bissett,  Fiduciary  Trust and Darby Overseas funds,
institutional, high net-worth and other investment products, collectively called
our sponsored investment products. Services to our sponsored investment products
are provided under  contracts that set forth the level and nature of the fees to
be charged for these  services.  The majority of our  revenues  relate to mutual
fund products that are subject to contracts that are  periodically  reviewed and
approved  by  each  mutual  fund's  Board  of   Directors/Trustees   and/or  its
shareholders.  Currently,  no single  sponsored  investment  product's  revenues
represent more than 10% of total revenues.

BASIS OF  PRESENTATION.  The consolidated  financial  statements are prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of
America, which require us to estimate certain amounts. Actual amounts may differ
from these  estimates.  Certain  comparative  amounts  for prior years have been
reclassified to conform to the fiscal 2004 financial statement presentation.

The  consolidated   financial   statements  include  the  accounts  of  Franklin
Resources,  Inc. and its subsidiaries  ("Franklin Templeton  Investments").  All
material  inter-company  accounts and transactions  have been eliminated  except
that we have not  eliminated  the  receivable  from  banking/finance  group  and
payable to parent from our Consolidated  Balance Sheets which represent balances
outstanding  related to the funding of banking  activities,  including  auto and
credit card loan  financing.  In addition,  the related  inter-company  interest
expense is included in other, net revenue and the inter-company  interest income
is included in  investment  and other income in our  Consolidated  Statements of
Income (see Note 20). This treatment provides additional  information on funding
sources available to the banking/finance group and on its operations.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS include cash on hand, demand deposits with banks, debt
instruments  with  maturities  of three months or less at the purchase  date and
other highly liquid investments, including money market funds, which are readily
convertible into cash.

INVESTMENT  SECURITIES,  TRADING  are  carried at fair  value  based on the last
reported  net  asset  value  with  changes  in  fair  value  recognized  in  our
consolidated  net  income.   Trading  securities  include  investments  held  by
majority-owned  sponsored  investment  products  that  are  consolidated  in our
financial statements.

INVESTMENT SECURITIES, AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE are carried at fair value. Fair values
for  investments  in our  sponsored  investment  products  are based on the last
reported net asset  value.  Fair values for other  investments  are based on the
last reported price on the exchange on which they are traded. Realized gains and
losses  are  included  in  investment   income   currently   based  on  specific
identification.  Unrealized  gains and losses are recorded net of tax as part of
accumulated other comprehensive income until realized.

When the cost of an investment  exceeds its fair value, we review the investment
for an  other-than-temporary  decline in value. In making the  determination  of
whether the decline is  other-than-temporary,  we use a  systematic  methodology
that includes  consideration  of the duration and extent to which the fair value
is less than cost, the financial  condition of the investee,  including industry
and sector performance,  and our intent and ability to hold the investment. When
a decline in fair value of an  available-for-sale  security is  determined to be
other-than-temporary,  the  unrealized  loss recorded net of tax in  accumulated
other comprehensive income is realized as a charge to net income.

DERIVATIVES. Generally, we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments
for trading purposes.  Periodically, we enter into interest-rate swap agreements
to reduce variable  interest-rate exposure with respect to our commercial paper,
designated  as cash flow hedges,  and to hedge  exposures or modify the interest
rate  characteristics of fixed-rate  borrowings with maturities in excess of one
year,  designated  as fair value  hedges.  As of  September  30,  2004,  we held
interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $51.7 million and these were
reported at their fair value of $1.4 million.

We periodically  enter into spot and forward currency  contracts as principal to
facilitate client transactions and, on limited occasions,  hold currency options
for our own account.  It is our policy that  substantially all forward contracts
be  covered  no later than the close of  business  each day.  Gains or losses on
these  contracts are  reflected in the  Consolidated  Statements of Income.  The
gross fair market value of all  contracts  outstanding  that had a positive fair
market value represents a credit exposure to the extent that counterparties fail
to settle

                                       62
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<PAGE>

their  contractual  obligations.  This  risk is  mitigated  by the use of master
netting  agreements,   careful  evaluation  of  counterparty  credit  standings,
diversification and limits. Credit exposure was not significant at September 30,
2004.

From time to time,  we sell put options  giving the  purchaser the right to sell
shares of our  common  stock to us at a  specified  price upon  exercise  of the
options on the designated  expiration  dates if certain  conditions are met. The
likelihood  that we will have to purchase  our stock and the  purchase  price is
contingent on the market value of our stock when the put option contract becomes
exercisable.  These put options  are carried at fair value with  changes in fair
value recognized in our  consolidated  net income.  At September 30, 2004, there
were no put options outstanding.

LOANS RECEIVABLE.  Our banking/finance  group offers retail-banking and consumer
lending services.  We accrue interest on loans using the simple interest method.
The majority of retail-banking  loans are at variable rates,  which are adjusted
periodically. Loans originated and intended for sale are carried at the lower of
cost or estimated fair value in the aggregate.  Net unrealized  losses,  if any,
are recognized through a valuation allowance included in other, net revenues.

ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES. An allowance for probable loan losses on our consumer
loan  portfolio is maintained at a level  sufficient to absorb  probable  losses
inherent in the loan  portfolio.  Probable losses are estimated for the consumer
loan portfolio  based on  contractual  delinquency  status and  historical  loss
experience.  The  allowance  on our consumer  portfolio  is based on  aggregated
portfolio segment evaluations, generally by loan type, and reflects our judgment
of  portfolio  risk  factors  such as economic  conditions,  bankruptcy  trends,
product  mix,  geographic  concentrations  and other  similar  items.  A loan is
charged  to the  allowance  for  probable  loan  losses  when it is deemed to be
uncollectible,  taking  into  consideration  the  value of the  collateral,  the
financial  condition  of the  borrower and other  factors.  Recoveries  on loans
previously  charged-off  as  uncollectible  are  credited to the  allowance  for
probable loan losses.  Beginning in fiscal 2004, the allowance for probable loan
losses on our auto loan  portfolio no longer  includes a portion of  acquisition
discounts from our purchase of automobile  installment loan contracts,  commonly
referred to as dealer holdbacks.

We have not recorded an allowance for probable loan losses on our retail-banking
loans and advances as these loans are generally  payable on demand and are fully
secured  by assets  under our  custody.  Advances  on  customers'  accounts  are
generally  secured  or  subject to rights of offset  and,  consistent  with past
experience, no loan losses are anticipated.

Past due loans 90 days or more in both our consumer  lending and  retail-banking
portfolios are reviewed  individually to determine whether they are collectible.
If warranted,  after  considering  collateral level and other factors,  loans 90
days  past  due are  placed  on  non-accrual  status.  Interest  collections  on
non-accrual  loans  for  which  the  ultimate  collectibility  of  principal  is
uncertain are applied as principal reductions;  otherwise,  such collections are
credited to income when received.

INVESTMENTS,  OTHER include  investments  that we intend to hold for a period in
excess of one year at the time of purchase.

Investments  are  accounted  for using the equity method of accounting if we are
able to exercise  significant  influence,  but not control,  over the  investee.
Significant  influence  is  generally  considered  to  exist  when an  ownership
interest in the voting  stock of the  investee is between 20% and 50%,  although
other factors,  such as  representation on the investee's board of directors and
the  impact of  commercial  arrangements,  are also  considered  in  determining
whether the equity method of accounting is  appropriate.  Lower  thresholds  are
used for our investments in limited partnerships and limited liability companies
in determining whether we are able to exercise significant influence.

Entities in which we hold in excess of 50% ownership  interest are  consolidated
in our  financial  statements.  We are also  required  to  consolidate  variable
interest entities in relation to which we are the primary beneficiary as defined
in FASB  Interpretation  No. 46,  "Consolidation of Variable Interest  Entities"
(revised December 2003) (see Note 2).

Generally,  long-term investments, such as debt instruments, are carried at fair
value   in   accordance   with   our   treatment   of   investment   securities,
available-for-sale  if we are unable to exercise significant  influence over the
investee.  These include  collateralized  debt obligations  ("CDOs"),  which are
valued based on cash flow


                                       63
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<PAGE>

projections.  Investments  are accounted for under the cost method if we are not
able  to  exercise   significant   influence  over  the  investee  and  are  not
exchange-traded.

Investments, other are adjusted for other-than-temporary declines in value. When
a decline in fair value of an investment  carried at fair value is determined to
be other-than-temporary,  the unrealized loss recorded net of tax in accumulated
other comprehensive income is realized as a charge to net income. When a decline
in  fair  value  of  an   investment   carried  at  cost  is  determined  to  be
other-than-temporary,  the investment is written down to fair value and the loss
in indicated value is included in earnings.

DEFERRED SALES  COMMISSIONS.  Sales commissions paid to broker/dealers and other
investment  advisers in  connection  with the sale of shares of our mutual funds
sold without a front-end sales charge are capitalized and amortized over periods
not  exceeding  eight years - the periods in which we estimate that they will be
recovered  from  distribution  plan payments or from  contingent  deferred sales
charges.

PROPERTY  AND  EQUIPMENT  are  recorded  at  cost  and  are  depreciated  on the
straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.  Expenditures for repairs
and  maintenance  are charged to expense when  incurred.  We amortize  leasehold
improvements on the straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives or the
lease term, whichever is shorter.

SOFTWARE  DEVELOPED FOR INTERNAL USE.  Internal and external  costs  incurred in
connection  with   developing  or  obtaining   software  for  internal  use  are
capitalized. These capitalized costs are included in property and equipment, net
on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and are amortized beginning when the software
project  is  complete  and the  application  is put  into  production,  over the
estimated useful life of the software.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS. Intangible assets consist primarily of the
estimated value of mutual fund management  contracts and customer base resulting
from our acquisition of the assets and liabilities of the following companies:

* Templeton, Galbraith & Hansberger Ltd. in October 1992
* Heine Securities Corporation in November 1996
* Bissett and Associates Investment Management Ltd. ("Bissett") in October 2000
* Fiduciary Trust Company International ("Fiduciary Trust") in April 2001
* Pioneer ITI AMC Limited ("Pioneer") in July 2002
* Darby  Overseas   Investments,   Ltd.  and  Darby  Overseas  Partners,   L.P.
(collectively "Darby") in October 2003

We amortize  intangible  assets over their  estimated  useful  lives,  using the
straight-line  method,  unless  the asset is  determined  to have an  indefinite
useful life.  Amounts assigned to  indefinite-lived  intangible assets primarily
represent the value of contracts to manage  mutual fund assets,  for which there
is no foreseeable limit on the contract period.

Goodwill  represents  the excess  cost of a business  acquisition  over the fair
value of the net assets  acquired.  In  accordance  with  Statement of Financial
Accounting  Standards No. 142,  "Goodwill and Other  Intangible  Assets"  ("SFAS
142"),  indefinite-lived  intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized,  but
are reviewed when there is an indication of impairment, or at least annually, to
determine whether the value of the assets is impaired.

When the  carrying  amount of  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  exceeds the
implied fair value, an indication of impairment exists. Fair value is determined
based on anticipated  discounted cash flows.  Similarly,  goodwill impairment is
indicated when the carrying  amount of a reporting unit exceeds its implied fair
value.  In  estimating  the fair value of the  reporting  unit, we use valuation
techniques  based on  discounted  cash  flows  similar  to  models  employed  in
analyzing  the purchase  price of an  acquisition  target.  When  impairment  of
goodwill or indefinite-lived  intangible assets is indicated in the above tests,
impairment is  determined by  calculating  the  difference  between the carrying
value of the asset  reflected on the financial  statements  and its current fair
value,  generally based on undiscounted cash flows. Any excess of carrying value
over the fair value would be recognized as an expense in the period in which the
impairment occurs.

Intangible  assets subject to  amortization  are reviewed for impairment at each
reporting period on the basis of the expected future undiscounted operating cash
flows, without interest charges, to be derived from these assets. See Note 9 for
additional information regarding goodwill and other intangible assets.


                                       64
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<PAGE>
Our goodwill and other  intangible  assets have been assigned to our  investment
management operating segment.

DEMAND AND INTEREST-BEARING DEPOSITS.  The fair value of demand deposits are, by
definition,  equal to their  carrying  amounts.  Interest-bearing  deposits  are
variable rate and short-term and,  therefore,  the carrying amounts  approximate
their fair values.

REVENUES. We recognize investment  management fees,  shareholder servicing fees,
investment  income and  distribution  fees as  earned,  over the period in which
services  are  rendered.   Performance-based   investment  management  fees  are
recognized when earned.  Investment  management  fees are determined  based on a
percentage of assets under management. Generally, shareholder servicing fees are
calculated  based on the number of  accounts  serviced.  We record  underwriting
commissions  related to the sale of shares of our sponsored  investment products
on the trade date.

ADVERTISING  AND  PROMOTION.  We expense costs of  advertising  and promotion as
incurred.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION. Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are
translated at current exchange rates as of the end of the accounting period, and
related revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates in effect
during the period.  Net exchange gains and losses resulting from translation are
excluded from income and are recorded as part of accumulated other comprehensive
income.  Foreign currency  transaction  gains and losses are reflected in income
currently.

DIVIDENDS.  For the years ended September 30, 2004,  2003, and 2002, we declared
dividends to common stockholders of $0.34, $0.30 and $0.28 per share.

STOCK-BASED  COMPENSATION.  As permitted  under the  provisions  of Statement of
Financial   Accounting   Standards   No.  123,   "Accounting   for   Stock-Based
Compensation" ("SFAS 123"), we have elected to apply Accounting Principles Board
Opinion  No.  25,  "Accounting  for Stock  Issued  to  Employees",  and  related
interpretations  in  accounting  for  our  stock-based  plans.  Accordingly,  no
compensation costs are recognized with respect to stock options granted when the
exercise  price is equal to the market  value of the stock,  or with  respect to
shares issued under the Employee Stock  Investment  Plan ("ESIP").  We recognize
compensation expense for the matching  contribution that we may elect to make in
connection with the ESIP over the 18-month  holding period and for the full cost
of restricted stock grants as earned,  in the year that the related services are
rendered.

If we had determined  compensation costs for our stock option plans and our ESIP
(see  descriptions in Notes 15 and 16) based upon fair values at the grant dates
in accordance  with the  provisions of SFAS 123, our net income and earnings per
share would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts  indicated below. For pro
forma  purposes,  the estimated fair value of options was  calculated  using the
Black-Scholes  option-pricing  model and is amortized over the options'  vesting
periods.

NOTE 2 - NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

In January 2003,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  ("FASB")  issued
Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" ("FIN 46").
Under  FIN 46, a  variable  interest  entity  ("VIE")  is an entity in which the
equity investment holders have not contributed sufficient capital to finance its
activities  or the  equity  investment  holders do not have  defined  rights and
obligations  normally  associated  with an equity  investment.  FIN 46  requires
consolidation  of a VIE by the enterprise that has the majority of the risks and
rewards of ownership, referred to as the primary beneficiary.

                                       66
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<PAGE>

In December 2003, the FASB published FASB Interpretation No. 46,  "Consolidation
of Variable Interest Entities (revised December 2003)" ("FIN 46-R"),  clarifying
FIN 46 and exempting  certain entities from the provisions of FIN 46. Generally,
application of FIN 46-R is required in financial  statements of public  entities
that have  interests  in  structures  commonly  referred  to as  special-purpose
entities  for periods  ending after  December 15, 2003,  and, for other types of
VIEs,  for periods  ending after March 15, 2004. We early adopted FIN 46-R as of
December 31, 2003,  and, as a result,  we  recognized a cumulative  effect of an
accounting  change,  net of tax, of $4.8  million as of this date to reflect the
accumulated  retained  earnings  of VIEs in which we became an  interest  holder
prior to February 1, 2003 (see Note 13).

In December 2003, the FASB issued  Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards
("SFAS") No. 132 (revised  2003),  "Employers'  Disclosures  about  Pensions and
Other Postretirement  Benefits,  an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, and
106" ("SFAS 132"). SFAS 132 revises  employers'  disclosures about pension plans
and other  post-retirement  benefits plans and requires  additional  disclosures
about the assets,  obligations,  cash flows,  and net  periodic  benefit cost of
defined benefit pension plans and other defined benefit  post-retirement  plans.
SFAS 132 is effective for financial  statements  relating to fiscal years ending
after December 15, 2003 (see Note 17).

In March 2004,  the FASB approved the consensus  reached on the Emerging  Issues
Task  Force  (EITF)  Issue  No.  03-1,  "The  Meaning  of   Other-Than-Temporary
Impairment  and Its  Application  to Certain  Investments"  ("EITF  03-1").  The
objective  of  this  Issue  is to  provide  guidance  for  identifying  impaired
investments. EITF 03-1 also provides new disclosure requirements for investments
that are deemed to be temporarily  impaired.  The accounting  provisions of EITF
03-1 are  effective  for all reporting  periods  beginning  after June 15, 2004,
while the disclosure  requirements  are effective only for annual periods ending
after June 15, 2004. The adoption of EITF 03-1 did not have a significant impact
on our overall results of operations or financial position.

The EITF has proposed  EITF No. 04-8,  "The Effect of  Contingently  Convertible
Debt on Diluted  Earnings  per Share"  ("EITF  04-8"),  which will  require  the
inclusion of the  potential  conversion  of our zero coupon  convertible  senior
notes (see Note 11) into common  stock when  calculating  diluted  earnings  per
share even if the conditions that must be satisfied to allow conversion have not
been  met.  EITF  04-8 has not  been  ratified  as of the  date of this  filing;
however,  it is expected to be  effective  for  reporting  periods  ending after
December  15,  2004.  Based on our fiscal 2004  result,  we estimated a negative
impact on diluted  earnings  per share of  approximately  $0.05,  if the current
provisions of EITF 04-8 were approved.

NOTE 3 - ACQUISITIONS

On October 1, 2003, we acquired the remaining  87.3%  interest in Darby Overseas
Investments,  Ltd. and Darby Overseas Partners, L.P. (collectively "Darby") that
we did not own for an additional cash investment of approximately $75.9 million.
The  acquisition  cost was  allocated  to tangible  net assets  acquired  ($31.3
million), definite-lived management contracts ($3.4 million) and goodwill ($41.2
million).  These  definite-lived  intangible assets are being amortized over the
remaining  contractual life of the sponsored investment  products,  ranging from
one to eight years, as of the date of purchase. At September 30, 2003, Darby had
approximately  $0.9  billion  in assets  under  management  relating  to private
equity, mezzanine and emerging markets fixed-income products.

On July 26, 2002, our 75% owned subsidiary,  Templeton Asset Management  (India)
Private Limited,  acquired all of the issued and outstanding  shares of Pioneer,
an Indian  investment  management  company  with  approximately  $0.8 billion in
assets under  management as of the purchase date. This all-cash  transaction was
valued at approximately  $55.4 million.  Our consolidated  financial  statements
include the  operating  results of Pioneer  from July 26,  2002.  We  recognized
goodwill of $38.7  million and  indefinite-lived  management  contracts of $13.1
million from this acquisition.

We have not  presented  pro  forma  combined  results  of  operations  for these
acquisitions  because the results of operations as reported in the  accompanying
Consolidated Statements of Income would not have been materially different.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</TABLE>

When  we  sell  auto  loans  in  a  securitization  transaction,  we  record  an
interest-only strip receivable.  The interest-only  strip receivable  represents
our  contractual  right to receive  interest from the pool of securitized  loans
after the payment of required  amounts to holders of the  securities and certain
other costs associated with the securitization. Gross sales proceeds include the
fair value of the interest-only strips.

We generally  estimate fair value based on the present value of future  expected
cash flows.  The key assumptions  used in the present value  calculations of our
securitization transactions at the date of securitization were as follows:
<TABLE>

                                                               2004            2003           2002
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<S>                                                     <C>             <C>            <C>
Excess cash flow discount rate (annual rate)                  12.0%           12.0%          12.0%
Cumulative life loss rate                               3.2% - 3.4%     3.7% - 4.3%    3.3% - 3.8%
Pre-payment speed assumption (average monthly rate)     1.6% - 1.8%     1.8% - 1.9%           1.5%
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

</TABLE>

We  determined  these  assumptions  using  data  from  comparable  transactions,
historical   information  and   management's   estimate.   Interest-only   strip
receivables  are  generally  restricted  assets and subject to limited  recourse
provisions.

We  generally  estimate  the fair  value  of the  interest-only  strips  at each
period-end based on the present value of future expected cash flows,  consistent
with the methodology used at the date of securitization. The following shows the
carrying value and the  sensitivity  of the  interest-only  strip  receivable to
hypothetical  adverse  changes in the key economic  assumptions  used to measure
fair value:

NOTE  9 - GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

We adopted  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No. 141,  "Business
Combinations"  ("SFAS  141") and SFAS 142 on October 1, 2001.  SFAS 141 and SFAS
142  address  the initial  recognition  and  measurement  of  intangible  assets
acquired and the recognition  and  measurement of goodwill and other  intangible
assets   after   acquisition.   Under  these   standards,   all   goodwill   and
indefinite-lived  intangible  assets,  including  those acquired  before initial
application  of the  standards,  are no  longer  amortized  but are  tested  for
impairment at least annually.

All of our goodwill and  intangible  assets,  including  those  arising from the
purchase of Fiduciary Trust in April 2001,  relate to our investment  management
operating  segment.  Non-amortized  intangible  assets  represent  the  value of
management  contracts  related to certain of our sponsored  investment  products
that are indefinite-lived.

During the quarter  ended March 31,  2004,  we completed  our annual  impairment
testing of goodwill and  indefinite-lived  and definite-lived  intangible assets
and we  determined  that there was no impairment in the value of these assets as
of October 1, 2003.

Intangible assets other than goodwill were as follows:

Federal  funds  purchased  and Federal  Home Loan Bank  advances are included in
other liabilities of the banking/finance operating segment.

On December 31, 2003, we  recognized a $164.9  million  five-year  note facility
that was used to finance the construction of our corporate  headquarters  campus
under the guidance of FIN 46-R (see Note 2). In September 2004, we purchased the
headquarter  campus from the lessor trust that held these assets,  and we issued
$170.0 million of commercial paper to finance the transaction.

In May 2001, we received  approximately  $490.0 million in net proceeds from the
sale of $877.0 million  principal amount at maturity of zero-coupon  convertible
senior notes due 2031 (the "Convertible  Notes").  The Convertible  Notes, which
were offered to qualified  institutional  buyers only, carry an interest rate of
1.875% per annum, with an initial  conversion premium of 43%. Each of the $1,000
(principal  amount at maturity)  Convertible  Notes is  convertible  into 9.3604
shares  of our  common  stock,  when the  price  of our  stock  reaches  certain
thresholds.  To date, we have repurchased Convertible Notes with a face value of
$5.9 million  principal  amount at maturity,  for their  accreted  value of $3.5
million,  in cash. We may redeem the remaining  Convertible Notes for cash on or
after May 11, 2006 or make additional repurchases, at the option of the holders,
on May 11 of 2006,  2011,  2016,  2021 and 2026. In this event, we may choose to
pay the accreted value of the Convertible  Notes in cash or shares of our common
stock.  The amount  that the  holders  may redeem in the future  will depend on,
among other factors, the performance of our common stock.

In April 2003,  we completed  the sale of  five-year  senior notes due April 15,
2008 totaling $420.0 million ("Medium Term Notes"). The Medium Term Notes, which
were offered to qualified  institutional  buyers only,

carry an  interest  rate of 3.7% and are not  redeemable  prior to  maturity  by
either the note holders or us. Interest payments are due semi-annually.

Other  long-term  debt  consists  primarily  of  deferred  commission  liability
recognized in relation to U.S. deferred  commission assets financed by Lightning
Finance Company  Limited  ("LFL") that were not sold by LFL in a  securitization
transaction as of September 30, 2004 and September 30, 2003.

As of September  30, 2004, we had $300.0  million of debt and equity  securities
available to be issued under shelf  registration  statements  filed with the SEC
and $330.0 million of additional  commercial  paper available for issuance.  Our
committed  revolving  credit  facilities  at September  30, 2004 totaled  $420.0
million,  of which, $210.0 million was under a 364-day facility expiring in June
2005. The remaining $210.0 million  facility is under a five-year  facility that
will  expire  in  June  2007.   In  addition,   at  September   30,  2004,   our
banking/finance  operating  segment had $523.6 million in available  uncommitted
short-term  bank lines  under the  Federal  Reserve  Funds  system,  the Federal
Reserve Bank discount  window,  and Federal Home Loan Bank short-term  borrowing
capacity.

Included in income before taxes was $477.4  million,  $305.2  million and $283.7
million of foreign  income for the years ended  September  30, 2004,  2003,  and
2002. The provision for U.S. income taxes includes  benefits of $2.0 million for
the year ended  September 30, 2004 related to the  utilization  of net operating
loss carry-forwards. In fiscal 2004, our income taxes payable for federal, state
and foreign purposes have been reduced by $18.6 million, which represent the tax
benefit associated with our employee stock plans. The benefit was recorded as an
increase in capital in excess of par value.

At September  30, 2004,  there were  approximately  $33.4 million of foreign net
operating  loss  carry-forwards,  approximately  $18.2  million of which  expire
between 2005 and 2012 with the  remaining  carry-forwards  having an  indefinite
life.  In  addition,  there  were  approximately  $657.5  million  in state  net
operating loss carry-forwards that expire between 2005 and 2024. There were also
approximately $27.6 million in federal foreign tax credit carry-forwards,  which
will expire between 2010 and 2014. A valuation  allowance has been recognized to
offset the related  deferred tax assets due to the  uncertainty of realizing the
benefit of the loss and credit carry-forwards.

We have made no  provision  for U.S.  taxes on  $2,508.7  million of  cumulative
undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as those earnings are intended to
be reinvested for an indefinite  period of time.  Determination of the potential
amount of  unrecognized  deferred  U.S.  income  tax  liability  related to such
reinvested  income  is  not  practicable  because  of the  numerous  assumptions
associated  with this  hypothetical  calculation;  however,  foreign tax credits
would be available to reduce some  portion of this amount.  As of September  30,
2004,  and based on tax laws in effect as of this date,  it is our  intention to
continue  to  indefinitely  reinvest  the  undistributed   earnings  of  foreign
subsidiaries.

The  American  Jobs  Creation  Act of 2004 (the  "Act") was  signed  into law on
October  22,  2004.  Under a provision  of the Act,  we may elect to  repatriate
certain  earnings  of our  foreign-based  subsidiaries  at a reduced tax rate in
either of our fiscal years ending  September  30, 2005 or September 30, 2006. We
are currently evaluating the effect of this repatriation provision;  however, we
do not expect to complete this evaluation  until after the U.S.  Congress or the
U.S.  Department  of the  Treasury  issue  additional  guidance  regarding  this
provision.  The range of possible amounts we are considering for repatriation is
between zero and $1.9 billion and the potential  range of income tax  associated
with amounts subject to the reduced rate is between zero and $117.0 million.

NOTE 13 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

GUARANTEES

Under Financial  Accounting  Standards Board Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantor's
Accounting  and  Disclosure  Requirements  for  Guarantees,  Including  Indirect
Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others", we are required,  on a prospective basis,
to recognize in our  financial  statements a liability for the fair value of any
guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002 as well as make additional
disclosures about existing guarantees.

In October  1999,  we entered into an agreement  for the lease of our  corporate
headquarters  campus  in San  Mateo,  California  from a lessor  trust  under an
operating lease that would have expired in fiscal 2005, with additional  renewal
options for a further period of up to 10 years.  In connection  with this lease,
we were  contingently  liable  for  approximately  $145.0  million  in  residual
guarantees,  representing  approximately 85% of the total  construction costs of
$170.0  million.  We were also  contingently  liable to purchase  the  corporate
headquarters  campus  for an  amount  equal to the final  construction  costs of
$170.0 million if an event of default occurred under the agreement.

On December 31, 2003, we  consolidated  the lessor trust under the provisions of
FIN 46-R and recognized,  as a current  liability,  the loan principal of $164.9
million and minority interest of $5.1 million, which, in total,  represented the
amount used to finance the construction of our corporate headquarters campus and
our maximum  contingent  liability under the  agreements.  In September 2004, we
purchased  the assets  held by the lessor  trust and  extinguished  any  related
contingent liability.

In relation to the auto loan  securitization  transactions  that we have entered
into with a number of qualified  special purpose  entities,  we are obligated to
cover shortfalls in amounts due to the holders of the notes up to certain levels
as specified under the related agreements. As of September 30, 2004, the maximum
potential  amount of future  payments was $23.6  million  relating to guarantees
made prior to January 1, 2003. In addition,  our  consolidated  balance sheet at
September  30, 2004  includes a $0.6 million  liability  to reflect  obligations
arising from auto securitization transactions subsequent to December 31, 2002.

At  September  30,  2004,  our  banking/finance  operating  segment  had  issued
financial standby letters of credit totaling $2.5 million on which beneficiaries
would be able to draw upon in the  event of  non-performance  by our  customers,
primarily in relation to lease and lien obligations of these banking  customers.
These standby  letters of credit,  issued prior to January 1, 2003, were secured
by marketable  securities  with a fair value of $2.1 million as of September 30,
2004 and commercial real estate.

GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS, PROCEEDINGS AND ACTIONS

GOVERNMENTAL  INVESTIGATIONS AND SETTLEMENTS.  As part of various investigations
by the Securities and Exchange  Commission  ("SEC"),  the U.S.  Attorney for the
Northern District of California,  the New York Attorney General,  the California
Attorney  General,  the U.S.  Attorney  for the District of  Massachusetts,  the
Securities  Division  of the  Office of the  Secretary  of the  Commonwealth  of
Massachusetts, the Florida Department of Financial Services and the Commissioner
of Securities,  the West Virginia  Attorney General,  the Vermont  Department of
Banking, Insurance,  Securities, and Health Care Administration and the National
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. ("NASD"),  relating to certain practices
in the mutual fund industry, including late trading, market timing and marketing
support payments to securities dealers who sell fund shares, Franklin Resources,
Inc. and certain of its  subsidiaries  (as used in this section,  together,  the
"Company"), as well as certain current or former executives and employees of the
Company,  received  requests  for  information  and/or  subpoenas  to testify or
produce documents.  The Company and its current employees provided documents and
information  in response to these  requests  and  subpoenas.  In  addition,  the
Company responded, and in one instance is currently responding,  to requests for
similar kinds of information from regulatory  authorities in some of the foreign
countries where the Company conducts its global asset management business.

Franklin  Templeton  Investments Corp.  ("FTIC"),  a Company  subsidiary and the
investment  manager of Franklin  Templeton's  Canadian  mutual  funds,  has been
cooperating  with and  responding to requests for  information  from the Ontario
Securities  Commission  (the  "OSC")  relating  to the OSC's  review of frequent
trading  practices  within the Canadian  mutual fund  industry.  On December 10,
2004,  FTIC  received  a  letter  indicating  that  the  staff  of  the  OSC  is
contemplating  enforcement  proceedings  against  FTIC  before  the OSC.  In its
letter,  the OSC staff expressed the view that, over the period of February 1999
to February 2003, there were certain accounts that engaged in a frequent trading
market timing  strategy in certain funds being managed by FTIC.  The letter also
gave FTIC the  opportunity  to respond to the issues raised in the letter and to
provide the OSC staff with additional information relevant to these matters. The
Company  expects  to enter into  discussions  with the OSC staff in an effort to
resolve the issues raised in the OSC's review.  The Company  cannot  predict the
likelihood of whether  those  discussions  will result in a  settlement,  or the
terms of any such settlement.

On December 9, 2004, the staff of the NASD informed the Company that it has made
a  preliminary  determination  to recommend a  disciplinary  proceeding  against
Franklin/Templeton  Distributors,  Inc.  ("FTDI"),  alleging  that FTDI violated
certain NASD rules by the use of directed brokerage commissions to pay for sales
and marketing  support.  FTDI has also received a separate  letter from the NASD
staff advising FTDI of the NASD staff's preliminary determination to recommend a
disciplinary  proceeding  against FTDI alleging  violation of certain NASD rules
relating to FTDI's Top  Producers  program.  The Company  believes that any such
charges are unwarranted.

On August 2, 2004,  Franklin  Resources,  Inc.  announced  that its  subsidiary,
Franklin Advisers,  Inc. ("Franklin Advisers") reached an agreement with the SEC
that  resolved  the  issues   resulting  from  the   previously   disclosed  SEC
investigation  into market timing  activity.  In connection with that agreement,
the  SEC  issued  an  "Order  instituting  administrative  and  cease-and-desist
proceedings  pursuant to sections  203(e) and 203(k) of the Investment  Advisers
Act of 1940 and sections  9(b) and 9(f) of the  Investment  Company Act of 1940,
making  findings and imposing  remedial  sanctions and a cease and desist order"
(the "Order").  The SEC's Order  concerned the activities of a limited number of
third  parties  that ended in 2000 and those that were the  subject of the first
Massachusetts administrative complaint described below.

Under the terms of the SEC's Order,  pursuant to which Franklin Advisers neither
admitted nor denied any of the findings  contained  therein,  Franklin  Advisers
agreed to pay $50 million to be  distributed to  shareholders  of certain of the
Franklin  Templeton  mutual  funds  ("Funds"),  of which $20 million was a civil
penalty.  The  settlement  was  provided  for as part of a charge of $60 million
($45.6  million,  net of taxes)  recorded in the fiscal  quarter ended March 31,
2004.  This  charge  represented  the  Company's  estimate  of  the  anticipated
settlement and related legal and distribution costs.

                                       79
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<PAGE>

The Order required Franklin Advisers to, among other things:

     *    Enhance and periodically  review  compliance  policies and procedures,
          and establish a corporate ombudsman;
     *    Establish a new internal position whose responsibilities shall include
          compliance matters related to conflicts of interests; and
     *    Retain an  Independent  Distribution  Consultant  to develop a plan to
          distribute the $50 million settlement to Fund shareholders.

The Order  further  provided  that in any  related  investor  actions,  Franklin
Advisers would not benefit from any offset or reduction of any investor's  claim
by the amount of any distribution from the  above-described  $50 million to such
investor  that is  proportionately  attributable  to the civil  penalty  paid by
Franklin Advisers.

On September  20,  2004,  Franklin  Resources,  Inc.  announced  that two of its
subsidiaries,   Franklin  Advisers,  Inc.  and  Franklin  Templeton  Alternative
Strategies,  Inc. ("FTAS"), reached an agreement with the Securities Division of
the Office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts  (the "State of
Massachusetts")  related to the  previously-disclosed  administrative  complaint
filed on February 4, 2004. The administrative  complaint  concerned one instance
of market timing that was also a subject of the August 2, 2004  settlement  that
Franklin Advisers reached with the SEC, as described above.

Under  the  terms  of the  settlement  consent  order  issued  by the  State  of
Massachusetts,  Franklin Advisers and FTAS consented to the entry of a cease and
desist order and agreed to pay a $5 million  administrative fine to the State of
Massachusetts (the  "Massachusetts  Consent Order").  Franklin  Resources,  Inc.
recorded this expense in the quarter ended September 30, 2004. The Massachusetts
Consent  Order  included  two  different  sections:  "Statements  of  Fact"  and
"Violations  of  Massachusetts  Securities  Laws."  Franklin  Advisers  and FTAS
admitted the facts in the Statements of Fact.

On October 25, 2004, the State of  Massachusetts  filed a second  administrative
complaint, alleging that Franklin Resources, Inc.'s Form 8-K filing (in which it
described  the  Massachusetts  Consent  Order and stated that  "Franklin did not
admit  or deny  engaging  in any  wrongdoing")  failed  to state  that  Franklin
Advisers and FTAS admitted the  Statements of Fact portion of the  Massachusetts
Consent  Order (the "Second  Complaint").  Franklin  Resources,  Inc.  reached a
second agreement with the State of Massachusetts on November 19, 2004, resolving
the Second Complaint. As a result of the November 19, 2004 settlement,  Franklin
Resources,  Inc. filed a new Form 8-K. The terms of the original  settlement did
not  change  and  there  was  no  monetary  fine  associated  with  this  second
settlement.

On November 17, 2004,  Franklin  Resources,  Inc. announced that FTDI reached an
agreement  with the  CAGO,  resolving  the  issues  resulting  from  the  CAGO's
investigation  concerning  sales and  marketing  support  payments.  The Company
believes  that the  settlement of the CAGO matter is in the best interest of the
Company  and its Fund  shareholders.  Under  the terms of the  settlement,  FTDI
neither  admitted nor denied the allegations in the CAGO's  complaint and agreed
to pay $2 million as a civil penalty,  $14 million to Franklin  Templeton  funds
and $2 million to the CAGO for its investigative costs.

As a result of the CAGO settlement,  the results for the quarter and fiscal year
ended  September 30, 2004 announced on October 28, 2004 were adjusted to include
an additional  charge to income of $18.5 million  ($12.2  million,  net of tax).
This  adjustment  was made in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting
principles in the United States,  which require the Company to update  estimates
when  additional  information  becomes  available after the end of the reporting
period but prior to the  issuance of the  financial  statements  with respect to
loss contingencies that existed as of the date of the financial statements.

On December 13, 2004, Franklin  Resources,  Inc. announced that its subsidiaries
FTDI and Franklin  Advisers  reached an agreement  with the SEC,  resolving  the
issues  resulting  from the SEC's  investigation  concerning  marketing  support
payments to securities  dealers who sell Fund shares.  In  connection  with that
agreement,   the  SEC   issued  an   "Order   Instituting   Administrative   and
Cease-and-Desist  Proceedings,  Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions
Pursuant to Section  203(e) and 203(k) of the  Investment  Advisers Act of 1940,
Sections 9(b) and 9(f) of the Investment  Company Act of 1940, and Section 15(b)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Order").

The Company  believes that the settlement of this matter is in the best interest
of the Company and its Fund shareholders. Under the terms of the Order, in which
FTDI and Franklin  Advisers neither  admitted nor denied


                                       80
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<PAGE>

the findings  contained  therein,  they agreed to pay the Funds a penalty of $20
million  and $1 in  disgorgement.  FTDI and  Franklin  Advisers  also  agreed to
implement  certain  measures  and  undertakings  relating to  marketing  support
payments to broker-dealers  for the promotion or sale of Fund shares,  including
making  additional  disclosures  in the Funds'  Prospectuses  and  Statements of
Additional  Information.  The  Order  further  requires  the  appointment  of an
independent distribution consultant, at the Company's expense, who shall develop
a plan for the  distribution  of the penalty and  disgorgement  to the Funds.  A
charge of $21.5  million  ($17.3  million,  net of taxes)  was  recorded  by the
Company in its fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2004 related to this matter.

INTERNAL  INQUIRIES.  The Company also  conducted its own internal  fact-finding
inquiry with the  assistance  of outside  counsel to determine  whether any Fund
shareholders,  including  Company  employees,  were  permitted to engage in late
trading  or in  market  timing  transactions  contrary  to the  policies  of the
affected Fund and, if so, the circumstances and persons involved.  The Company's
internal inquiry  regarding  market timing and late trading is complete.  We did
not find any late trading,  though we identified  various  instances of frequent
trading.  One officer of a subsidiary of Franklin Resources,  Inc. was placed on
administrative  leave  and  subsequently  resigned  from his  position  with the
Company in December 2003.

We found no instances  of  inappropriate  mutual fund  trading by any  portfolio
manager, investment analyst or officer of Franklin Resources, Inc. As previously
disclosed,  the Company  identified some instances of frequent trading in shares
of certain Funds by a few current or former  employees in their personal  401(k)
plan  accounts.  These  individuals  included  one trader and one officer of the
Funds.  Pending  our  further  inquiry,  these two  individuals  were  placed on
administrative leave and the officer resigned from his positions with the Funds.
The independent directors of the Funds and the Company also retained independent
outside  counsel  to review  these  matters  and to report  their  findings  and
recommendations.  Based on independent  counsel's findings and  recommendations,
the Company reinstated the trader.  The independent  counsel concluded that some
instances of the former Fund officer's trading violated Company policy,  and the
Company was prepared to institute appropriate disciplinary action. Subsequently,
the former Fund officer  resigned  from his  employment  with the  Company.  The
Company does not believe  there were any losses to the Funds as a result of this
trading.

OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

In  addition,  the  Company  and certain  Funds,  current  and former  officers,
employees,  and  directors  have been named in multiple  lawsuits  in  different
federal courts in Nevada, California,  Illinois, New York, and Florida, alleging
violations of various federal  securities laws and seeking,  among other things,
monetary damages and costs. Specifically, the lawsuits claim breach of duty with
respect to alleged  arrangements  to permit  market  timing  and/or late trading
activity,  or breach of duty with  respect  to the  valuation  of the  portfolio
securities of certain Templeton Funds managed by Company subsidiaries, resulting
in alleged market timing activity. The majority of these lawsuits duplicate,  in
whole or in part, the allegations  asserted in the Massachusetts  administrative
complaint  described  above.  The  lawsuits  are  styled  as class  actions,  or
derivative  actions  on  behalf  of  either  the  named  Funds  or the  Company.
Additionally,  FTIC  was  recently  served  with a class  action  market  timing
complaint in Quebec, Canada,  entitled Huneault v. AGF Funds, Inc., et al., Case
No.  500-06-000256-046,  filed on October 25, 2004 in the Superior Court for the
Province of Quebec, District of Montreal.

To date,  more than 240 similar  lawsuits  against at least 19 different  mutual
fund  companies  have been  filed in  federal  district  courts  throughout  the
country.  Because these cases  involve  common  questions of fact,  the Judicial
Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (the "Judicial Panel") ordered the creation of
a multidistrict  litigation in the United States District Court for the District
of Maryland,  entitled "In re Mutual Funds  Investment  Litigation" (the "MDL").
The Judicial Panel then  transferred  similar cases from different  districts to
the MDL for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings.

As of December 13, 2004, the following  lawsuits are pending against the Company
(and in some instances,  against certain of the Funds) and have been transferred
to the MDL:

Kenerley v.  Templeton  Funds,  Inc.,  et al.,  Case No.  03-770  GPM,  filed on

Plaintiffs  in the MDL filed  consolidated  amended  complaints on September 29,
2004.  It is  anticipated  that  defendants  will file motions to dismiss in the
coming months.

As previously  reported,  various  subsidiaries of Franklin Resources,  Inc., as
well as certain Templeton Funds, have also been named in multiple lawsuits filed
in state  courts  in  Illinois,  alleging  breach of duty  with  respect  to the
valuation of the portfolio securities of certain Templeton Funds managed by such
subsidiaries as follows:

Bradfisch v.  Templeton  Funds,  Inc., et al., Case No. 2003 L 001361,  filed on
October 3, 2003 in the  Circuit  Court of the Third  Judicial  Circuit,  Madison
County, Illinois;  Woodbury v. Templeton Global Smaller Companies Fund, Inc., et
al.,  Case No. 2003 L 001362,  filed on October 3, 2003 in the Circuit  Court of
the Third Judicial Circuit, Madison County,  Illinois;  Kwiatkowski v. Templeton

December 22, 2003 in the Circuit Court of the Third  Judicial  Circuit,  Madison
County, Illinois.

These lawsuits are state court actions and are not subject to the MDL.

In  addition,  the  Company,  as well as certain  current  and former  officers,
employees,  and  directors,  have  been  named  in  multiple  lawsuits  alleging
violations of various  securities  laws and pendent state law claims relating to
the  disclosure  of directed  brokerage  payments  and/or  payment of  allegedly
excessive advisory, commission, and distribution fees. These lawsuits are styled
as class actions and derivative  actions brought on behalf of certain Funds, and
are as follows:

Stephen Alexander IRA v. Franklin Resources,  Inc., et al., Case No. 04-982 JLL,
filed on March 2, 2004 in the United States  District  Court for the District of
New Jersey;  Strigliabotti  v. Franklin  Resources,  Inc., et al., Case No. C 04
0883 SI,  filed on March 4, 2004 in the  United  States  District  Court for the
Northern District of California;  Tricarico v. Franklin Resources, Inc., et al.,
Case No.  CV-04-1052  JAP, filed on March 4, 2004 in the United States  District
Court for the District of New Jersey;  Miller v. Franklin Mutual Advisors,  LLC,
et al.,  Case No.  04-261  DRH,  filed on April 16,  2004 in the  United  States
District  Court for the  Southern  District of Illinois and  transferred  to the
United  States  District  Court for the District of New Jersey on August 5, 2004
(plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed this action, without prejudice, on October 22,
2004); Wilcox v. Franklin  Resources,  Inc., et al., Case No. 04-2258 WHW, filed
on May 12,  2004 in the United  States  District  Court for the  District of New

Distributors,  Inc. et al., Case No.  04-11195 PBS, filed on June 3, 2004 in the
United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.

The United States District Court for the District of New Jersey consolidated for
pretrial purposes three of the above lawsuits (Stephen Alexander IRA, Tricarico,
and Wilcox)  into a single  action,  entitled  "In re Franklin


                                       83
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<PAGE>

Mutual  Funds  Fee  Litigation."  Plaintiffs  in those  three  lawsuits  filed a
consolidated amended complaint on October 4, 2004.

Management  strongly  believes  that  the  claims  made in each of the  lawsuits
identified  above are without  merit and intends to  vigorously  defend  against
them. The Company cannot predict with certainty,  however,  the eventual outcome
of the remaining  governmental  investigations or private lawsuits,  nor whether
they will have a  material  negative  impact on the  Company.  Public  trust and
confidence  are critical to the  Company's  business  and any  material  loss of
investor  and/or  client  confidence  could result in a  significant  decline in
assets under  management by the Company,  which would have an adverse  effect on
future financial results. If the Company finds that it bears  responsibility for
any unlawful or  inappropriate  conduct that caused losses to our Funds,  we are
committed to making the Funds or their shareholders  whole, as appropriate.  The
Company is committed to taking all appropriate  actions to protect the interests
of our Funds' shareholders.

In addition,  pending  regulatory and legislative  actions and reforms affecting
the mutual fund industry may significantly increase the Company's costs of doing
business  and/or  negatively  impact its revenues,  either of which could have a
material negative impact on the Company's financial results.

OTHER COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

We lease office space and equipment under long-term operating leases expiring at
various dates through fiscal year 2021. Lease expense  aggregated $44.7 million,
$45.6 million and $40.6  million for the fiscal years ended  September 30, 2004,
2003,  and 2002.  Sublease  income  totaled $7.2 million,  $6.5 million and $6.2

Under FIN 46-R, we have determined that we are a significant  variable  interest
holder in a number of sponsored investment products as well as in LFL, a company
incorporated  in Ireland whose sole business  purpose is to finance our deferred
commission  assets.  As  of  September  30,  2004,  total  assets  of  sponsored
investment  products in which we held a significant  interest were approximately
$1,553.5  million and our  exposure to loss as a result of our interest in these
products  was $256.1  million.  LFL had  approximately  $475.7  million in total
assets at September 30, 2004.  Our exposure to loss related to our investment in
LFL was limited to the carrying value of our investment in and loans to LFL, and
interest and fees receivable from LFL aggregating  approximately  $53.2 million.
This amount  represents  our  maximum  exposure to loss and does not reflect our
estimate of the actual losses that could result from adverse changes.

In July 2003, we renegotiated  an agreement to outsource  management of our data
center and distributed server operations, originally signed in February 2001. We
may terminate  the amended  agreement any time after July 1, 2006 by incurring a
termination  charge.  The maximum  termination charge payable will depend on the
termination  date of the  amended  agreement,  the  service  levels  before  our
termination  of the  agreement,  costs  incurred  by  our  service  provider  to
wind-down the services and costs associated with assuming  equipment  leases. As
of September  30, 2004,  we estimate  that the  termination  fee payable in July
2006, not including  costs  associated  with assuming  equipment  leases,  would
approximate  $14.3 million and would  decrease each month for the subsequent two
years, reaching a payment of approximately $2.2 million in July 2008.

At September 30, 2004, the banking/finance  operating segment had commitments to
extend credit aggregating $242.4 million, primarily under its credit card lines.

NOTE 15 - EMPLOYEE STOCK AWARD AND OPTION PLANS

We sponsor the 2002 Universal  Stock Incentive Plan (the "USIP") and the Amended
and Restated Annual Incentive Compensation Plan (the "AICP"). Under the terms of
these plans,  eligible  employees may receive cash and stock awards based on the
performance  of  Franklin  Templeton  Investments  and  that  of the  individual
employee. The USIP provides for the issuance of up to 36.0 million shares of our
common stock for various  stock-related  awards,  including those related to the
AICP. As of September 30, 2004 and prior to considering  fiscal 2004 grants,  we
had  approximately  9.3  million  shares  available  for  grant  under the USIP,
including  those  related to the AICP.  In addition to the annual award of stock
under the plan, we may award options and other forms of stock-based compensation
to  some  employees.  The  Compensation  Committee  of the  Board  of  Directors
determines the terms and conditions of awards under the plans. Total stock-based
compensation  cost during fiscal 2004,  2003, and 2002 was $67.9 million,  $37.2
million and $42.1 million.

NOTE 16 - EMPLOYEE STOCK INVESTMENT PLAN

We have a qualified,  non-compensatory  Employee Stock Investment Plan ("ESIP"),
which allows participants who meet certain eligibility criteria to buy shares of
our common stock at 90% of their market value on defined dates. Our stockholders
approved 4 million  shares of common stock for issuance under the ESIP. The ESIP
is open to substantially  all employees of U.S.  subsidiaries and some employees
of non-U.S.  subsidiaries. At September 30, 2004, approximately 2,090,000 shares
had been  purchased on a cumulative  basis under the ESIP at a  weighted-average
price of $31.52.

In connection with the ESIP, we may, at our election, provide matching grants to
participants  in the ESIP of whole or  partial  shares  of common  stock.  While
reserving the right to change this determination, we have indicated that we will
provide one half-share for each share held by a participant for a minimum period
of 18 months.  We made our first  matching  grant in fiscal 2000.  During fiscal
2004, 2003, and 2002, we issued approximately 132,000, 104,000 and 85,000 shares
at an average market price of $52.24, $39.47 and $35.47.

NOTE 17 - OTHER COMPENSATION AND BENEFIT PLANS

Fiduciary Trust has a  noncontributory  retirement plan (the "Retirement  Plan")
covering  substantially all its employees hired before we acquired it. Fiduciary
Trust also  maintains a nonqualified  supplementary  executive  retirement  plan
("SERP") to pay defined  benefits in excess of limits imposed by Federal tax law
to  participants  in the  retirement  plan who  attain  age 55 and ten  years of
service as of the plan  termination  date. In April 2003, the Board of Directors
of Fiduciary  Trust approved a resolution to terminate both the Retirement  Plan
and the SERP as of June 30, 2003. In December  2003,  Fiduciary  Trust filed for
approval of the Retirement Plan  termination  with the Internal Revenue Service.
Since  Fiduciary  Trust has not been notified that the Internal  Revenue Service
has approved the Retirement Plan termination,  a curtailment gain (loss) has not
yet been recorded in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 88,  "Employers'  Accounting for  Settlements  and  Curtailments  of Defined
Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits".

In addition to these pension plans,  Fiduciary  Trust sponsors a defined benefit
healthcare  plan that  provides  post-retirement  medical  benefits to full-time
employees  who have worked ten years and attained age 55 while in the service of
Fiduciary Trust, or have met alternate eligibility criteria. The defined benefit
healthcare plan was closed to new entrants in April 2003.

The following table  summarizes the funded status and the amounts  recognized in
the Consolidated  Balance Sheets for the Retirement Plan and SERP, under pension
benefits, and for the defined healthcare plan, under other benefits.

During fiscal 2004, we have not made any  contribution  to the Retirement  Plan.
Based on our most recent  valuation,  we anticipate  that we will  contribute an
additional  $14.4 million to the Retirement  Plan and an additional $4.2 million
to the SERP, when final approval of the Retirement Plan  termination is received
from the Internal  Revenue  Service.  We accrued the benefit  liability for this
anticipated  funding in our  financial  statements  during the fiscal year ended
September 30, 2004.

Following the  acquisition of Fiduciary  Trust,  we established an $85.0 million
retention  pool aimed at retaining key Fiduciary  Trust  employees,  under which
employees  will receive both cash payments and options.  Salaried  employees who
remain  continuously  employed  through the  applicable  dates are  eligible for
compensation  under the program.  Excluding  the value of options  granted,  the
value of the retention plan is $68 million,  and is being expensed over a period
ranging from one to five years.  We expensed  $1.6  million,  $10.2  million and
$25.5

payments related to the September 11, 2001 events as described in Note 19.

NOTE 18 - SEGMENT INFORMATION

We have two operating segments:  investment  management and banking/finance.  We
based our operating segment selection process primarily on services offered. The
investment  management  segment derives  substantially  all its revenues and net
income from providing  investment  advisory,  administration,  distribution  and
related services to the Franklin,  Templeton,  Mutual Series, Bissett, Fiduciary
Trust and Darby Overseas  sponsored  investment  products.  The  banking/finance
segment offers selected  retail-banking  services to high net-worth individuals,
foundations  and  institutions,  and  consumer  lending  services.  Our consumer
lending   activities   include  automotive  lending  related  to  the  purchase,
securitization,  and servicing of retail installment sales contracts  originated
by independent  automobile  dealerships,  consumer credit and debit cards,  real
estate equity lines, and home equity/mortgage loans.

Financial  information for our two operating  segments is presented in the table
below.  Operating  revenues of the  banking/finance  segment are reported net of
interest expense and the provision for probable loan losses.

Inter-segment  interest  payments  from  the  banking/finance   segment  to  the
investment  management  segment  are based on  market  rates  prevailing  at the
inception of each loan. As further described in Note 1,  inter-segment  interest
income and expense are not eliminated in our Consolidated  Statements of Income.
The investment  management segment incurs  substantially all of our depreciation
and amortization costs and expenditures on long-lived assets.

We conduct operations in the following principal  geographic areas of the world:
the United States, Canada, the Bahamas,  Europe, Asia, South America, Africa and
Australia. For segment reporting purposes, we have combined Asia, South America,
Africa and  Australia  into one category - Other.  Revenues by  geographic  area
include  fees  and  commissions   charged  to  customers  and  fees  charged  to
affiliates.

NOTE 21 - FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The fair  value of a  financial  instrument  represents  the amount at which the
instrument could be exchanged in a current  transaction between willing parties,
other than in a forced sale or liquidation.  The methods and assumptions used to
estimate fair values of our financial  instruments are described below (see Note
1).

Due to the  short-term  nature and  liquidity of cash and cash  equivalents  and
receivables,  the carrying amounts of these assets in the  Consolidated  Balance
Sheets approximated fair value.

Investment  securities,  trading are carried at fair value with  changes in fair
value recognized in our consolidated net income.

Investment  securities,  available-for-sale  are carried at fair market value as
required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.

Loans held for sale are  originated and intended for sale and are carried at the
lower of cost or estimated fair value in the aggregate.  Estimated fair value is
calculated using discounted cash flow analyses.  Net unrealized  losses, if any,
are recognized through a valuation allowance included in other, net revenues.

Loans receivable,  net are valued using interest rates that consider the current
credit and interest rate risk inherent in the loans and the current economic and
lending conditions.  The majority of retail-banking loans are at variable rates,
which are adjusted  periodically.  We utilize  interest  rate swaps to hedge the
interest  rate risk on those  retail-banking  loans that are at fixed  rates and
have maturities  longer than one year. As such, the fair value of retail-banking
loans approximates their carrying value.

The fair value of loans  related to  consumer  lending are  generally  estimated
using discounted cash flow analyses.  For certain consumer lending variable rate
loans with no significant  credit  concerns and frequent  repricings,  estimated
fair values are generally based on the carrying value.

Deposits of the banking/finance  segment are valued using interest rates offered
by comparable  institutions on deposits with similar remaining  maturities.  The
amounts in the Consolidated Balance Sheets approximated fair value.

Interest-rate swap agreements and foreign exchange contracts are carried at fair
value.

Debt is valued using  publicly-traded debt with similar maturities,  credit risk
and interest rates. The amounts in the Consolidated  Balance Sheets  approximate
fair values.

Guarantees and letters of credit have fair values based on the face value of the
underlying instrument.

NOTE 22 - BANKING REGULATORY RATIOS

Following  the  acquisition  of Fiduciary  Trust in April 2001, we became a bank
holding company and a financial  holding  company subject to various  regulatory
capital  requirements  administered by the federal banking agencies.  Failure to
meet minimum capital requirements can result in certain mandatory,  and possibly
additional,  discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have
a direct  material  effect on our  financial  statements.  We must meet specific
capital adequacy  guidelines that involve  quantitative  measures of our assets,
liabilities,  and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory
accounting practices. Our capital amounts and classification are also subject to
qualitative  judgments by the regulators about  components,  risk weightings and
other factors.


                                       91
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<PAGE>
Quantitative  measures  established  by  regulation to ensure  capital  adequacy
require us to maintain a minimum  Tier 1 capital  and Tier 1 leverage  ratio (as
defined  in the  regulations),  as well as minimum  Tier 1 and Total  risk-based
capital ratios (as defined in the regulations).  Based on our calculations as of
September  30, 2004 and 2003,  we exceeded  the  capital  adequacy  requirements
applicable to us as listed below.

In our opinion,  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance sheets and the related
consolidated statement of income,  stockholders' equity and comprehensive income
and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects,  the financial position
of Franklin Resources, Inc. and its subsidiaries at September 30, 2004 and 2003,
and the  consolidated  results of their operations and their cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended  September  30, 2004 in  conformity  with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  These
financial  statements are the  responsibility of the Company's  management.  Our
responsibility  is to express an opinion on these financial  statements based on
our audits.  We conducted our audits of these  statements in accordance with the
standards of the Public  Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board (United  States).
Those standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance   about  whether  the  financial   statements  are  free  of  material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the  amounts  and  disclosures  in  the  financial  statements,   assessing  the
accounting  principles  used and significant  estimates made by management,  and
evaluating the overall  financial  statement  presentation.  We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
