ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

I. Introduction
   ------------

Franklin Resources,  Inc. ("FRI" or the "Company"),  is a diversified  financial
services  company,  which is registered as a bank holding company under the Bank
Holding  Company Act of 1956,  as amended  (the "BHC  Act"),  and as a financial
holding company under the  Gramm-Leach-Bliley  Act (the "GLB Act").  Through our
wholly-owned direct and indirect subsidiary companies,  we provide a broad range
of investment advisory,  investment  management and related services to open-end
investment  companies,   including  our  own  family  of  retail  mutual  funds,
institutional  accounts,  high net  worth  families,  individuals  and  separate
accounts in the United States and internationally. Our 245 "sponsored investment
products"  include a broad range of domestic  and  global/international  equity,
balanced,  fixed-income,  sector and money market  mutual funds as well as other
investment products, which are sold to the public under the Franklin, Templeton,
Mutual Series,  Bissett and Fiduciary  brand names. As of September 30, 2001, we
had $246 billion in assets under our management with  approximately  8.4 million
shareholder  accounts  worldwide.  In support of our primary  business  segment,
investment  management,  we also provide  certain  related  services,  including
transfer agency,  fund  administration,  distribution,  shareholder  processing,
custodial,  trustee and other  fiduciary  services.  In our  secondary  business
segment,  banking/finance,  we  provide  clients  with  select  retail,  private
banking,  consumer loan and other credit services through our bank subsidiaries.
The common stock of FRI is traded in the United States ("U.S.") primarily on the
New York Stock  Exchange and the Pacific  Exchange under the ticker symbol "BEN"
and under  the  ticker  symbol  "FKR" on the  London  Stock  Exchange.  The term
"Franklin(R)  Templeton(R)  Investments"  as used in this  document,  refers  to
Franklin Resources, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.

II. Company History and Acquisitions
    --------------------------------

Franklin  Templeton  Investments and its  predecessors  have been engaged in the
financial   services  business  since  1947.   Franklin   Resources,   Inc.  was
incorporated  in  Delaware  in  November  1969.  We  originated  our mutual fund
business with the Franklin family of funds (now known as the Franklin Funds(R)).
We  expanded  our  business,  in part,  by  acquiring  companies  engaged in the
investment advisory and investment management business.

In October 1992, we acquired  substantially all of the assets and liabilities of
the investment  adviser to the Templeton,  Galbraith & Hansberger Ltd. financial
services  business.  This acquisition added the Templeton family of funds to our
company.  The  Templeton  funds are known for  their  international  and  global
investment objectives and value style of investing.

In November 1996, we acquired certain assets and liabilities of Heine Securities
Corporation,  which provided investment  management services to various accounts
and  investment  companies,  including  Mutual  Series  Fund Inc.,  now known as
Franklin Mutual Series Fund Inc. ("Mutual Series").  The Mutual Series funds are
primarily value oriented equity funds.

                                       4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<PAGE>

We  expanded  our  business in Korea in July 2000 when we  purchased  all of the
remaining  outstanding shares of a Korean asset management  company, in which we
previously held a partial interest.

On October 2,  2000,  we  acquired  all of the  outstanding  shares of Bissett &
Associates  Investment  Management,   Ltd.  ("Bissett")  for  approximately  $95
million.  Bissett  now  operates  as part of our  Canadian  subsidiary  Franklin
Templeton Investments Corp. ("FTIC").  With the addition of Bissett, we added 12
of Bissett's  family of mutual funds to our  existing  Canadian  based funds and
expanded our investment  advisory services throughout Canada to a broad range of
clients, including institutional clients such as pension plans,  municipalities,
universities,  charitable  foundations  and private  clients of both Bissett and
other financial institutions.

On April 10, 2001, we acquired  Fiduciary  Trust Company  International,  a bank
organized  under the New York State  Banking Law  ("Fiduciary").  Following  the
acquisition,  Fiduciary became a wholly-owned  subsidiary of Franklin  Templeton
Investments. Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Acquisition, each outstanding
share of common  stock,  par value  $1.00 per share,  of  Fiduciary  ("Fiduciary
Common Stock") was exchanged for 2.7744 shares of common stock,  par value $0.10
per share of common stock of FRI (the "Share  Exchange").  The stock transaction
was valued at approximately $776 million on closing. In connection with the loss
of certain  employees  during the  September 11, 2001  tragedy,  we  accelerated
payments to the families of such  employees who  qualified  under an $85 million
retention  pool,  which had been aimed at retaining  key employees of Fiduciary.
Fiduciary  has a  reputation  as one  of the  leading  providers  of  investment
management and related trust and custody services to high net worth families and
individuals.  With the acquisition of Fiduciary,  we also added Fiduciary's U.S.
and non-U.S. mutual funds to our product line.

III. Lines of Business
     -----------------

              Investment Advisory, Management and Related Services
              ----------------------------------------------------

We derive  substantially  all of our revenues from our  investment  advisory and
management operating segment, which is our principal line of business. When used
in this report  "Franklin  Templeton  mutual  funds" means all of the  Franklin,
Templeton,  Mutual  Series,  Bissett,  and Fiduciary  mutual  funds;  "sponsored
investment products" means all of the Franklin,  Templeton mutual funds together
with closed-end investment  companies,  foreign-based  investment products,  and
other U.S. and international private, institutional, high net worth and separate
accounts.

Our sponsored investment products are offered to retail, institutional, high net
worth and separate  accounts,  which  include  individual  investors,  qualified
groups,  trustees,  tax-deferred (such as IRA) or money purchase plans, employee
benefit and profit sharing plans,  trust companies,  bank trust  departments and
institutional investors in over 128 countries.

Our  revenues  and income  are  dependent  upon many  factors,  including  those
described in the following sections:

      a. Assets Under Management
      b. Types of Investment Management and Related Services
      c. Types of Share Classes Offered by Our Funds
      d. Underwriting, Distribution and Related Services
      e. Shareholder Servicing
      f. Investment Objectives of Sponsored Investment Products
      g. Product Categorization
      h. Fund Introductions, Mergers and Liquidations

a. Assets Under Management ("AUM")
   -------------------------------

Franklin  Templeton  Investments'  revenues  depend to a large  extent  upon the
dollar  value of assets under  management,  because we earn most of our revenues
based upon fees linked to the amount of assets in the  accounts  that we advise.
As of September 30, 2001,  our U.S.  retail  assets,  including  U.S.-registered
mutual funds,  insurance  product funds,  wrap fee and partnership  accounts and
closed-end  funds,  accounted for $158.1 million of our assets under management.
Our U.S.  and  foreign  high net worth,  institutional  and  separate  accounts,
foreign-based  investment products and closed-end investment companies accounted
for $88.3 billion of our assets

                                       5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<PAGE>

under management.  As of September 30, 2001, the type of assets under management
by investment objective held by investors on a worldwide basis was:

-----------
Short-term liquid assets.

</TABLE>


The  acquisitions  of Bissett and Fiduciary in fiscal 2001  increased our assets
under management by $3.7 and $45.8 billion, respectively as of the dates of such
acquisitions.

Broadly  speaking,  the  change in the net  assets of the  sponsored  investment
products depends upon two factors:  (1) the level of sales (inflows) as compared
to the level of redemptions (outflows);  and (2) the increase or decrease in the
market value of the  securities  held in the  portfolio of  investments.  As our
asset mix has shifted since 1992 from predominantly fixed-income securities to a
majority of equity assets,  we have become subject to an increased risk of asset
volatility,  and therefore  revenue,  resulting from changes in the domestic and
global equity markets. In addition,  because we generally derive higher revenues
and income from our equity assets, a shift in assets from equity to fixed-income
and hybrid funds has a greater than proportional  reduction on total revenue and
thus,  income.  Despite such volatility,  we believe that in the long run we are
more  competitive as a result of the greater  diversity of sponsored  investment
products available to our customer base.

Many factors affect market values,  including the general  condition of national
and world economies, the political climate, movements in currency exchange rates
and the  direction  and volume of changes in  interest  rates  and/or  inflation
rates. Fluctuations in interest rates and in the yield curve affect the value of
fixed-income  assets under  management as well as the flow of monies to and from
fixed-income  funds.  In turn,  this affects our revenues from those funds.  The
multiplicity of factors impacting asset mix make it difficult to predict the net
effect of any particular set of conditions during any particular time frame.

b. Types of Investment Management and Related Services
   ---------------------------------------------------

advisory and  management  services to our  sponsored  investment  products  with
mandates in the emerging markets;

FRANKLIN/TEMPLETON  DISTRIBUTORS, INC. ("FTDI"), a registered broker/dealer with
the SEC and member of the National Association of Securities Dealers,  Inc. (the
"NASD"),  provides  distribution  services to our U.S.-registered retail mutual
funds;

and related services to certain Templeton developing funds and portfolios;

TEMPLETON  GLOBAL ADVISORS LIMITED  ("TGAL"),  a registered  investment  adviser

administrative services to certain of the Templeton funds; and

TEMPLETON  WORLDWIDE,   INC.  ("TWW"),  a  holding  company  for  the  Templeton
investment and administrative businesses worldwide.

Subsidiary  companies  conduct  research  and  provide the  investment  advisory
services and determine which securities the funds will purchase, hold or sell as
directed by each fund's board of trustees, directors or administrative managers.
In addition, the subsidiary companies take all steps necessary to implement such
decisions,  including  selecting  brokers and  dealers,  executing  and settling
trades  in  accordance  with  detailed  criteria  set  forth  in the  management
agreement for each fund, and applicable law and practice.  In addition,  certain
of our  subsidiary  companies  also provide  similar  investment  management and
administrative  services  to  a  number  of  non-U.S.  open-end  and  closed-end
investment  companies,  as well as other  U.S.  and  international  private  and
institutional   accounts,   including  certain  Franklin   Templeton   sponsored
investment companies organized in Luxembourg (SICAV funds) and Ireland (umbrella
unit trusts).

Our investment  advisory services include  fundamental  investment  research and
valuation analyses, including original economic, political, industry and company
research, company visits and inspections, and the utilization of such sources as
company public records and activities,  management interviews,  company prepared
information,  and other publicly available  information,  as well as analyses of
suppliers, customers and competitors. In addition, research services provided by
brokerage firms are used to support our findings.

Investment  management and related services are provided  pursuant to agreements
in effect  with  each of our  U.S.-registered  open-end  and  closed-end  funds.
Comparable  agreements  are in  effect  with  foreign-registered  funds and with
private accounts.  In general, the management agreements for our U.S.-registered
open-end  and  closed-end   funds  must  be  renewed  each  year,  and  must  be
specifically  approved  at  least  annually  by a vote of such  funds'  board of
trustees or  directors  or by a vote of the holders of a majority of such funds'
outstanding voting securities. Foreign-registered funds have various termination
rights, review and renewal provisions that are not discussed in this report.

Each  U.S.   management  or  advisory   agreement  between  Franklin   Templeton
Investments  and  each  fund  automatically  terminates  in  the  event  of  its
"assignment", as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the " '40 Act").
In addition,  either party may  terminate the  agreement  without  penalty after
written notice ranging from 30 to 60 days.

If management agreements  representing a significant portion of our assets under
management  were  terminated,  it would  have a material  adverse  impact on our
company.  To date,  none of our  management  agreements  with any of our  retail
Franklin Templeton mutual funds have been involuntarily terminated.

Generally,  the funds  themselves  have no paid  employees.  In the  majority of
cases, we provide and pay the salaries of personnel who serve as officers of the
Franklin   Templeton   mutual   funds,   including   the   President  and  other
administrative personnel as necessary to conduct such funds' day-to-day business
operations.   These  personnel  provide  information,   ensure  compliance  with
securities regulations, maintain accounting systems and controls, prepare annual
reports and perform other administrative  activities.  Various subsidiaries have
contracts with the funds to provide additional services including  maintaining a
fund's portfolio  records,  answering  shareholder  inquiries,  and creating and
publishing literature.

The funds  generally  pay their own  expenses  such as legal,  custody and audit
fees,  reporting  costs,  board and  shareholder  meeting  costs,  SEC and state
registration  fees and similar expenses.  The funds also pay Franklin  Templeton
Investments a fee payable  monthly in arrears based upon a fund's  average daily
net  assets.  Annual fee rates under the various  global  investment  management
agreements  generally  range  from  0.15% to a  maximum  of 2.25%  and are often
reduced as net assets exceed various threshold levels.

Our investment  management  agreements  permit us to serve as an adviser to more
than one fund so long as our ability to render  services to each of the funds is
not impaired,  and so long as purchases and sales for various  advised funds are
made on an equitable basis.  Our management  personnel and the fund directors or
boards of trustees  regularly review the fund advisory and other  administrative
fee  structures  in light of fund  performance,  the level and range of services
provided,  industry  conditions and other relevant  factors.  Advisory and other
administrative  fees are generally waived or voluntarily reduced when a new fund
is established  and then  increased to contractual  levels within an established
timeline or as net asset values reach certain levels.

We use a "master/feeder"  fund structure in limited  situations.  This structure
allows an investment  adviser to manage a single  portfolio of securities at the
"master  fund"  level  and have  multiple  "feeder  funds"  invest  all of their
respective   assets  into  the  master  fund.   Individual   and   institutional
shareholders  invest in the "feeder  funds" which can offer a variety of service
and distribution  options.  An advisory fee is charged at the master fund level,
and administrative and shareholder servicing fees are charged at the feeder fund
level.

HIGH NET WORTH INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT

Through our  recently  acquired  subsidiaries  Fiduciary  and  Bissett,  we have
broadened our ability to provide global investment  management and related trust
and custody  services and market and sell our sponsored  investment  products to
high net worth individuals and families. These services focus on managing family
wealth from generation to generation  through a full service  package  including
wealth management,  estate planning, private funds, private banking, and custody
services.  Our high net worth client  business  seeks to maintain  relationships
that   span   generations   and  help   families   plan  the  best   method   of
intergenerational  wealth transfer.  The minimum asset balance for an individual
client is generally $2 million.

Individual client assets are held in accounts  separately  managed by individual
portfolio  managers.  These portfolio  managers  determine asset  allocation and
stock selection for client  accounts,  taking into  consideration  each client's
specific  long-term  objectives while utilizing our macroeconomic and individual
stock research.

We offer  clients  personalized  attention and estate  planning  expertise in an
integrated package of services under the Family Resource  Management(R)  ("FRM")
brand.  Services  under FRM  provide  clients  with an  integrated  strategy  to
optimize wealth  accumulation and maximize after-tax wealth transfer to the next
generation.  These services  include advice  concerning  strategic  planning and
asset allocation, investment management, and custody and reporting.

INSTITUTIONAL INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT

We provide a broad array of  investment  management  services  to  institutional
clients,  focusing on foundations,  endowment funds and government and corporate
pension  funds.  Our  subsidiaries  offer  a wide  range  of both  domestic  and
international equity, fixed income and real estate services through a variety of
investment  vehicles,  including separate and commingled accounts and open-ended
domestic and offshore mutual funds.

We primarily attract new institutional business through our strong relationships
with management consultants.  Additionally, we build strong direct relationships
with trustees and fund  executives  where new business can be generated  through
additional mandates from existing clients.

Our  subsidiary,  Templeton  Investment  Counsel,  LLC, is one of the  principal
investment advisers for our managed and institutional  accounts. In September of
2001,  we  announced  that in fiscal 2002 we were  combining  our  institutional
investment  management product line and support functions of Fiduciary with that
of  Franklin  Templeton  Investments  to form one  global  sales  and  marketing
platform under a new subsidiary,  FTI  Institutional,  LLC. This new entity will
continue  to  distribute  and market the  sponsored  investment  products to our
institutional accounts under the Franklin, Templeton, Mutual Series, Bissett and
Fiduciary brand names, utilizing the investment advisory services of many of our
subsidiaries described earlier.

During fiscal 2001 we also created the Strategic Alliances Group, a division of
our subsidiary Franklin/Templeton Distributors, Inc. ("Distributors") to service
sponsors of defined contribution plans, including 401(k)'s, and variable annuity
products. This business unit will allow us to focus on expanding sales of our
asset management capabilities to the insurance industry by offering a number of
investment options, including sub-advised portfolios, mutual funds and variable
insurance trusts.

SEPARATE ACCOUNTS

Through our  subsidiaries  Franklin  Private  Client  Group,  Inc.  ("FPCG"),  a
registered  investment adviser,  and Templeton Private Client Group ("TPCG"),  a
division of  Templeton/Franklin  Investment Services,  Inc. ("TFIS"), we provide
private portfolio  management services and advisory services through third party
broker/dealer wrap fee programs.  Our subsidiary,  TFIS, also serves as a direct
marketing  broker/dealer for institutional  investors in the Franklin  Templeton
mutual funds. We also market and distribute our sponsored investment products to
individually managed and separate accounts.

TRUST AND CUSTODY

As the result of our recent acquisition of Fiduciary, we have expanded our trust
and custody  business to include global master  custody and support  services to
high  net  worth  and  institutional  clients.  Through  various  trust  company
subsidiaries,  including Fiduciary,  we offer a wide range of investment-related
services,   including,  custody  and  administration,   trust  services,  estate
planning,  tax  planning,  securities  brokerage,  trade  clearance  and private
banking,  to high net worth individuals,  families and institutional  clients in
the United  States and abroad.  In addition to custody  services,  we also offer
clients with a series of other services, including foreign exchange, performance
measurement,  securities  lending and  brokerage  services.  We provide  planned
giving administration for non-profit organizations and related custody services,
including  pooled income funds,  charitable  remainder  trusts,  charitable lead
trusts and gift annuities, for which we may or may not act as trustee.

Our other trust  company  subsidiaries,  many of which were added as part of the
Fiduciary acquisition,  include Fiduciary Investment Corporation,  an investment
company  incorporated  under New York State Banking Law and the holding  company
for many of the trust company subsidiaries; Fiduciary Trust International of the
South, a Florida state-chartered, limited purpose trust company; Fiduciary Trust
International of California, a California  state-chartered limited purpose trust
company;  Fiduciary Trust International of Delaware, a Delaware  state-chartered
limited purpose trust company; FTI-Banque Fiduciary Trust, a Swiss bank based in
Geneva, Switzerland;  FTCI (Cayman) Ltd., an offshore trust company, licensed as
a bank and trust  company (with a type "B" license) in the Cayman  Islands;  and
Franklin Templeton Bank & Trust,  F.S.B.  ("FTB&T").  FTB&T, among other things,
exercises  full trust powers and serves  primarily  as  custodian of  Individual
Retirement Accounts ("IRA") and business retirement plans.

c. Types of Share Classes Offered by Our Funds
   -------------------------------------------

Most of our U.S. and non-U.S.  registered  retail funds have a multi-class share
structure.  We adopted this share  structure to provide  investors  with greater
sales charge  alternatives  for their  investments.  Class A shares  represent a
traditional fee structure  whereby the investor pays a commission at the time of
purchase.  Class B shares,  which are  available in many of our funds  globally,
have no front-end  sales charges but instead have a declining  schedule of sales
charges  (called  contingent  deferred  sales  charges) if the investor  redeems
within a number of years from original  purchase date.  For Class B shares,  the
broker/dealer's  commission is paid by the fund's  distributor  from  contingent
deferred  sales  charges,  distribution  and service  (12b-1) fees and its other
resources.  Class C shares have a hybrid, level load pricing structure combining
aspects of conventional front-end, back-end and level-load pricing.

Globally,  we offer Advisor Class shares in our Franklin  Templeton mutual funds
and in the U.S.  we offer Z Class  shares  in Mutual  Series  funds on a limited
basis, both of which have no sales charges. FTI Funds, managed by our subsidiary
FII,  offers 7 series of funds with no sales  charges.  The  Advisor and Z Class
shares are sold to our officers, directors and current and former employees, and
are  also  offered  to  institutions  and  investment   advisory  clients  (both
affiliated and  unaffiliated),  as well as  individuals  investing $5 million or
more.  In addition,  shareholders  who held shares of any Mutual Series funds on
October 31, 1996,  may continue to purchase Z Class  shares.  We also sell money
market funds to investors without a sales charge. Under the terms and conditions
described in the  prospectuses  or the statements of additional  information for
some  funds,  certain  investors  can  purchase  shares at net asset value or at
reduced sales  charges.  In addition,  investors may  generally  exchange  their
shares of a fund at net asset value for shares  within the same class of another
fund  in  the  Franklin  Templeton  Investments  group  without  having  to  pay
additional sales charges.

The Franklin  Templeton  insurance product funds offered in the U.S.,  generally
have a two class share structure,  Class 1 and Class 2, which are offered at net
asset value  without a sales load  directly to the  insurance  company  separate
accounts (the shareholder).  The only difference between the two classes is that
Class 2 shares are  assessed a  distribution  and service fee ("12b-1  fee") (as
described below in "Distribution,  Marketing and Related  Services") to Franklin
Templeton  Investments,  the  insurance  company or others for the  expenses  of
activities  that are primarily  intended to sell shares of the class or variable
contracts  offering shares of the class. These 12b-1 fees are generally assessed
quarterly  at an annual  rate of 0.25% of the  average  daily net  assets of the
class.

(a)  Reductions in the maximum sales charges may be available depending upon the
     amount  invested  and the type of  investor.  In some  cases  noted in each
     fund's prospectus or statement of additional information, certain investors
     may  invest  in Class A shares  at net  asset  value  (with  no  load).  In
     connection with certain of these no-load purchases, Distributors may make a
     payment out of its own  resources  to a  broker/dealer  involved  with that

(d)  Distributors  pays a 2% dealer  commission  to brokers of record of Class C
     Shares, which consists of a 1% sales charge assessed to the investor at the
     time  of  sale,  and 1% of  which  is paid  by  Distributors.  Distributors
     recovers a portion of the  amount it pays to brokers by  retaining  certain
     12b-1  fees  assessed  during  the  first 12  months  and  from  collecting
     contingent  deferred sales charges on any redemptions made within 18 months
     of the time of sale.

     any Mutual  Series  funds on October  31,  1996 may  continue to purchase Z
     Class shares of any Mutual Series fund.  Shareholders of the Z Class shares
     may also  exchange into Advisor  Class shares of other  Franklin  Templeton
     mutual funds if otherwise  meeting the Advisor  Class  shares'  eligibility
     requirements. Alternatively, Z Class shareholders may exchange into Class A
     shares of other Franklin  Templeton mutual funds at net asset value,  which
     are subject to 12b-1 fees.  Distributors  may make a payment out of its own
     resources to a broker/dealer involved in selling Z Class shares.

d. Underwriting, Distribution and Related Services
   -----------------------------------------------

Franklin/Templeton   Distributors,   Inc.   ("Distributors"),   a   wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Company,  acts as the principal underwriter and distributor of
shares of our  U.S.-registered  open-end mutual funds.  Distributors has entered
into  underwriting  agreements  with the  funds,  which  generally  provide  for
Distributors to pay the commission  expenses for sales of fund shares.  Franklin
Templeton  mutual  fund  shares are sold  primarily  through a large  network of
independent  intermediaries,  including broker/dealers,  banks and other similar
investment advisers.  We are heavily dependent upon these distribution  channels
and business relationships.  There is increasing competition for access to these
channels,  which has  caused  our  distribution  costs to rise and  could  cause
further   increases  in  the  future  as   competition   continues  and  service
expectations  increase. In addition,  many intermediaries also have mutual funds
offered for sale under their own names that compete  directly with our products.
These  intermediaries  could  decide to limit or  restrict  the sale of our fund
shares, which could lower our future sales, increase redemption rates, and cause
our revenues to decline.  As of September 30, 2001,  approximately  3,800 local,
regional and national  securities  brokerage  firms  offered  shares of the U.S.
registered  Franklin Templeton mutual funds for sale to the investing public. In
the United States,  Franklin Templeton  Investments has approximately 64 general
wholesalers  and six (6)  retirement  plan  wholesalers  who interface  with the
broker/dealer community.

Broker/dealers  receive  various  fees from  Distributors,  including  fees from
investors  and the funds,  for services in matching  investors  with funds whose
investment   objectives   match  such   investors'   goals  and  risk  profiles.
Broker/dealers  may also receive fees for their  assistance  in  explaining  the
operations of the funds,  in servicing  the  investor's  account,  reporting and
various other distribution services.

Most of the U.S.-registered  Franklin Templeton mutual funds, with the exception
of certain  Franklin  Templeton  money market funds,  have adopted  distribution
plans  (the  "Plans")  under  Rule  12b-1  promulgated  under the '40 Act ("Rule
12b-1").  The Plans are  established  for an  initial  term of one (1) year and,
thereafter,  must be approved  annually by the particular  fund's board and by a
majority  of  disinterested  fund  directors.  All such  Plans  are  subject  to
termination at any time by a majority vote of the disinterested  directors or by
the  particular  fund  shareholders.  The Plans permit the funds to bear certain
expenses  relating to the  distribution  of their  shares,  such as expenses for
marketing,  advertising,  printing and sales promotion. Fees under the Plans for
the  different  share classes are shown above in the table under "Types of Share
Classes  Offered by Our Funds." The  implementation  of the Plans provided for a
lower fee on Class A shares  acquired prior to the adoption of such Plans.  Fees
from the Plans are paid primarily to third-party  dealers who provide service to
the shareholder accounts,  and engage in distribution  activities.  Distributors
may also  receive  reimbursement  from  the  funds  for  various  expenses  that
Distributors  incurs in distributing the funds, such as marketing,  advertising,
printing and sales promotion subject to the Plans' limitations on amounts.  Each
fund has a percentage  limit for these type of expenses  based on average  daily
net assets under management.

Class B and C shares are  generally  more costly to us in the year of sale,  but
they  allow  us  to  be  competitive  by  increasing  our  presence  in  various
distribution  channels.  We finance  payments of the Class B and certain Class C
share  broker  commissions.   We  have  arranged  to  finance  certain  deferred
commissions  arising from our U.S.,  Canadian and  European  operations  through
Lightning  Finance  Company  Limited,  a company  in which we have an  ownership
interest.  The repayment of the financing  advances is limited to the cash flows
generated by the funds' 12b-1 Plans and by any contingent deferred sales charges
collected in connection with early redemptions  (within six years after purchase
on Class B shares).

e. Shareholder Servicing
   ---------------------

Our subsidiary,  Franklin Templeton Investor  Services,  LLC ("FTIS"),  provides
shareholder   record   keeping   services   and  acts  as  transfer   agent  and
dividend-paying agent for the U.S.-registered Franklin Templeton open-end funds.
FTIS is  registered  with  the SEC as a  transfer  agent  under  the  Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (the " '34 Act").  FTIS is  compensated  under an agreement
with each fund on the basis of an annual fee per account,  which varies with the
fund  and  the  type  of  services  being   provided,   and  is  reimbursed  for
out-of-pocket  expenses.  In addition,  certain funds  compensate  FTIS based on
assets under  management.  Other  subsidiaries  provide the same services to the
open-end  funds  offered for sale in Canada,  Europe and Asia under  similar fee
arrangements.  As of September 30, 2001,  there were  approximately  8.4 million
shareholder accounts in the Franklin Templeton Investments group worldwide.

f. Investment Objectives of Funds
   ------------------------------

Our sponsored  investment  products  accommodate a variety of investment  goals,
including  growth or value  styles,  capital  appreciation,  growth and  income,
income,  tax-free income and preservation of capital. In seeking to achieve such
objectives, each portfolio emphasizes different investment securities.

Our equity investment products include some that are value-oriented, others that
reflect a growth style of investing  and some that use a  combination  of growth
and value.  Value investing focuses on identifying  companies which our research
analysts and portfolio  managers  believe are  undervalued  based on a number of
factors.  Portfolios that seek capital  appreciation  invest primarily in equity
securities in a wide variety of international and U.S. markets;

                                       13
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<PAGE>

some seek broad national market exposure, while others focus on narrower sectors
such as precious metals, health care, emerging technology,  large-cap companies,
small-cap  companies,  real estate  securities and utilities.  Growth  investing
relies on the review of  macro-economic,  industry and sector trends to identify
companies that exhibit superior growth potential  relative to industry peers and
the broad market. Unlike other management styles that focus on short-term market
trends,  our growth  portfolio  investment  management team invests in companies
demonstrating  long-term growth potential,  based mainly on proprietary in-house
analysis and research.

Portfolios seeking income generally focus on taxable and tax-exempt money market
instruments,   tax-exempt  municipal  bonds,  global  fixed-income   securities,
fixed-income debt securities of corporations and of the U.S.  government and its
agencies  and  instrumentalities   such  as  the  Government  National  Mortgage
Association,  the Federal National  Mortgage  Association,  and the Federal Home
Loan  Mortgage  Corporation.  Still others focus on  investments  in  particular
countries and regions, such as emerging markets.

Again, we also provide investment management and related services to a number of
closed-end  investment  companies  whose shares are traded on various major U.S.
and some  international  stock  exchanges.  In addition,  we provide  investment
management, marketing and distribution services to SICAV funds and umbrella unit
trusts organized in Luxembourg and Ireland, respectively,  which are distributed
in international market places, as well as to locally organized funds in various
countries outside the U.S.

Our sponsored  investment  products also include  portfolios managed for some of
the world's largest corporations,  endowments,  charitable foundations,  pension
funds,  wealthy  individuals and other  institutions.  We use various investment
techniques  to  focus  on  specific  client  objectives  for  these  specialized
portfolios.

g. Product Categorization
   ----------------------

As of September 30, 2001 we had $246.4 billion in assets under  management.  Our
U.S.-registered open-end mutual funds accounted for $146.7 billion of our assets
under  management.  As of September 30, 2001, the net assets under management of
our five (5) largest funds were Franklin  California  Tax-Free Income Fund, Inc.
($14.1 billion),  Templeton Growth Fund ($12.0 billion),  Templeton Foreign Fund
($8.9 billion),  Franklin  Small-Mid Cap Growth Fund ($8.0 billion) and Franklin
Government  Securities  Fund  ($7.9  billion).   These  five  (5)  mutual  funds
represented, in the aggregate, 20.6% of all sponsored investment products assets
under management.

Franklin  Templeton  Variable  Insurance  Products Trust, our insurance products
trust,  offers 27 funds,  with assets of $7.4 billion as of September  30, 2001.
The insurance product funds are available as investment options through variable
insurance  contracts  and  certain  pension  plans.  Most of the funds have been
fashioned after some of the more popular funds offered to the general public and
are managed, in most cases, by the same investment adviser.  One of the funds in
the trust includes a third class that is offered exclusively to pension plans.

Our U.S.  closed-end  funds  accounted  for $5.4  billion  of our  assets  under
management.  U.S. wrap fee,  partnership and trust accounts made up $4.1 billion
of our assets under  management.  On a  Company-wide  basis,  separate  accounts
accounted for $60.8 billion of assets under management. In addition, $22 billion
of our assets under management were held in foreign-based funds and open-end and
closed-end  accounts  whose  investment   objectives  vary,  but  are  primarily
international and global equity-oriented.

The following table shows the types of our U.S.-registered open-end mutual funds
and  dedicated  insurance  product  funds  as of  September  30,  2001,  and  is
categorized using the Investment  Company Institute ("ICI")  definitions,  which
are more detailed than the broad investment objective definitions used in "MD&A"
and in our Consolidated Financial Statements. /1/

/1/  The table excludes wrap fee, trust and partnership  accounts and closed-end
     funds. A significant  number of  institutional  assets are invested in U.S.
     open-end mutual funds and are disclosed in the table.

h. Fund Introductions, Mergers and Liquidations
   --------------------------------------------

From  time to time,  as  market  conditions  or  investor  demand  warrants,  we
introduce new funds,  merge existing funds or liquidate  existing funds.  During
the fiscal year ended  September 30, 2001,  we added and  introduced a number of
funds both within the U.S. and internationally.

In the U.S.,  we expanded our product line by launching a number of new funds or
series of funds.  We also added a family of mutual funds through our acquisition
of Fiduciary.

Internationally,  through our indirect  wholly-owned  investment  management and
advisory  subsidiaries  and joint  ventures,  we  expanded  our  business in and
launched new funds and investment  products to target country specific  markets.
For example,  in Korea, we leveraged our status as the first completely  foreign
owned  investment  trust  management   company  and  were  able  to  expand  our
distribution   channels  to  retail   banks,   securities   companies   and  the
institutional  market in that  region.  In other parts of Asia,  including  Hong
Kong,  India and Japan, we launched new funds and introduced  various  sponsored
investment products.  In Canada, we added, among others, a series of funds known
as the Tax  Class  Funds  and added the  Bissett  family  of funds  through  our
acquisition

     Emerging  Markets Bond Fund.  For  purposes of this table,  we consider the
     sales  region  to be  where a fund is  based  and  primarily  sold  and not
     necessarily the region where a particular fund is invested.  Many funds are
     also  distributed  across  different  sales regions  (e.g.  SICAV funds are
     based,  primarily  sold  in  and  therefore  considered  to be  within  the
     U.K./Europe  sales region,  although  distributed in the Asia Pacific sales
     region), but are only designated a single sales region in the table.

of Bissett. Europe was another region where our business continued to expand. We
introduced  funds in,  among other  regions,  France  (e.g.  the Fund of funds),
Ireland (e.g. the Franklin  Floating Rate Fund) and South Africa;  we also added
an additional series of our SICAV funds. Through our acquisition of Fiduciary we
added certain funds under an umbrella unit trust organized in Ireland, which are
registered in the United Kingdom, Germany, Sweden and Switzerland.

During the fiscal year ended  September 30, 2001, the following fund mergers and
liquidations  took place: 1 variable annuity fund matured and was terminated;  1
variable  annuity  fund was  terminated  and  transferred  its assets to another
variable  annuity fund; 4 Templeton  mutual funds merged into a single Templeton
fund; and 1 Franklin fund merged into another Franklin fund.

                            Banking/Finance Operations
                            --------------------------

Our secondary business segment is  banking/finance,  which offers select retail,
consumer, private banking and credit related services.

Our  subsidiary,  Fiduciary,  is a New York state  chartered  bank and  provides
private banking services primarily to high net worth clients who maintain trust,
custody  and or  investment  management  accounts  with  Fiduciary.  Fiduciary's
private  banking and credit  products  include,  among others,  loans secured by
marketable  securities,  foreign exchange  services,  deposit accounts and other
credit  services.  As discussed in Types of  Investment  Management  and Related
Services, Fiduciary also offers investment management, trust and estate, custody
and related services to institutional accounts and high net worth individual and
families.

Franklin  Capital  Corporation  ("FCC") is a subsidiary  of FRI formed to expand
Franklin  Templeton  Investments'  lending  activities  related primarily to the
purchase,  securitization  and servicing of retail  installment  sales contracts
("automobile contracts") originated by independent automobile dealerships.  FCC,
headquartered in Utah,  conducts its business primarily in the Western region of
the United States and is a finance company organized and licensed under the laws
of Utah. As of September 30, 2001, FCC's total assets included $289.8 million of
outstanding   automobile   contracts.   During  fiscal  2001,  FCC   securitized
approximately  $142.5 million of automobile  contract  receivables  for which it
maintains servicing rights. FCC continues to service $211 million of receivables
that have been  securitized  to date.  See Note 4 in the Notes to the  Financial
Statements.

Our  securitized   consumer  receivables  business  is  subject  to  marketplace
fluctuation and competes with businesses with  significantly  larger portfolios.
Auto loan and credit card portfolio  losses can be influenced  significantly  by
trends in the economy and credit  markets  which  reduce  borrowers'  ability to
repay loans.  A more detailed  analysis of the financial  effects of loan losses
and delinquency rates in Franklin  Templeton  Investments'  consumer lending and
dealer auto loan business, as well as the funding of this activity, is contained
in Note 4 in the Notes to the Financial Statements.

Franklin  Templeton Bank & Trust,  F.S.B.  ("FTB&T"),  a subsidiary of FRI, with
total assets of $122.3 million,  as of September 30, 2001, provides FDIC insured
deposit  accounts and general  consumer  loan products such as credit card loans
and auto loans.  FTB&T (formerly  known as Franklin Bank) became  chartered as a
federal  savings  bank on May 1,  2000 when the  Office  of  Thrift  Supervision
approved FTB&T's  application to convert from a California state banking charter
to a Federal  thrift  charter.  Immediately  following the conversion of FTB&T's
state charter to a federal thrift charter,  Franklin  Templeton Trust Company, a
California  chartered  trust  company,  was merged into FTB&T and  continues  to
perform its prior activities as a division of FTB&T.

Our other banking subsidiaries include, FTI-Banque Fiduciary Trust, a Swiss bank
based in Geneva,  Switzerland,  which provides an array of private banking trust
and  investment  services  to clients  outside of the  United  States,  and FTCI
(Cayman) Ltd., a licensed bank and trust company in the Cayman Islands.

IV. Regulatory Considerations
    -------------------------

Virtually all aspects of Franklin Templeton Investments'  businesses,  including
those  conducted  through  our  various  subsidiaries,  are  subject  to various
federal, state, and foreign regulation, and supervision.  Domestically, Franklin
Templeton Investments is subject to regulation and supervision by, among others,
the SEC, the National

                                       19
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<PAGE>

Association of Securities  Dealers  ("NASD"),  the Federal  Reserve  Board,  the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"), the Office of Thrift Supervision
and  the  New  York  State  Banking  Department.  Globally,  we are  subject  to
regulation and supervision by, among others,  the Ontario and Alberta Securities
Commissions  in Canada,  the Monetary  Authority of  Singapore,  the  Investment
Management  Regulatory  Organization in the United Kingdom,  the Central Bank of
Ireland, the Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong, the Korean Ministry
of Finance and Economy and the Financial Supervisory Commission in Korea and the
Securities Exchange Board of India. The Investment Advisers Act imposes numerous
obligations on our  subsidiaries,  which are registered as investment  advisers,
including  record  keeping,  operating  and marketing  requirements,  disclosure
obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent  activities.  The Investment  Company
Act imposes  similar  obligations  on our  subsidiaries  that are  registered as
investment companies.  The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose
sanctions  for  violations  of the  Investment  Advisers Act and the  Investment
Company Act,  ranging  from fines and censure to  termination  of an  investment
adviser's registration.

Since 1993,  the NASD Conduct  Rules have limited the amount of aggregate  sales
charges  which  may be paid in  connection  with the  purchase  and  holding  of
investment company shares sold through brokers.  The effect of the rule might be
to limit the amount of fees that could be paid  pursuant to a fund's  12b-1 Plan
to Distributors,  a subsidiary of FRI that earns underwriting commissions on the
distribution of fund shares. Such limitations would apply in a situation where a
fund has no, or limited,  new sales for a prolonged  period of time. None of the
Franklin  Templeton  mutual  funds are in, or close to,  that  situation  at the
present time.

Following the acquisition of Fiduciary, in fiscal 2001, Franklin Resources, Inc.
became a bank holding  company  subject to  supervision  and  regulation  by the
Federal Reserve Board ("FRB") and a financial holding company under the BHC Act.
Pursuant to the GLB Act,  which became  effective  on March 11,  2000,  Franklin
Templeton  Investments,  as a qualifying bank holding company,  was permitted to
become a financial  holding  company,  and thereby  affiliate with a far broader
range of financial companies than had previously been permitted for bank holding
companies.  Permitted  affiliates include securities  brokers,  underwriters and
dealers, investment managers, mutual fund distributors,  insurance companies and
companies  engaged  in  other  activities  that  are  "financial  in  nature  or
incidental  thereto" or  "complementary"  to a financial  activity.  The FRB has
issued interim rules  specifying  that  organizing,  sponsoring,  and managing a
mutual fund are activities that are permissible for financial  holding companies
under certain guidelines. A bank holding company may elect to become a financial
holding company if, as in the case of Franklin  Templeton  Investments,  each of
its  subsidiary  banks and other  depository  institution  subsidiaries  is well
capitalized,  is well managed and has at least a "satisfactory" rating under the
Community Reinvestment Act (the "CRA").

The FRB may impose limitations,  restrictions, or prohibitions on the activities
or  acquisitions  of a financial  holding  company if the FRB believes  that the
Company does not have the  appropriate  financial  and  managerial  resources to
commence or conduct an activity,  make an acquisition,  or retain ownership of a
company.  The  GLB  Act  establishes  the  FRB as the  umbrella  supervisor  for
financial holding companies and adopts an administrative  approach to regulation
that  requires  the FRB to defer to the  actions  and  requirements  of the U.S.
"functional"  regulators  of  subsidiary  broker/dealers,  investment  advisers,
investment companies,  insurance companies,  and other regulated  non-depository
institutions.

FRB policy provides that, as a matter of prudent banking, a bank holding company
generally  should not pay dividends unless its net income is sufficient to fully
fund the dividends and the prospective rate of earnings  retention appears to be
consistent with the capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition
of the holding company and its bank and thrift institution  subsidiaries.  As we
are a bank holding company,  this policy may be applied to us even though we are
also a financial holding company.

Almost every aspect of the operations and financial condition of our banking and
thrift  subsidiaries are subject to extensive  regulation and supervision and to
various  requirements  and restrictions  under Federal and state law,  including
requirements  governing  capital  adequacy,  management  practices,   liquidity,
branching, earnings, loans, dividends,  investments,  reserves against deposits,
and the provision of services.  Under Federal law, a depository  institution  is
prohibited from paying a dividend if the depository institution would thereafter
be "undercapitalized" as determined by the Federal bank regulatory agencies. The
relevant Federal banking regulatory  agencies,

                                       20
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<PAGE>

and the state banking  regulatory  agencies,  also have  authority to prohibit a
bank or a bank  holding  company  from  engaging in what,  in the opinion of the
regulatory body, constitutes an unsafe or unsound practice.

Each of our banking  subsidiaries is subject to  restrictions  under Federal law
that limit  transactions  with Franklin  Templeton  Investments and its non-bank
subsidiaries,  including  loans and other  extensions of credit,  investments or
asset purchases. These and various other transactions,  including any payment of
money to Franklin  Templeton  Investments,  must be on terms and conditions that
are, or in good faith would be,  offered to  companies  that are not  affiliated
with Franklin Templeton Investments.

Federal banking agencies are required to take prompt  supervisory and regulatory
actions with respect to institutions that do not meet minimum capital standards.
There  are  five  defined   capital  tiers,   the  highest  of  which  is  "well
capitalized."  A  depository  institution  is generally  prohibited  from making
capital distributions,  including paying dividends, or paying management fees to
a holding  company if the  institution  would  thereafter  be  undercapitalized.
Undercapitalized  institutions  may not  accept,  renew  or roll  over  brokered
deposits.  To  remain  a  financial  holding  company,  each  company's  banking
subsidiaries  must be well  capitalized  and well  managed.  As of September 30,
2001,  our  bank  and  thrift  subsidiaries  continued  to be  considered  "well
capitalized" and "well managed".  See  "Management's  Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition".

The FRB has adopted various capital guidelines for bank holding  companies.  The
GLB Act authorizes the FRB to establish  consolidated  capital  requirements for
financial holding companies. The GLB Act prohibits the FRB from imposing capital
requirements  on  functionally  regulated  non-bank subsidiaries  of a financial
holding company, such as broker/dealers and investment advisers. The FRB has not
published  consolidated  capital  requirements  specific  to  financial  holding
companies, but may do so in the future.

The Federal banking agencies have broad enforcement powers,  including the power
to terminate  deposit  insurance,  impose  substantial fines and other civil and
criminal penalties and appoint a conservator or receiver. Failure to comply with
applicable laws,  regulations and supervisory  agreements could subject Franklin
Templeton Investments, our thrift and banking subsidiaries, as well as officers,
directors  and  other  so-called   "institution-affiliated   parties"  of  these
organizations,  to  administrative  sanctions and potentially  substantial civil
money penalties. In addition, the appropriate Federal banking agency may appoint
the FDIC as conservator or receiver for a banking  institution,  or the FDIC may
appoint itself if any one or more of a number of circumstances exist.

V. Competition
   -----------

The  financial  services  industry is highly  competitive  and has  increasingly
become a global  industry.  There are  approximately  8,300 open-end  investment
companies of varying sizes,  investment policies and objectives whose shares are
being  offered  to the  public in the United  States.  Due to our  international
presence and varied  product mix, it is difficult to assess our market  position
relative to other investment  managers on a worldwide basis, but we believe that
we are one of the more  widely  diversified  investment  managers  in the United
States.  We believe that our equity and fixed-income  asset mix coupled with our
global  presence  will serve our  competitive  needs well over the long term. We
continue to focus on service to customers,  performance  of investment  products
and  extensive  marketing  activities  with our strong  broker/dealer  and other
financial institution distribution network.

We face strong competition from numerous investment management,  stock brokerage
and  investment  banking firms,  insurance  companies,  banks,  savings and loan
associations and other financial  institutions  which also offer a wide range of
financial services.  In recent years, there has been a trend of consolidation in
the financial services industry,  resulting in stronger competitors with greater
financial resources than us.

Although  we rely  largely on  intermediaries  to sell and  distribute  Franklin
Templeton  mutual fund  shares,  many of these  intermediaries  also have mutual
funds under their own names that compete directly with our products. The banking
industry also continues to expand its  sponsorship of proprietary  funds.  These
intermediaries  could  decide to limit or restrict  the sale of our fund shares,
which could lower our future  sales and cause our  revenues to decline.  We have
and continue to pursue sales  relationships  with all types of intermediaries to
broaden our distribution network.

We are currently  expanding our Internet  e-business to compete with the rapidly
developing  and  evolving  capabilities  being  offered  with  this  technology.
Together with several large  financial  services  companies,  we recently made a
capital investment in the development of an industry-wide Internet portal, known
as  advisorcentral.com,  which is designed to provide our  customers,  including
brokers,  dealers and investment advisors, to view their clients' holdings using
one  log-in  ID. It is not  currently  possible  to  predict  the  effect of the
Internet on Franklin Templeton Investments or on the financial services industry
overall.

As investor  interest in the mutual fund  industry  has  increased,  competitive
pressures have increased on sales charges of broker/dealer distributed funds. We
believe that,  although this trend will continue,  a significant  portion of the
investing public still relies on the services of the  broker/dealer or financial
adviser  community,  particularly  during  weaker  market  conditions.  We  have
experienced  increased  demand for  payments to its  distribution  channels  and
anticipates that this trend will continue.

We believe that we are well positioned to deal with changes in marketing  trends
as a result of our  already  extensive  advertising  activities  and broad based
marketplace   recognition.   Franklin  Templeton  Investments  does  significant
advertising  and conducts  sales  promotions  through  various  media sources to
promote   brand   recognition.   We  advertise  in  major   national   financial
publications,  as  well  as on  radio  and  television  to  promote  brand  name
recognition and to assist its  distribution  network.  Such activities  included
purchasing network and cable programming,  sponsorship of sporting events,  such
as the  "Franklin  Templeton  Shoot-Out",  sponsorship  of The Nightly  Business
Report on public television, and extensive newspaper and magazine advertising.

Diverse  and  strong  competition  affects  the  banking/finance  segment of our
business as well,  and limits the fees for our  services.  For  example,  in the
banking segment we compete with many types of  institutions  for consumer loans,
including the finance  subsidiaries  of large  automobile  manufacturers,  which
limits the interest rates that we can charge on consumer loans.

VI. Financial Information About Industry Segments

VIII. Employees
      ---------

As of  September  30, 2001,  we employed  approximately  6,800  employees at our
offices located in 29 countries. We consider our relations with our employees to
be satisfactory.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

We conduct our  worldwide  operations  using a  combination  of leased and owned
facilities.  While we believe we have sufficient  facilities to conduct business
during fiscal 2002, we will continue to lease, acquire and dispose of facilities
throughout the world as necessary.

We lease space domestically in California,  Delaware,  Florida,  New Jersey, New
York,  Utah and the  District of  Columbia,  and  internationally  in Abu Dhabi,
Australia,  Belgium,  Brazil, Canada, England,  France,  Germany,  Holland, Hong
Kong,  India,  Italy,  Japan,  Korea,  Luxembourg,   Poland,  Russia,  Scotland,
Singapore,  South  Africa,  Spain,  Sweden,  Switzerland,   Taiwan,  Turkey  and
Venezuela.  As of September 30, 2001, we leased and occupied  approximately 1.33
million square feet of leased space.  We also subleased to third parties a total
of 345,503 square feet of space.

                                       22

In addition,  Franklin  Templeton  Investments owns 7 buildings near Sacramento,
California,  as well as 6 buildings in St.  Petersburg,  Florida, 2 buildings in
Nassau,  Bahamas,  as well as space in office buildings in Argentina,  China and
Singapore.  The buildings we own consist of  approximately  1.29 million  square
feet. Since we operate on a unified basis,  corporate  activities,  fund related
activities,  accounting  operations,  sales, real estate and banking operations,
auto  loans  and  credit  cards,   management   information  system  activities,
publishing and printing  operations,  shareholder  service  operations and other
business activities and operations take place in a variety of such locations. In
fiscal 2001 we sold one of our buildings located in St. Petersburg,  Florida for
$4.1 million.

We  had  previously   entered  into  a  series  of  agreements  to  finance  the
construction  of our new corporate  headquarters on a 32-acre site in San Mateo,
California.  An owner-lessor  trust was set up to finance the  construction  and
lease the completed facility.  The construction was substantially  completed and
we moved into our new  headquarters  in fiscal  2001.  We have  entered  into an
operating lease for our new corporate  headquarters  and in connection with this
lease, we are contingently  liable under residual  guarantees for  approximately
$145 million,  representing approximately 85% of the total construction costs of
$170 million.  The lease includes  renewal  options that can be exercised at the
end of the initial  lease  period,  and  purchase  options that can be exercised
prior to the expiration of the lease term.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We  previously  reported  that three  individual  plaintiffs,  James C. Roumell,
Michael J. Wetta and Richard Waksman, filed a consolidated complaint in the U.S.
District Court for the Southern  District of Florida against  Templeton  Vietnam
Opportunities  Fund,  Inc. (now known as Templeton  Vietnam and  Southeast  Asia
Fund,  Inc.);  Templeton  Asset  Management,   Ltd.,  an  indirect  wholly-owned
subsidiary  of FRI and  the  investment  manager  of the  closed-end  investment
company;  certain of the fund's  officers  and  directors;  FRI;  and  Templeton
Worldwide,  Inc., an FRI subsidiary (Civil Action No. 98-6059).  On November 15,
2001,  the Court  preliminarily  approved a  settlement  entered  into among the
parties.  Under  the  terms of the  settlement  agreement,  the  plaintiffs  and
defendants agreed to resolve all claims for $6.5 million,  including plaintiff's
attorneys fees and costs of administering  the proposed  settlement,  of which a
minimum of $2 million will be paid to the Fund.

We also previously  reported that on June 22, 2001 plaintiffs Richard Nelson and
Dorothy Nelson filed a First Amended complaint captioned Richard Nelson, et. al.
v. AIM  Advisors,  Inc.  et.  al. in the  United  States  District  Court of the
Southern District of Illinois,  Case Number  01-282-DRH,  which added additional
plaintiffs and named as defendants  advisory and  distribution  entities from 25
different  mutual  fund  complexes,   including  Franklin  Advisers,   Inc.  and
Franklin/Templeton Distributors, Inc., both wholly-owned subsidiaries of FRI and
Templeton Global Advisors Limited,  an indirect  wholly-owned  subsidiary of FRI
(collectively, the "Franklin Defendants"). On September 17, 2001, the plaintiffs
filed a Second Amended  Complaint,  which  dismissed  certain  previously  named
defendants. The Second Amended Complaint alleges, among other things, violations
of the Investment  Company Act of 1940 with respect to distribution and advisory
contracts of funds  advised or  distributed  by the  defendants,  including  the
Franklin Defendants.  The plaintiffs are seeking actual and punitive damages, as
well as equitable and other relief.  Management believes this lawsuit is without
merit and intends to vigorously defend the action.

Other than as stated  above,  there have been no  material  developments  in the
above  referenced  litigation.  We are involved  from time to time in litigation
relating to claims  arising in the normal  course of business.  Management is of
the opinion  that the  ultimate  resolution  of such claims will not  materially
affect our business or financial position.

ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

During the fourth  quarter of the fiscal year covered by this report,  no matter
was submitted to a vote of security holders.

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
         OF OPERATIONS

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

In this  section,  we  discuss  our  results  of  operations  and our  financial
condition.  We also make some statements relating to the future which are called
"forward-looking" statements. Although we do our best to make clear and accurate
forward-looking   statements,   the  actual   results  and  outcomes   could  be
significantly  different from those that we discuss in this  document.  For this
reason, you should not rely too heavily on these forward-looking  statements. We
encourage you to read the "Risk Factors"  section below,  where we discuss these
statements in more detail.

GENERAL

The majority of our operating  revenues,  operating  expenses and net income are
derived from providing investment advisory and related services to retail mutual
funds, institutional,  high net-worth and private accounts, and other investment
products.  This is our primary  business  activity and  operating  segment.  The
mutual  funds  and  other  products  that we  advise,  collectively  called  our
sponsored investment  products,  are distributed to the public globally via five
distinct names:

*  Franklin
*  Templeton
*  Mutual Series
*  Bissett
*  Fiduciary

Our  sponsored  investment  products  include  a broad  range  of  domestic  and
global/international  equity,  balanced,  fixed-income,  sector and money market
mutual funds, as well as other  investment  products that meet a wide variety of
specific investment needs of individuals and institutions.

In fiscal 2001, we broadened our product lines with funds  currently  offered by
two  companies.  In October  2000,  the  acquisition  of Bissett and  Associates
Investment Management Ltd.  ("Bissett"),  added 12 funds to our Canadian product
line,  primarily in the balanced  and growth  asset  classes.  It also brought a
number of  institutional  and private  clients to the group.  In April 2001,  we
completed   the   acquisition   of   Fiduciary   Trust   Company   International
("Fiduciary"), a global investment management organization providing services to
institutions and private clients through its bank and trust charters.

The level of our  revenues  is  largely  dependent  upon the level and  relative
composition of assets under  management.  To a lesser  degree,  our revenues are
also  dependent  on the level of mutual fund sales and the number of mutual fund
shareholder  accounts.  The fees charged for our services are based on contracts
between our  subsidiary  entities and our sponsored  investment  products or our
clients. These arrangements could change in the future.

Our secondary  business activity and operating segment is  banking/finance.  Our
banking/finance group offers selected  retail-banking services to high net-worth
individuals and corporations and consumer lending.

At September 30, 2001,  we employed  over 6,800 people in 29 countries,  serving
customers on six different continents.

</TABLE>

Our assets under  management at the end of fiscal 2001 were $246.4  billion,  7%
higher than the prior fiscal year end. The simple monthly average value of these
assets  during fiscal 2001 was $243.4  billion as compared to $227.7  billion in
fiscal 2000, a 7% increase.  The change in simple  monthly  average assets under
management is generally  more  indicative of investment  management  fee revenue
trends than the period end change year over year.

The following table shows the relative composition of assets under management.


AS OF SEPTEMBER 30,                                  2001        2000       1999

The change in the composition of assets under  management was largely due to the
inclusion of the Fiduciary assets under management in fiscal 2001 and the market
depreciation  in equity assets.  Approximately  64% of Fiduciary's  assets under
management  were classified as hybrid assets at the time of acquisition in April
2001. This change in mix had the additional effect of lowering our effective fee
rate on assets managed as a greater percentage of assets under management are in
the fixed income and hybrid  categories which generally carry a lower management
fee than equity assets.

The  acquisitions  of  Bissett  in  October  2000 and  Fiduciary  in April  2001
increased our assets under  management by $3.7 and $45.8 billion,  respectively.
During fiscal 2001, our sponsored  investment  products  experienced overall net
cash  inflows,  including  reinvested  dividends,  in  contrast  to the net cash
outflows  experienced in fiscal 2000 and 1999. Gross product sales increased 13%
while  redemptions  decreased 7%. We  experienced  sales  increases in the fixed
income,  hybrid,  and money market  products which more than offset a decline in
equity product sales.  The chart below  summarizes  changes in assets by product
class.

Despite a relative  improvement in the  investment  performance of our sponsored
investment  products,  we experienced market depreciation in fiscal 2001, mainly
in the final quarter of the year, as a result of an overall  decline in domestic
and global equity markets.  The market depreciation led to the decline in assets
under management absent the addition of the Bissett and Fiduciary  acquisitions.
In fiscal 2000 and fiscal 1999, net outflows were offset by market  appreciation
thereby allowing our ending assets under management to grow by 5% in both years.

</TABLE>

Net income and diluted  earnings per share decreased by 14% and 16% respectively
in fiscal 2001.  Slightly higher revenue and investment  income this fiscal year
over the prior fiscal year were offset by higher  operating  expenses  resulting
from cost  increases in  distribution,  compensation  and benefits,  information
systems,  technology and occupancy,  advertising and  intangibles  amortization.
Earnings per share in fiscal 2001  decreased  16% from the prior year  primarily
due to  decreased  net income  and an  increase  in the number of the  company's
shares outstanding, primarily resulting from the Fiduciary acquisition which was
paid for through the issuance of company stock.  Net income and diluted earnings
per share for fiscal 2000 increased by 32% and 35%, respectively, principally as
a result of increased  investment  management fee revenue from increased average
assets under  management,  higher investment  income,  and lower operating costs
driven predominantly from the restructuring charge taken in fiscal 1999.

The table below presents the percentage  change in each category  between fiscal
2001 and fiscal 2000 and between fiscal 2000 and fiscal 1999.

</TABLE>

SUMMARY

In fiscal 2001, total operating  revenues  increased 1% over the prior year. The
acquisition of Fiduciary in April provided  higher  investment  management  fees
from higher average assets under  management,  despite lower effective fee rates
resulting from the change in the mix of assets under  management,  and increased
banking  revenues  included  in other,  net.  These  increases  were offset by a
decrease in shareholder servicing revenue, resulting from a decline

                                       28
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<PAGE>

in shareholder billable accounts year over year. In fiscal 2000, total operating
revenues  increased 3% due primarily to increased  simple monthly average assets
under management and shareholder servicing fee increases.

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FEES

Investment  management  fees,  accounting  for 60% of our operating  revenues in
fiscal 2001,  include both  investment  advisory and business  management  fees.
These fees are generally  calculated  under  contractual  arrangements  with our
sponsored  investment  products as a  percentage  of the market  value of assets
under management.  Annual rates vary by product, region and investment objective
and, in certain  instances,  decline as the average net assets of the individual
portfolios exceed certain threshold levels. In return for these fees, we provide
investment advisory, administrative and other management services.

Investment  management  fees  increased 1% in fiscal 2001,  primarily due to the
Fiduciary  acquisition,  which increased the simple monthly average assets under
management  in the latter half of the fiscal year.  This  increase was partially
offset by a shift in our asset mix toward lower  management fee fixed-income and
hybrid investment products. This shift toward fixed-income and hybrid investment
products  led to a decrease  in our  effective  investment  management  fee rate
(investment  management  fees  divided by simple  monthly  average  assets under
management)  in  fiscal  2001.  The  effective  investment  management  fee rate
declined to 0.58% for the 2001 fiscal year  compared to 0.61% in fiscal 2000. In
the latest  quarter,  the  effective  fee rate  reflects  the full impact of the
current  change  in asset mix and was  calculated  as  0.55%.  In  fiscal  2000,
investment  management  fees  increased  4%,  primarily  due to 4% higher simple
monthly average assets under management.

UNDERWRITING AND DISTRIBUTION FEES

Underwriting  commissions  are  earned  from  the  sale of  certain  classes  of
sponsored  investment  products that have a sales commission paid at the time of
purchase.  Distribution  fees are paid by our sponsored  investment  products in
return for sales,  marketing and  distribution  efforts on their  behalf.  While
other contractual  arrangements exist in other locations,  in the United States,
distribution  fees include 12b-1 plan fees, which are subject to maximum pay-out
levels based upon a percentage of the assets in each fund. A significant portion
of underwriting  commissions and  distribution  fees are paid to the brokers and
other intermediaries who sell our sponsored investment products to the investing
public on our behalf.  See the  description  of  underwriting  and  distribution
expenses below.

Overall,  underwriting and distribution  fees remained  constant in fiscal 2001,
despite a 13% increase in product  sales.  Sales at reduced or zero  commissions
are  offered on  certain  classes  of shares  and for sales to  shareholders  or
intermediaries that exceed specified minimum amounts.  Thus, as the mix of sales
change, so will our commission  revenue.  Commission  revenues remained constant
with  the  prior  year  due to a  greater  percentage  of  sales  at no or lower
commission  levels  offsetting the sales  increase in fiscal 2001.  Distribution
fees also  remained  consistent  with the prior  fiscal year as the  increase in
simple  average  assets under  management  was largely  caused by the  Fiduciary
acquisition.   The  Fiduciary   assets  under  management  are  not  subject  to
distribution  fees;  therefore,  these  assets did not affect  distribution  fee
income as would be expected  with a year over year  increase  in average  assets
under   management.   We  experienced   similar  trends  in  fiscal  2000  where
underwriting  and distribution  fees decreased 1% in fiscal 2000,  despite a 24%
increase in product sales.

SHAREHOLDER SERVICING FEES

Shareholder  servicing fees are generally fixed charges per shareholder  account
that vary  with the  particular  type of fund and the  service  being  rendered,
although  some  funds  are  charged  fees  based on the  level of  assets  under
management.  Fees are received as  compensation  for providing  transfer  agency
services which include providing customer  statements,  transaction  processing,
customer  service  and tax  reporting.  In the U.S.,  transfer  agency  services
agreements provide that closed accounts in a given calendar year remain billable
through the second quarter of the following  calendar year at a reduced rate. In
Canada,  the agreements  provide that accounts  closed in the previous  calendar
year  remain  billable  for four  months  after  the end of the  calendar  year.
Accordingly,  the  level of fees  will  vary  with the  split of total  billable
accounts  between open and closed  accounts,  the date on which  accounts are no
longer billable, and the growth in new accounts.

                                       29
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<PAGE>

Shareholder  servicing  fees  decreased  6% during  fiscal 2001 as a result of a
decrease in the total number of billable accounts.  In fiscal 2000,  shareholder
servicing  fees  increased 14% over fiscal 1999.  This was due to increased fees
from  funds  whose  servicing  fees are based on  assets  under  management  and
increases  in the per  account  charge,  partially  offset by a decrease  in the
average number of billable accounts for the fiscal year.

OTHER, NET

Other,  net consists  primarily of revenues from the  banking/finance  operating
segment  and  custody   services   related  to  Fiduciary.   Revenues  from  the
banking/finance   operating  segment  include  operating  revenues,   consisting
primarily of interest income on loans,  servicing income,  and investment income
on banking/finance investment securities,  which are offset by interest expense,
and the provision for anticipated loan losses.

Other,  net increased 90% in fiscal 2001.  This increase was  principally due to
the addition of the Fiduciary  banking and custody  activities  from the date of
acquisition to those of Franklin  Templeton  Bank and Trust,  F.S.B and Franklin
Capital Corporation. Other, net remained relatively constant during fiscal 2000.
Securitization of a portion of the auto loan portfolio in March 2000 resulted in
a loss that was offset by revenues from the residual portfolio. In January 2001,
we sold auto loans receivable with a net book value of $142.5 million. The gross
sales   proceeds  of  this   securitization,   including   interest  and  before
underwriting  discount,  were $139.3  million.  A gain of $2.9  million has been
recorded on the transaction.

</TABLE>


SUMMARY

Operating  expenses  increased  10%  during  fiscal  2001  primarily  caused  by
increased  compensation  and  benefits,   information  systems,  technology  and
occupancy  costs,  the addition of the operating  costs of Fiduciary,  increased
underwriting and distribution expenses and increased  amortization of intangible
assets.  In fiscal 2000,  operating  expenses  decreased 3% primarily due to the
restructuring charge of fiscal 1999.

UNDERWRITING AND DISTRIBUTION

Underwriting and distribution  includes sales  commissions and distribution fees
paid to brokers and other third parties for selling,  distributing and providing
ongoing  services to  investors in our  sponsored  investment  products.  During
fiscal 2001,  underwriting and distribution  expenses  increased 2%. Total sales
increased in fiscal 2001 by 13%, but a  significant  number of those  additional
sales were at a low or zero commission rate, resulting in a smaller proportional
increase in the commissions  paid to  intermediaries  in fiscal 2001 compared to
fiscal 2000.  Distribution fee expense was consistent with the prior fiscal year
distribution expense. We experienced similar trends in fiscal 2000.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<PAGE>

COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS

Compensation  and benefits  increased 15% during fiscal 2001.  This increase was
primarily due to the addition of approximately 790 Fiduciary  employees from the
date of acquisition,  retention bonuses for Fiduciary  employees,  annual salary
increases,  and an increase in employee  benefit and  recruiting  costs.  Salary
awards are normally given annually in October and are based upon the performance
of the  individual  employee.  The number of employees at September 30, 2001 was
more than 6,800 as  compared  to the  approximately  6,500 at the same time last
year.  Compensation and benefits  increased 4% in fiscal 2000,  primarily due to
annual salary increases awarded in October 1999 and market  adjustments  awarded
throughout fiscal 2000 for certain employees, partially offset by a 14% decrease
in the average employee headcount during fiscal 2000 as compared to fiscal 1999.
In order to hire and retain our key  employees,  we are committed to keeping our
salaries  and  benefit  packages  competitive,  which  means  that the  level of
compensation and benefits may increase more quickly or decrease more slowly than
our revenues at certain points in our growth cycle.

INFORMATION SYSTEMS, TECHNOLOGY AND OCCUPANCY

Information  systems,  technology  and occupancy  costs  increased 23% in fiscal
2001. This increase was primarily due to continued expenditure on new technology
initiatives,  an investment in the technology infrastructure of the company, the
charges and costs in connection  with IBM's  assumption of the management of our
data center and  distributed  server  operations,  and the added  technology and
occupancy costs of the Fiduciary acquisition.  During the past year, we embarked
on a number  of  hardware  upgrades,  purchased,  developed  and  installed  new
software  applications,  re-engineered our technology  infrastructure and global
network   architecture,   replaced  or  upgraded   older  versions  of  software
applications, and developed e-business strategies to improve our service levels,
work  environment  and  productivity.  We expect that  similar  activities  will
continue to impact our overall  expenditures  through fiscal 2002 and beyond, as
the  organization  looks  to  technology  and  process  enhancement  to  improve
efficiency,  lower costs and add  capacity as our  business  continues to expand
globally.  We also  experienced  an increase in occupancy  costs  related to our
expansion in Asia, Canada, and Europe as well as costs related to the relocation
to our new worldwide headquarters in San Mateo, California.

Information systems, technology and occupancy costs increased 1% in fiscal 2000.
This increase was not indicative of the actual increase in technology  expenses,
as we  significantly  increased our  expenditure  on technology  initiatives  in
fiscal  2000.  However,  that  increase  was offset by a  decrease  in Year 2000
expenses and increased capitalization of technology costs following the adoption
of a new accounting rule. In addition,  during fiscal 2000, we incurred slightly
higher occupancy costs related to our site consolidation efforts, new facilities
and the pending relocation to our San Mateo worldwide headquarters.

Details of capitalized information systems and technology costs were as follows.

ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION

Advertising  and  promotion  increased  5% during  fiscal  2001.  This  increase
resulted  primarily from  increased  promotion and  advertising  activity in the
latter half of the fiscal year to assist in educating the sales channels and the
investing  public  about  the  strong  relative  investment  performance  of our
sponsored  investment  products  during  the  year.  Advertising  and  promotion
expenses  decreased  4% in  fiscal  2000  due  primarily  to  cost  efficiencies
associated with printing and marketing material production expenditures.

<PAGE>

AMORTIZATION OF DEFERRED SALES COMMISSIONS

Amortization of deferred sales commissions  decreased 18% in fiscal 2001 and 13%
in fiscal 2000.  This  decrease  was  principally  as a result of the  financing
arrangements  described  below.  Certain fund classes,  namely class B, are sold
without a front-end sales charge to  shareholders,  while, at the same time, our
distribution  subsidiaries  pay  a  commission  to  selling  brokers  and  other
intermediaries.  Similarly,  class A shares are sold  without a front-end  sales
charge to shareholders when certain minimum investment criteria are met, yet our
U.S. distribution subsidiaries pay a commission on the sale. We have arranged to
finance  certain  deferred  commission  assets  ("DCA")  arising  from our U.S.,
Canadian and European  operations  through  Lightning  Finance  Company  Limited
("LFL"), a company in which we have an ownership interest. DCA that are recorded
on our balance sheet,  principally  consisting of  commissions  arising from the
sale of class A, B and C shares sold in the U.S., including DCA financed through
LFL, are amortized.  As a result of the  arrangement  with LFL, all Canadian and
European DCA are no longer recorded in our financial statements. Generally, U.S.
DCA  sold  to LFL  under  the  U.S.  agreement  are  retained  in our  financial
statements  since they are not considered sold under this agreement until resold
by LFL,  which occurs at least once  annually.  During  fiscal 2001,  we sold or
financed sales  commissions  globally totaling $84.7 million to LFL, compared to
$56.0 million in fiscal 2000.

OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE)

Investment and other income is comprised primarily of:

* dividends from investments in our sponsored mutual funds
* interest income from investments in bonds and government securities
* realized gains and losses on investments
* foreign currency exchange gains and losses
* other miscellaneous income, including gain or loss on disposal of company
  property

Other income  (expense)  increased  65% in fiscal 2001,  primarily due to higher
realized  gains.  During  fiscal  2001,  we  recognized  net  realized  gains of
approximately  $34.2  million  from the  sale of  certain  sponsored  investment
products held by the company for investment.  In addition,  other realized gains
of  $24.6  million  were  recognized  related  to the  sale of our  headquarters
building in San Mateo.  Investment  income  increased 61% in fiscal 2000, due to
higher average  available cash balances to invest,  higher interest  rates,  and
greater realized gains.

Interest  expense  decreased 24% in fiscal 2001. This decrease was mainly due to
the  relatively low interest rate of 1.875% on the  convertible  notes issued in
May 2001, the redemption of outstanding  commercial  paper,  and generally lower
interest  rates in fiscal 2001.  Interest  expense  decreased 33% in fiscal 2000
following a reduction in our average outstanding debt during the fiscal year.

TAXES ON INCOME

Our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2001 and 2000 remained  constant at 24%
on an annual basis  compared to 26% in fiscal 1999.  The effective tax rate will
continue to be reflective of the relative contributions of foreign earnings that
are  subject to reduced  tax rates and that are not  currently  included in U.S.
taxable income.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

At September 30, 2001, we had $569.0  million in cash and cash  equivalents,  as
compared to $746.0 million at September 30, 2000.  Liquid assets,  which consist
of  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  investments  available-for-sale  and  current
receivables  increased to $2,377.4  million at September  30, 2001 from $1,677.1
million at September 30, 2000. At September 30, 2001, approximately $850 million
was available to us under unused commercial paper and medium-term note programs.
In addition,  in fiscal 2001 we filed a shelf  registration  statement  with the
Securities  and Exchange  Commission  permitting the issuance of debt and equity
securities of up to $300 million.  Our revolving credit  facilities at September
30,  2001  totaled  $500  million,  of which,  $200  million was under a 364-day
facility.  The remaining $300 million  facility will expire in May 2003. We also
have $350 million  available in uncommitted bank lines under the Federal Reserve
Funds system.

                                       32
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<PAGE>

Cash provided by operating activities decreased to $553.2 million in fiscal 2001
from  $701.7  million  in fiscal  2000.  This  decrease  was due mainly to lower
operating  income resulting from higher  operating  expenses  offsetting a small
increase in operating  revenues.  During  fiscal 2001, we used a total of $779.6
million  for  investing  activities,  including  $484.3  million  related to the
purchase of investments,  net of liquidations;  $99.3 million in connection with
the  banking/finance  segment;  and  $99.1  million  primarily  related  to  the
Fiduciary and Bissett acquisitions. Net cash provided by financing activities in
fiscal 2001 was $49.4 million as net debt issued of approximately $215.5 million
exceeded other uses of cash in financing activities, including stock repurchases
of $172.1 million.

Outstanding  debt  increased to $574.4 million at September 30, 2001 compared to
$362.9 million at September 30, 2000. After May 2001, debt consists primarily of
the convertible notes. The convertible notes carry a yield to maturity of 1.875%
per annum to maturity. Prior to May 2001, debt primarily consisted of commercial
paper that carried  interest at variable  rates and  fixed-interest  medium-term
notes.  During the quarter ended June 30, 2001, our remaining  commercial  paper
was redeemed.  Other long-term debt totaling $61.3 million has various  maturity
dates through fiscal 2006 and thereafter.

We  had  previously   entered  into  a  series  of  agreements  to  finance  the
construction  of a new  corporate  headquarters  on a 32-acre site in San Mateo,
California.  An owner-lessor  trust was set up to finance the  construction  and
lease the completed  facility.  The construction was completed and we moved into
our new  headquarters  in fiscal  2001.  The lease  agreement is not expected to
impact our cash  flows or  financial  condition  materially  during the  initial
five-year lease period.

We have  arranged  with LFL for  non-recourse  financing  of  sales  commissions
advanced on sales of our B shares  globally.  The cumulative  sales  commissions
that we have financed through LFL since inception approximated $300.3 million at
September 30, 2001.

We expect  that the  principal  uses of cash will be to  increase  assets  under
management through expansion of our business, make strategic acquisitions,  fund
property and equipment  acquisitions,  pay  operating  expenses of the business,
enhance our  technology  infrastructure,  improve our  business  processes,  pay
shareholder  dividends,  repay  and  service  debt,  and  acquire  shares of the
company.   We  expect  to  finance   future   increases  in  investment  in  our
banking/finance  activities  through operating cash flows,  debt, or through the
securitization of a portion of the receivables from consumer lending activities.
We  believe  that  our  existing  liquid  assets,  together  with  the  expected
continuing  cash flow from  operations,  our  borrowing  capacity  under current
credit facilities,  our ability to issue debt or equity securities and our sales
commission  financing  arrangement  will be  sufficient  to meet our present and
reasonably foreseeable operating cash needs.

RISK FACTORS

"FORWARD-LOOKING  STATEMENTS." When used in this Annual Report, words or phrases
about  the  future  such  as  "expected  to,"  "will  continue,"  "anticipates,"
"estimates," or similar expressions are "forward-looking  statements" as defined
in the Private  Securities  Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Statements about our
future cash needs,  our anticipated uses of cash, the expected sources of future
cash  inflows,  and the  anticipated  costs  related to the  September  11, 2001
tragedy,  are also  "forward-looking  statements." These types of statements are
subject to certain risks and uncertainties, such as the factors described in the
risk  factors  outlined  below.  These risks and  uncertainties  could cause our
current  expectations  and predictions in the  forward-looking  statements to be
wrong.  Forward-looking statements are our best prediction at the time that they
are  made,  and you  should  not  rely on  them.  Rather,  you  should  read the
forward-looking  statements in  conjunction  with the risk  disclosures  in this
Annual Report. If a circumstance  occurs that causes any of our  forward-looking
statements to be  inaccurate,  we have no  obligation  to publicly  announce the
change in our expectations, or to revise the forward-looking statements.

WE FACE STRONG  COMPETITION  FROM NUMEROUS AND SOMETIMES  LARGER  COMPANIES.  We
compete with  numerous  investment  management  companies,  stock  brokerage and
investment  banking  firms,   insurance  companies,   banks,  savings  and  loan
associations and other financial institutions.  Continuing  consolidation in the
financial  services  industry  has created  stronger  competitors  with  greater
financial   resources   and  broader   distribution   channels   than  our  own.
Additionally,  competing  securities dealers whom we rely upon to distribute our
mutual  funds also sell their

                                       33
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<PAGE>

own  proprietary   funds  and  investment   products,   which  could  limit  the
distribution  of  our  investment  products.  To the  extent  that  existing  or
potential  customers,  including  securities  dealers,  decide  to  invest in or
distribute the products of our competitors, the sales of our products as well as
our market share, revenues and net income could decline.

CHANGES  IN THE  DISTRIBUTION  CHANNELS  ON WHICH WE  DEPEND  COULD  REDUCE  OUR
REVENUES AND HINDER OUR GROWTH.  We derive  nearly all of our fund sales through
broker/dealers and other similar investment advisors. Increasing competition for
these distribution  channels has caused our distribution costs to rise and could
cause further increases in the future.  Higher  distribution costs lower our net
revenues and earnings.  Additionally, if one of the major financial advisors who
distribute  our  products  were to  cease  their  operations,  it  could  have a
significant adverse impact on our revenues and earnings.  Moreover,  our failure
to maintain strong business  relationships  with these advisors would impair our
ability to distribute and sell our products,  which would have a negative effect
on our level of assets under  management,  related revenues and overall business
and financial condition.

WE HAVE BECOME SUBJECT TO AN INCREASED RISK OF ASSET  VOLATILITY FROM CHANGES IN
THE GLOBAL EQUITY MARKETS.  We have become subject to an increased risk of asset
volatility  from changes in the domestic  and global  equity  markets due to the
recent terrorist attacks. Declines in these markets have caused in the past, and
would cause in the future, a decline in our revenue and income.

THE LEVELS OF OUR ASSETS UNDER  MANAGEMENT,  WHICH IN TURN IMPACT REVENUES,  ARE
SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT FLUCTUATIONS.  Global economic conditions, changes in the
equity market place, interest rates,  inflation rates, the yield curve and other
factors that are difficult to predict affect the mix, market values,  and levels
of our assets under management.  Changing market conditions may cause a shift in
our asset mix towards fixed-income products and a related decline in our revenue
and income,  since we derive  higher fee revenues and income from equity  assets
than from fixed-income products we manage.  Similarly,  our securitized consumer
receivables business is subject to marketplace fluctuation.

WE  FACE  RISKS  ASSOCIATED  WITH  CONDUCTING  OPERATIONS  IN  NUMEROUS  FOREIGN
COUNTRIES.  We sell  mutual  funds and offer  investment  advisory  and  related
services in many different regulatory jurisdictions around the world, and intend
to  continue  to expand  our  operations  internationally.  Regulators  in these
jurisdictions  could  change  their  policies  or laws in a  manner  that  might
restrict or otherwise  impede our ability to distribute  or register  investment
products in their respective markets.

OUR  INABILITY TO MEET CASH NEEDS COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE  EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND BUSINESS  OPERATIONS.  Our ability to meet  anticipated cash needs
depends  upon  factors  including  our  asset  value,  our  creditworthiness  as
perceived by lenders and the market value of our stock.  Similarly,  our ability
to securitize and hedge future loan portfolios and credit card receivables,  and
to  obtain  continued  financing  for  class B shares,  is also  subject  to the
market's perception of those assets,  finance rates offered by competitors,  and
the general  market for private debt. If we are unable to obtain these funds and
financing,  we may be forced to incur unanticipated costs or revise our business
plan.

WE FACE COMPETITION IN HIRING AND RETAINING QUALIFIED  EMPLOYEES.  Our continued
success will depend upon our ability to attract and retain qualified  personnel.
If we are not able to  attract  and  retain  qualified  employees,  our  overall
business condition and revenues could suffer.

OUR  EMERGING  MARKET   PORTFOLIOS  AND  RELATED   REVENUES  ARE  VULNERABLE  TO
MARKET-SPECIFIC POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC RISKS. Our emerging market portfolios and
revenues derived from managing these portfolios are subject to significant risks
of loss from  political  and  diplomatic  developments,  currency  fluctuations,
social   instability,    changes   in   governmental   polices,   expropriation,
nationalization,  asset  confiscation  and  changes  in  legislation  related to
foreign ownership. Foreign trading markets, particularly in some emerging market
countries are often smaller,  less liquid, less regulated and significantly more
volatile than the U.S. and other established markets.

DIVERSE AND STRONG  COMPETITION  LIMITS THE INTEREST RATES THAT WE CAN CHARGE ON
CONSUMER LOANS.  We compete with many types of institutions  for consumer loans,
which  can  provide  loans  at  significantly  below-market  interest  rates  in
connection with automobile sales. Our inability to compete  effectively  against
these  companies or to maintain

                                       34
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<PAGE>

our  relationships  with the various  automobile  dealers  through whom we offer
consumer  loans could limit the growth of our consumer loan  business.  Economic
and credit market  downturns  could reduce the ability of our customers to repay
loans, which could cause our consumer loan portfolio losses to increase.

THE  SEPTEMBER  11, 2001 WORLD TRADE  CENTER  TRAGEDY MAY  ADVERSELY  AFFECT OUR
ABILITY  TO ACHIEVE  THE  BENEFITS  WE EXPECT  FROM THE  RECENT  ACQUISITION  OF
FIDUCIARY.  The September 11, 2001 tragedy at the World Trade Center resulted in
the  destruction  of our Fiduciary  headquarters,  loss of 87 of our  employees,
additional  operating expenses to re-establish and relocate our operations,  and
asset  write-offs,  all of which could adversely  affect or delay our ability to
achieve the anticipated  benefits from the acquisition.  Overcoming this tragedy
and achieving the anticipated  benefits of the acquisition  will depend on close
collaboration  between  management  and key  personnel of the two companies in a
timely and efficient manner.

THE FIDUCIARY  ACQUISITION COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR COMBINED FINANCIAL RESULTS
OR THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. If the benefits of the acquisition over
time do not exceed the costs  associated  with the  acquisition,  including  the
costs  arising  from the  September  11, 2001  tragedy  and any  dilution to our
shareholders  resulting  from the  issuance  of  shares in  connection  with the
acquisition,  our  financial  results,  including  earnings per share,  could be
adversely affected.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO FEDERAL  RESERVE  BOARD  REGULATION.  Upon  completion  of our
acquisition  of  Fiduciary,  we became a bank  holding  company  and a financial
holding company subject to the supervision and regulation of the Federal Reserve
Board under the Bank Holding  Company Act of 1956. The Federal Reserve Board may
impose  limitations,  restrictions,  or  prohibitions  on our  activities if the
Federal Reserve Board believes that we do not have the appropriate financial and
managerial  resources to commence or conduct an activity or make an acquisition,
and the  Federal  Reserve  Board may take  actions  as  appropriate  to  enforce
applicable federal law.

TECHNOLOGY  AND OPERATING  RISK COULD  CONSTRAIN OUR  OPERATIONS.  We are highly
dependent on the integrity of our  technology,  operating  systems and premises.
Although we have in place certain  disaster  recovery  plans,  we may experience
system  delays  and  interruptions  as a  result  of  natural  disasters,  power
failures,  acts of war, and third party failures,  which could negatively impact
our operations.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

In the normal course of business,  our  financial  position is subject to market
risk: the potential  loss due to changes in the value of  investments  resulting
from  fluctuations  in interest  rates,  foreign  exchange and/or equity prices.
Management is  responsible  for managing  this risk. We have also  established a
Risk  Management  Committee  to  provide a  framework  to assist  management  to
identify, assess and manage market and other risks.

We are exposed to changes in interest rates  primarily in our debt  transactions
and portfolio debt holdings available for sale, which are carried at fair value.
As of September 30, 2001, a significant percentage of our outstanding debt is at
fixed  interest  rates.  In our  banking/finance  segment,  we  monitor  the net
interest  rate margin and the average  maturity of interest  earning  assets and
funding  sources.  In addition,  we have considered the potential  impact of the
effect on the banking/finance  segment,  our outstanding debt and portfolio debt
holdings,  individually and collectively,  of a 100 basis point (1%) movement in
market interest rates. We do not expect this change would have a material impact
on our operating revenues or results of operations in either scenario.

We operate  primarily in the United States,  but also provide  services and earn
revenues  in Canada,  the  Bahamas,  Europe,  Asia,  South  America,  Africa and
Australia. The majority of these revenues and associated expenses,  however, are
denominated  in U.S.  dollars.  Therefore,  our  exposure  to  foreign  currency
fluctuations  in our revenues  and  expenses is not material at this time.  This
situation may change in the future as our business continues to grow outside the
United States.

We are exposed to equity price fluctuations.  Investments available for sale are
carried at fair  value.  To  mitigate  this  risk,  we  maintain  a  diversified
investment portfolio.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

We derive the majority of our revenues and net income from providing  investment
management,  administration,  distribution and related services to the Franklin,
Templeton, Mutual Series, Bissett and Fiduciary funds, institutional and private
accounts and other investment  products (our "Sponsored  Investment  Products").
Services to our Sponsored  Investment Products are provided under contracts that
set forth the fees to be  charged  for these  services.  The  majority  of these
contracts  are subject to  periodic  review and  approval by each Mutual  Fund's
Board of  Directors/Trustees  and/or  its  shareholders.  Currently,  no  single
Sponsored  Investment  Product's  revenues  represent  more  than  10% of  total
revenues.

BASIS OF  PRESENTATION.  The consolidated  financial  statements are prepared in
accordance  with generally  accepted  accounting  principles  that require us to
estimate certain amounts. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates.

The  consolidated   financial   statements  include  the  accounts  of  Franklin
Resources,  Inc.  and  its  majority-owned   subsidiaries  ("Franklin  Templeton
Investments").  All material  intercompany  accounts and transactions  have been
eliminated except the intercompany payable from the banking/finance group to the
parent to fund auto and credit  card  loans and the  related  interest  expense.
Operating revenues of the  banking/finance  group are included in Other, net and
are presented net of related interest expense and the provision for loan losses.
Accordingly,  reported  consolidated  interest expense excludes interest expense
attributable to the banking/finance group.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS include cash on hand, demand deposits with banks, debt
instruments  with  original  maturities of three months or less and other highly
liquid investments,  including money market funds, which are readily convertible
into cash.

INVESTMENT SECURITIES, AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE are carried at fair value. Fair values
for  investments  in our  sponsored  investment  products  are based on the last
reported net asset  value.  Fair values for other  investments  are based on the
last reported price on the exchange on which they are traded. Realized gains and
losses  are  included  in  investment   income   currently   based  on  specific
identification.  Unrealized  gains and losses are recorded net of tax as part of
Accumulated other comprehensive income until realized.

DERIVATIVES.  We do not  hold or  issue  derivative  financial  instruments  for
trading purposes.  Periodically,  we enter into interest-rate swap agreements to
reduce  variable  interest-rate  exposure with respect to our commercial  paper,
designated  as cash flow hedges,  and to hedge  exposures or modify the interest
rate  characteristics of fixed rate loans with maturities in excess of one year,
designated as fair value hedges. As of September 30, 2001, we held interest rate
swaps with a total notional  amount of $4 million and these were carried at fair
value.

We periodically  enter into spot and forward currency  contracts as principal to
facilitate client transactions and, on limited occasions,  hold currency options
for our own account.  It is our policy that  substantially all forward contracts
be  covered  no later than the close of  business  each day.  Gains or losses on
these contracts are reflected in the consolidated statement of income. The gross
fair market value of all contracts  outstanding  that had a positive fair market
value  totaled  $1.3 million at September  30,  2001.  This  represents a credit
exposure  to the extent that  counterparties  fail to settle  their  contractual
obligations.  This risk is  mitigated by the use of master  netting  agreements,
careful valuation of counterparty credit standings, diversification and limits.

LOANS RECEIVABLE.  Our banking/finance  group offers retail-banking and consumer
lending services.  We accrue interest on loans using the simple interest method.
The majority of  retail-banking  loans are at variable  rates which are adjusted
periodically.  An allowance  for loan losses on our consumer  loan  portfolio is
established monthly based on historical  experience,  including  delinquency and
loss  trends.  A loan is charged to the  allowance  for loan  losses  when it is
deemed  to  be  uncollectible,  taking  into  consideration  the  value  of  the
collateral,   the  financial  condition  of  the  borrower  and  other  factors.
Recoveries on loans previously  charged off as uncollectible are credited to the
allowance  for loan losses.  We have not recorded  allowance  for possible  loan
losses on our  retail-banking  loans and  advances as these loans are  generally
payable on demand and are fully secured by assets

                                       43
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<PAGE>

under our custody.  Advances on  customers'  accounts are  generally  secured or
subject to rights of offset and, consistent with past experience, no loan losses
are anticipated.

DEFERRED  SALES  COMMISSIONS.  Sales  commissions  paid  to  brokers  and  other
investment  advisors in  connection  with the sale of shares of our mutual funds
sold without a front-end sales charge are capitalized and amortized over periods
not  exceeding  six years - the periods in which we  estimate  that they will be
recovered from  distribution  plan payments and from  contingent  deferred sales
charges.

PROPERTY  AND  EQUIPMENT  are  recorded  at  cost  and  are  depreciated  on the
straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.  Expenditures for repairs
and maintenance are charged to expense when incurred. Leasehold improvements are
amortized on the  straight-line  basis over their estimated  useful lives or the
lease term, whichever is shorter.

SOFTWARE  DEVELOPED  FOR INTERNAL  USE.  Certain  internal  and  external  costs
incurred in connection  with  developing or obtaining  software for internal use
are  capitalized in accordance with the American  Institute of Certified  Public
Accountants'  Statement  of  Position  No.  98-1  "Accounting  for the  Costs of
Computer  Software  Developed or Obtained for Internal  Use." These  capitalized
costs are included in Property and Equipment,  net on the  Consolidated  Balance
Sheets  and  are  amortized  when  the  software  project  is  complete  and the
application  is put into  production,  over  the  estimated  useful  life of the
software.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS,  consisting principally of the estimated value of mutual fund
management contracts,  customer base and goodwill resulting from our acquisition
of the assets of  Templeton,  Galbraith  &  Hansberger  Ltd.,  Heine  Securities
Corporation,  Bissett and Associates  Investment Management Ltd. ("Bissett") and
Fiduciary Trust Company  International  ("Fiduciary"),  are being amortized on a
straight-line  basis over  various  lives  ranging  from 5 to 40 years.  We have
reviewed   intangible   assets  for   other-than-temporary   impairment.   Where
applicable,  we assessed the value of  intangibles  on the basis of the expected
future undiscounted  operating cash flows without interest charges to be derived
from these assets in relation to the carrying  values and determined  that there
is no impairment.  Effective October 1, 2001, we will adopt an  impairment-based
approach  to  intangible  assets as  further  described  in Note 19. If, in some
future period,  our  evaluation  indicates that these assets have been impaired,
the assets will be adjusted to their fair values.

DEMAND AND INTEREST BEARING DEPOSITS.  The fair value of demand deposits are, by
definition,  equal to their carrying amounts. The interest-bearing  deposits are
variable rate and short-term and,  therefore,  the carrying amounts  approximate
their fair values.  As of September 30, 2001 and 2000, we carried $109.0 million
and $10.0  million of demand  deposits and $614.6  million and $44.8  million of
interest-bearing  deposits,  respectively.  As of fiscal  year end  2001,  these
included $24.4 million in non-U.S. locations.

RECOGNITION OF REVENUES.  We recognize investment  management fees,  shareholder
servicing fees,  investment  income and distribution  fees as earned.  We record
underwriting  commissions  related  to the  sale  of  shares  of  our  Sponsored
Investment Products on the trade date.

ADVERTISING  AND  PROMOTION.  We expense costs of  advertising  and promotion as
incurred.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION. Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are
translated at current exchange rates as of the end of the accounting period, and
related revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates in effect
during the period.  Net exchange gains and losses resulting from translation are
excluded from income and are recorded as part of Accumulated other comprehensive
income.  Foreign currency  transaction  gains and losses are reflected in income
currently.

DIVIDENDS.  For the years ended  September 30, 2001,  2000 and 1999, we declared
dividends  to  common   stockholders  of  $0.26,  $0.24  and  $0.22  per  share,
respectively.

STOCK-BASED  COMPENSATION.  As allowed  under the  provisions  of  Statement  of
Financial   Accounting   Standards   No.  123,   "Accounting   for   Stock-Based
Compensation" ("FAS 123"), we have elected to apply Accounting  Principles Board
Opinion  No.  25,  "Accounting  for Stock  Issued  to  Employees,"  and  related
interpretations  in  accounting

                                       44
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<PAGE>

for our stock-based  plans.  Accordingly,  no compensation  costs are recognized
with respect to stock  options  granted,  or with respect to shares issued under
the Employee Stock Investment Plan.  Compensation  expense is recognized for the
matching  contribution that we may elect to make in connection with the Employee
Stock  Investment Plan over the 18-month holding period and for the full cost of
restricted stock grants in the year that they are earned.

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. Total comprehensive income is reported in the consolidated
statements of stockholders' equity and includes net income,  unrealized gains on
investment  securities  available-for-sale,  net of income  taxes  and  currency
translation adjustments.

The  changes  in  net  unrealized   gains   (losses)  on   investments   include
reclassification  adjustments  relating to the net realized  gains on investment
sales of $34.2 million,  $9.9 million and $0.1 million during fiscal 2001,  2000
and  1999.  The tax  effect  of the  change  in  unrealized  gains  (losses)  on
investments  was $(18.4)  million,  $7.1 million and $4.8 million  during fiscal
2001, 2000 and 1999.

EARNINGS PER SHARE.  Earnings per share were computed as follows:

NOTE 2 - ACQUISITIONS

On October 2, 2000,  we  acquired  all of the issued and  outstanding  shares of
Bissett,  a Canadian asset  management  company.  The all-cash  transaction  was
valued at approximately  $95 million.  Intangible  assets of  approximately  $89
million with lives  ranging from 15 to 40 years were recorded as a result of the
acquisition.  We accounted for this transaction using the purchase method. These
financial  statements  include the operating  results of Bissett from October 2,
2000.

On April 10, 2001, we acquired Fiduciary. These financial statements include the
results of Fiduciary from April 10, 2001. Each share of Fiduciary's common stock
was exchanged  for 2.7744 shares of our common stock,  resulting in the issuance
in the aggregate of  approximately  20,187,000  shares of our common stock.  The
value of the shares issued in exchange for Fiduciary  was  approximately  $775.8
million.  We  accounted  for this  transaction  using  the  purchase  method  of
accounting.  The excess of the purchase price,  including our acquisition costs,
over the fair value of the net assets  acquired  resulted  in goodwill of $559.5
million. Net assets acquired included $235.5 million of other intangible assets.
As of  September  30, 2001,  we wrote off the net  intangible  asset  related to
Fiduciary's  headquarters lease of $8.2 million as a result of the September 11,
2001 terrorist attack. See Note 18. The estimated life of the remaining goodwill
and other intangible assets is 40 and 15 years, respectively.

We have  not  presented  proforma  combined  results  of  operations  for  these
acquisitions  because the results of operations as reported in the  accompanying
consolidated statements of income would not have been materially different.

NOTE 7 - SEGMENT INFORMATION

We have two operating segments:  investment management and banking/finance.  The

segment  offers  consumer  lending  and  selected   retail-banking  services  to
individuals.

Financial  information  for our two  operating  segments  for  the  years  ended
September  30, 2001,  2000 and 1999 is  presented in the table below.  Operating
revenues of the banking/finance segment are reported net of interest expense and

</TABLE>


The investment  management segment incurs  substantially all of our depreciation
and amortization costs and expenditures on long-lived assets.

We conduct operations in the following principal  geographic areas of the world:
the United States, Canada, the Bahamas,  Europe, Asia, South America, Africa and
Australia. For segment reporting purposes, we have combined Asia, South America,
Africa and  Australia  into one category - Other.  Revenues by  geographic  area
include  fees  and  commissions   charged  to  customers  and  fees  charged  to
affiliates.

In May 2001,  we received  approximately  $490 million in net proceeds  upon the
closing of the sale of $877 million  principal amount at maturity of zero-coupon
convertible senior notes due 2031 (the "Convertible Notes").

The  Convertible  Notes,  which were offered to qualified  institutional  buyers
only, carry a yield to maturity of 1.875% per annum, with an initial  conversion
premium of 43%. Each of the $1,000  (principal  amount at maturity)  Convertible
Notes is convertible  into 9.3604 shares of our common stock.  We may redeem the
Convertible  Notes for cash on or after May 11, 2006 at their accreted value. We
may be required to repurchase the Convertible  Notes at their accreted value, at
the option of the holders,  on May 11 of 2003,  2004, 2006, 2011, 2016, 2021 and
2026.  In  such  event,  we may  choose  to pay  the  purchase  price  for  such
repurchases in cash or shares of our common stock.

At September 30, 2001,  the amount  included in long-term debt in respect of the
Convertible Notes was $504.7 million including principal outstanding and accrued
interest.  In the maturity  schedule  above,  we have  classified this amount as
maturing  after  September  2006, as the final  maturity  date is May 2031.  The
holders'  ability to redeem will depend on the  performance of our common stock.
If our  stock  price  at May  2003,  2004,  and  2006  is the  same as it was at
September  30,  2001,  holders  will not redeem  the  Convertible  Notes  before
September 2006.

At September  30,  2001,  approximately  $850 million was  available to us under
unused  commercial  paper and  medium-term  note programs and an additional $300
million was available under a shelf  registration  statement with the Securities
and Exchange  Commission  permitting the issuance of debt and equity securities.
We did not have any commercial paper  outstanding or medium term notes issued at
September 30, 2001.

Our revolving credit  facilities at September 30, 2001 totaled $500 million,  of
which $200  million was under a 364-day  facility.  The  remaining  $300 million
facility will expire in May 2003. The agreements related to the revolving credit
facilities include various restrictive  covenants,  including:  a capitalization
ratio,  interest  coverage  ratio,  minimum  working  capital and  limitation on
additional  debt. We also have $350 million  available in uncommitted bank lines
under the Federal Reserve Funds system.

Substantially  all of our dividend  income was generated by  investments  in our
sponsored investment  products.  We realized a gain of $32.9 million on the sale
of our headquarters  building in San Mateo in July 2000. That gain was amortized
over 12 months, the period of our leaseback on the building.

addition,  there  are  approximately  $23  million  in  Federal  operating  loss

valuation  allowance has been  recognized on certain  deferred tax assets due to
the uncertainty of realizing the benefit of the loss and credit carry-forwards.

We have  made no  provision  for U.S.  taxes on  $1,687  million  of  cumulative
undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as those earnings are intended to
be reinvested for an indefinite  period of time.  Determination of the potential
amount of  unrecognized  deferred  U.S.  income  tax  liability  related to such
reinvested  income  is  not  practicable  because  of the  numerous  assumptions
associated  with this  hypothetical  calculation;  however,  foreign tax credits
would be available to reduce some portion of this amount.

NOTE 11 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

We lease office space and equipment under long-term operating leases expiring at
various dates through fiscal year 2017. Lease expense  aggregated $30.9 million,
$43.1 million and $38.7  million for the fiscal years ended  September 30, 2001,
2000 and 1999, respectively.  Future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable
operating  leases are not material.

We entered into an operating  lease for our new  corporate  headquarters  in San
Mateo,  California that expires in fiscal 2005, with additional  renewal options
for a further period of up to 10 years.  In connection  with this lease,  we are
contingently liable under residual  guarantees,  for approximately $145 million,
representing  approximately 85% of the total construction costs of $170 million.
The lease  agreement  is not  expected  to impact  our cash  flows or  financial
condition  materially  during the initial  five-year  lease  period.  As the net
present value of the

minimum lease payments,  including the residual guarantee,  was less than 90% of
the fair value of the leased  property at the  inception of the lease,  this has
been classified as an operating lease.

At September 30, 2001,  the  banking/finance  segment had  commitments to extend
credit  aggregating  $235.0  million,  principally  under its credit card lines.
Standby letters of credit existed  totaling $10.2 million for Fiduciary  clients
which  expire  through  March 2002.  These  credits  are  secured by  marketable
securities.

We are  involved in various  claims and legal  proceedings  that are  considered
normal in our  business.  While it is not feasible to predict or  determine  the
final  outcome of these  proceedings,  we do not believe that they should have a
material  adverse  effect on our  financial  position,  results of operations or
liquidity.

In  February  2001,  we signed an  agreement  with IBM under  which IBM  assumed
management of our data center and distributed server operations. Under the terms
of the  agreement,  we may terminate the agreement any time after March 2004. If
we were to terminate the  agreement,  we would incur a termination  charge.  The
maximum  termination  charge  payable  depends  on service  levels  prior to our
termination of the agreement, and the amount of costs IBM would incur in winding
down the services.  Based on September 30, 2001 service levels, this termi-


                                       53

nation fee would  approximate $33 million.  We do not consider it likely that we
will incur this cost.  Under the terms of the agreement,  we also must pay IBM a
transition charge of approximately $2.7 million in March 2003.

NOTE 12 - EMPLOYEE STOCK AWARD AND OPTION PLANS

We sponsor a  universal  stock plan and an Annual  Incentive  Compensation  Plan
("AICP").  Under the terms of these plans,  eligible  employees may receive cash
and stock awards. Under the terms of the AICP, restricted stock awards are based
on our pretax  operating  income.  The  universal  stock plan  provides  for the
issuance  of  up  to  26  million   shares  of  the  common  stock  for  various
stock-related  awards,  including those related to the AICP. As of September 30,
2001,  we had  approximately  10 million  shares  available  for grant under the
universal  stock plan,  including  those related to the AICP. In addition to the
annual  award of stock under the plan,  we may award  options and other forms of
stock-based compensation to certain employees.  Currently, only restricted stock
and stock options have been granted. The Compensation  Committee of the Board of
Directors  determines the terms and conditions of awards under the plans.  Total
compensation  cost recognized for stock-based  compensation  during fiscal 2001,
2000 and 1999 was $28.5 million, $28.9 million and $37.9 million, respectively.

Information regarding stock options is as follows:

The range of exercise  prices for these  options at September  30, 2001 was from
$28.19 to $43.36.  Of these,  83% were exercisable at prices ranging from $32.63
to $38.38. The weighted-average remaining contractual life for the options was 7
years.

If we had  determined  compensation  costs  for our stock  option  plans and our
Employee Stock Investment Plan (See Note 13) based upon fair values at the grant
dates in accordance  with the provisions of FAS 123, our net income and earnings
per share would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts  indicated below. For
pro forma purposes,  the estimated fair value of options is amortized to expense
over the options' vesting period.

NOTE 13 - EMPLOYEE STOCK INVESTMENT PLAN

We have a qualified,  non-compensatory  Employee Stock  Investment Plan ("ESIP")
which  allows  participants  who meet certain  eligibility  criteria to purchase
shares of our  common  stock at 90% of their  market  value on  certain  defined
dates. Our  stockholders  approved 4 million shares of common stock for issuance
under  the  ESIP.  The  ESIP is  open to  substantially  all  employees  of U.S.
subsidiaries and certain  employees of non-U.S.  subsidiaries.  At September 30,
2001, approximately 913,000 shares had been purchased on a cumulated basis under
the ESIP at a weighted average price of $32.13.

In connection  with the ESIP, we may provide  matching grants to participants in
the ESIP of whole or partial shares of common stock.  While  reserving the right
to  change  such  determination,  we have  indicated  that we will  provide  one
half-share  for each  share  held by a  participant  for a minimum  period of 18
months. Our first matching grant was made in fiscal 2000. During fiscal 2001 and
2000,  we issued  approximately  81,000 and 84,000  shares at an average  market
price of $45.04 and $35.52, respectively.

NOTE 14 - OTHER COMPENSATION AND BENEFIT PLANS

Following  the   acquisition   of  Fiduciary  on  April  10,  2001,  we  assumed
responsibility for a number of compensation and benefit plans that Fiduciary had
with its employees.

Fiduciary has a noncontributory retirement plan (the "retirement plan") covering
substantially all Fiduciary  employees who had attained age 21 and completed one
year of service. Fiduciary also maintains a nonqualified supplementary executive
retirement  plan  ("SERP")  to  pay  defined  benefits  to  participants  in the
retirement plan that are in excess of certain limits imposed by Federal tax law.
In addition to these  pension  retirement  plans,  Fiduciary  sponsors a defined
benefit  healthcare  plan that  provides  post-retirement  medical  benefits  to
full-time  employees  who have  worked  10 years  and  attained  age 55 while in
service of Fiduciary. As of the date of acquisition,  these plans were closed to
new entrants.

The benefit obligation at September 30, 2001 in respect of these plans was $34.5
million  which  exceeded the fair value of plan assets by $15.3  million.  As of
September 30, 2001,  we were fully  accrued under these plans.  The net periodic
benefit cost reflected on our statement of operations was $1.4 million in fiscal
2001.

We used the following assumptions in calculating financial information for these
plans:


                                      PENSION BENEFITS      NON-PENSION BENEFITS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Discount rate                                   7.25%                     7.25%
 Expected return on plan assets                  9.00%                       N/A
 Increase in rate of compensation                5.50%                     5.50%


                                       55
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<PAGE>

Following the acquisition of Fiduciary,  we established a $85 million  retention
pool aimed at retaining  key Fiduciary  employees,  under which  employees  will
receive  both  cash  payments  and  options.   Salaried   employees  who  remain
continuously employed through the applicable dates are eligible for compensation
under the  program.  Excluding  the value of options  granted,  the value of the
retention plan is $68 million,  and is being expensed over a period ranging from
one to five years.  During fiscal 2001,  we expensed $24 million,  including the
acceleration of retention  payments  related to the September 11, 2001 events as
described in Note 18.

NOTE 15 - RESTRUCTURING

In  December   1998,  we  adopted  a   restructuring   plan  estimated  to  cost
approximately $58.4 million and designed to reduce costs, improve service levels
and reprioritize  our business  activities.  All of the total estimated  charges
were utilized at September 30, 2000.

NOTE 16 - FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The fair  value of a  financial  instrument  represents  the amount at which the
instrument could be exchanged in a current  transaction between willing parties,
other than in a forced sale or liquidation.  The methods and assumptions used to
estimate fair values of our financial instruments are described below.

Due to the  short-term  nature and  liquidity of Cash and cash  equivalents  and
Receivables,  the carrying amounts of these assets in the  consolidated  balance
sheets approximated fair value.

Investment  securities,  available-for-sale  are carried at fair market value as
required by generally accepted accounting principles. See Note 1.

Loans receivable,  net are valued using interest rates that consider the current
credit and interest rate risk inherent in the loans and the current economic and
lending conditions.  The amounts in the consolidated balance sheets approximated
fair value.

Deposits of the banking/finance  segment are valued using interest rates offered
by comparable  institutions on deposits with similar remaining  maturities.  The
amounts in the consolidated balance sheets approximated fair value.

As of September 30, 2001,  interest-rate swap agreements that expire in February
2003 and August 2004 are accounted for at their fair value of approximately $0.2
million  and  foreign   exchange   contracts   are  carried  at  fair  value  of
approximately zero.

Debt is valued using  publicly-traded debt with similar maturities,  credit risk
and interest rates.  The amounts in the consolidated  balance sheet  approximate
fair values.

NOTE 17 - BANKING REGULATORY RATIOS

Following  the  Fiduciary  acquisition  in April 2001,  we became a bank holding
company and a financial  holding company subject to various  regulatory  capital
requirements  administered  by the  federal  banking  agencies.  Failure to meet
minimum  capital  requirements  can  initiate  certain  mandatory,  and possibly
additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a
direct  material  effect on our financial  statements.  Under  capital  adequacy
guidelines and the regulatory  framework for prompt  corrective  action, we must
meet  specific  capital  guidelines  that involve  quantitative  measures of our
assets,  liabilities,  and certain  off-balance  sheet items as calculated under
regulatory accounting practices. Our capital amounts and classification are also
subject to  qualitative  judgements by the  regulators  about  components,  risk
weightings and other factors.

Quantitative  measures  established  by  regulation to ensure  capital  adequacy
require us to  maintain  minimum  amounts and ratios of total and Tier 1 capital
(as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined) and of Tier
1 capital to average assets (as defined).

We believe  that,  as of  September  30,  2001,  we exceed the capital  adequacy
requirements listed below.

NOTE 18 - SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 EVENT

On September 11, 2001, the headquarters of our subsidiary company, Fiduciary, at
Two World Trade Center was destroyed in the  terrorist  attacks on New York City
(the  "September  11, 2001 event").  Franklin  Templeton  Investments  has since
leased  office space for  Fiduciary in midtown  Manhattan,  to resume  permanent
operations.

The  following  table  shows the  financial  impact of the event  recognized  at
September 30, 2001:

Approximately  $19.9 million of the estimated costs were for the write-off of an
intangible  asset  related  to the  lease  and the  write-off  of  property  and
equipment lost in the September 11, 2001 event. The other significant component,
$16.5 million related to employee benefit  payments,  including the acceleration
of payments under the employee  retention  bonus plan related to the acquisition
of Fiduciary, and other payments made in respect to victims of the September 11,
2001 event that were employees of Franklin Templeton Investments.

NOTE 19 - NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

In June 2001,  Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 141,  "Business
Combinations" ("SFAS 141") and Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No.
142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible  Assets" ("SFAS 142") were issued.  SFAS 141
requires  that all  business  combinations  initiated  after  June  30,  2001 be
accounted  for  using  the  purchase  method  of  accounting  and also  requires
identified intangible assets acquired in a business combination be recognized as
an asset apart from  goodwill if they meet certain  criteria.  The impact of the
adoption of SFAS 141 on our reported operating  results,  financial position and
existing financial statement disclosure is not expected to be material.

SFAS 142 applies to all goodwill and identified  intangible assets acquired in a
business combination.  Under the new standard, all goodwill and indefinite-lived
intangible  assets,  including that acquired  before initial  application of the
standard,  will not be  amortized  but will be tested  for  impairment  at least
annually.  The new  standard  is  effective  for fiscal  years  beginning  after
December  15,  2001.  Subject  to a  detailed  review,  we expect a $50  million
reduction of expense  related to  amortization  of goodwill and  indefinite-life
intangible assets.

<PAGE>

In August 2001, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, "Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived  Assets" ("SFAS 144"),  was issued.
This statement addresses  financial  accounting and reporting for the impairment
or disposal of long-lived assets and broadens the definition of what constitutes
a discontinued  operation and how the results of a discontinued operation are to
be  measured  and  presented.  The  provisions  of SFAS  144 are  effective  for
financial  statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001,
and we expect to early adopt this  statement  on October 1, 2001.  The impact of
the adoption of SFAS 144 on our reported operating  results,  financial position
and existing financial statement disclosure is not expected to be material.

cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended  September  30, 2001,
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America.  These financial  statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management;  our  responsibility  is to express  an  opinion on these  financial
statements  based on our  audits.  We  conducted  our audits of these  financial
statements  in  accordance  with auditing  standards  generally  accepted in the
United  States of America,  which  require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable  assurance about whether the financial  statements are free of
material  misstatement.  An audit includes examining,  on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and  disclosures in the financial  statements,  assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall  financial  statement  presentation.  We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
