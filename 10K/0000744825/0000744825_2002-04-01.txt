ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

GENERAL

     American Shared Hospital Services ("ASHS" and, together with its
subsidiaries, the "Company") provides Gamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgery
services to twelve medical centers in eleven states. The Company provides these
services through its 81% indirect interest in GK Financing, LLC, a California
limited liability company ("GKF"). The remaining 19% of GKF is owned by GKV
Investments, Inc., a wholly owned U.S. subsidiary of Elekta AG, a Swedish
company ("Elekta"). Elekta is the manufacturer of the Leksell Gamma Knife (the
"Gamma Knife"). GKF is a non-exclusive provider of alternative financing
services for Elekta. Gamma Knife services accounted for 100% of the Company's
revenues in 2001.

     At present, the Company is developing its business model for "The Operating
Room for the 21st Century" (sm) ("OR21" (sm)). OR21 is not expected to generate
significant revenues within the next twelve months.

     In November 1998, the Company sold its diagnostic imaging business to
affiliates of Alliance Imaging, Inc. (the "Purchaser") for $13,552,000 in cash
and the assumption by the Purchaser of substantially all of the liabilities of
the diagnostic imaging business, including approximately $27.1 million in debt.
Prior to that sale, the Company provided Magnetic Resonance Imaging ("MRI"),
Computed Axial Tomography, Ultrasound, Nuclear Medicine and Cardiac
Catheterization Laboratory services to approximately 190 customers in 22 states.

     The Company was incorporated in the state of California in 1983 and its
predecessor, Ernest A. Bates, M.D., Ltd. (d/b/a American Shared Hospital
Services), a California limited partnership, was formed in June 1980.

GAMMA KNIFE OPERATIONS

     Gamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgery, a non-invasive procedure, is an
alternative to conventional brain surgery or can be an adjunct to conventional
brain surgery. Compared to conventional surgery, Gamma Knife surgery usually
involves shorter patient hospitalization, lower risk of complications and can be
provided at a lower cost. Typically, Gamma Knife patients resume their normal
activities one or two days after treatment. The Gamma Knife treats the patient
with 201 single doses of gamma rays that are focused with great precision on
small and medium, well circumscribed and critically located structures in the
brain. The Gamma Knife delivers the concentrated dose of gamma rays from 201
sources of Cobalt 60 housed in the Gamma Knife. The 201 Cobalt 60 sources
converge at the target area and deliver a dose that is high enough to destroy
the diseased tissue without damaging surrounding healthy tissue.

     The Gamma Knife treats selected malignant tumors (i.e. solitary and
multiple metastatic tumors, gliomas, nasopharyngeal carcinomas and ocular
meningiomas), benign brain tumors (i.e. meningiomas, pituitary and acoustic
neuromas, craniopharyngiomas), arteriovenous malformations and trigeminal
neuralgia (facial pain). Research is being conducted to determine whether the
Gamma Knife can be effective in the treatment of epilepsy, Parkinson's Disease
and other functional disorders.

     In the early 1950's, Lars Leksell, M.D., professor of neurological surgery
at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden, researched ways to
non-invasively treat brain disorders using stereotactically directed beams of
energy. Dr. Leksell is acknowledged as the developer of stereotactic
radiosurgery. Stereotactic radiosurgery is a surgical procedure in which
radiation is stereotactically delivered to a prescribed target. In 1968, Dr.
Leksell and Borte Larsson, professor of biophysics at the Gustaf Werner
Institute at the University of Uppsala in Sweden, introduced the first prototype
Gamma Knife, at the Karolinska Hospital. Initially, the Gamma Knife treated
vascular malformations, benign brain tumors and functional disorders. The Gamma
Knife was first introduced into the United States in 1987. During the past
decade, Gamma Knife treatment of malignant brain tumors became accepted clinical
practice and is now the most prevalent Gamma Knife

                                        1

indication. The Gamma Knife continued to evolve and the B unit was introduced in
the United States in 1997. The latest Gamma Knife, the C unit, was first
installed in the United States in 2000.

     There are currently 66 Gamma Knife units operating at 65 sites in the
United States and approximately 156 units in operation worldwide. As of December
31, 2001, in excess of 170,000 procedures had been performed worldwide. An
estimated percentage breakdown of these Gamma Knife procedures performed in the
U.S. by indications treated are as follows: malignant (43%) and benign (30%)
brain tumors, vascular disorders (14%) and functional disorders (13%).

     The Company, as of March 15, 2002, has twelve (12) Gamma Knife units
operating at twelve (12) sites in the United States. In addition, the Company
has three (3) more hospitals that are currently under development. The Company's
first Gamma Knife commenced operation in September 1991. The Company's Gamma
Knife units performed approximately 1,500 procedures in 2001 for a cumulative
total of approximately 5,700 procedures through December 31, 2001.

     Gamma Knife revenues for the Company during the five (5) years ended
December 31, 2001 and the percentage of total revenues of the Company
represented by the Gamma Knife for each of the last five years are set forth
below:

</Table>

     The Company conducts its Gamma Knife business through its 81% indirect
interest in GKF. The remaining 19% interest is indirectly owned by Elekta. GKF,
formed in October 1995, is managed by its policy committee. The policy committee
is composed of one representative from the Company, Ernest A. Bates, M.D., the
Company's Chairman and CEO, and one representative from Elekta. The policy
committee sets the operating policy for GKF. The policy committee may act only
with the unanimous approval of all of its members. The policy committee selects
a manager to handle GKF's daily operations. Craig K. Tagawa, Chief Executive
Officer of GKF and Chief Operating and Financial Officer of the Company, serves
as GKF's manager.

     GKF profits and/or losses and any cash distributions are allocated based on
membership interests. GKF's Operating Agreement requires that it have a cash
reserve of at least $50,000 before cash distributions are made to its members.
From inception to December 31, 2001, GKF distributed $6,337,000 to the Company.

RISKS OF GAMMA KNIFE BUSINESS

     There are significant risks involved in the Company's Gamma Knife business,
including the following:

     - Each Gamma Knife unit requires a substantial capital investment.
       Historically our cost for a Gamma Knife unit has been approximately
       $2,710,000. In some cases, we contribute additional funds for capital
       costs and/or annual operating costs such as marketing. Due to the
       structure of our contracts with medical centers, there can be no
       assurance that these costs will be fully recovered or that we will earn a
       satisfactory return on our investment.

     - There is a limited market for the Gamma Knife. Due to the substantial
       costs of acquiring a Gamma Knife unit, we must identify medical centers
       that possess neurosurgery and oncology departments capable of performing
       a large number of Gamma Knife procedures. We have identified
       approximately 200 such medical centers in the United States as potential
       future sites. There currently are approximately 66 operating Gamma Knife
       units in the United States, 12 of which are units owned by

                                        2
<PAGE>

       us, and approximately 156 units in operation worldwide. There can be no
       assurance that we will be successful in placing additional units at a
       significant number of sites in the future.

     - Our business is capital intensive and we have traditionally financed each
       Gamma Knife with debt. Our long term debt totals $25,920,000 and is
       collateralized by the Gamma Knife units and other assets, including our
       accounts receivable and future proceeds from any contract between us and
       any end user of the financed equipment. This high level of debt may
       adversely affect our ability to secure additional credit in the future,
       and as a result may affect our operations and profitability. If default
       occurs in the future, our creditors would have the ability to accelerate
       the defaulted loan, to seize the Gamma Knife unit with respect to which
       default has occurred, and to apply any collateral they may have at the
       time to cure the default.

     - There currently are approximately four companies (in addition to our
       company) that provide alternative, non-conventional Gamma Knife financing
       to potential customers. There are no competitor companies that currently
       have more than four Gamma Knife units in operation. Our relationship with
       Elekta, the manufacturer of the Leksell Gamma Knife units, is
       non-exclusive, and in the past we have lost sales to customers that chose
       to purchase a Gamma Knife unit directly from Elekta AG. In addition, in
       the future, we may continue to lose sales to such customers and may also
       lose sales to our competitors. There can be no assurance that in the
       future we will be able to successfully compete against others in placing
       units.

     - There are several methods of radiosurgery (including the modified linear
       accelerator) as well as conventional neurosurgery that compete against
       the Gamma Knife. Currently, there are approximately 300-350 medical
       centers in the United States with modified linear accelerators. Each of
       the medical centers targeted by us could decide to acquire another
       radiosurgery modality instead of a Gamma Knife. In addition,
       neurosurgeons who are primarily responsible for referring patients for
       Gamma Knife surgery may not be willing to make such referrals for various
       reasons, instead opting for invasive surgery. There can be no assurance
       that we will be able to secure a sufficient number of sites or Gamma
       Knife procedures to sustain its profitability and growth.

     - The amount reimbursed to medical centers for each Gamma Knife treatment
       may decline in the future. The reimbursement decrease may come from
       federally mandated programs (i.e., Medicare and Medicaid) or other third
       party payor groups. Ten of our existing contracts are reimbursed by the
       medical center to us on a fee-for-service basis. The primary risk to us
       under this type of contract is that actual volumes of procedures could be
       less than projected. However, a significant reimbursement rate reduction
       may result in the Company restructuring certain of the existing
       contracts. We also have two contracts where we receive revenues based
       directly on the amount of reimbursement received for procedures
       performed. Revenues under those contracts and any future contracts with
       revenues based directly on reimbursement amounts will be impacted by any
       reimbursement rate change. Some of our future contracts for Gamma Knife
       services may have revenues based on such reimbursement rates instead of a
       fee-for-service basis. There can be no assurance that future changes in
       healthcare regulations and reimbursement rates will not directly or
       indirectly adversely affect our Gamma Knife revenues.

     - As with other highly sophisticated medical equipment, there is constant
       change and innovation in the market. New and improved medical equipment
       can be introduced that could make the Gamma Knife technology obsolete and
       that would make its operation uneconomic. During 2000, Elekta AG
       introduced an upgraded Gamma Knife which costs approximately $3.4 million
       plus applicable tax and duties. This upgrade includes an Automated
       Patient Positioning system, or APS, and therefore involves less health
       care provider intervention. Ten of our existing Gamma Knife units are
       upgradeable and one Gamma Knife unit has already been upgraded. The cost
       to upgrade existing units to the new model C Gamma Knife with APS is
       estimated to be approximately $950,000. The failure to acquire or use new
       technology and products could have a material adverse effect on our
       business and results of operations.

CUSTOMERS

     The Company's current business is the outsourcing of Gamma Knife
stereotactic radiosurgery services. The Company typically provides the Gamma
Knife equipment, as well as planning, installation, reimbursement and marketing
support services. Customers usually pay the Company on a fee-per-use basis. The
market for these services primarily consists of major urban medical centers. The
Gamma Knife business is capital intensive. The total cost of a Gamma Knife
facility usually ranges from $3.25 million to $4 million, including equipment,
site construction and installation. The Company's typical, historical costs for
acquisition are approximately $2,710,000 with the medical center paying for site
and installation costs. The following is a listing of the Company's current

     The Company's second Gamma Knife contract, with the University of Southern
California ended in the third quarter of 1999. The customer exercised its option
to purchase the equipment for its net book value, approximately $1.2 million.
Currently, two of the Company's sites now under development are projected to

                                        4

become operational in mid 2002. The Company's contract with Hospital Barra D'Or
is being converted to a joint venture arrangement.

     The Company's fee per use agreement is typically for a ten-year term. The
fixed fee per use reimbursement amount that the Company receives from the
customer is based on the Company's cost to provide the service and the
anticipated volumes of the customer. The contracts signed by the Company
typically call for a fee ranging from $7,500 to $9,500 per procedure. There are
no minimum volume guarantees required of the customer. Typically, GKF is
responsible for providing the Gamma Knife and related ongoing Gamma Knife
equipment expenses (i.e. personal property taxes, insurance, equipment
maintenance) and also helps fund the customer's Gamma Knife marketing. The
customer generally is obligated to pay site and installation costs and the costs
of operating the Gamma Knife. The customer can either renew the agreement or
terminate the agreement at the end of the contractual term. If the customer
chooses to terminate the agreement, then GKF removes the equipment from the
medical center for possible placement at an another site.

     The Company's revenue sharing agreements ("retail") are typically for a
period of ten to fifteen years. Instead of receiving a fixed fee, the Company
receives all or a percentage of the reimbursement (exclusive of physician fees)
received by the customer less the operating expenses of the Gamma Knife. The
Company is at risk for any reimbursement rate changes for Gamma Knife services
by the government or other third party payors. The Company is also at risk if it
inefficiently operates the Gamma Knife. There are no minimum volume guarantees
required of the customer.

     Four customers each accounted for more than 10% of the Company's revenues
in 2001, 2000 and 1999: Hoag, STMH, Yale and UAMS.

MARKETING

     The Company markets its services through its preferred provider status with
Elekta and a direct sales effort. The direct sales effort is executed by the
Company's Vice President of Sales, who joined the Company in April 2001. The
major advantages to a health care provider in contracting with the Company for
Gamma Knife services include:

     - The medical center avoids the high cost of owning the equipment. By not
       acquiring the Gamma Knife unit, the medical center is able to allocate
       the funds required to purchase and/or finance the Gamma Knife to other
       projects.

     - The medical center avoids the risk of Gamma Knife under-utilization. The
       Company does not have minimum volume requirements. The medical center
       pays the Company only for each Gamma Knife procedure performed on a
       patient.

     - The medical center transfers the risk of technological obsolescence to
       the Company. The medical center and its physicians are not under any
       obligation to utilize technologically obsolete equipment.

     - The Company provides planning, installation, operating and marketing
       assistance and support to its Gamma Knife customers.

FINANCING

     The Company's Gamma Knife business is operated through GKF. GKF has funded
its existing Gamma Knife units with loans from a single lender for 100% of the
cost of each Gamma Knife, plus any sales tax, customs and duties. The loans are
fully amortized over an 84-month period. The loans are collateralized by the
Gamma Knife, customer contracts, and accounts receivable and are without
recourse to the Company and Elekta.

     GKF currently has loan commitments and has received progress payments from
its primary lender for two of its three Gamma Knife projects under development.
The loan commitments require that GKF have a debt to equity plus subordinated
debt ratio of 6 to 1. GKF currently meets the ratio requirement to be eligible

                                        5
<PAGE>

for funding of the approximately $3,700,000 remaining cash requirements for the
two projects under development.

COMPETITION

     Conventional neurosurgery is the primary competitor of Gamma Knife
radiosurgery. Gamma Knife surgery is gaining acceptance as an alternative and/or
adjunct to conventional surgery due to its more favorable morbidity outcomes for
certain procedures as well as its non-invasiveness. Utilization of the Company's
Gamma Knife units is contingent on the acceptance of Gamma Knife radiosurgery by
the customer's neurosurgeons, radiation oncologists and referring physicians. In
addition, the utilization of the Company's Gamma Knife units is impacted by the
proximity of competing Gamma Knife centers and providers using other
radiosurgery modalities.

     The Company's ability to contract with additional customers for Gamma Knife
services is dependent on its ability to compete against (i) Elekta, the
manufacturer of the Gamma Knife, (ii) manufacturers of competing radiosurgery
devices (primarily modified linear accelerators), and (iii) other companies that
outsource Gamma Knife services. The Company does not have an exclusive
relationship with Elekta and has lost sales in the past to customers that choose
to purchase a Gamma Knife directly from Elekta. The Company may continue to lose
sales in the future to such customers and may also lose sales to competitors of
the Company.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

     The Company's Gamma Knife services customers receive payments for patient
care from federal government and private insurer reimbursement programs.
Currently in the United States, the majority of Gamma Knife services are
performed on an in-patient basis, although a significant number are performed on
an out-patient basis. Gamma Knife patients, with Medicare as their primary
insurer and treated on either an in-patient or out-patient basis, comprise an
estimated 20% to 30% of the total Gamma Knife patients treated.

     A Prospective Payment System ("PPS") is utilized to reimburse hospitals for
care given to hospital in-patients covered by federally funded reimbursement
programs. Patients are classified into a Diagnosis Related Group ("DRG") in
accordance with the patient's diagnosis, necessary medical procedures and other
factors. Patient reimbursement is limited to a predetermined amount for each
DRG. The reimbursement payment may not necessarily cover the cost of all medical
services actually provided because the payment is predetermined. Effective
October 1, 1997, Gamma Knife services for Medicare hospital in-patients were
reclassified from DRG 1 to either DRG 7 or DRG 8. This reclassification is
estimated to have reduced medical center revenues from the Medicare DRG program
by approximately 30%.

     In 1986 and again in 1990, Congress enacted legislation requiring the
Department of Health and Human Services ("DHHS") to develop proposals for a PPS
for Medicare out-patient services. DHHS has proposed a new payment system,
Ambulatory Product Classifications ("APC"), which affects all out-patient
services, performed in a hospital based facility. APC implementation took place
in the third quarter of 2000.

     The APC consists of 346 clinically, homogenous classifications or groupings
of codes that are typically used in out-patient billing. Out-patient services
are bundled with fixed rates of payment determined according to specific
regional and national factors, similar to that of the in-patient PPS.

     The reimbursement for Medicare patients receiving Gamma Knife services on
an out-patient basis is estimated to have decreased approximately 40% under the
APC system. The Gamma Knife APC rate, effective April 1, 2002 is anticipated to
increase. The exact increased amount will be individually hospital dependent and
is not known at this time. The Company has two contracts from which revenues are
directly affected by changes in payment rates under the APC system. Currently,
these two contracted hospitals are primarily treating Medicare Gamma Knife
patients on an in-patient basis and therefore the Company believes that adoption
of APC's has not had a significant impact on the revenues of the Company.
However, some of the Company's fee-per-use customers treat patients on an
out-patient basis and may have experienced a

                                        6
<PAGE>

reduction in Medicare payment. There can be no assurance that the adoption of
APC's will not have a negative impact directly or indirectly on the Company's
revenues in the future.

     The payment of remuneration to induce the referral of health care business
has been a subject of increasing governmental and regulatory focus in recent
years. Section 1128B(b) of the Social Security Act (sometimes referred to as the
"federal anti-kickback statute") provides criminal penalties for individuals or
entities that knowingly and willfully offer, pay, solicit or receive
remuneration in order to induce referrals for items or services for which
payment may be made under the Medicare and Medicaid programs and certain other
government funded programs. The Social Security Act provides authority to the
Office of Inspector General through civil proceedings to exclude an individual
or entity from participation in the Medicare and state health programs if it is
determined any such party has violated Section 1128B(b) of the Social Security
Act. The Company believes that it is in compliance with the federal
anti-kickback statute. Additionally, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of
1993, often referred to as "Stark II", bans physician self-referrals to
providers of designated health services with which the physician has a financial
relationship. The term "designated health services" includes, among others,
radiation therapy services and in-patient and outpatient hospital services. On
January 1, 1995, the Physician Ownership and Referral Act of 1993 became
effective in California. This legislation prohibits physician self-referrals for
covered goods and services, including radiation oncology, if the physician (or
the physician's immediate family) concurrently has a financial interest in the
entity receiving the referral. The Company believes that it is in compliance
with these rules and regulations.

     A range of federal civil and criminal laws target false claims and
fraudulent billing activities. One of the most significant is the Federal False
Claims Act, which prohibits the submission of a false claim or the making of a
false record or statement in order to secure a reimbursement from a
government-sponsored program. In recent years, the federal government has
launched several initiatives aimed at uncovering practices which violate false
claims or fraudulent billing laws. Claims under these laws may be brought either
by the government or by private individuals on behalf of the government, through
a "whistleblower" or "qui tam" action. The Company believes that it is in
compliance with the Federal False Claims Act; however, because such actions are
filed under seal and may remain secret for years, there can be no assurance that
the Company or one of its affiliates is not named in a material qui tam action.

     Legislation in various jurisdictions requires that health facilities obtain
a Certificate of Need ("CON") prior to making expenditures for medical
technology in excess of specified amounts. Four of the Company's existing
customers were required to obtain a CON or its equivalent. One of the Company's
more recently signed contracts is subject to CON, and is still awaiting
regulatory approval. The CON procedure can be expensive and time consuming and
may impact the length of time before Gamma Knife services commence. CON
requirements vary from state to state in their application to the operations of
both the Company and its customers. In some jurisdictions the Company is
required to comply with CON procedures to provide its services and in other
jurisdictions customers must comply with CON procedures before using the
Company's services.

     The Company's Gamma Knife units contain Cobalt 60 radioactive sources. The
medical centers that house the Company's Gamma Knife units are responsible for
obtaining possession and user's licenses for the Cobalt 60 source.

     The Company believes it is in substantial compliance with the various rules
and regulations that affect its businesses.

INSURANCE AND INDEMNIFICATION

     The Company's contracts with equipment vendors generally do not contain
indemnification provisions. The Company maintains a comprehensive insurance
program covering the value of its property and equipment, subject to
deductibles, which the Company believes are reasonable.

     The Company's customer contracts generally contain mutual indemnification
provisions. The Company maintains general and professional liability insurance.
The Company is not involved in the practice of

                                        7
<PAGE>

medicine and therefore believes its present insurance coverage and
indemnification agreements are adequate for its business.

EMPLOYEES

     At December 31, 2001, the Company employed nine (9) people on a full-time
basis. None of these employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement
and there is no union representation within the Company. The Company maintains
various employee benefit plans and believes that its employee relations are
good.

     The Company estimates that there were approximately 1,200 beneficial
holders of its Common Shares at December 31, 2001.

     The Board of Directors authorized in March 2000 the repurchase of up to
500,000 shares of the Company's Common Stock in the open market from time to
time at prevailing prices. Approximately 484,000 shares were repurchased in the
open market pursuant to that authorization, through December 31, 2001, at a cost
of approximately $1,213,000. The Board of Directors on February 2, 2001
authorized the repurchase of up to another 500,000 shares of the Company's
common stock in the open market from time to time at prevailing prices.

     During 2001 holders of options to acquire the Company's common stock
exercised their respective rights pursuant to such securities, resulting in the
Company issuing approximately 9,000 new shares of common stock for approximately
$16,000.

     On March 22, 1999 the Company adopted a Shareholder Rights Plan ("Plan").
Under the Plan, the Company made a dividend distribution of one Right for each
outstanding share of the Company's common stock as of the close of business on
April 1, 1999. The Rights become exercisable only if any person or group, with
certain exceptions, becomes an "acquiring person" (acquires 15 percent or more
of the Company's outstanding common stock) or announces a tender or exchange
offer to acquire 15 percent or more of the Company's outstanding common stock.
The Company's Board of Directors adopted the Plan to protect shareholders
against a coercive or inadequate takeover offer. The Board of Directors is not
aware that any person or group intends to make a takeover offer for the Company.

     At December 31, 2001 the Company had 5,253,268 fully diluted shares
outstanding, including 3,524,853 issued and outstanding common shares, 1,799,017
common shares reserved for options, and 5,248 shares reserved pursuant to the
Company's Shareholder Rights Plan.

     The Board of Directors has declared a dividend of $.12 per common share to
shareholders of record on March 15, 2002 to be paid on April 2, 2002.
Shareholders of record on March 15, 2001 were paid a dividend of $0.10 per
common share on April 2, 2001. The Board of Directors anticipates declaring and
paying annual

                                        9
<PAGE>

cash dividends in similar amounts in the future subject to evaluation of the
Company's level of earnings, balance sheet position and availability of cash.
The Company did not pay cash dividends prior to 2001.

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS

     During the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, 100% of the
Company's revenues were derived from its Gamma Knife business.

Average revenue per procedure................  $ 8,081       1.6%     $7,952      10.4%     $7,206
</Table>

     Medical services revenues increased 25.9% in 2001 compared to 2000, and
increased 30.5% in 2000 compared to 1999. The increase in 2001 compared to 2000
is primarily attributable to an increase in the number of Gamma Knife units in
operation. The increase in 2000 compared to 1999 is primarily attributable to an
increase in the number of Gamma Knife units in operation as well as increased
revenues at Gamma Knife locations in operation for more than one year.

     Gamma Knife revenues increased $2,422,000 and $2,185,000 in 2001 and 2000,
respectively, compared to the prior years. The 2001 increase was primarily due
to three new Gamma Knife units that started at various times during 2001 and the
full year inclusion of one new Gamma Knife unit that commenced operation in
April 2000. The 2000 increase was due to the full year inclusion of four new
Gamma Knife units that started at various times during 1999, the commencement of
a new Gamma Knife unit in April 2000, and a 20% increase in revenues for Gamma
Knife units in operation more than one year. The increase was partially offset
by the expiration of the Company's second Gamma Knife contract in the fourth
quarter of 1999. The customer purchased the Gamma Knife after the expiration of
the contract for $1,200,000 in cash. The Company had twelve, nine and eight
Gamma Knife units in operation at December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively.

     The number of Gamma Knife procedures increased 281 and 181 in 2001 and 2000
respectively compared to prior years because of the increase in the number of
Gamma Knife units in operation each year.

     Gamma Knife revenue per procedure increased by $129 in 2001 compared to
2000 primarily because of the three new contracts that started during 2001. One
of the Company's older contracts is at a lower procedure rate due to a lower
investment basis, while the newer contracts have a higher per procedure rate.
The increase in revenue per procedure of $746 in 2000 from 1999 is primarily due
to the addition in late 1999 of a new retail account. In retail accounts the
Company collects higher average per procedure revenues and is also responsible
for all or a portion of the operating costs associated with the procedure.

Percentage of revenue.........................    36.4%                 36.8%                 30.3%
</Table>

     The Company's costs of operations, consisting of maintenance and supplies,
depreciation and amortization, equipment rental and other operating expenses
(such as insurance, property taxes, sales taxes, marketing costs and other fees)
increased $850,000 in 2001 as compared to 2000 and increased $1,270,000 in 2000
as compared to 1999.

     The Company's maintenance and supplies costs were 3%, 2% and 2% of medical
service revenues in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Maintenance and supplies
costs increased $152,000 in 2001 compared to 2000 and increased $44,000 in 2000
compared to 1999. The increase in 2001 compared to 2000 was primarily due to the
expiration of the warranty period on one Gamma Knife unit and the full year
inclusion of maintenance on

                                        11
<PAGE>

three Gamma Knife units whose warranty period expired during the previous year.
The increase in 2000 was primarily due to the expiration of the warranty period
on three Gamma Knife units.

     Depreciation and amortization increased $663,000 in 2001 compared to 2000
and increased $652,000 in 2000 compared to 1999. The increase in 2001 was due to
the addition of three new Gamma Knife units that commenced operation at various
times during 2001 and a full year of depreciation of a new Gamma Knife unit that
started operation during 2000. The increase in 2000 was due to the addition of a
new Gamma Knife unit in second quarter 2000 and a full year's depreciation on
four new Gamma Knife units that started operation during 1999.

     Other costs of operations as a percentage of medical services revenues were
9%, 10%, and 6% in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The increase of $35,000 in
2001 compared to 2000 was primarily due to increased sales and use tax, as well
as increased insurance expense because of additional Gamma Knife units and
higher insurance rates. The increase was partially offset by an $80,000 credit
to property tax expense in third quarter 2001. The increase of $574,000 in 2000
compared to 1999 is due to operating expenses at the Company's retail site that
started in September 1999, increased property tax and insurance expenses due to
additional Gamma Knife units, and increased marketing costs.

Percentage of revenue.........................    27.6%                 28.4%                 25.2%
</Table>

     The Company's selling and administrative costs increased $590,000 in 2001
compared to 2000 and increased $852,000 in 2000 compared to 1999. The increase
in 2001 was primarily due to increased investor relations costs of approximately
$64,000, increased building rent of approximately $67,000, increased insurance
expense of $66,000 and increased business development costs of approximately
$278,000. The increase in business development costs was primarily due to the
addition of a sales person in second quarter and the implementation of a broad
based marketing program throughout the year. The increase in 2000 was primarily
due to startup costs of approximately $228,000 on the Company's two newest
ventures, OR21 and MedLeader, management and employee bonuses of approximately
$125,000, and restructuring costs of approximately $120,000 resulting in the
elimination of two senior management positions. The increase in 2000 was also
caused by inclusion in 1999 of a $325,000 credit due to a change in estimate
regarding the need for and the corresponding cost of liability insurance related
to divested operations.

</Table>

     The Company's interest expense increased $338,000 in 2001 compared to 2000
and increased $809,000 in 2000 compared to 1999. The increase in 2001 was
primarily due to the addition of three new Gamma Knife units at various times
during the year, all of which were financed. The increase in 2000 was primarily
due to the addition of five new Gamma Knife units during 2000 and 1999, all of
which were financed. All of the Company's operating Gamma Knife units are
financed by means of interest bearing debt. Four of the Company's twelve Gamma
Knife units have been in operation for less than two years, and have higher
interest expense than units with more mature loans because interest expense
decreases with each subsequent loan payment.

</Table>

     Gain on sale of assets, early termination of capital leases and other
decreased $25,000 in 2001 and increased $15,000 in 2000 compared to prior years.
Sale or disposal of assets or early termination of capital leases is not a
normal recurring item in the Company's current line of business.

     Interest and other income decreased $324,000 in 2001 compared to 2000 and
increased $201,000 in 2000 compared to 1999. The decrease in 2001 was primarily
due to reduced return on cash investments due to the market decline in interest
rates that occurred during 2001. The increase in 2000 was primarily due to
additional interest income from higher cash balances that were invested in
overnight securities that had a higher interest rate than in 1999.

     Minority interest increased $106,000 in 2001 and $144,000 in 2000 compared
to prior years. Minority interest represents the pre-tax income earned by the
minority member's 19% interest in GKF. The increase in minority interest
reflects the increased profitability of GKF.

     The Company began recording a federal and state income tax provision in
2001 as the Company's deferred tax liability began to exceed its deferred tax
assets. The valuation allowance that had been provided for the deferred tax
asset in excess of the deferred tax liability was eliminated in second quarter
2001. In 2000 the Company recorded no income tax expense or benefit because a
valuation allowance was provided for the entire deferred tax asset in excess of
the deferred tax liability. The Company received an income tax benefit of
$716,000 in 1999, which was primarily a result of an overestimate of the federal
and state income tax provision in 1998, resulting from the sale of the imaging
division. The overestimate was adjusted in 1999 when tax returns were completed
for filing with taxing agencies.

     The Company anticipates that with future profits it will continue to record
income tax expense. Currently there are minimal actual tax payments required due
to net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets available for
tax purposes.

     The Company had a net operating loss carryforward for federal income tax
return purposes at December 31, 2001 of approximately $9,166,000.

     The Company had net income of $1,068,000 in 2001 compared to $1,312,000 in
2000 and $2,707,000 in 1999. Net income for 2001 included a provision for
federal and state income taxes of $433,000, startup costs for OR21 and MedLeader
of $200,000 and an increase compared to 2000 of $278,000 in business development
costs. Net income for 2000 included restructuring costs of $120,000 and startup
costs for OR21 and MedLeader of $228,000. Net income for 1999 included an
insurance expense credit of $325,000 and a tax benefit of $716,000.

  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

     The Company had cash and cash equivalents of $11,580,000 at December 31,
2001 compared to $12,421,000 at December 31, 2000. The Company's cash position
decreased $841,000 due primarily to payment of dividends to shareholders of
$361,000, deposits of $518,000 on future Gamma Knife projects, and payments of
approximately $596,000 to repurchase equity securities.

     Restricted cash of $50,000 at December 31, 2001 reflects cash that may only
be used for the operations of GK Financing, LLC.

     The Company's trade accounts receivable increased slightly to $2,160,000 at
December 31, 2001 from $2,155,000 at December 31, 2000. This increase was due to
higher revenue in 2001 compared to 2000, which was offset by a shortened
collection period for some of the Gamma Knife contracts.

     The Company changed its cash investments during 2001 from overnight
repurchase agreements and commercial paper to money market funds to minimize the
effects of declining interest rates. Cash is invested in these short term funds
pending use in the Company's operations. The Company believes its cash position
combined with its working capital is adequate to service the Company's cash
requirements in 2002.

     Working capital decreased $804,000 due to the decrease in cash, as well as
an increase in the current portion of long term debt due to the addition of
three Gamma Knife units during 2001, all of which were financed.

  IMPACT OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES

     The Company does not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on
operations because a substantial majority of the costs that it incurs under its
customer contracts are fixed through the term of the contract.

                          INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders
American Shared Hospital Services

     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of American
Shared Hospital Services as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the related
consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

     In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
American Shared Hospital Services at December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the
consolidated results of their operations and consolidated cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 -- BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

     Business -- American Shared Hospital Services (the "Company"), a California
corporation, provides Gamma Knife units to twelve medical centers in California,
Texas, Connecticut, Ohio, Massachusetts, Arkansas, Wisconsin, Nevada, Illinois,
Mississippi and New Jersey.

     In June 1995, African American Church Health and Economic Services, Inc.
(ACHES) and ACHES Insurance Services, Inc. ("AIS") were incorporated. AIS is a
wholly owned subsidiary of ACHES. AIS is an insurance agency qualified to sell
life, health, and disability insurance in the states of California and New York.
ACHES, through AIS, sells life, health and disability insurance primarily to the
African-American Community. In 1999, the operations of ACHES and AIS were
discontinued.

     On October 17, 1995, the Company (through American Shared Radiosurgery
Services ("ASRS")) and Elekta AB, the manufacturer of the Gamma Knife (through
its wholly owned United States subsidiary GKV Investments, Inc. ("GKV")),
entered into an operating agreement which formed GK Financing, LLC ("GKF"). GKF
provides alternative financing of Elekta Gamma Knife units and is the preferred
provider for Elekta AB of financing arrangements, such as fee-for-service lease
arrangements with health care institutions.

     In November, 1999, OR21, Inc., was incorporated. This wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Company will provide the product "The Operating Room for the
21st Century(SM)", which is currently under development.

     In April, 2000, MedLeader.com, Inc., was incorporated. This wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Company will provide continuing medical education online and
through videos for doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers. Currently this
subsidiary is not operational.

     The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company,
its wholly owned subsidiaries, European Shared Medical Services Ltd., OR21,
Inc., MedLeader.com, Inc., ACHES and its wholly-owned subsidiary, AIS, and ASRS
and its majority-owned subsidiary, GK Financing, LLC. On April 28, 2000,
European Shared Medical Services, Ltd. was dissolved.

     All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated
in consolidation.

NOTE 2 -- ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     Use of estimates in the preparation of financial statements -- In preparing
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America, management makes estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as
well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

     Cash and cash equivalents -- The Company considers all liquid investments
with original maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase to be
cash equivalents. Restricted cash is not considered a cash equivalent for
purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows.

     Restricted cash -- Restricted cash represents the minimum cash that, by
agreement, must be maintained in GK Financing LLC (GKF) to fund operations.

     Concentration of credit risk -- The Company maintains its cash balances in
financial institutions which exceed federally insured limits. The Company has
not experienced any losses and believes it is not exposed to any significant
credit risk on cash and cash equivalents.

     Accounts receivable -- Substantially all of the Company's revenue is
provided by twelve customers. These customers constitute accounts receivable at
December 31, 2001. The Company performs credit evaluations of its customers and
generally does not require collateral.

                       AMERICAN SHARED HOSPITAL SERVICES

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

     Accounting for majority-owned subsidiary -- The Company accounts for GKF as
a consolidated entity due to its 81% majority-equity interest.

     Property and equipment -- Property and equipment are stated at cost less
accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is determined using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets which for
medical and office equipment is generally 3-15 years. The Company capitalized
interest of $195,000 and $168,000 in 2001 and 2000, respectively, as costs of
medical equipment.

     The Company leases Gamma Knife equipment to its customers under
arrangements accounted for as operating leases. At December 31, 2001, the
Company held equipment under operating lease contracts with customers with an
original cost of $30,585,000 and accumulated depreciation of $7,041,000.

     Revenue recognition -- Revenue is provided for and recognized on either a
fee-per-use or revenue sharing basis. The fee-per-use agreements call for a
fixed fee per procedure and are typically for a ten-year term. Revenue is
recognized at the time the procedures are performed. The Company receives a
percentage of the reimbursement received by the medical center less the
operating expenses of the Gamma Knife under the revenue sharing agreements.
These agreements are typically for a ten to fifteen year term. Revenue is
recognized at the time the procedures are performed based on an estimate of
previously collected net revenue per procedure at the medical centers.

     Income taxes -- The liability method is used to account for income taxes.
Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on
differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and
liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be
in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.

     Earnings per share -- Basic earnings per share excludes dilution and is
computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding for the year. Diluted earnings per
share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if common shares were
issued pursuant to the exercise of options or warrants. The following table
illustrates the computations of basic and diluted earnings per share for the
years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999.

</Table>

     Options to purchase 5,000 and 17,150 shares of common stock at $3.06 and
$4.10 per share, respectively, were outstanding during 2001. They were not
included in the computation of earnings per share assuming dilution because the
exercise price of the options were greater than the average market price of the
common shares.

     Stock-based compensation -- Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(SFAS) No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," encourages but does
not require companies to record compensation cost for stock-based employee
compensation plans at fair value. The Company has chosen to continue to account
for stock-based employee compensation using the intrinsic value method
prescribed in Accounting

                                       F-8

                       AMERICAN SHARED HOSPITAL SERVICES

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees," and related interpretations. Accordingly, compensation cost for
stock options granted to employees is measured as the excess, if any, of the
quoted market price of the Company's stock at the date of the grant over the
amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock. Disclosure requirements in
accordance with SFAS No. 123 are included in Note 6.

     Fair value of financial instruments -- The carrying amounts of financial
instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts
receivable, accounts payable, and other accrued liabilities approximated their
fair value as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, because of the relatively short
maturity of these instruments. The carrying amounts of the Company's various
debt obligations approximated fair value as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, based
upon interest rates that are currently available for the Company for issuance of
instruments with similar terms and remaining maturities.

     Business segment information -- The Company has one reportable segment, the
Gamma Knife, which engages in the business of leasing equipment to health care
providers that treat certain vascular malformations and intracranial tumors
without surgery. Two of the Company's wholly owned subsidiaries, OR21 and
MedLeader.com, Inc., are currently in the initial stages of operations and
development. The results of operations and financial information for these
subsidiaries are not material to the Company's consolidated financial
statements.

     Recent accounting pronouncements -- In June 2001, the Financial Standards
Accounting Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations" and SFAS
No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets". SFAS No. 141 addresses
financial accounting and reporting for business combinations and supersedes APB
Opinion No. 16, "Business Combinations" and SFAS No. 38, "Accounting for
Preacquisition Contingencies of Purchased Enterprises". SFAS No. 141 is
effective for transactions initiated after June 30, 2001. SFAS No. 142 addresses
financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible
assets and supersedes APB Opinion No. 17, Intangible Assets. It addresses how
intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group of other assets
(but not those acquired in a business combination) should be accounted for in
financial statements upon their acquisition. SFAS No. 142 also addresses how
goodwill and other intangible assets should be accounted for after they have
been initially recognized in the financial statements. The Company does not
expect the adoption of these statements to have a material effect on its
consolidated results of operations or financial position.

     In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations". This Statement addresses financial accounting and
reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived
assets and the associated asset retirement costs. It applies to legal
obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from
the acquisition, construction, development and (or) the normal operation of a
long-lived asset, except for certain obligations of lessees. The Company is
required to adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 143 no later than the beginning of
fiscal year 2003, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect the
adoption of this statement to have a material effect on its consolidated results
of operations or financial position.

     In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets", which addresses financial
accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets.
While SFAS No. 144 supersedes FASB Statement No. 121, Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of, it
retains many of the fundamental provisions of that Statement. SFAS No. 144
becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001, with early
applications encouraged. The Company does not expect the adoption of this
statement to have a material effect on its consolidated results of operations or
financial position.

     In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements" (SAB
101). SAB 101, as amended, summarizes

                                       F-9
<PAGE>
                       AMERICAN SHARED HOSPITAL SERVICES

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

certain aspects of the SEC's views in applying generally accepted accounting
principles to revenue recognition in financial statements. The Company was
required to adopt SAB 101 in the fourth quarter of 2000. The adoption of SAB 101
did not have a material effect on the Company's operations or financial
position.

     In September 1999, the FASB issued Emerging Issues Task Force Topic No.
D-83, "Accounting for Payroll Taxes Associated with Stock Option Exercises"
(EITF D-83). EITF D-83 requires that payroll taxes paid on the difference
between the exercise price and the fair value of acquired stock in association
with an employee's exercise of stock options be recorded as operating expenses.
The Company was required to adopt EITF D-83 in the fourth quarter of 1999. There
was no material effect on the Company's operations or financial position as a
result of adoption.

NOTE 4 -- LONG-TERM DEBT

     Long-term debt consists primarily of 12 notes with a financing company,
related to Gamma Knife construction and installation, totaling $25,920,000.
These notes accrue interest at fixed annual rates between 8.5% and 10.95%, are
payable in 84 monthly installments, mature between September, 2004, and January,
2007, and are collateralized by the respective Gamma Knives. Additionally, the
Company has $1,590,000 in borrowings outstanding for deposits for three Gamma
Knives under construction at December 31, 2001 (Note 9). These borrowings accrue
interest at prime plus 2% (6.75% at December 31, 2001), are payable when the
Gamma Knife units commence operation, and are collateralized by the equipment.
The following are contractual maturities of long-term debt by year at December

     At December 31, 2001, the Company had a net operating loss carryforward for
federal income tax return purposes of approximately $9,166,000 which expire
between 2002 and 2021. A substantial part of this carryforward is subject to
separate return limitations. The Company's ability to utilize its net operating
loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets may be limited in the event of
a 50% or more ownership change

within any three-year period. Future federal net operating losses generated by
the Company can be carried forward for 20 years.

     The Company recorded no income tax expense or benefit in 2000 because a
valuation allowance was provided for its entire deferred tax asset in excess of
its deferred tax liability.

     The Company's estimated income tax liability for the year ended December
31, 1998 was overstated by approximately $700,000. This change in estimate is
the result of finalization of unresolved details associated with the 1998 sale
of the diagnostic imaging services product line. The effect of the resolution of
these details was estimated in the 1998 financial statements. The effect of the
final resolution was a reduction of the company's income tax liability resulting
in an income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 1999 as well as an
increase in the net operating loss carryforwards available to the Company. The
tax effected amount of the increase in net operating losses is approximately
$1,571,000 and is reflected as a change in carryovers and tax attributes in the
reconciliation from expected to actual income tax expense above.

NOTE 6 -- SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY

  1984 STOCK OPTION PLAN

     Under the Company's 1984 Stock Option Plan (the "Plan"), as amended, a
total of 475,000 stock options were authorized for grant. The Plan terminated
according to its terms on March 1, 1994. Options granted pursuant to the Plan
generally had lives of 10 years from the date of grant, subject to earlier
expiration in certain cases, such as termination of the grantee's employment.

  1995 STOCK OPTION PLAN

     The Company's 1995 Stock Option Plan, providing for nonqualified stock
options and "incentive stock options," was approved by the Company's Board of
Directors on August 15, 1995, subject to shareholder approval, which was given
on October 6, 1995. Under the 1995 Plan, 330,000 common shares are reserved for
awards to officers and other key employees, non-employee directors, and
advisors. Provisions of the 1995 Stock Option Plan include an automatic grant to
each non-employee director of options to purchase up to 4,000 shares annually on
the date of the Company's Annual Shareholder Meeting, at an exercise price equal
to the market price of the Company's common shares on that date, until the
non-employee director has options for a total of 12,000 shares of the Company's
common stock in all Company plans. Directors who are appointed or elected to the
Company's Board of Directors on a date other than that of the Annual Shareholder
Meeting receive a pro-rata grant of such options, at an exercise price equal to
the market price of the Company's common shares on the date of grant.

  2001 STOCK OPTION PLAN

     The Company's 2001 Stock Option Plan, providing for nonqualified stock
options and "incentive stock options," was approved by the Company's Board of
Directors in October 2001. Under the 2001 Plan, 250,000 common shares are
reserved for awards to officers who beneficially own 15% or less of the
outstanding shares of the Company's stock, other key employees, non-employee
directors, and advisors. Provisions of the 2001 Stock Option Plan include an
automatic grant to each non-employee director of options to purchase up to 4,000
shares annually on the date of the Company's Annual Shareholder Meeting, at an
exercise price equal to the market price of the Company's common shares on that
date, until the non-employee director has options for a total of 12,000 shares
of the Company's common stock in all Company plans. Directors who are appointed
or elected to the Company's Board of Directors on a date other than that of the
Annual Shareholder Meeting receive a pro-rata grant of such options, at an
exercise price equal to the market price of the Company's common shares on the
date of grant. As of December 31, 2001, no stock options had been granted under
the 2001 Stock Option Plan.

  PRO FORMA INFORMATION RELATED TO OPTION GRANTS

     Pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is
required by SFAS 123 for awards granted after December 31, 1995, as if the
Company had accounted for its stock-based awards to employees under the fair
value method of SFAS 123. The fair value of the Company's stock-based awards to
employees was estimated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. The
Black-Scholes options valuation model was

                                       F-13
<PAGE>
                       AMERICAN SHARED HOSPITAL SERVICES

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options which have no
vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, the Black-Scholes
model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected
stock price volatility. Because the Company's stock-based awards to employees
have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and
because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the
fair value estimate, in management's opinion, the existing models do not
necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its
stock-based awards to employees. The effects of applying SFAS No. 123 in this
proforma disclosure are not indicative of future amounts. The fair value of the
Company's option grants under the 1984 and 1995 Plans was estimated assuming no
expected dividends and the following weighted-average assumptions:

  REPURCHASE OF COMMON STOCK, COMMON STOCK WARRANTS AND STOCK OPTIONS

     On March 8, 1999, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of
572,000 shares from two shareholders who were previous bondholders of the
Company. These shares were originally issued in conjunction with a debt
restructuring. On March 22, 1999, the Board of Directors approved a resolution
authorizing the Company to repurchase up to 500,000 shares of its own stock on
the open market. Correspondingly, the Company repurchased 155,000, 134,000 and
196,000 shares of its own stock on the open market during the years ending
December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Additionally, the Company
repurchased 40,000 and 60,000 common shares from a director during the years
ending December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. As the Company's stock has no
par value, the entire repurchase price of the stock is recorded as a reduction
to common stock.

     In previous years, the Company had issued 314,000 common stock warrants
with an exercise price of $.75 per share in conjunction with the restructuring
of certain debt and lease obligations of the Company. During 2000, the Company
repurchased all of the common stock warrants. The original issue of the warrants
was recorded as an addition to additional paid-in-capital and the repurchase has
correspondingly been recorded as a decrease to additional paid-in-capital.

     In 2001, the Company repurchased 20,000 options under the 1984 stock option
plan and 50,000 options under the 1995 stock option plan from former employees.
The repurchase of the options is recorded as a reduction in additional
paid-in-capital.

NOTE 7 -- RETIREMENT PLAN

     The Company amended its defined-contribution retirement plan (the "Plan")
effective in 2002 to allow for a matching safe harbor contribution. For 2002,
the Board of Directors elected to match participant deferred salary
contributions up to a maximum of 4% of the participant's annual compensation.
Matching contributions must be invested in shares of the Company's stock.
Discretionary profit sharing contributions are allowed under the Plan in years
that the Board does not elect a safe harbor match. Through December 31, 2001,
the Plan did not provide for Company matching contributions nor did the Board
elect to make a discretionary profit sharing contribution.

NOTE 8 -- OPERATING LEASES

     The Company leases office space and equipment under operating leases
expiring at various dates through 2005.

     Future minimum payments under noncancelable operating leases having initial
terms of more than one year consisted of the following at December 31, 2001:

     Payments for repair and maintenance agreements are included in the future
minimum operating lease payments shown above.

December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, and includes the above operating
leases as well as month-to-month rental and certain executory costs.

     In August 2001, the Company entered into an agreement to sublease office
space expiring in September 2002. The minimum sublease rental income to be
received is $66,960.

NOTE 9 -- COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Company had $1,855,500 in deposits related to these purchase commitments which
