research firm, the total U.S. market for pain management pharmaceuticals totaled $33.9 billion in 2014. The prescription pain management market in the United States is dominated by opioid analgesics, which, according to IMS Health data, represented
60% of the 446&nbsp;million analgesic prescriptions written in 2014 and accounted for sales of $9.1 billion in that year. Opioid analgesics decrease the perception of pain by stimulating mu, delta and/or kappa opioid receptors. All of these
receptors are involved in modulating pain signals. The most widely used opioid analgesics, including hydrocodone, oxycodone, morphine, and fentanyl, act primarily through the activation of mu opioid receptors in the central nervous system, or CNS.
However, because of the wide distribution of mu opioid receptors throughout the brain, morphine and other mu opioid analgesics also trigger a characteristic pattern of adverse &#147;central&#148; side effects, including nausea and vomiting, itching
and respiratory depression. Mu opioids are also known to cause euphoria, which can lead to misuse, abuse and addiction issues. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our new

signals without activation of mu or kappa opioid receptors in the CNS, it is not expected to produce the psychiatric side effects of centrally-active prior kappa opioids or the CNS related side
effects of mu opioids. Based on the clinical trials and preclinical studies we have completed to date, we believe that product candidates based on CR845, if approved, will be attractive to both patients and physicians as a treatment for
moderate-to-severe pain because of their ability to provide pain relief while significantly reducing the incidence of opioid-related adverse events or abuse and addiction issues associated with currently approved mu opioid analgesics. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our most advanced product candidate is an I.V. version of CR845 intended for the treatment of acute pain in an acute care setting. I.V. CR845
has been well tolerated and demonstrated consistent efficacy in three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trials. Two of these trials were in patients undergoing a laparoscopic hysterectomy, a soft tissue surgical
procedure, and a third trial was in patients undergoing a bunionectomy, a hard tissue surgical procedure. I.V. CR845 administration resulted in statistically significant reductions in pain intensity, as measured by the sum of pain intensity
difference, or SPID, the FDA-recommended endpoint. In addition, in both surgical models, I.V. CR845 exhibited an ability to decrease the opioid-related adverse events, or AEs, of nausea and vomiting associated with current therapies with no evidence
of drug-related respiratory depression. According to research conducted at Duke University, post-operative AEs associated with currently approved opioids, such as nausea and vomiting, increase the length of time that a patient spends in the hospital
and increases the cost of caring for those patients. Therefore, we believe that I.V. CR845 has the potential to significantly reduce the length of hospital stays, thereby reducing overall healthcare costs. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The safety profile of I.V. CR845 has been documented in nine clinical trials, including six Phase 1 and three Phase 2 studies. CR845 has been
administered to over 400 human subjects at single or repeat doses ranging from 1mcg/kg to 40 mcg/kg up to a 1 week period, in the form of I.V. infusion or I.V. bolus injection. I.V. CR845 was considered to be generally safe and well tolerated in all
of these clinical trials. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events, or TEAEs, across evaluated populations were transient facial tingling or numbness, dizziness and fatigue. In addition, a transient increase in urine output in the absence
of electrolyte loss, otherwise known as aquaresis, was also observed, which in some subjects was accompanied by asymptomatic elevations in plasma sodium that were generally considered to be clinically unimportant. No clinically significant changes
in electrocardiogram characteristics have been observed in any of these studies. Importantly, there appeared to be no cases of the characteristic CNS-related adverse events, such as acute psychiatric side effects, typically observed with
prior-generation CNS-active kappa agonists. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition to I.V. CR845, we are also developing Oral CR845, which we believe could be used
to provide pain relief to patients with acute or chronic pain in an outpatient setting and also as an I.V.-to-oral transition, or step-down, therapy for hospital patients being prepared for discharge. We have successfully completed a Phase 1 trial
of an oral capsule formulation of CR845 to establish oral bioavailability parameters, as well as an additional Phase 1 clinical trial with an oral tablet formulation of CR845 with improved pharmaceutical properties. We intend to initiate the first
Phase 2 trial with this formulation in the second quarter of 2015. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are also developing a peripherally-acting cannabinioid receptor
agonist, CR701, which has demonstrated potent activity in preclinical models of inflammatory and neuropathic pain without producing CNS-related side effects. In addition, CR701 exhibits substantial oral bioavailability in preclinical studies. We
have successfully conducted pre-GLP safety studies with CR701 and are exploring the option of conducting the necessary GLP studies (safety studies conducted under the regulatory standard of Good Laboratory Practices) necessary to file an IND to
initiate a Phase 1 ascending single-dose tolerance and pharmacokinetic study in healthy human subjects. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">CR845 and CR701 were discovered

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Pain is generally categorized by its duration as either acute or chronic, by its severity, as mild, moderate or severe, and its type and/or
causality, such as postoperative or neuropathic. Acute pain is typically caused by an injury resulting in nerve, tissue or bone damage and is expected to subside in severity when the injury heals. Postoperative pain is a subset of the acute pain
market. Chronic pain, on the other hand, is prolonged, and can be the long-term result of an acute injury or an ongoing disease condition, such as neuropathic pain associated with diabetes. According to a recent Institute of Medicine report, chronic
pain affects approximately 100&nbsp;million U.S. adults, while millions of others experience acute pain caused by events such as surgery, injury, childbirth and illness. According to IMS Health, the total U.S. market for pain management
pharmaceuticals was $33.9 billion in 2014. In 2012, according to Visiongain, an independent industry research company, total sales for pain therapies worldwide, exceeded $63 billion. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The severity of pain is the key factor in determining the appropriate therapy. Mild or mild-to-moderate pain is generally treated with
non-opioid products, such as oral formulations of NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen, naproxen), aspirin, and acetaminophen. Moderate-to-severe pain, on the other hand, is typically treated with products containing traditional mu opioids. Mu opioid analgesics
are effective to some degree for many patients, but have a poor side effect and abuse liability profile, which limits or precludes their use in treating less severe pain. For many people with moderate-to-severe pain, opioid analgesics are the only
effective method of treating pain. As a result, these opioid analgesics are among the largest prescription drug classes in the United States. According to IMS Health, opioid analgesics represented approximately 60% of the nearly 446&nbsp;million
analgesic prescriptions written in 2014, accounting for $9.1 billion in sales. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Postoperative pain represents a substantial part of the overall acute pain market. According to the International Association for the Study of
Pain, more than 46&nbsp;million inpatient and 53&nbsp;million outpatient surgeries are performed annually in the United States. Moderate-to-severe pain in a hospital or other medical setting is most often treated with injectable analgesics. The U.S.
I.V./injectable analgesic therapy market primarily consists of mu opioid agonists, such as morphine, hydromorphone and fentanyl, and certain non-opioid analgesics, such as Toradol (and related generic I.V. ketorolac products), Caldolor (I.V.
ibuprofen), and Ofirmev (I.V. acetaminophen). According to GBI Research, a research organization, the postoperative pain relief market, with sales of $5.9 billion in 2010, accounted for approximately 20% of the total pain management therapeutics
market. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">According to recently updated Practice Guidelines developed by the American Society of Anesthesiologists, the standard of care
for treating acute postoperative pain is multimodal analgesia, which includes the administration of two or more drugs that act by different mechanisms for providing analgesia in a manner that will minimize the occurrence of adverse events. When
patients are ready for discharge, a transition is typically made to a prescription oral pain medication, allowing patients to self-administer relatively strong analgesics after being discharged home. This transition from an I.V. pain medication to
an oral pain medication is commonly referred to as I.V.-to-oral &#147;step-down&#148; therapy. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Strong mu opioid analgesics, such as
morphine, fentanyl, and hydromorphone, are mainstays of pain treatment in the immediate postoperative period, and are used as part of a multimodal analgesic approach. However, the use of strong mu opioid analgesics is associated with an array of
unwanted and serious side effects, including postoperative opioid-induced respiratory depression, or POIRD, postoperative nausea and vomiting, or PONV, and opioid-induced bowel dysfunction, or OBD, which contributes to the severity of postoperative
ileus, or POI. According to Anesthesiology News<I>, </I>a trade journal, the incidence of POIRD may be as high as 29%, can occur unexpectedly in even the healthiest of patients, and exerts a disproportionately high toll on length of stay and
hospital costs due to the significant expenses associated with the treatment of POIRD. According to an article published in Best Practice&nbsp;&amp; Research Clinical Anaesthesiology, a trade journal, PONV occurs in approximately one-third of
surgical patients overall, and is one of the most important factors in determining length of stay after surgery, resulting in estimated annual costs in the U.S. in the range of $1 billion. These mu opioid-related adverse events not only
significantly increase the cost of care, but also reduce a patient&#146;s quality of care and lead to sub-optimal recovery. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Nonopioid
analgesics formulated for injection or infusion, including I.V. acetaminophen and NSAIDs, such as I.V. ibuprofen, are available as alternatives to mu opioids to relieve acute pain, but their use is limited in a postoperative care setting as a result
of their limited efficacy. I.V. acetaminophen and NSAIDs also have side effects that limit their use at higher, more efficacious doses. Acetaminophen is associated with risk of liver toxicity, which can be fatal, and NSAIDs are associated with risks
of bleeding, serious gastrointestinal side effects including ulcers, kidney damage, and serious cardiovascular thrombotic events such as stroke and heart attack, which can be fatal. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Chronic Pain Market </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The most
common causes of moderate-to-severe chronic pain are musculoskeletal problems and inflammatory conditions. Injuries from accidents resulting in fractures, dislocations or soft tissue injury, as well as lower back pain, are the most frequent causes
of musculoskeletal pain. Although these injuries are mostly non-fatal, the cost in terms of long-term disability, medical expense and lost productivity is large. Moderate-to-severe chronic pain is typically treated with prescription products
including immediate release and long-acting opioids, such as the branded products OxyContin (oxycodone) and Opana (oxymorphone), and combination products that include an opioid combined with an NSAID or acetaminophen, such as the branded products
Vicodin (hydrocodone and acetaminophen) and Percocet (oxycodone and acetaminophen). Prescription products for chronic pain are usually in oral tablet or capsule form because the vast majority of these patients are taking these medications outside of
the hospital setting. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On April&nbsp;7, 2005, the FDA announced a decision to require boxed warnings of potential
cardiovascular risk for all NSAIDs. The 2005 FDA warning related to cardiovascular adverse events associated with NSAIDs and the increased awareness of the risk of liver toxicity associated with high doses of acetaminophen have led to increased use
of mu opioid analgesics for the treatment of chronic pain. However, the use of mu opioid analgesics carries significant additional risks. Chronic opioid use causes patients to develop tolerance for the opioid, which results in the patient needing
increasing opioid doses to achieve the same level of pain relief. For the most commonly prescribed analgesic combination products, the need for increasing doses to achieve the same level of pain relief means exposure to increasing amounts of NSAIDs
or acetaminophen, which carry the risks attendant to these therapeutics. Moreover, due to their CNS activity, mu opioids produce feelings of euphoria, which can give rise to abuse and addiction. Underlining the severity of this issue, in September
2013, the FDA announced class-wide safety labeling changes and new post-market study requirements for all extended-release and long-acting mu opioid analgesics intended to treat pain. In support of this action, the FDA Commissioner stated that
&#147;[t]he FDA is invoking its authority to require safety labeling changes and post-market studies to combat the crisis of misuse, abuse, addiction, overdose, and death from these potent drugs that have harmed too many patients and devastated too
many families and communities.&#148; In addition, as a result of their potential for misuse, abuse and addiction, currently approved mu opioids are strictly regulated by the United States Drug Enforcement Agency, or DEA, under the Controlled
Substances Act, which imposes strict registration, record keeping and reporting requirements, security control and restrictions on prescriptions &#150; all of which significantly increase the costs and the liability attendant to prescription opioid
analgesics. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>The Unmet Need in Pain Management </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Despite the size of the pain management market, there has been little innovation in the development of new analgesics, with nearly all recent
new drug approvals limited to reformulations and improved methods of delivery of existing therapeutics. Mu opioids continue to be the most prescribed drugs for pain management, despite their side effects and the potential for misuse, abuse and
addiction. These concerns often cause healthcare providers to administer or prescribe less than optimal doses of mu opioids, or patients to take lower than prescribed doses, resulting in inadequate pain relief. Consequently, we believe that the pain
market represents a therapeutic area with substantial unmet needs for patients in pain, for physicians who must balance pain control with risks of causing severe adverse events, and for healthcare organizations that bear the costs of managing the
consequences of undertreated pain and drug-related adverse events. We believe that CR845, with its novel mechanism of action, will be attractive to patients and physicians, as well as hospitals and payers, as a treatment for moderate-to-severe pain
because of its ability to provide pain relief without opioid-related adverse events or abuse and addiction issues associated with currently approved mu opioid analgesics. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Pruritus, or itch, is defined as an unpleasant sensation that provokes the desire to scratch. Certain systemic diseases have been known to
cause pruritus that ranges in intensity from a mild annoyance to an intractable, disabling condition. The sensation of pruritus is transmitted through slow-conducting unmyelinated C-polymodal and possibly type A delta nociceptive neurons with free
nerve endings located near the dermoepidermal junction or in the epidermis. These neurons appear to be located more superficially and are more sensitive to pruritogenic substances than pain receptors. Activators of these nerves include histamine,
neuropeptide substance P, serotonin, bradykinin, proteases (e.g., mast cell tryptase), and endothelin (which stimulates the release of nitric oxide). Impulses are transmitted from the dorsal root ganglion to the spinothalamic tract. Additionally,
opioids are known to modulate the sensation of pruritus, both peripherally and centrally. Stimulation of mu opioid receptors accentuates pruritus, while stimulation of kappa receptors suppress pruritus. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Pruritus may be classified into the following categories on the basis of the underlying causative disease: renal or uremic pruritus,
cholestatic pruritus, hematologic pruritus, endocrine pruritus, pruritus related to malignancy, dermatological pruritus and idiopathic generalized pruritus. According to a study Cara conducted with IMS utilizing medical claims data from 2013, nearly
45&nbsp;million patients have been diagnosed with diseases </P>

antihistamines, select antidepressants, counterirritants, bile acid sequestrants, rifampin, narcotic antagonists and partial agonists, topical immunomodulators (Elidel, Protopic) or gabapentin. </P>

pruritus can occur in patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) and is most often seen in patients receiving hemodialysis (HD). According to Fresenius Medical Care, a world leading provider of products and medical care for dialysis patients, there
were over 400,000 patients in the United States and 2.2&nbsp;million globally undergoing HD in 2013. It is estimated that 40-50% of these patients suffer from renal or uremic pruritus according to a study of dialysis patients (&#147;Pruritus in
haemodialysis patients: international results from the Dialysis Observation and Practice Patterns Study (DOPPS)&#148;, Pisoni et al. 2006). </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Currently, there are no approved products in the United States to treat renal or uremic pruritus. Patients are generally managed with a
multitude of products including corticosteroids, gabapentin, antihistamines, antidepressants and others with varying degrees of success. There is one product, nalfurafine, approved to treat uremic pruritus in Japan. Nalfurafine is a kappa opioid
receptor agonist but it also has partial mu-opioid receptor activity. Mu agonists, like morphine, are known to cause itch. Kappa agonists that cross the blood brain barrier like nalfurafine are also known to cause CNS-related adverse events
resulting in high rates of discontinuation. The limited efficacy in light of concerns about adverse events caused European Medicines Agency to refuse to approve nalfurafine for the treatment of uremic pruritus in 2013. </P>

are many other systemic diseases that can trigger pruritus in patients. They include cholestatic liver disease endocrinologic disease (e.g. hyperthyroidism), malignancy (e.g. Hodgkin lymphoma), hematologic disease (e.g. polycythemia vera), atopic
dermatitis, eczema, psoriasis, hives/urticarial, and lice/scabies. Data from a Cara-sponsored IMS Health study, indicates that over 20&nbsp;million patients suffer from some level of pruritus in the United States. Many of these patients are
sub-optimally treated for their pruritus with products not approved to treat their condition. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Our Product Candidates </B></P>

sites in the United States. The trial enrolled female patients, ages 21 to 65, scheduled for elective laparoscopic hysterectomy under general anesthesia. In this trial, patients were administered either placebo or one dose of 40mcg /kg I.V. CR845
preoperatively. Following surgery, if they were medically stable and had a pain intensity score <FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:SYMBOL">&#179;</FONT>40 on a 100 point pain scale based on the visual analog scale, or VAS, they were re-randomized to receive
either placebo or one dose of 40mcg /kg I.V. CR845. Efficacy was measured using time-specific 24 hour pain intensity differences. Pain intensity, or PI, is measured at various times by asking patients to rate their pain on a 100-point scale, where
&#147;0&#148; is absence of pain and &#147;100&#148; is the worst possible pain. PID, or pain intensity difference, is the difference between the PI measured prior to treatment and at subsequent times of measurement. SPID, or the summed pain
intensity difference, is the time-weighted sum of all of the PID scores, from the pretreatment level to a subsequent time of measurement, such as 24 hours after the pretreatment baseline pain measurement. Both PID and SPID are FDA-recognized
endpoints for acute pain clinical trials. Additional endpoints included the amount of morphine consumption over 24 hours, time-specific total pain relief and patient global evaluation of study medication. Of the 203 patients that participated in the

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe the ability of I.V. CR845 to reduce nausea and vomiting despite not meaningfully
reducing fentanyl usage is due to a direct anti-vomiting or anti-nausea effect resulting from its kappa opioid agonist mechanism of action. We believe that the ability to provide postsurgical analgesia and simultaneously reduce opioid-related side
effects will make I.V. CR845 an attractive treatment option for postoperative patients and their physicians. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In this bunionectomy trial,
repeated intravenous administration of I.V. CR845 at a dose of 5mcg /kg was safe and generally well tolerated. The most frequent TEAEs (greater than 10%) observed in the CR845 treatment group were transient facial tingling and somnolence, a state of
near-sleep. Of the seven cases of somnolence reported, the clinical trial&#146;s investigator reported four as &#147;mild&#148; and/or &#147;related to drug&#148; and three as &#147;moderate&#148; and/or &#147;not related to drug&#148;. The mean
plasma sodium concentration in CR845-treated patients exhibited an approximately 3% rise over 24 hours from baseline levels, but was not outside the normal physiological range at either 24 or 48 hours post-CR845 administration. This lack of
clinically significant hypernatremia was likely a result of both utilizing a lower dose of I.V. CR845 and replacing transient fluid loss with oral water or sodium-free intravenous fluid. In addition, consistent with our prior studies, there was no
evidence of acute psychiatric side effects that were observed with prior-generation CNS-active kappa opioid agonists. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Phase 2a

trial to evaluate the analgesic efficacy and safety of I.V. CR845 during the postoperative period in 114 patients undergoing laparoscopic hysterectomy. In the first of two cohorts, two single doses of I.V. CR845 (8 mcg/kg and 24 mcg/kg) were
evaluated versus placebo in 68 patients who were maintained on patient-controlled analgesia, or PCA, morphine for 24 hours after surgery prior to randomization to receive treatment with CR845 or placebo. However, more than 50% of the patients (CR845
and placebo) in this cohort did not request any rescue medication before at least 4 hours after randomization and 30% of placebo patients required no narcotic for 24 hours after randomization. Therefore, it was concluded that the magnitude of pain
the day after surgery appeared to be insufficient to allow separation between treatment groups and no clinical conclusions regarding the efficacy of I.V. CR845 could be made from this cohort. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the second cohort, 46 patients were administered a single dose of I.V. CR845 (40 mcg/kg) or placebo within three hours following recovery
from surgery. In this group, CR845-treated patients exhibited statistically significant reductions in pain intensity up to six hours post-infusion versus placebo (p<FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:SYMBOL">&#163;</FONT>0.05). Moreover, PCA morphine use was
approximately 49% lower in the CR845-treated group compared to placebo starting at four&nbsp;hours post-infusion and lasting through an additional 12 hours (p<FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:SYMBOL">&#163;</FONT>0.01) with a concomitant reduction in nausea
and vomiting. The results for this proof-of-concept trial indicated that CR845 treatment could reduce pain intensity and morphine consumption post-surgery and informed the study timeline and design of the larger Phase 2 clinical trial
(<I>CLIN2002</I>) described above. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In this Phase 2a Laparoscopic Hysterectomy clinical trial, administration of all three doses of I.V.
CR845 was considered safe and generally well tolerated. Most of the TEAEs were comparable across groups, mild to moderate in severity, and nearly all were considered by the investigators to be unrelated, or to have an unlikely relationship, to study
treatment. Transient facial tingling was the primary TEAE reported in CR845-treated groups in Cohort 1. Other AEs occurring in more than 10% in any group included headache, flatulence, nausea, pyrexia, urinary tract infection, dizziness and

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the fourth quarter of 2014, we completed a Human Abuse Liability (&#147;HAL&#148;) trial in which we evaluated the relative abuse liability
of I.V. CR845 compared to I.V. pentazocine, a Schedule IV opioid receptor agonist. The trial included 39 subjects who were non-dependent recreational opioid and hallucinogen abusers and was conducted as a four-way cross-over trial, in which each
subject received two doses of I.V. CR845 (5 mcg/kg and 15 mcg/kg), one dose of I.V. pentazocine and placebo. The top-line results from this HAL trial indicate that I.V. CR845 met the trial&#146;s primary endpoint by demonstrating highly
statistically significant lower &#147;drug liking&#148; scores as measured by visual analog scale (&#147;VAS&#148;), Emax (p &lt;0.0001), when compared to I.V. pentazocine (Figure 10). I.V. CR845 also demonstrated highly statistically significant
lower &#147;feeling high,&#148; &#147;overall liking,&#148; and &#147;take drug again&#148; scores (p &lt;0.0001), compared to pentazocine. Additionally, I.V CR845 showed no &#147;drug liking&#148; dose response as the effect of both doses of I.V.
CR845 were the same. These metrics represent standard subjective measures recommended by the FDA to assess a drug&#146;s abuse liability. We believe that the totality of these results are supportive of the potential for I.V. CR845 to be the first

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In 2014, we conducted a Phase 1b clinical trial (as part of a Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial) as a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled
trial designed to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics (&#147;PK&#148;) of I.V. CR845 in 24 hemodialysis patients. I.V. CR845 was administered as a bolus dose (ranging from 0.5 mcg/kg to 2.5mcg/kg) after each dialysis session up to three times a
week (&#147;t.i.w&#148;). Pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that I.V. CR845 exhibited dose linear increases in maximum serum concentration (&#147;Cmax&#148;) and total CR845 exposure, using a common measurement method known as area under the curve
(&#147;AUC&#148;) with an approximate 10-fold increase in AUC across doses in these dialysis patients compared to normal subjects. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">I.V.
CR845 was observed to be safe and well tolerated over the one-week dosing period.&nbsp;The most common adverse events (&#147;AEs&#148;) were transient facial tingling and headache, and no serious AEs were reported. Although uremic pruritus was not
an inclusion criterion for randomization, three subjects entered the trial with &#147;worst itching&#148; baseline scores in the moderate-to-severe range, &gt; 4.0 on a 10.0 point visual analog scale (VAS). All three of these subjects received
t.i.w. dosing of I.V. CR845 (with two subjects receiving 1 mcg/kg and one receiving 2.5mcg/kg) and ended the one-week dosing period with reported &#147;worst itching&#148; scores of 1.0 or less. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The ongoing Phase 2 trial will measure the efficacy of I.V. CR845 compared to placebo in reducing the intensity of itch in dialysis patients
with baseline &#147;worst itching&#148; scores of 4.0 or greater over a two-week dosing period. The primary endpoint of the study will be the change from baseline in the average &#147;worst itching&#148; scores during the second week of treatment,
as recorded on a VAS. Secondary endpoints will focus on quality of life measures associated with pruritus burden using a series of previously validated self-assessment scales. The study will enroll a total of 60 dialysis patients at multiple sites
in the U.S. and expect to report top-line efficacy results in the second quarter of 2015. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>CR845 Pre-clinical Studies </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A significant amount of preclinical work has been completed for CR845 in order to further define its characteristics. In standard preclinical
pain models, CR845 attenuated acute and chronic visceral, inflammatory and neuropathic pain in a dose-dependent manner (see Table 1 below). The analgesic effect of CR845 was recordable within 15 minutes post-administration and lasted for up to 18
hours following single-dose administration. CR845 also decreased the production and release of pro-inflammatory mediators, which we believe is likely due to the direct activation of kappa opioid receptors expressed on immune cells that synthesize
and secrete these substances. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Table 1: CR845 Exhibits a Broad Spectrum of Activity in Multiple Types of Industry Standard Preclinical Pain Models </P>

tissue indicating that the CNS was not the site of action for CR845. Moreover, in standard preclinical pain models, such as the &#147;Chung Model&#148; of neuropathic pain, our scientists
confirmed that the analgesic action of CR845 can be blocked with kappa opioid receptor antagonists administered directly to the local site of injury, indicating a peripheral site of action for CR845 (Figure 11 below). In the &#147;Chung Model&#148;,
neuropathic pain is induced experimentally by ligating spinal nerves mediating sensation for a hind limb. This results in a type of neuropathic pain, referred to as allodynia. Experimental animals with allodynia exhibit a &#147;paw withdrawal
reflex&#148; upon contact with a relatively thin filament on the injured site. Sets of different thickness filaments are used to test sensitivity, each of which is designed to produce a given force (in grams) upon bending after contact. By testing
with these filaments, the minimum force to evoke a withdrawal response defines the paw withdrawal threshold. The nerve injury produces a marked reduction in paw withdrawal thresholds (increased sensitivity to force) in response to probing with the
filaments. I.V. administration of CR845 reduces this neuropathic pain as demonstrated by a subsequent increase in the withdrawal threshold (see Figure 10 below). Administration of a low dose of the selective peripherally-acting kappa opioid receptor
antagonist nor-binaltorphamine, or nor-BNI, into the plantar surface of the injured paw significantly reduces the effect of CR845, whereas injection of saline had no effect on the efficacy of CR845. Because nor-BNI was only able to block local
peripheral kappa opioid receptors in this experiment, we believe these results show that the effect of CR845 is a result of activation of kappa opioid receptors located at the peripheral site of injury rather than in the CNS. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">None of the test subjects displayed any of the dysphoric or psychotomimetic side effects that have hindered the development of prior
generations of centrally active kappa agonists. We believe that the identification of tablet strengths that produce plasma levels of CR845 similar to those seen in the Phase 2 postoperative analgesia clinical trials of I.V. CR845, together with
evidence that these doses are well-tolerated, and bioactive, lays a strong foundation for conducting proof-of concept efficacy trials with this new oral formulation. We intend to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial in the second quarter of 2015. Such
trial, if successful, would be expected to substantially broaden the potential utility of CR845 beyond the acute care setting for which I.V. CR845 was designed, while complementing that use (e.g., as an out-patient discharge medication following
treatment in a hospital with I.V. CR845).</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>CR701 Overview </I></B></P>

peripheral cannabinoid receptors. Studies on the effects of cannabis have led to the discovery of an endogenous system of ligands in humans involved in a number of physiological processes, including pain and inflammation. The main naturally
occurring ligands for this system, anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), activate a number of cannabinoid receptors, including CB1 and CB2 receptors. Like opioid receptors, CB1 and CB2 receptors are members of the G protein-coupled receptor
superfamily. CB1 receptors and associated ligands are mainly localized in the brain, whereas CB2 receptors are found mainly in peripheral tissues, particularly immune cells such as leukocytes and mast cells, which have been shown to be

involved in pain and inflammatory responses. We are developing lead molecules that selectively modulate peripheral CB receptors without targeting CNS cannabinoid receptors. Our most advanced CB
compound, CR701, is a peripherally-restricted, mixed-CB1/CB2 receptor agonist that selectively interacts with these cannabinoid receptor subtypes, with no off-target activities. The compound is orally bioavailable, active in preclinical models of
inflammatory and neuropathic pain, and does not produce the side effects characteristic of centrally-active cannabinoids, such as sedation and hypothermia. Accordingly, CR701 would be expected to have substantially less abuse potential than
centrally-active cannabinoids, but retain activity against therapeutically valuable peripheral targets, similar in principle to CR845. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Our Strategy
</B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our strategy is to develop and commercialize a novel and first-in-class portfolio of peripherally-acting analgesics, focused initially
on kappa opioid receptor agonists, with I.V. CR845 as the lead candidate, and subsequently on cannabinoid receptor agonists. We have designed and are developing product candidates which have clearly defined clinical development programs and target
large commercial market opportunities. The key elements of our strategy are as follows: </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Continue to advance I.V. CR845 to approval
for treating moderate-to-severe acute pain in acute care settings in the United States.</I></B> We are currently planning a Phase 3 program for I.V. CR845 based on prior FDA guidance and have scheduled an End-of-Phase-2 meeting during the second
quarter of 2015 to discuss this with the FDA. We believe that we will be required to complete a minimum of two successful Phase 3 clinical trials, one in patients with pain resulting from soft tissue surgery and one in patients with pain resulting
from hard tissue surgery. At present, we intend to conduct three Phase 3 clinical trials, which we believe will provide the breadth of patients and surgical exposures, as well as the necessary number of drug exposures, to enable a successful NDA
review process. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Build a sales and marketing organization to commercialize I.V. CR845 for acute pain in the acute care setting in
the United States.</I></B> We are planning to establish a hospital-based sales force to market I.V. CR845 to physicians in the United States. We believe that a sales force of approximately 80 sales professionals can reach a large majority of our
target market. We also intend to build a medical liaison organization as well as a reimbursement infrastructure to support our sales and marketing efforts. </P>

build a sales and marketing infrastructure outside the United States. We will seek partnerships and collaborations with companies that have development and commercialization expertise for the commercialization of I.V. CR845 in countries or regions
outside of the United States. We have already signed development and commercialization agreements with Maruishi for I.V. CR845 and acute indications of Oral CR845 in the Japanese market and Chong Kun Dang for I.V. and Oral CR845 in the South Korean
market. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Advance Oral CR845 to proof-of-concept and seek a global development and commercialization partner.</I></B> The market for
oral chronic pain medications is large and requires a significant sales and marketing infrastructure that other global pharmaceutical partners are better positioned to provide than we are. We intend to advance Oral CR845 through our Phase 2a proof
of concept trial and then seek a global or regional partner for continued development and future commercialization of Oral CR845 internationally. We would intend to retain rights to co-promote Oral CR845 in the U.S. </P>

on potent anti-pruritic (anti-itch) properties we observed CR845 to possess in standard preclinical models of itch, we began exploring I.V. CR845 as a potential treatment of uremic pruritus, a condition that is prevalent among kidney dialysis
patients and is resistant to both anti-histamine and steroid treatments and for which there are no approved therapeutics in the U.S. In 2014, we conducted a proof-of-concept Phase 2 trial for I.V. CR845 for the treatment of uremic pruritus, in which

obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a PCT application or a non-provisional patent application. The term of a patent in the United States can be adjusted and extended due to the
failure of the United States Patent and Trademark Office following certain statutory and regulation deadlines for issuing a patent. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In

review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent
extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other non-United

pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with
competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies, and medical technology companies. Any product
candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There are a large number of companies developing or marketing pain therapies for the indications that we are pursuing. Many of our
competitors, including many of the organizations named below, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other
regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of competitors.
Small or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. We also compete with these companies in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific
personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe the key competitive factors that
will affect the development and commercial success of our product candidates, if approved for marketing, are likely to be their safety, efficacy and tolerability profile, reliability, convenience of dosing, price and reimbursement from government
and third party payers. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive
than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position
before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third party payers seeking to encourage the use of generic products. Generic products that broadly address these
indications are currently on the market for the indications that we are pursuing, and additional products are expected to become available on a generic basis over the coming years. If our product candidates achieve marketing approval, we expect that
they will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic products. </P>

formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature,
among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Manufacture of drug substance, drug product and the labeling and distribution of clinical supplies must all comply with cGMP standards. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is
submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on a clinical hold. In such a case,
the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. </P>

supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with cGCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are
conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol
amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must
continue to oversee the clinical trial while it is being conducted. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on their
ClinicalTrials.gov website. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined.
In Phase 1, the drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an initial
indication of its effectiveness. In Phase 2, the drug typically is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted
diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. In Phase 3, the drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough
data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. </P>

clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the
clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB&#146;s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. </P>

waivers from the pediatric data requirements. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS,
to mitigate any identified or suspected serious risks and ensure safe use of the drug. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution
methods, patient registries or other risk minimization tools. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days
after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application
must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA
reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product&#146;s continued safety, quality
and purity. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an external advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of
independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of
an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically
will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured, referred to as a Pre-Approval Inspection. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with
cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with cGCP. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The testing and approval process for an NDA requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take several years to
complete. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval of an NDA on a timely
basis, or at all. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee
recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a
statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional
information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA&#146;s satisfaction, the FDA may issue an approval letter. An approval
letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. For some products, an additional step of DEA review and scheduling is required. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or
precautions be included in the product labeling, including a boxed warning, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug&#146;s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance
programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the
product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications,
manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Post-Approval Requirements.</I></B> Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing
regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, and compliance with
any post-approval requirements imposed as a condition of approval, such as Phase 4 clinical trials and surveillance to assess safety and effectiveness after commercialization. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new
indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new
application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data. In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state
agencies, and are subject to periodic announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval
before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to
use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or
if problems occur after the product reaches the market. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse
events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market
studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: </P>

marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Although physicians, in the practice of medicine, may prescribe approved drugs for unapproved indications, pharmaceutical companies generally are required to
promote their drug products only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a
company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, the distribution
of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of
drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution. </P>

CR845 or our other product candidates, if approved, may be regulated as a &#147;controlled substance&#148; as defined in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, or CSA, which establishes registration, security, recordkeeping, reporting, storage,
distribution and other requirements administered by the DEA. The DEA is concerned with the control of handlers of controlled substances, and with the equipment and raw materials used in their manufacture and packaging, in order to prevent loss and
diversion into illicit channels of commerce. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The DEA regulates controlled substances as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances. Schedule
I substances by definition have no established medicinal use, and may not be marketed or sold in the United States. A pharmaceutical product may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V, with Schedule II substances considered to present the highest
risk of abuse and Schedule V substances the lowest relative risk of abuse among such substances. The manufacture, shipment, storage, sale and use of Schedule II substances are subject to a high degree of regulation. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Annual registration is required for any facility that manufactures, distributes, dispenses, imports or exports any controlled substance. The
registration is specific to the particular location, activity and controlled substance schedule. For example, separate registrations are needed for import and manufacturing, and each registration will specify which schedules of controlled substances
are authorized. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The DEA typically inspects a facility to review its security measures prior to issuing a registration. Security
requirements vary by controlled substance schedule, with the most stringent requirements applying to Schedule I and Schedule II substances. Required security measures include background checks on employees and physical control of inventory through
measures such as cages, surveillance cameras and inventory reconciliations. Records must be maintained for the handling of all controlled substances, and periodic reports made to the DEA, for example distribution reports for Schedule I and II
controlled substances, Schedule III substances that are narcotics, and other designated substances. Reports must also be made for thefts or losses of any controlled substance, and to obtain authorization to destroy any controlled substance. In
addition, special authorization and notification requirements apply to imports and exports. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, a DEA quota system controls and
limits the availability and production of controlled substances in Schedule I or II. Distributions of any Schedule I or II controlled substance must also be accompanied by special order forms, with copies provided to the DEA. The DEA may adjust
aggregate production quotas and individual production and procurement quotas from time to time during the year, although the DEA has </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, federal and state health care regulatory laws restrict business
practices in the biopharmaceutical industry. These laws include, among other things, anti-kickback and false claims laws and regulations, physician payment transparency laws and regulations, as well as data privacy and security laws and regulations.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying,
soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, or order of any item or
service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term &#147;remuneration&#148; has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements
between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. Practices
that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a
particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative
review of all of its facts and circumstances. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Additionally, the intent standard under the Anti-Kickback Statute was also amended by the
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the &#147;Health Care Reform Law&#148;), to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual
knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Health Care Reform Law provided that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of
the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The federal
civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government or knowingly making, using, or
causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes &#147;any request or demand&#148; for money or property presented to the U.S. government. The civil False
Claims Act has been used to assert liability on the basis of kickbacks and other improper referrals, improperly reported government pricing metrics such as Best Price or Average Manufacturer Price, improper use of Medicare provider or supplier
numbers when detailing a provider of services, improper promotion of off-label uses not expressly approved by FDA in a drug&#146;s label, and allegations as to misrepresentations with respect to the services rendered. Additionally, the civil
monetary penalties statute, which, among other things, imposes fines against any person or entity who is determined to have presented, or caused to be presented, claims to a federal healthcare program that the person knows, or should know, is for an
item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. Additionally, the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully
executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit
program, including private third party payers </P>

and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with
the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters. Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state
programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payer. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by
both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, including the final
omnibus rule published on January&nbsp;25, 2013, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes security standards and certain
privacy standards directly applicable to business associates. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys
general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney&#146;s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws may govern the
privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Additionally, federal transparency laws, including the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act created under Section&nbsp;6002 of the Health
Care Reform Law and its implementing regulations, require that manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children&#146;s Health Insurance Program (with certain
exceptions) report annually to the Centers for Medicare&nbsp;&amp; Medicaid Services (&#147;CMS&#148;) information related to payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians (defined to include doctors of medicine, dentists,
optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), generally, with some exceptions, and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals. Additionally, applicable
manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations are required to report annually to CMS certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians (as defined above) and their immediate family members by the 90th day of each subsequent
calendar year. Disclosure of such information for the first reporting period was made publicly available by CMS on September&nbsp;30, 2014. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There are also an increasing number of analogous state laws that require manufacturers to file reports with states on pricing and marketing
information, such as tracking and reporting of gifts, compensations, other remuneration and items of value provided to healthcare professionals and healthcare entities. Many of these laws contain ambiguities as to what is required to comply with
such laws. For example, several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to, among other things, establish and implement commercial compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures
on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities and/or register their sales representatives. Certain state laws also regulate manufacturers&#146; use of prescriber-identifiable data. These laws may affect our future sales,
marketing and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens. In addition, given the lack of clarity with respect to these laws and their implementation, our reporting actions once we commercialize could be subject to
the penalty provisions of the pertinent state and federal authorities. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the
health regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject penalties, including criminal and significant civil monetary penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare
programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be
subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of
payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The commercial success of our product candidates and our ability to commercialize any approved product candidates successfully will depend in
part on the extent to which governmental payer programs at the federal and state levels, including Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers and other third-party payers provide coverage for and establish adequate reimbursement levels for our
product candidates. Third-party payers generally decide which drugs they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels for healthcare. In particular, in the United States, private health insurers and other third party payers often provide
reimbursement for products and services based on the level at which the government provides reimbursement through the Medicare or Medicaid programs for such products and services. In the United States, the European Union and other potentially
significant markets for our product candidates, government authorities and third party payers are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative products and therapies,
which often has resulted in average selling prices lower than they would otherwise be. Further, the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States and on country and regional pricing and reimbursement controls in the European Union
will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and utilization, which may adversely affect our future product sales and results of operations. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, judicial
decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, pharmaceutical coverage and reimbursement policies and pricing in general. Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers
performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payers to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Sales of our product candidates will therefore depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to
which the costs of our products will be paid by health maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management organizations, or reimbursed by government health administration authorities, such as Medicare and Medicaid, private
health insurers and other third-party payers. Third-party payers are increasingly imposing additional requirements and restrictions on coverage and limiting reimbursement levels for medical products, including pharmaceuticals. For example, federal
and state governments reimburse covered prescription drugs at varying rates generally below average wholesale price. These restrictions and limitations influence the purchase of healthcare services and products. Third-party payers may limit coverage
to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drug products for a particular indication. Additionally, third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical
necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. Therefore, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of
our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. Moreover, a payer&#146;s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply
that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in drug development. Legislative
proposals to reform healthcare or reduce costs under government insurance programs may result in lower reimbursement for our products and product candidates or exclusion of our products and product candidates from coverage. The cost containment
measures that healthcare payers and providers are instituting and any healthcare reform could significantly reduce our revenues from the sale of any approved product candidates. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to obtain and
maintain third party coverage or adequate reimbursement for our product candidates in whole or in part. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Coverage, Reimbursement, and
Pricing Developments </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, the legislative landscape continues to evolve. There have
been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payers in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting
changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly
affected by major legislative initiatives. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For example, the Health Care Reform Law was passed in March 2010 and includes provisions that
have substantially changed healthcare financing by both governmental and private insurers. Among other cost containment measures, the Health Care Reform Law, among other things, revised the methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers to the
state and federal government for covered outpatient drugs under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, extended the Medicaid Drug
Rebate program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals&nbsp;enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, subjected manufacturers to new annual fees and taxes for certain branded prescription drugs, and provided incentives to programs that
increase the federal government&#146;s comparative effectiveness research. The Health Care Reform Law&#146;s full impact on our business is unclear as many of its reforms require the promulgation of additional detailed regulations implementing the
statutory provisions which has not yet completely occurred. Further, new litigation is currently pending before the U.S. Supreme Court seeking to invalidate certain provisions of the Health Care Reform Law. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Health Care Reform Law was enacted. In August 2011, the
President signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to Congress. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit
Reduction did not achieve its targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation&#146;s automatic reductions to several government programs. These reductions include aggregate reductions
to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2%&nbsp;per fiscal year, starting in 2013 and will remain in effect until 2024, unless additional congressional action is taken. Under the Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended, federal budget
&#147;sequestration&#148; Medicare payment reductions became effective on April&nbsp;1, 2013 and automatically reduced payments under various government programs, including, for example, certain Medicare provider and supplier reimbursement payments.
In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to
recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These and other healthcare reform initiatives may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial
operations. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could
further limit the prices we are able to charge, or the amounts of reimbursement available, for our product candidates once they are approved. </P>

market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization,
commercial sales and distribution of our products. For example, in the European Union, we must obtain authorization of a clinical trial application, or CTA, in each member state in which we intend to conduct a clinical trial. Whether or not we
obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval
process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA
approval. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. </P>

to face similar risks to our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for and successfully commercialize such product candidates as we face with I.V. CR845. </P>

product candidates based on peripheral kappa opioid receptor agonists is an emerging field, and the scientific discoveries that form the basis for our efforts to discover and develop product candidates that work through this mechanism are relatively
recent. The scientific evidence to support the feasibility of developing differentiated product candidates based on these discoveries is both preliminary and limited. We believe that we are amongst a relatively small group of companies that are
pursuing the development of product candidates based on peripherally acting kappa opioid receptor agonists. In addition, we believe that companies that previously explored the development of kappa opioid receptor agonists abandoned these efforts
because those prior generation kappa agonists, which were centrally active, resulted in psychiatric side effects. Although CR845 is a peripherally acting kappa opioid receptor agonist and these side effects have not been observed in any of our
clinical trials to date, it is possible that we could observe similar side effects, or other unacceptable adverse events. As a result, our approach to developing product candidates based on peripheral kappa opioid receptor agonists may not be
successful and may never lead to marketable products. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product candidate

as most likely to succeed, in terms of both its regulatory approval and commercialization. As such, we are currently primarily focused on the development of I.V. CR845 for acute postoperative pain and uremic pruritus and Oral CR845 for acute and
chronic pain. As a result, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or for other indications that may prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to
capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future research and development programs and product candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable products. If we
do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it
would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>If we

regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data is insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies. In addition,

regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other comparable foreign authorities. For example, if concerns are raised
regarding the safety of a new drug as a result of undesirable side effects identified during clinical testing, the FDA may order us to cease further development, decline to approve the drug or issue a letter requesting additional data or information
prior to making a final decision regarding whether or not to approve the drug. The number of such requests for additional data or information issued by the FDA in recent years has increased, and resulted in substantial delays in the approval of
several new drugs. Undesirable side effects caused by I.V. CR845 or any of our other product candidates could also result in denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other regulatory authorities for any or all targeted indications or the
inclusion of unfavorable information in our product labeling, and in turn prevent us from commercializing and generating revenues from the sale of I.V. CR845 or any other product candidate. </P>

near-sleep, or somnolence, and hypernatremia, an electrolyte disturbance that is defined by an elevated sodium level in the blood, which we believe is secondary, at least in part, to another side effect, aquaresis, that is defined as
electrolyte-free urination. Prolonged aquaresis can result in a negative fluid balance if the excreted water is not replaced by oral or intravenous water, and although we will recommend such prevention of dehydration, we cannot be certain that such
instructions will be followed by healthcare providers and/or patients, and failure to follow such instructions may be accompanied by adverse events associated with dehydration, including disability and death. We believe that one such adverse event,
which has been observed, postural tachycardia, an elevation of heart rate upon standing up, is a physiological reflex that can be triggered as a result of decreased intravascular volume caused by a negative fluid balance. We have observed transient
prolactin elevations, which are brief increases in the concentration of the hormone prolactin in the bloodstream, in response to I.V. CR845, which we have measured as a nonselective opioid biomarker since both kappa and mu opioids elicit this
effect. We cannot be certain that such elevations in prolactin will be transient, safe, and well </P>

feeling of emotional and mental discomfort, or dysphoria, and hallucinations, at high doses, particularly for prior generations of kappa opioid agonists with substantially unrestricted or only partially restricted entry to the CNS. Although we have
not observed psychiatric side effects in any CR845 clinical trials to date, we cannot be certain that these side effects or others will not be observed in the future, or that the FDA will not require additional trials or impose more severe labeling
restrictions due to these side effects or other concerns. The drug-related side effects could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trial or result in potential product liability claims. Any of these

require REMS as part of their approval by the FDA. REMS programs may require medication guides for patients, special communication plans to healthcare professionals or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient
registries and/or other risk minimization tools. While CR845 has been well tolerated in clinical trials to date and has not shown any evidence of the euphoria that has led to misuse, abuse and addiction of mu opioids, including the results of our
Human Abuse Liability (&#147;HAL&#148;) trial, which we successfully completed in the fourth quarter of 2014, the FDA may still determine that CR845-based products require a REMS program. We cannot predict whether REMS will be required as part of
the FDA&#146;s approval of our product candidates and, if required, what those requirements might be. Any limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of our product
candidates, if approved. If a REMS program is required, depending on the extent of the REMS requirements, the program might significantly increase our costs to commercialize these product candidates. Furthermore, risks of our product candidates that
are not adequately addressed through proposed REMS for such product candidates may also prevent or delay their approval for commercialization. </P>

federal and foreign laws and regulations regarding their manufacture, use, sale, importation, exportation and distribution. Controlled substances are regulated under the federal Controlled Substances Act of 1970, or CSA, and regulations of the DEA.
The DEA regulates controlled substances as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances. Schedule I substances by definition have no established medicinal use and may not be marketed or sold in the United States. A pharmaceutical product may be listed as
Schedule II, III, IV or V, with Schedule II substances considered to present the highest risk of abuse and Schedule V substances the lowest relative risk of abuse among such substances. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The top-line results from our HAL trial suggest that CR845 may have the potential to be a Schedule V or non-scheduled peripheral opioid.
However, while CR845-based products have not demonstrated any evidence of the euphoria that has led to misuse, abuse, and addiction of mu opioids, and while CR845-based products are not being treated as a controlled substance in clinical trials, it
is possible that the DEA could determine that CR845-based products should be regulated as controlled substances. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Various states also
independently regulate controlled substances. Though state controlled substances laws often mirror federal law, because the states are separate jurisdictions, they may separately schedule drugs as well. While some states automatically schedule a
drug when the DEA does so, in other states there must be rulemaking or a legislative action. State scheduling may delay commercial sale of any controlled substance drug product for which we obtain federal regulatory approval and adverse scheduling
could impair the commercial attractiveness of such product. We or our collaborators may also be requested to obtain separate state registrations in order to be able to obtain, handle and distribute controlled substances for clinical trials or
commercial sale, and failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements could lead to enforcement and sanctions from the states in addition to those from the DEA or otherwise arising under federal law. </P>

associated with controlled substances govern manufacturing, labeling, packaging, testing, dispensing, production and procurement quotas, record keeping, reporting, handling, shipment and disposal. These regulations increase the personnel needs and
the expense associated with development and commercialization of product candidates including controlled substances. The DEA, and some states, conduct periodic inspections of registered establishments that handle controlled substances. Failure to
obtain and maintain required registrations or comply with any applicable regulations could delay or preclude us from developing and commercializing our product candidates containing controlled substances and subject us to enforcement action. The DEA
may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations or initiate proceedings to revoke those registrations. In some circumstances, violations could lead to criminal proceedings. Because of the restrictive nature of these regulations, if
it was determined that our product candidates are subject to these restrictions, the commercialization of our product candidates could be limited. </P>

must obtain separate marketing approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing. The time required to obtain approval may differ substantially
from that required to obtain FDA approval. The regulatory approval process outside the United States generally includes all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. In addition, in many countries outside the United States, it is required
that the product be approved for reimbursement before the product can be approved for sale in that country. We or these third parties may not obtain approvals from regulatory authorities outside the United States on a timely basis, if at all.
Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one regulatory authority outside the United States does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or
jurisdictions or by the FDA. However, the failure to obtain approval in one jurisdiction may compromise our ability to obtain approval elsewhere. We may not be able to file for marketing approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to

marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. The FDA imposes stringent restrictions on manufacturers&#146; communications regarding off-label use and if we do not market our products for
their approved indications, we may be subject to enforcement action for off-label marketing. Violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act relating to the promotion of prescription drugs may lead to investigations alleging violations of

There are a number of large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that currently market and sell products or are pursuing the development of products for the treatment of pain. Potential competitors also include academic institutions,
government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization. </P>

potentially compete with include: Pfizer, Cumberland Pharmaceuticals, Zogenix, Inc, Mallinckrodt, Actavis, Purdue Pharma, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Celgene, Endo Pharmaceuticals, Depomed and Acorda Therapeutics. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more
effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain
approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payers seeking
to encourage the use of generic products. Generic products are currently on the market for the indications that we are pursuing, and additional products are expected to become available on a generic basis over the coming years. If our product
candidates achieve marketing approval, we expect that they will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic products. </P>

preclinical studies and clinical trials. These agreements might terminate for a variety of reasons, including a failure to perform by the third parties. If we need to enter into alternative arrangements, that would delay our product development
activities and adversely affect our business. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our reliance on these third parties for development activities will reduce our control over
these activities. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory and scientific standards and our reliance on the CROs does not relieve us of our
regulatory responsibilities. For example, we will remain responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial and for ensuring that our preclinical
trials are conducted in accordance with GLP, as appropriate. Moreover, the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities require us to comply with standards, commonly referred to as good clinical practices, or GCPs, for conducting, recording and
reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial participants are protected. Regulatory authorities enforce these requirements
through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, clinical investigators and trial sites. If we or any of our CROs fail to comply with applicable GCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or
comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot assure you that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will
determine that any of our clinical trials complies with GCP regulations. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with product produced under cGMP regulations. Our failure to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat clinical
trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process. We also are required to register certain clinical trials and post the results of certain completed clinical trials on a government-sponsored database, ClinicalTrials.gov, within specified
timeframes. Failure to do so can result in fines, adverse publicity and civil and criminal sanctions. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our CROs may also have

sufficient time and resources to our on-going clinical, non-clinical and preclinical programs. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines or conduct our preclinical studies or clinical
trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols, if they need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols, regulatory

for commercially viable lengths of time. We and our contract manufacturers will need to demonstrate to the FDA and other regulatory authorities this acceptable stability data for our product candidates, as well as validate methods and manufacturing
processes, in order to receive regulatory approval to commercialize I.V. CR845 or any of our other product candidates. Furthermore, if our commercial manufacturers fail to deliver the required commercial quantities of bulk drug substance or finished
product on a timely basis and at commercially reasonable prices, we would likely be unable to meet demand for our products and we would lose potential revenues. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We only have one contract manufacturer for each of I.V. CR845 and Oral CR845 for use in our clinical trials. In addition, we do not have any
long-term commitments from our suppliers of clinical trial material or guaranteed prices for our product candidates. The manufacture of pharmaceutical products requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the development of
advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls. Manufacturers of pharmaceutical products often encounter difficulties in production, particularly in scaling up initial production. These problems include difficulties with production costs and
yields, quality control, including stability of the product candidate and quality assurance testing, shortages of qualified personnel, as well as compliance with strictly enforced federal, state and foreign regulations. Our manufacturers may not
perform as agreed. If our manufacturers were to encounter any of these difficulties, our ability to provide product candidates to patients in our clinical trials would be jeopardized. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Further, we may rely on proprietary technology developed by our contract manufacturers for purposes of manufacturing certain of our product
candidates and our failure to negotiate the long term use of any such proprietary technology may lead to regulatory approval and/or commercializing delays or interruptions, as well as increased costs. For example, we have developed a formulation of
Oral CR845 based on proprietary technology of Enteris Biopharma Inc., or Enteris. Under our agreement with Enteris, it is providing to us clinical supplies for an oral tablet formulation of CR845 on a fee for service basis. Under the agreed scope of
work for this agreement, Enteris is using its proprietary formulation technology for oral delivery of peptides to provide a tablet formulation of CR845 with suitable characteristics to use in clinical testing. We have not yet negotiated terms

in significantly delaying commercializing Oral CR845 and require us to incur additional costs in connection with such reformulation and potentially needed to seek additional approvals from the FDA. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, all manufacturers of our product candidates must comply with cGMP requirements enforced by the FDA through its facilities
inspection program. These requirements include quality control, quality assurance and the maintenance of records and documentation. Manufacturers of our product candidates may be unable to comply with these cGMP requirements and with other FDA,
state and foreign regulatory requirements. If our contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA or other regulatory authorities, they will not be
able to secure and/or maintain regulatory approval for their manufacturing facilities. We have little control over our manufacturers&#146; compliance with these regulations and standards. If the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority does
not approve these facilities for the manufacture of our product candidates or if it withdraws any such approval in the future, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would significantly impact our ability to develop, obtain
regulatory approval for or market our product candidates, if approved. A failure to comply with these requirements may result in fines and civil penalties, suspension of production, suspension, delay or denial of product approval, product seizure or
recall, or withdrawal of product approval. If the safety of any quantities supplied is compromised due to our manufacturers&#146; failure to adhere to applicable laws or for other reasons, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or
successfully commercialize our product candidates. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We may rely on third parties to perform many essential services for any products

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our business model is to commercialize our product candidates in the United States and generally to seek collaboration arrangements with
pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies for the development or commercialization of our product candidates in the rest of the world. We have entered into license agreements with Maruishi and CKD to develop, manufacture and commercialize products
containing CR845 (both I.V. and Oral) in Japan and South Korea, respectively. In addition to our existing agreements covering Japan and Korea, we may enter into additional collaboration arrangements in the future on a selective basis. Our existing

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Collaborators generally have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaboration

that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry&#146;s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available under the U.S. federal
Anti-Kickback Statute, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies continue to be prosecuted under the federal false claims laws for
numerous activities, including those related to research, sales, marketing and promotional programs. In addition, recent health care reform legislation has strengthened these laws. For example, the Health Care Reform Law among other things, amends
the intent requirement of the federal anti-kickback and certain criminal healthcare fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it. Moreover, the Health Care Reform Law
provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act. To the extent that any
product we make is sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations. If we or our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us,
we may be subject to penalties, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in U.S. federal or state health care programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations,
any of which could materially adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. Although an effective compliance program can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, the risks
cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management&#146;s attention from the operation of our
business. Moreover, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable federal and state privacy, security and fraud laws may prove costly. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business,
including our collaborators, is found not to be in compliance with applicable laws, it may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including but not limited to, exclusions from participation in government healthcare programs,
which could also materially affect our business. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>If the government or other third-party payers fail to provide coverage and

products when more established or lower cost therapeutic alternatives are already available or subsequently become available. Assuming coverage is approved, the resulting reimbursement payment
rates might not be adequate. In particular, many U.S. hospitals receive a fixed reimbursement amount per procedure for certain surgeries and other treatment therapies they perform, or a predetermined rate for all hospital inpatient care provided as
payment in full. Because this amount may not be based on the actual expenses the hospital incurs, hospitals may choose to use therapies which are less expensive when compared to our product candidates. Accordingly, I.V. CR845 or any of our other
product candidates, if approved, will face competition from other therapies and drugs for these limited hospital financial resources. We may need to conduct post-marketing studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of any future products
to the satisfaction of hospitals, other target customers and their third-party payers. Such studies might require us to commit a significant amount of management time and financial and other resources. Our future products might not ultimately be
considered cost-effective. Adequate third-party coverage and reimbursement might not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on investment in product development. </P>

controlling healthcare costs. In addition, in the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payers. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from
payer to payer. Further, we believe that future coverage and reimbursement will likely be subject to increased restrictions both in the United States and in international markets. Third-party coverage and reimbursement for our products or product
candidates for which we receive regulatory approval may not be available or adequate in either the United States or international markets, which could have a negative effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

among other things, aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2%&nbsp;per fiscal year, which went effective on April&nbsp;1, 2013 and will remain in effect until 2024, unless additional congressional action is taken. In January
2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover
overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on customers for our drugs, if approved, and, accordingly,
our financial operations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We expect that the Health Care Reform Law, as well as other federal and state healthcare reform measures that
may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved drug. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government healthcare programs
may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our drugs. </P>

any, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of the FDA&#146;s approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject us to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent
applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. Moreover, should we enter into
additional collaborations we may be required to consult with or cede control to collaborators regarding the prosecution, maintenance and enforcement of our patents. Therefore, these patents and applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a
manner consistent with the best interests of our business. The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain
unresolved. No consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in pharmaceutical or biotechnology patents has emerged to date in the United States. The patent situation outside the United States is even more uncertain. Changes in either
the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents or
in third-party patents. The degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain, because legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage.
Moreover, the patent application process is also subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, and there can be no assurance that we or any of our future development partners will be successful in protecting CR845 and any other product candidates
that we may develop, license or acquire by obtaining and defending patents. For example: </P> <P STYLE="font-size:6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents. On September&nbsp;16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, was signed
into law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to United States patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. The United States Patent
Office recently developed new regulations and procedures to govern administration of the Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act, and in particular, the first to file provisions, only
became effective on March&nbsp;16, 2013. Accordingly, it is not clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business. However, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs

Consequently, we cannot be certain we were the first to invent or the first to file patent applications on CR845 or any other product candidates that we may develop, license or acquire. In the event that a third party has also filed a
U.S.&nbsp;patent application relating to our product candidates or a similar invention, we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the U.S.&nbsp;Patent and Trademark Office to determine priority of invention in the United
States. The costs of these proceedings could be substantial and it is possible that our efforts would be unsuccessful, resulting in a material adverse effect on our U.S.&nbsp;patent position. The results of these types of proceedings may reduce the
scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology or products and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing
third-party patent rights. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or

patents or published applications that affect our business either by blocking our ability to commercialize our drugs or by covering similar technologies that affect our drug market. In addition, some countries, including many in Europe, do not grant
patent claims directed to methods of treating humans, and in these countries patent protection may not be available at all to protect our product candidates. Even if patents issue, we cannot guarantee that the claims of those patents will be valid

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We also rely on trade secrets to protect our technology, particularly where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable.
However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. While we use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets, our licensors, employees, consultants, contractors, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors may unintentionally or willfully
disclose our information to competitors. Enforcing a claim that a third party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets is expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States are
sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how. </P>

part, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and products. Given the amount of time required for the
development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such product candidates might expire before or shortly after such product candidates are commercialized. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio
may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>If we or

patent claims. For example, if a third party files an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, for a generic drug product containing CR845, and relies in whole or in part on studies conducted
by or for us, the third party will be required to certify to the FDA that either: (1)&nbsp;there is no patent information listed in the FDA&#146;s Orange Book with respect to our NDA for I.V. CR845; (2)&nbsp;the patents listed in the Orange Book
have expired; (3)&nbsp;the listed patents have not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (4)&nbsp;the listed patents are invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use or sale of
the third-party&#146;s generic drug product. A certification that the new product will not infringe the Orange Book-listed patents for CR845, or that such patents are invalid, is called a paragraph IV certification. If the third party submits a
paragraph IV certification to the FDA, a notice of the paragraph IV certification must also be sent to us once the third-party&#146;s ANDA is accepted for filing by the FDA. We may then initiate a lawsuit to defend the patents identified in the
notice. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45&nbsp;days of receipt of the notice automatically prevents the FDA from approving the third-party&#146;s ANDA until the earliest of 30&nbsp;months or the date on which the patent expires,
the lawsuit is settled, or the court reaches a decision in the infringement lawsuit in favor of the third party. If we do not file a patent infringement lawsuit within the required 45-day period, the third-party&#146;s ANDA will not be subject to
the 30-month stay. Litigation or other proceedings to enforce or defend&nbsp;intellectual property rights are often very complex in nature, may be very expensive and time-consuming, may divert our management&#146;s attention from our core business,
and may result in unfavorable results that could adversely impact our ability to prevent third parties from competing with our products. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Risks Related

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our industry has experienced a high rate of turnover of management personnel in recent years. We
are highly dependent on the skills and leadership of our management team, including Derek Chalmers, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Our senior management may terminate their employment with us at any time. If we lose one or more members
of our senior management team, our ability to successfully implement our business strategy could be seriously harmed. Replacing these employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in
our industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to develop, gain regulatory approval of and commercialize products successfully. Competition to hire from this limited pool is intense, and we may be unable to hire, train, retain or
motivate additional key personnel. We do not maintain &#147;key person&#148; insurance for any of our executives or other employees. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>If we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis
could be impaired. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002 and the rules and regulations of The NASDAQ Global Market. Pursuant to Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Section&nbsp;404, beginning in 2014, we were required to perform system and process evaluation and testing of our
internal control over financial reporting to allow our management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in this Form 10-K. However, while we remain an emerging growth company, we will not be required to
include an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">To achieve compliance with Section&nbsp;404 within the prescribed period, we have been engaged in a process of documenting and evaluating our
internal control over financial reporting using the 2013 Internal Control &#150; Integrated Framework established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). This process has been both costly and challenging. We
have dedicated internal resources and have engaged outside consultants to assist us, under management&#146;s direction, in the design, documentation and testing of our internal controls and procedures. We adopted a detailed work plan to assess
whether each of the 17 principles underlying the five components of internal control is present and functioning and whether the five components are operating together to provide reasonable assurance that the relevant objectives are met. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of December&nbsp;31, 2014, we have identified and documented the controls, including key controls, within our significant classes of
transactions as well as entity-level and information technology processes. Our outside consultants have tested our key controls in those transaction cycles to confirm that, as of December&nbsp;31, 2014, those controls were effective. However, even
though we have determined that these controls are currently effective, there is a risk that our controls may become inadequate in the future, either because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
may deteriorate. Therefore, in the future, we will need to continue steps to validate through testing that controls are continuing to function as documented and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process, as appropriate, for internal
control over financial reporting. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We may discover weaknesses in our system of internal financial and accounting controls and procedures
that could result in a material misstatement of our financial statements. Our internal control over financial reporting will not prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only
reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system&#146;s objectives will be met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud
will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud will be detected. If we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal controls, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, the market
price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by The NASDAQ Global Market, the SEC or other regulatory authorities. </P>

over the analysts or the content and opinions included in their reports. The price of our stock could decline if one or more equity research analysts downgrade our stock or issue other unfavorable commentary or research. If one or more equity
research analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. </P>

existing stockholders&#146; ownership will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if
available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. </P>

parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. Any debt financing we enter into may involve
covenants that restrict our operations. These restrictive covenants may include limitations on additional borrowing and specific restrictions on the use of our assets as well as prohibitions on our ability to create liens, pay dividends, redeem our
stock or make investments. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights

of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. As of March&nbsp;20, 2015, we had approximately 22.8&nbsp;million shares of our common stock outstanding. The majority of these shares were acquired
prior to our IPO and were subject to lock-up agreements prohibiting holders of these shares from selling any of their shares for a period of 180 days following our IPO. These lock-up agreements have expired and, as a result, a substantial number of
our shares are now generally freely tradable, subject, in the case of sales by our affiliates, to the volume limitations and other provisions of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#147;Securities Act&#148;). If holders of
these shares sell, or indicate an intent to sell, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline significantly. In addition, certain holders of shares of our common stock may require
us, subject to certain conditions, to prepare and file a registration statement under the Securities Act and are entitled to include their shares in any registration statement we may file for ourselves or other stockholders. If we register the
resale of these shares in the future, the holders could sell those shares freely in the public market, without regard to the limitations of Rule 144. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception
that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise adequate capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We are unable to predict the effect that sales may have on the
prevailing market price of our common stock. </P>

&#147;emerging growth company&#148; as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or JOBS Act, and we are taking advantage of some of the exemptions from reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are
not emerging growth companies, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section&nbsp;404, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and
exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no
longer an emerging growth company. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active
trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier

to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June&nbsp;30th, and (2)&nbsp;the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in
non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. To the extent we are no longer eligible to use exemptions from various reporting requirements under the JOBS Act, we may be unable to realize our anticipated cost savings from these
exemptions, which could have a material adverse impact on our operating results. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>The use of our net operating loss carryforwards

and not be used. As of December&nbsp;31, 2014, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $71.4&nbsp;million and $65.3 million, respectively, and we also had federal and state research and development tax credit
carryforwards of approximately $2.9 million and $0.7 million, respectively. Our net operating loss carryforwards will begin expiring in 2026 for federal purposes and 2027 for state purposes if we have not used them prior to that time, and our
federal tax credits will begin expiring in 2025 unless previously used. To the extent we have not exchanged our Connecticut research tax credits for a tax refund, those tax credits carryforward indefinitely. Additionally, our ability to use any net
operating loss and credit carryforwards to offset taxable income or tax, respectively, in the future will be limited under Internal Revenue Code Sections&nbsp;382 and 383, respectively, if we have a cumulative change in ownership of more than 50%
within a three-year period. The completion of our initial public offering, together with private placements and other transactions that have occurred, may trigger, or may have already triggered such an ownership change. In addition, since we will
need to raise substantial additional funding to finance our operations, we may undergo further ownership changes in the future. We have never completed an analysis as to whether such a change of ownership has occurred, but in such an event, we will
be limited regarding the amount of net operating loss carryforwards and research tax credits that could be utilized annually in the future to offset taxable income or tax, respectively. Any such annual limitation may significantly reduce the
utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards and research tax credits before they expire. In addition, certain states have suspended use of net operating loss carryforwards for certain taxable years, and other states are considering similar
measures. As a result, we may incur higher state income tax expense in the future. Depending on our future tax position, continued suspension of our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards in states in which we are subject to income tax
could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Introduction </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are a
clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing new chemical entities designed to alleviate pain and pruritus by selectively targeting kappa opioid receptors. We are developing a novel and proprietary class of
product candidates that target the body&#146;s peripheral nervous system and have demonstrated efficacy in patients with moderate-to-severe pain without inducing many of the undesirable side effects typically associated with currently available pain
therapeutics. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our most advanced product candidate, intravenous, or I.V., CR845, has demonstrated significant pain relief and a favorable
safety and tolerability profile in three Phase 2 clinical trials in patients with acute postoperative pain. We have scheduled an End of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA to be held in the second quarter of 2015 to discuss the design of Phase 3 trials for
I.V. CR845 in acute pain and anticipate initiating our initial Phase 3 clinical trial during the second quarter of 2015. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2014, we successfully completed a Human Abuse Liability (&#147;HAL&#148;) trial of I.V.
CR845. We believe that the totality of results from the HAL trial are supportive of the potential for CR845 to be the first non-scheduled or low (schedule V) scheduled peripheral opioid for acute pain. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are also developing an oral version of CR845, or Oral CR845, for acute and chronic pain. We have successfully completed a Phase 1 trial of
a capsule formulation of Oral CR845 that established oral bioavailability parameters. In the second quarter of 2014, we initiated a Phase 1 trial of a tablet formulation of Oral CR845, for which we announced positive top-line data in the fourth
quarter of 2014. We are preparing to advance this formulation of Oral CR845 into a Phase 2 clinical trial in the second quarter of 2015. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">CR845 has exhibited anti-pruritic (anti-itch) potency in standard preclinical models. In the second quarter of 2014, we filed an IND and in
the third quarter of 2014 we initiated a proof-of-concept Phase 2 trial for I.V. CR845 for the treatment of uremic pruritus, a systemic condition with high prevalence in dialysis patients for which there are no approved therapeutics in the U.S. In
the fourth quarter of 2014, we reported positive top-line dose-ranging pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety data from this trial (considered a Phase 1b trial) and expect to report top-line efficacy results in the second quarter of 2015. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We commenced operations in 2004, and our primary activities to date have been organizing and staffing our company, developing our product
candidates, including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials of CR845-based product candidates and raising capital. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through sales of our equity and debt securities and payments from
license agreements. We have no products currently available for sale, and substantially all of our revenue to date has been revenue from license agreements, although we have received nominal amounts of revenue under research grants. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Since our inception and through December&nbsp;31, 2014, we have received net proceeds of $56.3 million from the sale of 5.75&nbsp;million
shares of our common stock in our initial public offering (&#147;IPO&#148;), which closed on </P>

February&nbsp;5, 2014, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, net proceeds of $65.9 million from the sale of various series of convertible preferred stock,
$3.6 million from the issuance of convertible promissory notes and $3.8 million from the issuance of long-term debt. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition to our
financing activities, we have received aggregate payments of $30.1 million pursuant to license agreements related to CR845 and an earlier product candidate for which development efforts ceased in 2007. Included in those aforementioned payments
pursuant to license agreements, in April 2013, we received $15.0 million as an upfront payment, and in August 2014, we received an additional $0.5 million related to achievement of a milestone in connection with the license of rights to CR845 in
Japan to Maruishi. In 2012, we received aggregate upfront and milestone payments of $1.2 million pursuant to a license agreement with CKD, in connection with the license of rights to CR845 in South Korea. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Since inception, we have incurred significant operating and net losses available to common stockholders. Our net losses available to common
stockholders were $17.7 million, $3.1 million and $6.3 million for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, December&nbsp;31, 2013 and December&nbsp;31, 2012, respectively. As of December&nbsp;31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of $80.2 million.
We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating and net losses over at least the next several years. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year, depending on the timing of our clinical
trials, the receipt of additional milestone payments, if any, under our collaborations with Maruishi and CKD, the receipt of payments under any future collaborations we may enter into, and our expenditures on other research and development
activities. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially as we: </P>

raise additional capital on terms acceptable to us, or at all, and any failure to raise capital as and when needed could compromise our ability to execute on our business plan. Although it is difficult to predict future liquidity requirements, we
believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with interest thereon, will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 15 months without giving effect to any potential milestone payments we may receive under our
collaboration agreements. However, our ability to successfully transition to profitability will be dependent upon achieving a level of revenues adequate to support our cost structure. We cannot assure you that we will ever be profitable or generate

and non-creditable upfront license fee of $15.0 million and are eligible to receive up to an aggregate of $6.0 million in clinical development milestones and $4.5 million in regulatory milestones. In August 2014, we received a clinical development
milestone payment of $0.5 million upon completion by Maruishi of a Phase 1 clinical trial in Japan related to CR845 in acute post-operative pain. We are also eligible to receive tiered royalties, with percentages ranging from the low double digits

costs of our current or future preclinical programs and clinical trials of our product candidates, or if, when or to what extent we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates that obtain regulatory

in direct preclinical studies and clinical trial costs and related consultant costs resulted from an increase of $2.6 million of CR845 drug manufacturing costs, as well as increases in costs related to the following clinical trials which commenced
in 2014: $1.5 million in connection with the Phase 1 Oral CR845 trial, $2.0 million for the Phase 2 I.V. CR845 uremic pruritus trial and $1.7 million for the I.V. CR845 HAL trial. These costs were partially offset by a decrease of $2.0 million of
clinical trial costs in connection with the Phase 2 I.V. CR845 bunionectomy trial and the Phase 1 I.V. CR845 renal impairment trial, which were substantially completed in 2013. The increase in stock-based compensation expense reflects the granting
of stock options in 2014, whereas there were no such grants in 2012 or 2013. The increase in other R&amp;D operating expenses included increases of $0.1 million of payroll and related costs, and $0.5 million of clinical compound sold to Maruishi as
Maruishi increased its clinical trial activity in Japan. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013 compared to the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2012, the increase in direct preclinical studies and clinical trial costs and related consultant costs resulted primarily from increases of $1.6 million of CR845 drug manufacturing costs, $1.1 million from the completion of the
Phase 2 I.V. CR845 bunionectomy trial and $1.0 million from the Phase 1 I.V. CR845 renal impairment trial and $0.3 million in preclinical costs for formulation and studies related to oral tablets of CR845. The increase in other R&amp;D operating
expenses resulted primarily from an increase of $0.3 million of payroll and related costs. The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense resulted from the sale of fixed assets used in research and development during 2012. </P>

professional fees included increases in directors&#146; fees of $0.2 million and public/investor relations costs of $0.4 million as a result of our becoming a public company. Those increases were partially offset by decreases in consultant costs of
$0.2 million, primarily related to the success fee we incurred in connection with entering into the Maruishi license agreement in 2013, and decreased accounting and auditing fees of $0.2 million, which were higher in 2013 in preparation for our
initial public offering. Stock-based compensation expense increased due to the granting of stock options in 2014 in connection with the IPO. The increase in other G&amp;A operating expenses included increases of $0.7 million in payroll and related
costs and $0.6 million of directors&#146; and officers&#146; insurance costs, both as a result of our becoming a public company. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For the
year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013 compared to the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2012, professional fees increased due to an increase in accounting, legal and consulting professional fees of $0.8 million, incurred in connection with the Maruishi
license agreement and preparation for our initial public offering. Other G&amp;A operating expenses decreased $0.3 million due to a loss on the sale of assets in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2012, partially offset by an increase of $0.1 million

our IPO, which closed in February 2014, $30.1 million received under our license agreements for CR845, primarily with Maruishi, CKD, and an earlier product candidate for which development efforts ceased in 2007, $65.9 million of proceeds from the
sale of shares of our convertible preferred stock, including Junior A convertible preferred stock (see below), and $7.4 million of net proceeds from debt financings, including convertible promissory notes and the Connecticut Innovations, Inc. Term

cash equivalents, under our agreement with Maruishi, we are potentially eligible to earn up to an aggregate of $6.0 million in clinical development milestones and $4.5 million in regulatory milestones as well as tiered royalties, with percentages
ranging from the low double digits to the low twenties, based on net sales of products containing CR845 in Japan, if any, and share in any sub-license fees. In June 2014, Maruishi completed a Phase 1 clinical trial in Japan related to CR845 in acute
post-operative pain for which we received a clinical development milestone payment of $0.5 million in August 2014. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under our agreement

the high teens, based on net sales of products containing CR845 in South Korea, if any, and share in any sub-license fees. During 2012, we recognized milestone revenue of $0.5 million, net of $0.2 million of tax, in connection with the CKD license
agreement. Our ability to earn these payments and their timing is dependent upon the outcome of I.V. and Oral CR845 development activities and, potentially, commercialization. However, our receipt of any further such amounts is uncertain at this

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the terms of the Maruishi agreement, during April 2013, Maruishi purchased 2,105,263 shares of our Junior A convertible preferred stock
pursuant to a stock purchase agreement for a purchase price of $8.0 million. These shares were recorded at their fair value of $7.7 million. As a result, the premium of $0.3 million was allocated to the arrangement consideration and was, therefore,
recognized as license fee revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policies. Upon closing of our IPO, all shares of Junior A convertible preferred stock were automatically converted to shares of our common stock. </P>

December 2012 and February 2013, we issued an aggregate of $4.0 million principal amount of convertible promissory notes due August&nbsp;28, 2013. The notes bore interest at 8%&nbsp;per annum and included both optional and mandatory conversion
features. The optional conversion feature allowed each note holder, at any time prior to maturity, to elect to convert the balance of the note plus accrued interest into shares of our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock at a conversion price of
approximately $1.44 per share. The mandatory conversion feature of the notes provided that, if we issued or sold equity securities of not less than $10.0 million on or before the maturity date, the notes plus all accrued interest thereon would
automatically convert into shares of the issued class of equity securities at a price per share equal to 90% of the cash price paid by the investors in the new equity securities. </P>

notes. In August 2013, certain holders of notes elected to convert their notes in the aggregate amount of $3.9 million in principal plus accrued interest into 2,692,291 shares of Series D Preferred Stock. In October 2013, we repaid the remaining

amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheets and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We base our estimates on historical
experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time such estimates are made. Actual results and outcomes may differ materially from our estimates, judgments and assumptions. We
periodically review our estimates in light of changes in circumstances, facts and experience. The effects of material revisions in estimates are reflected in the financial statements prospectively from the date of the change in estimate. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We record revenue related to these agreements in accordance with Accounting Standards
Codification (&#147;ASC&#148;) 605-25, <I>Revenue Recognition Multiple-Element Arrangements</I>. In order to account for these agreements, we identify the deliverables included within an arrangement and evaluate which deliverables represent separate
units of accounting based on whether certain criteria are met, including whether the delivered element has stand-alone value to the counterparty. The consideration received is then allocated among the separate units of accounting based on each
unit&#146;s relative selling price. The identification of individual elements in a multiple-element arrangement and the estimation of the selling price of each element involves significant judgment, including consideration as to whether each
delivered element has standalone value. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We determine the estimated selling price for deliverables within each agreement using vendor
specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of selling price, if available, or third party evidence, or TPE, of selling price if VSOE is not available, or our best estimate of selling price, if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. Determining the best
estimate of selling price for a deliverable requires significant judgment. Because we do not have VSOE or TPE of selling price to determine the estimated selling price of a license to our proprietary technology, we typically uses our best estimate
of a selling price to estimate the selling prices for licenses to our proprietary technology. In making these estimates, we consider market conditions and entity-specific factors, including those contemplated in negotiating the agreements, as well
as internally developed estimates that include assumptions related to the market opportunity, estimated development costs, probability of success and the time needed to commercialize a product candidate pursuant to the license. In validating our
best estimate of selling price, we evaluate whether changes in the key assumptions used to determine our best estimate of selling price will have a significant effect on the allocation of arrangement consideration between deliverables. We recognize
consideration allocated to an individual element when all other revenue recognition criteria are met for that element. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Arrangement
consideration allocated to license deliverables that represent separate units of accounting are recognized as revenue at the outset of the agreement assuming the general criteria for revenue recognition noted above have been met. Arrangement
consideration allocated to license deliverables which do not represent separate units of accounting are deferred. We have determined that our license deliverables represent separate units of accounting because the counterparty has the right to
sublicense and manufacture in its territory, as defined. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Arrangement consideration allocated to research and development services which
represent separate units of accounting are recognized as the services are performed, assuming the general criteria for revenue recognition noted above have been met. We have determined that our research and developments services deliverables, as
applicable, represent separate units of accounting because similar services are sold separately by other vendors. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In connection with
arrangement consideration allocated to research and development services, our performance period estimates are principally based on projections of the scope, progress and results of our research and development activities. Due to the variability in
the scope of activities and length of time necessary to develop a drug product, changes to development plans as programs progress, and uncertainty in the ultimate requirements to obtain governmental approval for commercialization, revisions to
performance period estimates are likely to occur periodically, and could result in material changes to the amount of revenue recognized each year in the future. In addition, our estimated performance periods may change if development programs
encounter delays or we decide to expand or contract our clinical plans for a drug candidate. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our license agreements include contingent
milestone payments related to specified clinical development milestones and regulatory milestones. Development milestones are payable when a product candidate initiates or advances into different clinical trial phases. Regulatory milestones are
payable upon submission for marketing approval with the FDA or other countries&#146; regulatory authorities or on receipt of actual marketing approvals for the compound or for additional indications. At the inception of each agreement that includes
milestone payments, we evaluate whether each such payment is a milestone payment as defined by ASC 605-28, <I>Revenue Recognition&nbsp;&#150; Milestone Method</I>, because achievement requires performance by us and, at inception of the arrangement,
there is substantive uncertainty that the event will be achieved, or whether the payment is a contingent payment, because achievement requires performance by the counterparty. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If the payment meets the criteria of a milestone payment, we evaluate whether such milestone is
considered to be substantive. This evaluation includes an assessment of whether (a)&nbsp;the consideration is commensurate with either (1)&nbsp;the entity&#146;s performance to achieve the milestone, or (2)&nbsp;the enhancement of the value of the
delivered item(s) as a result of a specific outcome resulting from the entity&#146;s performance to achieve the milestone, (b)&nbsp;the consideration relates solely to past performance and (c)&nbsp;the consideration is reasonable relative to all of
the deliverables and payment terms within the arrangement. We evaluate factors such as the scientific, regulatory, commercial and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the respective milestone and the level of effort and investment required
to achieve the respective milestone in making this assessment. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We recognize substantive milestone payments as revenue upon the
achievement of the milestone, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met. If any milestone payment is considered not to be a substantive milestone or if considered to be a contingent payment, we initially defer the milestone payment,
allocate it to the deliverables based on relative selling price in the same proportion as at inception of the agreement, immediately recognize revenue to the extent of any delivered elements and recognize the portion attributable to any undelivered
elements over the remaining term of our performance obligations. If no such performance obligations exist, milestones that are considered not to be substantive or are considered to be contingent payments are generally recognized as revenue upon
achievement, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Royalty revenue is recognized when earned. To date, no royalties

payments to employees and non-employee directors, including grants of stock options, to be recognized in the Statements of Operations based on their grant date fair values. The grant date fair value of stock options is estimated using the

standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. We were
not engaged to perform an audit of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,

 <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Cara Therapeutics, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical corporation formed on July&nbsp;2,
2004. The Company is focused on developing and commercializing new chemical entities designed to alleviate pain and pruritus by selectively targeting kappa opioid receptors. The Company&#146;s primary activities to date have been organizing and
staffing the Company, developing its product candidates, including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials of CR845-based product candidates and raising capital. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company&#146;s registration statement on Form S-1 (File No 333-192230) relating to its initial public offering (&#147;IPO&#148;) was
declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on January&nbsp;30, 2014. The Company registered the offering and sale of 5,750,000 shares of common stock (including 750,000 shares upon exercise of an option by the underwriters) at a
public offering price of $11.00 per share for an aggregate offering price of $63,250. As a result of the IPO, the Company received net proceeds of $56,297 after deducting $6,953 of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses paid by
the Company. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Prior to the IPO, the Company raised several rounds of equity financing and issued debt, resulting in aggregate net proceeds
of approximately $73,309, including $7,642 in connection with a Stock Purchase Agreement, which the Company entered into with Maruishi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (&#147;Maruishi&#148;) in April 2013. In addition, in April&nbsp;2013, the Company
entered into a License Agreement with Maruishi, which added $15,000&nbsp;in cash (see Note&nbsp;11, <I>Collaborations</I>). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of
December&nbsp;31, 2014, the Company had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $52,663 and an accumulated deficit of $80,201. The Company has incurred substantial losses and negative cash flows from operations in nearly every fiscal period since

utilized methodologies in accordance with the framework of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Technical Practice Aid, <I>Valuation of Privately-Held Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation</I> (the &#147;Practice
Aid&#148;) to estimate the fair value of its common stock and convertible preferred stock at various reporting dates and in conjunction with various transactions. Each valuation included estimates and assumptions that required the Company&#146;s
judgment. These estimates included assumptions regarding future performance, including the probability of successful completion of preclinical studies and clinical trials and FDA approval of product candidates containing CR845, and the probability
and estimated time to complete financing and collaborative transactions. Significant changes to the key assumptions used in the valuations could have resulted in different fair values of common stock and convertible preferred stock at each valuation
date. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Revenue Recognition </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In general, the Company recognizes revenue when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; the
Company&#146;s price to the customer is fixed or determinable; collectability is reasonably assured and delivery has occurred or services have been rendered. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company has entered into license agreements to develop, manufacture and commercialize drug products. The terms of these agreements
typically contain multiple elements, including licenses and research and development services. Payments to the Company under these agreements may include nonrefundable license fees, payments for research activities, payments based upon the
achievement of certain milestones and royalties on any resulting net product sales. There are no performance, cancellation, termination or refund provisions in any of the arrangements that contain material financial consequences to the Company. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company records revenue related to these agreements in accordance with ASC 605-25, <I>Revenue Recognition Multiple-Element
Arrangements</I>. In order to account for these agreements, the Company identifies the deliverables included within an arrangement and evaluates which deliverables represent separate units of accounting based on whether certain criteria are met,
including whether the delivered element has stand-alone value to the counterparty. The consideration received is then allocated among the separate units of accounting based on each unit&#146;s relative selling price. The identification of individual
elements in a multiple-element arrangement and the estimation of the selling price of each element involves significant judgment, including evaluation as to whether each delivered element has standalone value. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company determines the estimated selling price for deliverables within each agreement using vendor specific objective evidence
(&#147;VSOE&#148;) of selling price, if available, or third party evidence (&#147;TPE&#148;) of selling price if VSOE is not available, or the Company&#146;s best estimate of selling price, if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. Determining the best
estimate of selling price for a deliverable requires significant judgment. Because the Company does not have VSOE or third party evidence of selling price to determine the estimated selling price of a license to its proprietary technology, it
typically uses its best estimate of a selling price to estimate the selling prices for licenses to its proprietary technology. In making these estimates, the Company considers market conditions and entity-specific factors, including those
contemplated in negotiating the agreements, as well as internally developed estimates that include assumptions related to the market opportunity, estimated development costs, probability of success and the time needed to commercialize a product
candidate pursuant to the license. In validating its best estimate of selling price, the Company evaluates whether changes in the key assumptions used to determine its best estimate of selling price will have a significant effect on the allocation
of arrangement consideration between deliverables. The Company recognizes consideration allocated to an individual element when all other revenue recognition criteria are met for that element. </P>

payments related to specified clinical development milestones and regulatory milestones. Development milestones are payable when a product candidate initiates or advances into different clinical trial phases. Regulatory milestones are payable upon
submission for marketing approval with the FDA or other countries&#146; regulatory authorities or on receipt of actual marketing approvals for the compound or for additional indications. At the inception of each agreement that includes milestone
payments, the Company evaluates whether each such payment is a milestone payment as defined by ASC 605-28, <I>Revenue Recognition&nbsp;&#150; Milestone Method</I>, because achievement requires performance by the Company and, at inception of the
arrangement, there is substantive uncertainty that the event will be achieved, or whether the payment is a contingent payment, because achievement requires performance by the counterparty. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If the payment meets the criteria of a milestone payment, the Company evaluates whether such milestone is considered to be substantive. This
evaluation includes an assessment of whether (a)&nbsp;the consideration is commensurate with either (1)&nbsp;the entity&#146;s performance to achieve the milestone, or (2)&nbsp;the enhancement of the value of the delivered item(s) as a result of a
specific outcome resulting from the entity&#146;s performance to achieve the milestone, (b)&nbsp;the consideration relates solely to past performance and (c)&nbsp;the consideration is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms
within the arrangement. The Company evaluates factors such as the scientific, regulatory, commercial and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the respective milestone and the level of effort and investment required to achieve the respective
milestone in making this assessment. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company recognizes substantive milestone payments as revenue upon the achievement of the
milestone, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met. If any milestone payment is considered not to be a substantive milestone or is considered to be a contingent payment, the Company initially defers the milestone payment, allocates
it to the deliverables based on relative selling price in the same proportion as at inception of the agreement, immediately recognizes revenue to the extent of any delivered elements and recognizes the portion attributable to any undelivered
elements over the remaining term of its performance obligations. If no such performance obligations exist, milestones that are considered not to be substantive or are considered to be contingent payments are generally recognized as revenue upon
achievement, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Royalty revenue is recognized when earned. To date, no royalties

based upon historical data of awards that were cancelled prior to vesting. The Company adjusts the total amount of compensation cost recognized for each award, in the period in which each award vests, to reflect the actual forfeitures related to
that award. To the extent that the actual forfeiture rate for an award is lower than the estimated forfeiture rate, additional compensation expense is recorded in the period that the award vests. Changes in the Company&#146;s estimated forfeiture

assuming the exercise of those renewal options that are reasonably assured because of the significant economic penalty that exists for not exercising those options. The exercise of renewal options is at the Company&#146;s sole discretion. The
expected lease term is one of the factors used to determine whether a lease is classified operating or capital and is used to calculate the straight-line rent expense. The difference between the cash paid to the landlord and the amount recognized as
rent expense on a straight-line basis is included in deferred rent and classified within long-term liabilities. Cash reimbursements received from landlords for leasehold improvements and other cash payments received from landlords as lease
incentives are recorded as deferred rent and classified as long-term liabilities. Deferred rent related to landlord incentives is amortized using the straight-line method over the lease term as an offset to rent expense. Penalties paid to landlords

contract(s) with a customer; (2)&nbsp;identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3)&nbsp;determine the transaction price; (4)&nbsp;allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and (5)&nbsp;recognize
revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. ASU 2014-09 is effective for the Company for annual reporting periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period (i.e.,
January&nbsp;1, 2017). Early application is not permitted. The Company is allowed to adopt ASU 2014-09 either (1)&nbsp;retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented using several practical expedients related to completed contracts and
required disclosures, or (2)&nbsp;retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying ASU 2014-09 recognized at the date of initial application, including disclosure of the effect of using this method of adoption on the financial
statement line items. The Company is currently in the process of deciding which method of adoption it will use and the effect of adoption of ASU 2014-09 on its results of operations, financial position and cash flows. </P>

205-40), Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity&#146;s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern </I>(&#147;ASU 2014-15&#148;). ASU 2014-15 codifies, for the first time within GAAP, management&#146;s responsibility to evaluate whether there is
substantial doubt about the Company&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures in connection with preparing financial statements for each annual and interim reporting period. Substantial doubt about the
Company&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern exists when there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that are known and reasonably knowable at the date that the financial statements are issued, that indicate that the
Company will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after that date. ASU 2014-15 requires the Company to disclose the nature of those conditions or events when they are present, management&#146;s plans to mitigate those
conditions or events and whether or not such plans alleviated the substantial doubt. ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after December&nbsp;15, 2016, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2016.
Early application is permitted. Prior to adoption of ASU 2014-15, the Company evaluated the need to disclose its ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time based on projections of its ability to meet its obligations as
they become due within a period of one year from the balance sheet date. Upon adoption of ASU 2014-15, that period will be extended to include one year from the date the financial statements are issued and the Company will be required to make the
applicable disclosures in its financial statements. The Company does not expect that the adoption of ASU 2014-15 will have a material effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. </P>

Conversion and Other Options</I>, the Company determined that the intrinsic value of the beneficial conversion feature embedded in the Notes issued in the initial closing was $2,050, based on the estimated fair value of the Series D convertible
preferred stock as of December&nbsp;31, 2012 of $2.61 per share, and this intrinsic value was recorded as a debt discount, to be accreted to interest expense over the term of the Notes. As of December&nbsp;31, 2012, the Company amortized $25 of debt
discount to interest expense. As of February&nbsp;28, 2013, the final closing of the Note financing, the Company determined that the intrinsic value of the beneficial conversion feature of the Notes issued in the final closing was $1,382 and
recorded this amount as an additional debt discount. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013, the Company amortized $3,407 of debt discount to interest expense. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The mandatory conversion of the Notes would have occurred in the event the Company issued or sold equity securities on or before
August&nbsp;28, 2013 of not less than $10,000. In this event, the Notes plus all accrued interest would have automatically converted into the issued class of equity securities at a price per share equal to 90% of the cash price paid by the investors
in the new equity securities. In accordance with ASC 815-15, <I>Derivatives and Hedging</I>, the Company was required to record the embedded mandatory conversion feature as a free-standing financial instrument, as the conversion feature was a
substantial contingent call option. The Company recorded $41 as the fair value of the contingent call option liability related to the Notes issued in the initial closing of the Note financing as of December&nbsp;31, 2012, with a corresponding amount
recorded as additional debt discount, with the debt discount to be accreted to interest expense over the life of the Notes. Any increases or decreases to the fair value of the contingent call option would be recorded in operations through the life
of the Notes. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company estimated the fair value of the contingent call option by estimating the accreted value of the Notes upon
conversion, with consideration provided for the 10% price discount and the probability of the Company closing an equity offering in excess of $10,000 before August&nbsp;28, 2013. The Company classified the liability within Level 3 of the fair value
hierarchy as the probability factor is an unobservable input and significant to the valuation model. Increases in the probability of an equity offering closing before August&nbsp;28, 2013 in excess of $10,000 would increase the fair value of the
liability. In April 2013, the estimated fair value of the contingent call option of $41 was reduced to zero with an equal reduction in interest expense, since the Company estimated the probability of closing a $10,000 equity offering before
August&nbsp;28, 2013 as zero, following the receipt of $23,000 in connection with the Maruishi transaction in April 2013, which removed the need for a $10,000 financing prior to August&nbsp;28, 2013. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In September&nbsp;2007, the Company entered into a $4,000 term loan (&#147;Loan&#148;) with Connecticut Innovations Inc.
(&#147;CII&#148;). The Loan carried a 7% interest rate and was payable in monthly installments over five years. The Loan was collateralized by property and equipment which was owned by the Company that was located in Shelton, Connecticut. The CII
Loan contained certain non-financial covenants, including the requirement that the Company maintain its principal place of business and conduct the majority of its operations in Connecticut. If the Company failed to maintain its Connecticut
presence, all amounts due under the Loan would be immediately due and payable with the cumulative interest rate increasing to 25%. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On
September&nbsp;4, 2012, the Company and CII amended the Loan to defer all payments due between July&nbsp;1, 2012 and December&nbsp;31, 2012 until January&nbsp;2, 2013 and to increase the interest rate to 8.5%. The Company repaid the remaining
principal balance of $307 plus accrued interest outstanding under the Loan in April&nbsp;2013. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In connection with the Loan, the Company
issued to CII a warrant to purchase 19,851 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $10.08. The fair value of such warrant at the date of issuance was determined not to be material. The warrant also incorporated the non-financial covenants of
the Loan described above. If the Company failed to maintain its Connecticut presence, it would be required to pay CII the excess of the market price of the common stock over the warrant exercise price for all unexercised shares represented by the
warrant and/or the exercise price paid plus the market price on any shares acquired through a previous exercise of the warrants. On July&nbsp;31, 2014, CII exercised its outstanding warrant in a cashless exercise, resulting in the issuance of 6,383
shares of the Company&#146;s common stock. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In April 2013, the Company entered into a license agreement with Maruishi under which the Company granted Maruishi an exclusive license to
develop, manufacture, and commercialize products containing CR845 for acute pain and uremic pruritus in Japan. The Company and Maruishi are each responsible to use commercially reasonable efforts, at its expense, to develop, obtain regulatory
approval for and commercialize CR845 in the United States and Japan, respectively. In addition, the Company will provide Maruishi specific clinical development services for CR845 used in Maruishi&#146;s field of use. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the terms of the agreement, the Company received an upfront non-refundable, non-creditable license fee of $15,000. As indicated in Note
2,<I> Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#150; Revenue Recognition</I>, the Company accounts for arrangements of this type under ASC 605-25, <I>Revenue Recognition&#151;Multiple Element Arrangements.</I> The Company has identified two
deliverables under this guidance: (1)&nbsp;the license; and (2)&nbsp;the R&amp;D services specific to the uremic pruritus field of use. The Company has determined that the license has standalone value because Maruishi has the right to sublicense and
manufacture CR845 in Japan. The second deliverable is the R&amp;D services, which also have standalone value as similar services are sold separately by other vendors. Since both license and R&amp;D services separability criteria have been met, they
are being accounted for as separate units of accounting at the outset of the arrangement. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As a result, the total value of the arrangement
of $15,337 (consisting of the $15,000 upfront payment, plus the additional amount assigned to these deliverables as a result of the Junior A Preferred Stock premium, see below) was allocated between the two units of accounting. The Company used its
best estimate of the selling price of these units of accounting, since, as described in Note 2<I> Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#150; Revenue Recognition</I>, neither VSOE nor TPE was available. To determine these estimates, the
Company used a discounted cash flow method that forecasted and analyzed CR845 in the Japanese market, the phase of clinical development as well as considering recent similar license arrangements within the same phase of clinical

development, therapeutic area, type of agreement, etc. As a result, at inception of this license agreement, the management of the Company determined that the license and the R&amp;D services had
estimated selling prices of $10,200 and $6,200, respectively. The resulting percentage allocations were applied to the $15,337 of total consideration, which resulted in $9,637 being assigned to the license unit of accounting, which was recognized
immediately as license revenue, while $5,700 was assigned to the R&amp;D services unit of accounting. The amount assigned to the R&amp;D services unit of accounting was initially recorded as deferred revenue and is being recognized as revenue as the
services are provided. Upon achievement of a milestone by Maruishi during June 2014, the Company deferred a portion of the milestone payment (see below). </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company is also entitled to receive aggregate milestone payments of $8,000 for events performed by Maruishi in Japan and $2,500 for events
performed by the Company in the U.S. The Company accounts for any future milestone payments under ASC 605-28 <I>Revenue Recognition &#150; Milestone Method</I> (see Note 2,<I> Summary of Significant Accounting Policies</I>). At the time of execution
of this license agreement, there was significant uncertainty as to whether the stated milestones would be achieved. In conjunction with this uncertainty, the Company has determined that the milestones achieved in the U.S. are substantive in nature
as they are commensurate with the enhancement of value of the delivered license as they relate to clinical success and advancement within the FDA drug development platform. However, the milestones achieved by Maruishi in Japan are not substantive
and will be accounted for as contingent consideration. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">During June 2014, Maruishi completed a Phase 1 clinical trial in Japan related to
CR845 in acute post-operative pain, which constituted achievement of one of the milestones specified in the license agreement. As the milestone was considered not to be substantive, the payment was accounted for as contingent consideration.
Accordingly, the Company allocated the non-refundable contingent payment of $480, net of a contractual foreign currency exchange adjustment, to the two deliverables in the same proportion as the initial upfront payment had been allocated. The
portion of the contingent payment allocated to the previously delivered license deliverable ($302) was recognized as license revenue entirely at the time of achievement of the milestone. A portion of the contingent payment allocated to the R&amp;D
services deliverable ($88) was recognized as collaborative revenue at the time of achievement of the milestone to the extent of R&amp;D services provided through that date&nbsp;and the remainder ($90) was deferred and is being recognized as
collaborative revenue through the period during which the Company provides R&amp;D services to Maruishi. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The next potential milestone
that the Company could be entitled to receive under the Maruishi license agreement will be a clinical development milestone for the initiation of a Phase 1 clinical trial in Japan for a certain indication. If achieved, this milestone will result in
a $2,000 payment being due to the Company. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Along with the R&amp;D services performed by the Company for Maruishi, the Company supplies
Maruishi with CR845 clinical material as an accommodation. The Company had previously entered into manufacturing and service agreements with third parties to manufacture CR845. Payments made by the Company to third parties based on firm and fixed
commitments by Maruishi to purchase CR845 from the Company are capitalized as prepaid expense. During the manufacturing process, title and risk of loss remains with the third party until the Company has paid in full for the material. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Once the Company has title to the CR845 and has delivered it to Maruishi, prepaid expense related to that CR845 is reduced with an offset to
R&amp;D expense. At that time, Maruishi reimburses the Company for its external and internal costs for purchasing CR845 and processing the sale to Maruishi and the Company recognizes clinical compound revenue for the reimbursement amount. Deposits
received from Maruishi prior to delivery of CR845 are recorded as deferred revenue. </P>

federal credits will begin expiring in 2025 unless previously utilized. The Connecticut credit carryforwards have no expiration period. Because of the net operating loss and research credit carryforwards, tax years 2007 through 2014 remain open to

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Upon an exit event, including an IPO or as otherwise defined in the Glasgow License
Agreement, Glasgow had the option to require the Company to guarantee a return of $1,000 on its 200,000 shares of common stock. If the proceeds from the exit event resulted in a return of less than $1,000, the Company was required to make an
additional license payment by giving Glasgow cash or through the issuance of additional shares (at the Company&#146;s option), as specified in the Glasgow License Agreement. In accordance with ASC 480, <I>Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity</I>,
the Company initially recorded the fair value of this option as both a long-term liability and research and development expense. The Company estimated the fair value of the option using the Black-Scholes option valuation model with consideration
given to the probability of an exit event occurring below the guaranteed amount. The fair value of the liability was estimated at each subsequent balance sheet date, with any increases or decreases to the fair value recorded as increases or
decreases to research and development expense and the related liability. As of December&nbsp;31, 2013, the estimated fair value of the liability was reduced to zero based on the Company&#146;s estimated fair value of common stock after the Maruishi
transaction (see Note 11,<I> Collaborations</I>). The Company classified the liability within Level 3 as the probability factor is an unobservable input and significant to the valuation model. The Company used a probability factor of 10% in all
periods from 2005 to 2013. The probability rate was based on the successful progress of the Company&#146;s product candidates containing CR845 and the Company&#146;s expectation of an exit event value below the guaranteed amount. An increase in the
probability rate would have resulted in a higher liability while an increase in the stock price would have reduced the liability. The decrease in the value of the liability of $35 in 2013 was the result of changes in the observable inputs (i.e.
stock value, interest rates and volatility) and was recorded in research and development expense. The closing of the Company&#146;s IPO on February&nbsp;5, 2014 constituted an exit event under the Glasgow License Agreement. Since the public offering
price in the IPO was $11.00 per share, the aggregate exit event value was greater than the guaranteed amount. Consequently, as of December&nbsp;31, 2014, the Company no longer has a liability under the Glasgow License Agreement. </P>

</TABLE> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013, the Company used the two-class method to calculate income (loss)
per share (refer to Note 2 &#150; <I>Significant Accounting Policies &#150; Income (Loss) per Share</I>). During the second quarter of the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013, the Company recorded net income, although for the full year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2013, the Company recorded net loss. For purposes of calculating basic net income per share for the second quarter, the Company excluded from the numerator $3,869 of net income attributable to participating securities. For purposes
of calculating diluted earnings per share, such amount was included in the numerator together with interest on convertible promissory notes. Common shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options, assumed conversion of convertible
preferred stock and convertible promissory notes were included in the denominator on an as-if converted basis. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">However, net loss for the
full year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013 was not allocated to preferred stockholders because they are not obligated to participate in the Company&#146;s net losses. Diluted loss per share excluded common shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding
stock options, assumed conversion of convertible preferred stock and convertible promissory notes because they were anti-dilutive. Consequently, the sum of net (loss) income and net (loss) income per share for the quarters in the table above do not
equal those measures for the full year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013. </P>
