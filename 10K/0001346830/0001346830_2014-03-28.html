biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing new chemical entities designed to alleviate pain by selectively targeting kappa opioid receptors. We are developing a novel and proprietary class of product candidates that target
the body&#146;s peripheral nervous system and have demonstrated efficacy in patients with moderate-to-severe pain without inducing many of the undesirable side effects typically associated with currently available pain therapeutics. Our most
advanced product candidate, intravenous, or I.V., CR845, has demonstrated significant pain relief and a favorable safety and tolerability profile in three Phase 2 clinical trials in patients with acute postoperative pain. We plan to request an End
of Phase 2 Meeting with the FDA in the second half of 2014 and begin Phase 3 registration trials for I.V. CR845 in the second half of 2014. We are also developing an oral version of CR845, or Oral CR845, for acute and chronic pain, for which we have
successfully completed a Phase 1 clinical trial to demonstrate the ability to deliver CR845 orally. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We commenced operations in 2004, and
our primary activities to date have been organizing and staffing our company, developing our product candidates, including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials of CR845-based product candidates and raising capital. To date, we have
financed our operations primarily through sales of our equity and debt securities and payments from license agreements. We have no products currently available for sale, and substantially all of our revenue to date has been revenue from license
agreements, although we have received nominal amounts of revenue under research grants. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On January&nbsp;30, 2014, our registration statement on Form S-1 (File No 333-192230) was
declared effective for our initial public offering (&#147;IPO&#148;), pursuant to which we registered the offering and sale of 5,750,000 shares of common stock (including 750,000 shares upon exercise of an option by the underwriters) at a public
offering price of $11.00 per share for an aggregate offering price of $63.3 million. As a result of the IPO, we received net proceeds on February&nbsp;5, 2014 of approximately $55.9 million from the sale of 5,750,000 shares of common stock, after
deducting $7.4 million of underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">According to IMS Health,
an independent market research firm, the total U.S. market for pain management pharmaceuticals totaled $18.2 billion in 2012. The prescription pain management market in the United States is dominated by opioid analgesics, which, according to IMS
Health data, represented 71% of the 341&nbsp;million analgesic prescriptions written in 2012 and accounted for sales of $8.3 billion in that year. Opioid analgesics decrease the perception of pain by stimulating mu, delta and/or kappa opioid
receptors. All of these receptors are involved in modulating pain signals. The most widely used opioid analgesics, including morphine, fentanyl and hydromorphone, act primarily through the activation of mu opioid receptors in the central nervous
system, or CNS. However, because of the wide distribution of mu opioid receptors throughout the brain, morphine and other mu opioid analgesics also trigger a characteristic pattern of adverse &#147;central&#148; side effects, including nausea and
vomiting, itching and respiratory depression. Mu opioids are also known to cause euphoria, which can lead to misuse, abuse and addiction issues. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our new chemical entity, CR845, is designed to produce pain relief by specifically stimulating kappa, rather than mu, opioid receptors.
Moreover, we have designed CR845 with specific chemical characteristics to restrict its entry into the CNS and further limit CR845&#146;s mechanism of action to kappa opioid receptors in the peripheral nervous system, which consists of the nerves
outside the brain and spinal cord. In addition to the side effects associated with activation of mu opioid receptors in the CNS, activation of kappa receptors in the CNS is also known to result in side effects, including acute psychiatric disorders.
Since CR845 is designed to modulate pain signals without activation of mu or kappa opioid receptors in the CNS, it is not expected to produce the psychiatric side effects of centrally-active prior kappa opioids or the CNS related side effects of mu
opioids. Based on the clinical trials and preclinical studies we have completed to date, we believe that product candidates based on CR845, if approved, will be attractive to both patients and physicians as a treatment for moderate-to-severe pain
because of their ability to provide pain relief while significantly reducing the incidence of opioid-related adverse events or abuse and addiction issues associated with currently approved mu opioid analgesics. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our most advanced product candidate is an I.V. version of CR845 intended for the treatment of acute pain in a hospital setting. I.V. CR845 has
been well tolerated and demonstrated consistent efficacy in three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trials. Two of these trials were in patients undergoing a laparoscopic hysterectomy, a soft tissue surgical procedure,
and a third trial was in patients undergoing a bunionectomy, a hard tissue surgical procedure. I.V. CR845 administration resulted in statistically significant reductions in pain intensity, as measured by the sum of pain intensity difference, or
SPID, the FDA-recommended endpoint. In addition, in both surgical models, I.V. CR845 exhibited an ability to decrease the opioid-related adverse events, or AEs, of nausea and vomiting associated with current therapies with no evidence of
drug-related respiratory depression. According to research conducted at Duke University, post-operative AEs associated with currently approved opioids, such as nausea and vomiting, increase the length of time that a patient spends in the hospital

electrolyte loss, otherwise known as aquaresis, was also observed, which in some subjects was accompanied by asymptomatic elevations in plasma sodium that were generally considered to be
clinically unimportant. No clinically significant changes in electrocardiogram characteristics have been observed in any of these studies. Importantly, there appeared to be no cases of the characteristic CNS-related adverse events, such as acute
psychiatric side effects, typically observed with prior-generation CNS-active kappa agonists. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition to I.V. CR845, we are also
developing an oral formulation of CR845 that we believe could be used to provide pain relief to patients with acute or chronic pain in an outpatient setting and also as an I.V.-to-oral transition, or step-down, therapy for hospital patients being
prepared for discharge. We have successfully completed a Phase 1 trial of an oral capsule formulation of CR845 to establish oral bioavailability parameters and anticipate commencing additional Phase 1 clinical trials with an oral tablet formulation
of CR845 in the first half of 2014. We are also developing a peripherally-acting cannabinioid receptor agonist, CR701, which has demonstrated potent activity in preclinical models of inflammatory and neuropathic pain without producing CNS-related
side effects. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">CR845 and CR701 were discovered by our scientists. We own six U.S. patents with claims covering compositions of matter and
methods of use for CR845. The earliest U.S. patent claiming CR845 compositions will expire no earlier than November&nbsp;12, 2027. We also own two issued U.S. patents that cover the compound CR701, CR701 as a member of a class of related compounds
and methods of using these compounds. These U.S. patents are due to expire no earlier than June&nbsp;20, 2028. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We anticipate developing a
distribution capability and commercial organization in the United States to market and sell our I.V. product candidates in the hospital setting, while out-licensing commercialization rights in certain geographical territories outside of the United
States. For Oral CR845, we plan to explore late-stage development and commercialization partnerships both in the United States and worldwide. We have entered into collaboration agreements for both I.V. and Oral CR845 with Maruishi Pharmaceuticals in
Japan and Chong Kun Dang Pharmaceutical Corp. in South Korea, which provide them the exclusive right to develop and market CR845 for certain indications within those territories. As of December&nbsp;31, 2013, we had received approximately $24

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Pain is generally categorized by its duration as either acute or chronic, by its severity, as mild, moderate or severe, and its type and/or
causality, such as postoperative or neuropathic. Acute pain is typically caused by an injury resulting in nerve, tissue or bone damage and is expected to subside in severity when the injury heals. Postoperative pain is a subset of the acute pain
market. Chronic pain, on the other hand, is prolonged, and can be the long-term result of an acute injury or an ongoing disease condition, such as neuropathic pain associated with diabetes. According to a recent Institute of Medicine report, chronic
pain affects approximately 100&nbsp;million U.S. adults, while millions of others experience acute pain caused by events such as surgery, injury, childbirth and </P>

illness. According to IMS Health, the total U.S. market for pain management pharmaceuticals was $18.2 billion in 2012. In 2011, according to Decision Resources, an independent industry research
company, total sales for pain therapies in the seven major pharmaceutical markets, which include the United States, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom and Japan, exceeded $37 billion. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The severity of pain is the key factor in determining the appropriate therapy. Mild or mild-to-moderate pain is generally treated with OTC
products, such as stand-alone oral formulations of aspirin, acetaminophen and ibuprofen. Moderate-to-severe pain, on the other hand, is typically treated with products containing traditional mu opioids. Mu opioid analgesics are effective to some
degree for many patients, but have a poor side effect and abuse liability profile, which limits or precludes their use in treating less severe pain. For many people with moderate-to-severe pain, opioid analgesics are the only effective method of
treating pain. As a result, these opioid analgesics are among the largest prescription drug classes in the United States. According to IMS Health, opioid analgesics represented approximately 71% of the nearly 341&nbsp;million analgesic prescriptions
written in 2012, accounting for $8.3 billion in sales. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Postoperative Pain Market </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Postoperative pain represents a substantial part of the overall acute pain market. According to the International Association for the Study of
Pain, more than 46&nbsp;million inpatient and 53&nbsp;million outpatient surgeries are performed annually in the United States. Moderate-to-severe pain in a hospital or other medical setting is most often treated with injectable analgesics. The U.S.
I.V./injectable analgesic therapy market primarily consists of mu opioid agonists, such as morphine, hydromorphone and fentanyl, and certain non-opioid analgesics, such as Toradol (and related generic I.V. ketorolac products), Caldolor (I.V.
ibuprofen), and Ofirmev (I.V. acetaminophen). According to GBI Research, a research organization, the postoperative pain relief market, with sales of $5.9 billion in 2010, accounted for approximately 20% of the total pain management therapeutics
market. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">According to recently updated Practice Guidelines developed by the American Society of Anesthesiologists, the standard of care
for treating acute postoperative pain is multimodal analgesia, which includes the administration of two or more drugs that act by different mechanisms for providing analgesia in a manner that will minimize the occurrence of adverse events. When
patients are ready for discharge, a transition is typically made to a prescription oral pain medication, allowing patients to self-administer relatively strong analgesics after being discharged home. This transition from an I.V. pain medication to
an oral pain medication is commonly referred to as I.V.-to-oral &#147;step-down&#148; therapy. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Strong mu opioid analgesics, such as
morphine, fentanyl, and hydromorphone, are mainstays of pain treatment in the immediate postoperative period, and are used as part of a multimodal analgesic approach. However, the use of strong mu opioid analgesics is associated with an array of
unwanted and serious side effects, including postoperative opioid-induced respiratory depression, or POIRD, postoperative nausea and vomiting, or PONV, and opioid-induced bowel dysfunction, or OBD, which contributes to the severity of postoperative
ileus, or POI. According to Anesthesiology News<I>, </I>a trade journal, the incidence of POIRD may be as high as 29%, can occur unexpectedly in even the healthiest of patients, and exerts a disproportionately high toll on length of stay and
hospital costs due to the significant expenses associated with the treatment of POIRD. According to an article published in Best Practice&nbsp;&amp; Research Clinical Anaesthesiology, a trade journal, PONV occurs in approximately one-third of
surgical patients overall, and is one of the most important factors in determining length of stay after surgery, resulting in estimated annual costs in the U.S. in the range of $1 billion. These mu opioid-related adverse events not only
significantly increase the cost of care, but also reduce a patient&#146;s quality of care and lead to sub-optimal recovery. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Nonopioid
analgesics formulated for injection or infusion, including I.V. acetaminophen and NSAIDs, such as I.V. ibuprofen, are available as alternatives to mu opioids to relieve acute pain, but their use is limited in a postoperative care setting as a result
of their limited efficacy. I.V. acetaminophen and NSAIDs also have side effects that limit their use at higher, more efficacious doses. Acetaminophen is associated with risk of liver </P>

toxicity, which can be fatal, and NSAIDs are associated with risks of bleeding, serious gastrointestinal side effects including ulcers, kidney damage, and serious cardiovascular thrombotic events
such as stroke and heart attack, which can be fatal. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Chronic Pain Market </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The most common causes of moderate-to-severe chronic pain are musculoskeletal problems and inflammatory conditions. Injuries from accidents
resulting in fractures, dislocations or soft tissue injury, as well as lower back pain, are the most frequent causes of musculoskeletal pain. Although these injuries are mostly non-fatal, the cost in terms of long-term disability, medical expense
and lost productivity is large. Moderate-to-severe chronic pain is typically treated with prescription products including immediate release and long-acting opioids, such as the branded products Oxycontin (oxycodone) and Opana (oxymorphone), and
combination products that include an opioid combined with an NSAID or acetaminophen, such as the branded products Vicodin (hydrocodone and acetaminophen) and Percocet (oxycodone and acetaminophen). Prescription products for chronic pain are usually
in oral tablet or capsule form because the vast majority of these patients are taking these medications outside of the hospital setting. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On April&nbsp;7, 2005, the FDA announced a decision to require boxed warnings of potential cardiovascular risk for all NSAIDs. The 2005 FDA
warning related to cardiovascular adverse events associated with NSAIDs and the increased awareness of the risk of liver toxicity associated with high doses of acetaminophen have led to increased use of mu opioid analgesics for the treatment of
chronic pain. However, the use of mu opioid analgesics carries significant additional risks. Chronic opioid use causes patients to develop tolerance for the opioid, which results in the patient needing increasing opioid doses to achieve the same
level of pain relief. For the most commonly prescribed analgesic combination products, the need for increasing doses to achieve the same level of pain relief means exposure to increasing amounts of NSAIDs or acetaminophen, which carry the risks
attendant to these therapeutics. Moreover, due to their CNS activity, mu opioids produce feelings of euphoria, which can give rise to abuse and addiction. Underlining the severity of this issue, in September 2013, the FDA announced class-wide safety
labeling changes and new post-market study requirements for all extended-release and long-acting mu opioid analgesics intended to treat pain. In support of this action, the FDA Commissioner stated that &#147;[t]he FDA is invoking its authority to
require safety labeling changes and post-market studies to combat the crisis of misuse, abuse, addiction, overdose, and death from these potent drugs that have harmed too many patients and devastated too many families and communities.&#148; In
addition, as a result of their potential for misuse, abuse and addiction, currently approved mu opioids are strictly regulated by the United States Drug Enforcement Agency, or DEA, under the Controlled Substances Act, which imposes strict
registration, record keeping and reporting requirements, security control and restrictions on prescriptions &#150; all of which significantly increase the costs and the liability attendant to prescription opioid analgesics. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>The Unmet Need in Pain Management </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Despite the size of the pain management market, there has been little innovation in the development of new analgesics, with nearly all recent
new drug approvals limited to reformulations and improved methods of delivery of existing therapeutics. Mu opioids continue to be the most prescribed drugs for pain management, despite their side effects and the potential for misuse, abuse and
addiction. These concerns often cause healthcare providers to administer or prescribe less than optimal doses of mu opioids, or patients to take lower than prescribed doses, resulting in inadequate pain relief. Consequently, we believe that the pain
market represents a therapeutic area with substantial unmet needs for patients in pain, for physicians who must balance pain control with risks of causing severe adverse events, and for healthcare organizations that bear the costs of managing the
consequences of undertreated pain and drug-related adverse events. We believe that CR845, with its novel mechanism of action, will be attractive to patients and physicians, as well as hospitals and payors, as a treatment for moderate-to-severe pain
because of its ability to provide pain relief without opioid-related adverse events or abuse and addiction issues associated with currently approved mu opioid analgesics. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe the ability of I.V. CR845 to reduce nausea and vomiting despite not meaningfully
reducing fentanyl usage is due to a direct anti-vomiting or anti-nausea effect resulting from its kappa opioid agonist mechanism of action. We believe that the ability to provide postsurgical analgesia and simultaneously reduce opioid-related side
effects will make I.V. CR845 an attractive treatment option for postoperative patients and their physicians. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In this bunionectomy trial,
repeated intravenous administration of I.V. CR845 at a dose of 0.005 mg/kg was safe and generally well tolerated. The most frequent TEAEs (greater than 10%) observed in the CR845 treatment group were transient facial tingling and somnolence, a state
of near-sleep. Of the seven cases of somnolence reported, the clinical trial&#146;s investigator reported four as &#147;mild&#148; and/or &#147;related to drug&#148; and three as &#147;moderate&#148; and/or &#147;not related to drug&#148;. The mean
plasma sodium concentration in CR845-treated patients exhibited an approximately 3% rise over 24 hours from baseline levels, but was not outside the normal physiological range at either 24 or 48 hours post-CR845 administration. This lack of
clinically significant hypernatremia was likely a result of both utilizing a lower dose of I.V. CR845 and replacing transient fluid loss with oral water or sodium-free intravenous fluid. In addition, consistent with our prior studies, there was no
evidence of acute psychiatric side effects that were observed with prior-generation CNS-active kappa opioid agonists. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Phase 2a
Laparoscopic Hysterectomy (CLIN2001) </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our <I>CLIN2001</I> trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, proof-of-concept
trial to evaluate the analgesic efficacy and safety of I.V. CR845 during the postoperative period in 114 patients undergoing laparoscopic hysterectomy. In the first of two cohorts, two single doses of I.V. CR845 (0.008 mg/kg and 0.024 mg/kg) were
evaluated versus placebo in 68 patients who were maintained on patient-controlled analgesia, or PCA, morphine for 24 hours after surgery prior to randomization to receive treatment with CR845 or placebo. However, more than 50% of the patients (CR845
and placebo) in this cohort did not request any rescue medication before at least 4 hours after randomization and 30% of placebo patients required no narcotic for 24 hours after randomization. Therefore, it was concluded that the magnitude of pain
the day after surgery appeared to be insufficient to allow separation between treatment groups and no clinical conclusions regarding the efficacy of I.V. CR845 could be made from this cohort. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the second cohort, 46 patients were administered a single dose of I.V. CR845 (0.04 mg/kg) or placebo within three hours following recovery
from surgery. In this group, CR845-treated patients exhibited statistically significant reductions in pain intensity up to six hours post-infusion versus placebo (p<FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:SYMBOL">&#163;</FONT>0.05). Moreover, PCA morphine use was
approximately 49% lower in the CR845-treated group compared to placebo starting at four&nbsp;hours post-infusion and lasting through an additional 12 hours (p<FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:SYMBOL">&#163;</FONT>0.01) with a concomitant reduction in nausea
and vomiting. The results for this proof-of-concept trial indicated that CR845 treatment could reduce pain intensity and morphine consumption post-surgery and informed the study timeline and design of the larger Phase 2 clinical trial
(<I>CLIN2002</I>) described above. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In this Phase 2a Laparoscopic Hysterectomy clinical trial, administration of all three doses of I.V.
CR845 was considered safe and generally well tolerated. Most of the TEAEs were comparable across groups, mild to moderate in severity, and nearly all were considered by the investigators to be unrelated, or to have an unlikely relationship, to study
treatment. Transient facial tingling was the primary TEAE reported in CR845-treated groups in Cohort 1. Other AEs occurring in more than 10% in any group included headache, flatulence, nausea, pyrexia, urinary tract infection, dizziness and
pruritus, most of which occurred in only one or two subjects per group. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>CR845 Phase 1 Clinical Trials and Pre-clinical Studies

blood pressure, resolved without intervention, and was classified as mild by the Investigator. We have demonstrated that this elevation in heart rate was a physiological consequence of the
subject&#146;s fluid deficit rather than a direct effect of the drug. No other changes in vital signs, including supine pulse rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, oral body temperature, or oxygen saturation were reported, nor were any clinically
significant changes observed in electrocardiogram characteristics. In addition, the CNS adverse events characteristic of prior-generation CNS-active kappa agonists, such as acute psychiatric side effects, were not observed with CR845. The potential
to cause sedation was assessed using the Ramsey Sedation Scale in the ascending dose-tolerance Phase 1 trial (Study 2048-001) of I.V. CR845, which included 54 subjects (17&nbsp;on placebo; 37 on CR845). CR845 was considered to not cause sedation in
this population of normal, healthy subjects in this trial. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A significant amount of preclinical work has been completed for CR845 in order
to further define its characteristics. In standard preclinical pain models, CR845 attenuated acute and chronic visceral, inflammatory and neuropathic pain in a dose-dependent manner (see Table 1 below). The analgesic effect of CR845 was recordable
within 15 minutes post-administration and lasted for up to 18 hours following single-dose administration. CR845 also decreased the production and release of pro-inflammatory mediators, which we believe is likely due to the direct activation of kappa
opioid receptors expressed on immune cells that synthesize and secrete these substances. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Table 1: CR845 Exhibits a Broad Spectrum of Activity in Multiple

</TABLE> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The peripheral mechanism of action of CR845 has been supported preclinically by both biochemical measurement
and functional pharmacological studies. In pharmacokinetic studies, animals administered analgesic and supra-analgesic doses of CR845 exhibited no measurable concentrations of drug in extracted brain tissue indicating that the CNS was not the site
of action for CR845. Moreover, in standard preclinical pain models, such as the &#147;Chung Model&#148; of neuropathic pain, our scientists confirmed that the analgesic action of CR845 can be blocked with kappa opioid receptor antagonists
administered directly to the local site of injury, indicating a peripheral site of action for CR845 (Figure 10 below). In the &#147;Chung Model&#148;, neuropathic pain is induced experimentally by ligating spinal nerves mediating sensation for a
hind limb. This results in a type of neuropathic pain, referred to as allodynia. Experimental animals with allodynia exhibit a &#147;paw withdrawal reflex&#148; upon contact with a relatively thin filament on the injured site. Sets of different
thickness filaments are used to test sensitivity, each of which is designed to produce a given force (in grams) upon bending after contact. By testing with these filaments, the minimum force to evoke a withdrawal response defines the paw withdrawal
threshold. The nerve injury produces a marked reduction in paw withdrawal thresholds (increased sensitivity to force) in response to probing with the filaments. I.V. administration of CR845 reduces this neuropathic pain as demonstrated by a
subsequent increase in the withdrawal threshold (see Figure 10 below). Administration of a low dose of the selective peripherally-acting kappa opioid receptor antagonist nor-binaltorphamine, or nor-BNI, into the plantar surface of the injured paw
significantly reduces the effect of CR845, whereas injection of saline had no effect on the efficacy of CR845. Because nor-BNI was only able to block local peripheral kappa opioid receptors in this experiment, we believe these results show that the
effect of CR845 is a result of activation of kappa opioid receptors located at the peripheral site of injury rather than in the CNS. </P>

acute pain in a hospital setting. Based on guidance from the FDA, we believe that we will be required to complete two Phase 3 clinical trials, one in patients with pain resulting from soft tissue surgery and one in patients with pain resulting from
hard tissue surgery. We believe that the primary efficacy endpoints will be the change in SPID at either 24 or 48 hours as compared to placebo. Recent trials conducted by other companies for FDA-approved acute pain drugs have run similar Phase 3
development programs in soft and hard tissue using either SPID 24 or SPID 48 as their endpoints. In addition to our two pivotal Phase 3 clinical studies for I.V. CR845 administered after surgery, we are also planning to run one optional supportive
Phase 3 clinical trial with I.V. CR845 dosed both pre-surgery and post-surgery in patients undergoing either laparoscopic hysterectomy or bunionectomy surgery. In all three trials, patients will have access to morphine rescue medication throughout
the trial. We are currently planning to request an End of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA in the second half of 2014 to discuss initiation of Phase 3 trials and expect to commence these trials in the second half of 2014 and file a New Drug Application,
or NDA, with the FDA following the completion of these trials. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">These planned clinical trials will be similar in design to our Phase 2

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are also developing an oral version of CR845. We believe Oral CR845 will address a significant unmet medical need for a safer alternative to
opioids, NSAIDs or CNS anticonvulsant agents for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acute and chronic pain. In addition to the efficacy benefits that CR845 has previously demonstrated, we believe a significant benefit of Oral CR845 in the chronic
pain market would be its lack of CNS side effects, including euphoria, which should preclude the misuse, abuse and addiction risks associated with currently approved mu opioids. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have developed a capsule formulation of CR845 using a third party proprietary formulation technology that is suitable for proof-of-concept
clinical testing. A single center, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled, escalating single oral dose, sequential group Phase 1 trial of Oral CR845 (Study 1001-PO) was conducted in 50 male volunteers administered with an enteric-coated capsule
of CR845 (0.5, 1, 3, or 10 mg) or matched placebo. Oral bioavailability was estimated to be approximately 16%, with maximal plasma concentration and overall exposure increasing in a linear fashion at ascending doses, with a time to maximal
concentration of approximately 3 hours (see Figure 11 below). The level of exposure at all doses was sufficient to activate peripheral kappa receptors, as indicated by an increase in serum prolactin, a known biomarker of kappa receptor activation.
Oral CR845 was well tolerated and considered safe across all doses tested. Adverse events were similar to those reported after I.V. administration, with the addition of mild abdominal discomfort, which we believe to be related to the acidity of the
excipients used in the oral capsule. None of the test subjects displayed any of the dysphoric or psychotomimetic side effects that have hindered the development of prior generations of centrally active kappa agonists. We believe this oral
bioavailability, confirmed kappa activity at even the lowest capsule concentrations and early favorable safety profile to be an attractive basis for oral drug development. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Having established a proof-of-concept for oral delivery of CR845 with a capsule version, we subsequently developed a tablet version which will
provide greater predictability with respect to the relationship between amounts of drug administered and concentration in the blood, or pharmacokinetic predictability, as well as possess increased stability suitable for commercial shelf life. We
have established drug substance stability and optimal pharmacokinetic characteristics for our tablet version in preclinical testing. We plan to conduct both single ascending and multiple ascending dose Phase 1 clinical trials in 2014 and, if the
results of these trials are favorable, initiate a Phase 2a proof-of-concept trial in acute pain thereafter. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>CR701 Overview </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition to our CR845 family of peripheral kappa agonists, we have discovered and are developing lead molecules that selectively modulate
peripheral cannabinoid receptors. Studies on the effects of cannabis have led to the discovery of an endogenous system of ligands in humans involved in a number of physiological processes, including pain and inflammation. The main naturally
occurring ligands for this system, anandamide and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">2-arachidonoylglycerol</FONT> (2-AG), activate a number of cannabinoid receptors, including CB1 and CB2 receptors. Like opioid receptors, CB1 and CB2 receptors are
members of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. CB1 receptors and associated ligands are mainly localized in the brain whereas CB2 receptors are found mainly in peripheral tissues, particularly immune cells such as leukocytes and mast cells,
which have been shown to be involved in pain and inflammatory responses. We are developing lead molecules that selectively modulate peripheral CB receptors without targeting CNS cannabinoid receptors. Our most advanced CB compound, CR701, is a
peripherally-restricted, mixed-CB1/CB2 receptor agonist that selectively interacts with these cannabinoid receptor subtypes with no-off target activities. The compound is orally bioavailable, active in preclinical models of inflammatory and
neuropathic pain, and does not produce the side effects characteristic of centrally-active cannabinoids, such as sedation and hypothermia. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our strategy is to develop and commercialize a novel and first-in-class portfolio of peripheral-acting analgesics focused on kappa opioid
receptor agonists, and subsequently cannabinoid receptor agonists. We have designed and are developing product candidates which have clearly defined clinical development programs and target large commercial market opportunities. The key elements of
our strategy are as follows: </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Continue to advance I.V. CR845 to approval for acute pain in the United States.</I></B> We are
currently planning a Phase 3 program for I.V. CR845 based on prior FDA guidance and will request an End of Phase 2 meeting in the second half of 2014 to discuss this with the FDA. We believe that we will be required to complete two Phase 3 clinical
trials, one in patients with pain resulting from soft tissue surgery and one in patients with pain resulting from hard tissue surgery. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Build a sales and marketing organization to commercialize I.V. CR845 for acute pain in the hospital setting in the United
States.</I></B> We are planning to establish a hospital-based sales force to market I.V. CR845 to physicians in the United States. We believe that a sales force of approximately 80 sales professionals can reach a large majority of our target market.
We also intend to build sales and medical liaison organizations and a reimbursement infrastructure to support our sales and marketing efforts. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Establish partnerships for development and commercialization of I.V. CR845 outside of the United States.</I></B> We do not intend to
build a sales and marketing infrastructure outside the United States. We will seek partnerships and collaborations with companies that have development and commercialization expertise for the commercialization of I.V. CR845 in countries or regions
outside of the United States. We have already signed development and commercialization agreements with Maruishi for I.V. CR845 and acute indications of Oral CR845 in the Japanese market and Chong Kun Dang for I.V. and Oral CR845 in the South Korean
market. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Advance Oral CR845 to proof-of-concept and seek a global development and commercialization partner.</I></B> The market for
oral chronic pain medications is large and requires a significant sales and marketing infrastructure that other global pharmaceutical partners are better positioned to provide than we are. We intend to advance Oral CR845 through our Phase 2a proof
of concept trial and then seek a global or regional partner for continued development and future commercialization of Oral CR845 internationally. We would intend to retain rights to co-promote Oral CR845 in the U.S. for patients who receive I.V.
CR845 in the hospital and step down to the oral formulation as they leave the hospital. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Establish proof-of-concept for the utility
of CR845 in additional, non-analgesic, clinical indications, such as pruritus</I></B>. CR845 has exhibited potent anti-pruritic (anti-itch) properties in standard preclinical models of itch. Pruritus is a symptom of many systemic diseases, including
hepatic, endocrine and neurological disorders, as well as a range of dermatological conditions. In addition, a pruritic condition, uremic pruritus, is prevalent among kidney dialysis patients and is resistant to both anti-histamine and steroid
treatments. Previous clinical trials with other kappa agonists have demonstrated some efficacy in treating uremic pruritus. As a result, we believe that CR845 could have the potential to treat uremic pruritus. We have previously observed CR845 to
have a good tolerability profile in end stage kidney disease patients. We intend to file an IND for CR845 this year to enable the initiation of a POC Phase 2 study in uremic pruritus. </P>

and other inventions that are important to our business. As more fully described below, patent applications have been filed covering compositions of matter for and methods of using CR845. Six U.S. patents directed to CR845 have issued and are
expected to expire no earlier than 2027. We also rely on trade secrets and careful monitoring of our proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection.

product candidates will be protectable or remain protected by enforceable patents. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued

due to expire November&nbsp;12, 2027, although under certain circumstances the patent term may be extended for up to a further five (5)&nbsp;years based upon the Hatch-Waxman Act. The CR845 patent portfolio also includes pending U.S. patent
applications which claim additional uses and methods of administering CR845. Related foreign applications were filed in more than 40 other countries. National patents have been granted in 31 European countries, as well as in Australia, China, Hong
Kong, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, Singapore and South Africa. These granted foreign patents with claims to CR845 are due expire no earlier than November&nbsp;12, 2027. Patent applications claiming CR845 are pending in Brazil,

jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our pharmaceutical products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. Although, we
intend to seek patent term extensions to any of our issued patents in any jurisdiction where these are available there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether
such extensions should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such extensions. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We also rely on trade secret protection for our

equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. Thus, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants,
outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information
concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual&#146;s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis
on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including large pharmaceutical and
biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies, and medical technology companies. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may
become available in the future. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There are a large number of companies developing or marketing pain therapies for the indications that we
are pursuing. Many of our competitors, including many of the organizations named below, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the development of product candidates,
obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller
number of competitors. Small or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. We also compete with these companies in recruiting and
retaining qualified scientific personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe
the key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of our product candidates, if approved for marketing, are likely to be their safety, efficacy and tolerability profile, reliability, convenience of dosing, price and
reimbursement from government and third party payors. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more
convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors
establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic products. Generic
products that broadly address these indications are currently on the market for the indications that we are pursuing, and additional products are expected to become available on a generic basis over the coming years. If our product candidates
achieve marketing approval, we expect that they will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic products. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There has been a trend in recent years for anesthesiologists to a use all three classes of products to manage postoperative pain, often
referred to as &#147;multimodal analgesia.&#148; If approved, I.V. CR845 would be competing within the overall acute postoperative pain market, although we expect that it would compete primarily with adjunctive analgesics, particularly in multimodal
analgesic treatment approaches. Common adjunctive analgesics include: ketorolac, an injectable NSAID, which is available generically; Caldolor, an injectable ibuprofen marketed by Cumberland Pharmaceuticals; and Ofirmev, an injectable acetaminophen
marketed by Cadence Pharmaceuticals. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition to the above products approved for use as adjunctive analgesics for moderate-to-severe

postoperative pain, and these and other such drugs may be used off-label for this purpose and, therefore, also compete with I.V. CR845. Additionally, numerous companies are developing additional product candidates for the treatment of acute
postoperative pain. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Oral CR845.</I></B> We are developing Oral CR845 for use as a step-down therapy, as well as the management of
moderate-to-severe chronic pain. The market for step-down therapies and for management of moderate-to-severe chronic pain is highly fragmented and includes numerous generic as well as brand name products, including oral formulations of NSAIDs and
controlled-release mu opioids. Common NSAIDs include Celebrex, which is marketed by Pfizer, and naproxen and ibuprofen, which are available generically. Common oral mu opioids include, among others: Avinza, an extended-release morphine sulfate
capsule marketed by Pfizer; EXALGO, an extended-release hydromorphone hydrochloride tablet marketed by Mallinckrodt; Kadian, an extended-release morphine sulfate capsule marketed by Actavis; and OxyContin, a controlled-release oxycodone

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Because of the size of the chronic pain market and the substantial unmet need for products that are safe and effective, there are a large
number of companies involved in the discovery, development, and/or marketing of such products. These product candidates include immediate release and extended release formulations of various NSAIDs and mu opioids. These include combination products
that include mu opioid combined with an NSAID or acetaminophen, such as Vicodin (hydrocodone and acetaminophen) and Percocet (oxycodone and acetaminophen). Other product candidates in development are based on compounds with non-opioid mechanisms of
action, including apremilast, an anti-inflammatory compound being studied in Phase 3 clinical trials by Celgene. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>CR701.</I></B> We
plan to develop CR701 for neuropathic pain indications such as postherpetic neuralgia, or PHN, and neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, or DPN. If approved for marketing, CR701 will compete against more established
products that have been approved for treatment of various neuropathic pain indications. One of the most widely-prescribed drug in the United States for treatment of neuropathic pain is gabapentin, which is marketed by Pfizer and is also available
generically. Gralise, a once-daily tablet formulation of gabapentin for the treatment of PHN, is marketed by Depomed. Pfizer markets Lyrica, an oral anticonvulsant, for use in the treatment of PHN and neuropathic pain associated with DPN. Janssen
Pharmaceuticals markets Nucynta, an extended-release mu opioid tablet, for neuropathic pain associated with DPN. Topical prescription products currently marketed in the United States for neuropathic pain indications include Lidoderm, a lidocaine

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Clinical Trials. </I></B>Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the
supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with cGCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are
conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol
amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must
continue to oversee the clinical trial while it is being conducted. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on their
ClinicalTrials.gov website. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined.
In Phase 1, the drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an initial
indication of its effectiveness. In Phase 2, the drug typically is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted
diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. In Phase 3, the drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough
data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious
adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various
grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in
accordance with the IRB&#146;s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Marketing Approval. </I></B>Assuming successful completion of the required clinical
testing, the results of the preclinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product&#146;s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA
requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in
effect, the FDA has agreed to certain performance goals regarding the timing of its review of an application. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, under the
Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, an NDA or supplement to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing
and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval
of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The FDA also may require submission of
a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to mitigate any identified or suspected serious risks and ensure safe use of the drug. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and elements
to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk minimization tools. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The FDA conducts a
preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than
accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the
FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to
assure the product&#146;s continued safety, quality and purity. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an external advisory
committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions.
The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured, referred to as a
Pre-Approval Inspection. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within
required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with cGCP. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The testing and approval process for an NDA requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take several years to
complete. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval of an NDA on a timely
basis, or at all. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and
inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions
that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may
decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA&#146;s satisfaction, the FDA may issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of
the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. For some products, an additional step of DEA review and scheduling is required. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product,
require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, including a boxed warning, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug&#146;s safety after
approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS which can materially affect the
potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product,
such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Post-Approval Requirements. </I></B>Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing
regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, and compliance with
any post-approval requirements imposed as a condition of approval, such as Phase 4 clinical trials and surveillance to assess safety and effectiveness after commercialization. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new
indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new
application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data. In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state
agencies, and are subject to periodic announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval
before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to
use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or
if problems occur after the product reaches the market. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse
events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market
studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the
Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state
laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>DEA
Regulation </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">I.V. CR845, Oral CR845 or our other product candidates, if approved, may be regulated as a &#147;controlled
substance&#148; as defined in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, or CSA, which establishes registration, security, recordkeeping, reporting, storage, distribution and other requirements administered by the DEA. The DEA is concerned with the
control of handlers of controlled substances, and with the equipment and raw materials used in their manufacture and packaging, in order to prevent loss and diversion into illicit channels of commerce. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The DEA regulates controlled substances as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances. Schedule I substances by definition have no established
medicinal use, and may not be marketed or sold in the United States. A pharmaceutical product may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V, with Schedule II substances considered to present the highest risk of abuse and Schedule V substances the
lowest relative risk of abuse among such substances. The manufacture, shipment, storage, sale and use of Schedule II substances are subject to a high degree of regulation. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Annual registration is required for any facility that manufactures, distributes, dispenses, imports or exports any controlled substance. The
registration is specific to the particular location, activity and controlled substance schedule. For example, separate registrations are needed for import and manufacturing, and each registration will specify which schedules of controlled substances
are authorized. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The DEA typically inspects a facility to review its security measures prior to issuing a registration. Security
requirements vary by controlled substance schedule, with the most stringent requirements applying to Schedule I and Schedule II substances. Required security measures include background checks on employees and physical control of inventory through
measures such as cages, surveillance cameras and inventory reconciliations. Records must be maintained for the handling of all controlled substances, and periodic reports made to the DEA, for example distribution reports for Schedule I and II
controlled substances, Schedule III substances that are narcotics, and other designated substances. Reports must also be made for thefts or losses of any controlled substance, and to obtain authorization to destroy any controlled substance. In
addition, special authorization and notification requirements apply to imports and exports. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, a DEA quota system controls and
limits the availability and production of controlled substances in Schedule I or II. Distributions of any Schedule I or II controlled substance must also be accompanied by special order forms, with copies provided to the DEA. The DEA may adjust
aggregate production quotas and individual production and procurement quotas from time to time during the year, although the DEA has substantial discretion in whether or not to make such adjustments. Our quota of an active ingredient may not be
sufficient to meet commercial demand or complete clinical trials. Any delay or refusal by the DEA in establishing our quota for controlled substances could delay or stop our clinical trials or product launches. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">To meet its responsibilities, the DEA conducts periodic inspections of registered establishments that handle controlled substances. Individual
states also regulate controlled substances, and we and our collaborators will be subject to state regulation with respect to the distribution of these products. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from
knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the
purchase, lease, or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term &#147;remuneration&#148; has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has
been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some
common activities from prosecution. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor.
Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on
a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Additionally, the intent standard under the
Anti-Kickback Statute was also amended by the Health Care Reform Law, as defined above, to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have
committed a violation. In addition, the Health Care Reform Law provided that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim
for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or
entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a
false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes &#147;any request or demand&#148; for money or property presented to the U.S. government. The civil False Claims Act has been used to assert liability on the basis of kickbacks
and other improper referrals, improperly reported government pricing metrics such as Best Price or Average Manufacturer Price, improper use of Medicare provider or supplier numbers when detailing a provider of services, improper promotion of
off-label uses not expressly approved by FDA in a drug&#146;s label, and allegations as to misrepresentations with respect to the services rendered. Additionally, the civil monetary penalties statute, which, among other things, imposes fines against
any person who is determined to have presented, or caused to be presented, claims to a federal healthcare program that the person knows, or should know, is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. The
federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or
fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or
covering up by trick, scheme or device a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters. Also,
many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our
business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, including the final omnibus rule published on January&nbsp;25, 2013, imposes specified
requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes security standards and certain privacy standards directly applicable to business associates. HITECH
also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions
in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney&#146;s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws may govern the privacy and security of health

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Additionally, federal transparency laws, including the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act created under Section&nbsp;6002 of the Health
Care Reform Law and its implementing regulations, require that manufacturers of drugs for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children&#146;s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) report annually to CMS
information related to &#147;payments or other transfers of value&#148; made or distributed to physicians (defined to include doctors of medicine, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), generally, with some exceptions, and teaching
hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals. Additionally, applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations are required to report annually to
CMS certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians (as defined above) and their immediate family members, with data collection required as of August&nbsp;1, 2013, and reporting to CMS is required by March&nbsp;31, 2014 (and by the
90th day of each subsequent calendar year). Disclosure of such information is to be made on a publicly available website beginning in September 2014. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There are also an increasing number of analogous state laws that require manufacturers to file reports with states on pricing and marketing
information, such as tracking and reporting of gifts, compensations, other remuneration and items of value provided to healthcare professionals and healthcare entities. Many of these laws contain ambiguities as to what is required to comply with
such laws. For example, several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to, among other things, establish and implement commercial compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures
on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities and/or register their sales representatives. Certain state laws also regulate manufacturers&#146; use of prescriber-identifiable data. These laws may affect our future sales,
marketing and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens. In addition, given the lack of clarity with respect to these laws and their implementation, our reporting actions once we commercialize could be subject to
the penalty provisions of the pertinent state and federal authorities. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the
health regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject penalties, including criminal and significant civil monetary penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare
programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be
subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of
payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Coverage and Reimbursement Generally </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The commercial success of our product candidates and our ability to commercialize any approved product candidates successfully will depend in
part on the extent to which governmental payor programs at the federal and state levels, including Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers and other third-party payors provide coverage for and establish adequate reimbursement levels for our
product candidates. Government authorities, private health insurers and other organizations generally decide which drugs they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels for healthcare. In particular, in the United States, private health
insurers and other third party payors often provide reimbursement for products and services based on the level at which the government provides reimbursement through the Medicare or Medicaid programs for such products and services. In the United
States, the European Union and other potentially significant markets for our product candidates, government authorities and third party payors are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services, particularly
for new and innovative products and therapies, which often has resulted in average selling prices lower than they would otherwise be. Further, the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States and on country and regional pricing and
reimbursement controls in the European Union will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and utilization, which may adversely affect </P>

our future product sales and results of operations. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to
Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, pharmaceutical coverage and reimbursement policies and pricing in general. Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on
third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Sales of our product candidates will therefore depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of our products will be paid by
health maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management organizations, or reimbursed by government health administration authorities, such as Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers and other third-party payors.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Third party payors are increasingly imposing additional requirements and restrictions on coverage and limiting reimbursement levels for
medical products, including pharmaceuticals. For example, federal and state governments reimburse covered prescription drugs at varying rates generally below average wholesale price. These restrictions and limitations influence the purchase of
healthcare services and products. Third party payors are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might
not include all of the FDA-approved drug products for a particular indication. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to
their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Our product
candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. Moreover, a payor&#146;s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement
may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in drug development. Legislative proposals to reform healthcare or reduce costs under government insurance programs may result
in lower reimbursement for our products and product candidates or exclusion of our products and product candidates from coverage. The cost containment measures that healthcare payors and providers are instituting and any healthcare reform could
significantly reduce our revenues from the sale of any approved product candidates. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to obtain and maintain third party coverage or adequate reimbursement for our product candidates in whole or in
part. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Coverage, Reimbursement, and Pricing Developments </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, the legislative landscape continues to evolve. There have been a number of legislative and
regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems
with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative
initiatives. For example, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, imposed new requirements for the distribution and pricing of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare
beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Part D plans include both standalone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a
supplement to Medicare Advantage plans. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug
formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs
in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for any
products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our future products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only
to drug benefits for Medicare </P>

beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from Medicare Part D may
result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides
funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. A plan for the research will be developed by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality
and the National Institutes for Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures will be made to Congress. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies
for public or private payors, it is not clear what effect, if any, the research will have on the sales of any product, if any such product or the condition that it is intended to treat is the subject of a study. It is also possible that comparative
effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor&#146;s product could adversely affect the sales of our product candidates. If third party payors do not consider our product candidates to be cost-effective compared to other available
therapies, they may not cover our product candidates, once approved, as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Health Care Reform Law was passed in March 2010 and includes provisions that have the potential to substantially change healthcare
financing by both governmental and private insurers. Among other cost containment measures, the Health Care Reform Law, among other things, revised the methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers to the state and federal government for
covered outpatient drugs under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate program to utilization of
prescriptions of individuals&nbsp;enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, subjected manufacturers to new annual fees and taxes for certain branded prescription drugs, and provided incentives to programs that increase the federal
government&#146;s comparative effectiveness research. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the
Health Care Reform Law was enacted. In August 2011, the President signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend proposals in spending
reductions to Congress. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction did not achieve its targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation&#146;s automatic reductions to several
government programs. These reductions include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2%&nbsp;per fiscal year, starting in 2013. Under the Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended, federal budget &#147;sequestration&#148;
Medicare payment reductions became effective on April&nbsp;1, 2013 and automatically reduced payments under various government programs, including, for example, certain Medicare provider and supplier reimbursement payments. In January 2013,
President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to
providers from three to five years. These and other healthcare reform initiatives may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial operations. We expect that
additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could further limit the prices we are
able to charge, or the amounts of reimbursement available, for our product candidates once they are approved. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Foreign Regulation </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other
countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. For example, in the European Union, we must obtain authorization of a clinical
trial application, or CTA, in each member state in which we intend to conduct a clinical trial. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need </P>

to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval
process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA
approval. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. </P>

demonstrated an ability to obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize, a product candidate. In addition, as a relatively nascent business, we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other known

development of product candidates based on peripheral kappa opioid receptor agonists is an emerging field, and the scientific discoveries that form the basis for our efforts to discover and develop product candidates that work through this mechanism
are relatively recent. The scientific evidence to support the feasibility of developing differentiated product candidates based on these discoveries is both preliminary and limited. We believe that we are amongst a relatively small group of
companies that are pursuing the development of product candidates based on peripherally acting kappa opioid receptor agonists. In addition, we believe that companies that previously explored the development of kappa opioid receptor agonists
abandoned these efforts because those prior generation kappa agonists, which were centrally active, resulted in psychiatric side effects. Although CR845 is a peripherally acting kappa opioid receptor agonist and these side effects have not been
observed in any of our clinical trials to date, it is possible that we could observe similar side effects, or other unacceptable adverse events. As a result, our approach to developing product candidates based on peripheral kappa opioid receptor
agonists may not be successful and may never lead to marketable products. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We may expend our limited resources to pursue a

opportunities with other product candidates or for other indications that may prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market
opportunities. Our spending on current and future research and development programs and product candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable products. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target
market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole

side effects caused by our product candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other
comparable foreign authorities. For example, if concerns are raised regarding the safety of a new drug as a result of undesirable side effects identified during clinical testing, the FDA may order us to cease further development, decline to approve
the drug or issue a letter requesting additional data or information prior to making a final decision regarding whether or not to approve the drug. The number of such requests for additional data or information issued by the FDA in recent years has
increased, and resulted in substantial delays in the approval of several new drugs. Undesirable side effects caused by I.V. CR845 or any of our other product candidates could also result in denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other
regulatory authorities for any or all targeted indications or the inclusion of unfavorable information in our product labeling, and in turn prevent us from commercializing and generating revenues from the sale of I.V. CR845 or any other product
candidate. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">To date, the side effects observed in the completed I.V. CR845 clinical trials include dizziness, transient facial tingling, a
state of near-sleep, or somnolence, and hypernatremia, an electrolyte disturbance that is defined by an elevated sodium level in the blood, which we believe is secondary, at least in part, to another side effect, aquaresis, that is defined as
electrolyte-free urination. Prolonged aquaresis can result in a negative fluid balance if the excreted water is not replaced by oral or intravenous water, and although we will recommend such prevention of dehydration, we cannot be certain that such
instructions will be followed by healthcare providers and/or patients, and failure to follow such instructions may be accompanied by adverse events associated with dehydration, including disability and death. We believe that one such adverse event,
which has been observed, postural tachycardia, an elevation of heart rate upon standing up, is a physiological reflex that can be triggered as a result of decreased intravascular volume caused by a negative fluid balance. We have observed transient
prolactin elevations, which are brief increases in the concentration of the hormone prolactin in the bloodstream, in response to I.V. CR845, which we have measured as a nonselective opioid biomarker since both kappa and mu opioids elicit this
effect. We cannot be certain that such elevations in prolactin will be transient, safe, and well tolerated in all patients. In addition, kappa opioid agonists, the class of drugs that I.V. CR845 belongs to, have been associated with poorly tolerated
psychiatric side effects, such as a feeling of emotional and mental discomfort, or dysphoria, and hallucinations, at high doses, particularly for prior generations of kappa opioid </P>

approved, will compete in the marketplace with mu opioid products that are subject to restrictive marketing and distribution regulations, which if applied to our product candidates would restrict their use and harm our ability to generate profits.
</I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The FDA Amendments Act of 2007 implemented safety-related changes to product labeling and provided the FDA with expanded authority
to require the adoption of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, as part of an NDA or after approval. Many currently approved mu opioid receptor agonists require REMS. REMS programs may require medication guides for patients, special
communication plans to healthcare professionals or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and/or other risk minimization tools. While CR845 has been safe and well tolerated in clinical trials to date
and has not shown any evidence of the euphoria that has led to misuse, abuse and addiction of mu opioids, the FDA may still determine that CR845-based products require a REMS program. We cannot predict whether REMS will be required as part of the
FDA&#146;s approval of our product candidates and, if required, what those requirements might be. Any limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of our product candidates,
if approved. If a REMS program is required, depending on the extent of the REMS requirements, the program might significantly increase our costs to commercialize these product candidates. Furthermore, risks of our product candidates that are not
adequately addressed through proposed REMS for such product candidates may also prevent or delay their approval for commercialization. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In
addition, currently approved mu opioids with which CR845-based products may compete are controlled substances, which are subject to state, federal and foreign laws and regulations regarding their manufacture, use, sale, importation, exportation and
distribution. Controlled substances are regulated under the federal Controlled Substances Act of 1970, or CSA, and regulations of the DEA. The DEA regulates controlled substances as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances. Schedule I substances by
definition have no established medicinal use and may not be marketed or sold in the United States. A pharmaceutical product may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V, with Schedule II substances considered to present the highest risk of abuse and
Schedule V substances the lowest relative risk of abuse among such substances. While CR845-based products have not demonstrated any evidence of the euphoria that has led to misuse, abuse, and addiction of mu opioids, and while CR845-based products
are not being treated as a controlled substance in clinical trials, it is possible that the DEA could determine that CR845-based products should be regulated as controlled substances. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Various states also independently regulate controlled substances. Though state controlled substances laws often mirror federal law, because
the states are separate jurisdictions, they may separately schedule drugs as well. While some states automatically schedule a drug when the DEA does so, in other states there must be rulemaking or a legislative action. State scheduling may delay
commercial sale of any controlled substance drug product for which we obtain federal regulatory approval and adverse scheduling could impair the commercial attractiveness of such product. We or our collaborators may also be requested to obtain
separate state registrations in order to be able to obtain, handle and distribute controlled substances for clinical trials or commercial sale, and failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements could lead to enforcement and sanctions from the
states in addition to those from the DEA or otherwise arising under federal law. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If any of our product candidates are classified as
controlled substances, we and our suppliers, manufacturers, contractors, customers and distributors would be required to obtain and maintain applicable registrations from state, federal and foreign law enforcement and regulatory agencies and comply
with state, federal and foreign laws and regulations regarding the manufacture, use, sale, importation, exportation and distribution of controlled substances. Also, if any of our product candidates that were classified as controlled substances,
there is a risk that DEA regulations could limit the supply of the compounds used in clinical trials and, in the future, the ability to produce and distribute our products in the volume needed to meet commercial demand. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Regulations associated with controlled substances govern manufacturing, labeling, packaging, testing, dispensing, production and procurement

commercialization of product candidates including controlled substances. The DEA, and some states, conduct periodic inspections of registered establishments that handle controlled substances.
Failure to obtain and maintain required registrations or comply with any applicable regulations could delay or preclude us from developing and commercializing our product candidates containing controlled substances and subject us to enforcement
action. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations or initiate proceedings to revoke those registrations. In some circumstances, violations could lead to criminal proceedings. Because of the restrictive nature of these
regulations, if it was determined that our product candidates are subject to these restrictions, the commercialization of our product candidates could be limited. </P>

must obtain separate marketing approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing. The time required to obtain approval may differ substantially
from that required to obtain FDA approval. The regulatory approval process outside the United States generally includes all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. In addition, in many countries outside the United States, it is required
that the product be approved for reimbursement before the product can be approved for sale in that country. We or these third parties may not obtain approvals from regulatory authorities outside the United States on a timely basis, if at all.
Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one regulatory authority outside the United States does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or
jurisdictions or by the FDA. However, the failure to obtain approval in one jurisdiction may compromise our ability to obtain approval elsewhere. We may not be able to file for marketing approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to

in the United States generally do not restrict or regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatment within the practice of medicine. Regulatory authorities do, however, restrict communications by pharmaceutical companies on off-label
use. If the FDA determines that our promotional activities constitute promotion of an off-label use, it could request that we modify our promotional materials or subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions, including issuance of warning letters
or untitled letters, suspension or withdraw an approved product from the market, mandatory or voluntary recalls, civil fines, disgorgement of money, operating restrictions, injunctions or criminal prosecution, any of which could significantly harm

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Risks Related to the Commercialization of Our Product Candidates </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We face significant competition from other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, government agencies and
other research organizations. Our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The development and
commercialization of new drug products is highly competitive. We face competition with respect to our current product candidates, and will face competition with respect to any product candidates that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the
future, from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide. There are a number of large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that currently market and sell products or are pursuing the
development of products for the treatment of pain. Potential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish
collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Specifically, there are a large number of
companies developing or marketing therapies for the treatment and management of postoperative acute pain, moderate to severe chronic pain and neuropathic pain, including many major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Among the companies that
currently market or are developing therapies that, if approved, our product candidates would potentially compete with include: Pfizer, Cumberland Pharmaceuticals, Cadence Pharmaceuticals, Mallinckrodt, Actavis, Purdue Pharma, Janssen
Pharmaceuticals, Celgene, Endo Pharmaceuticals, Depomed and Acorda Therapeutics. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or
eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain
FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to
compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic products. Generic products are currently on the market for the indications that we are pursuing, and additional products are
expected to become available on a generic basis over the coming years. If our product candidates achieve marketing approval, we expect that they will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic products. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Many of the companies against which we are competing or against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial
resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and
biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large
and established companies. These third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring
technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>If we are unable to establish effective marketing and sales
capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our product candidates, if they are approved, we may be unable to generate product revenues. </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We currently do not have a commercial infrastructure for the marketing, sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products. If approved, in order
to commercialize our products, we must build our marketing, sales and distribution capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services. We may not be successful in doing so. If I.V. CR845 is approved by the FDA, we plan to
build a commercial infrastructure, including our own specialty sales force, to launch I.V. CR845 in the hospital setting in the United States. We may seek to further penetrate the U.S.&nbsp;market in the future by expanding our sales force or

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have no prior experience in the marketing, sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products, and there are significant risks involved in
the building and managing of a commercial infrastructure. The establishment and development of our own sales force and related compliance plans to market any products we may develop will be expensive and time consuming and could delay any product
launch, and we may not be able to successfully develop this capability. We, or our future collaborators, will have to compete with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to recruit, hire, train, manage and retain marketing and sales
personnel. In the event we are unable to develop a marketing and sales infrastructure, we may not be able to commercialize I.V. CR845 or any of our other product candidates, which would limit our ability to generate product revenues. Factors that

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials, and those third parties
may not perform satisfactorily, including failing to meet deadlines for the completion of such trials. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We rely on third-party
clinical research organizations, or CROs, to conduct our preclinical and clinical trials for our product candidates, including I.V. CR845, and do not plan to independently conduct clinical trials of any other potential product candidates. We expect
to continue to rely on third parties, such as CROs, clinical data management organizations, medical institutions and clinical investigators, to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials. These agreements might terminate for a variety of
reasons, including a failure to perform by the third parties. If we need to enter into alternative arrangements, that would delay our product development activities and adversely affect our business. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our reliance on these third parties for development activities will reduce our control over these activities. Nevertheless, we are responsible
for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory and scientific standards and our reliance on the CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. For example, we will
remain responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial and for ensuring that our preclinical trials are conducted in accordance with GLP, as
appropriate. Moreover, the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities require us to comply with standards, commonly referred to as good clinical practices, or GCPs, for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to
assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial participants are protected. Regulatory authorities enforce these requirements through periodic inspections of trial sponsors,
clinical investigators and trial sites. If we or any of our CROs fail to comply with applicable GCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us
to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot assure you that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical trials complies with GCP
regulations. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with product produced under cGMP regulations. Our failure to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process.
We also are required to register certain clinical trials and post the results of certain completed clinical trials on a government-sponsored database, ClinicalTrials.gov, within specified timeframes. Failure to do so can result in fines, adverse
publicity and civil and criminal sanctions. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our CROs may also have relationships with other entities, some of which may be our
competitors. In addition, our CROs are not our employees, and except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such CROs, we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our on-going clinical, non-clinical
and preclinical programs. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines or conduct our preclinical studies or clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated
protocols, if they need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols, regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be
extended, delayed or terminated and we may not be able to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, marketing approvals for our product candidates and will not be able to, or may be delayed in our efforts to, successfully commercialize our product
candidates. As a result, our results of operations and the commercial prospects for our product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If any of our relationships with these third-party CROs terminate, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs or to
do so on commercially reasonable terms. Switching or adding additional CROs involves additional cost and requires management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new CRO commences work. As a result, delays could
occur, which could compromise our ability to meet our desired development timelines. Though we carefully manage our relationships with our CROs, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter similar challenges or delays in the future or that
these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and prospects. </P>

approved, or any of our other product candidates, for which we obtain approval in the future. Any problems or delays we experience in preparing for commercial-scale manufacturing of a product candidate may result in a delay in FDA approval of the
product candidate or may impair our ability to manufacture commercial quantities, which would adversely affect our business. For example, our manufacturers will need to produce specific batches of our product candidates to demonstrate acceptable
stability under various conditions and for commercially viable lengths of time. We and our contract manufacturers will need to demonstrate to the FDA and other regulatory authorities this acceptable stability data for our product candidates, as well
as validate methods and manufacturing processes, in order to receive regulatory approval to commercialize I.V. CR845 or any of our other product candidates. Furthermore, if our commercial manufacturers fail to deliver the required commercial
quantities of bulk drug substance or finished product on a timely basis and at commercially reasonable prices, we would likely be unable to meet demand for our products and we would lose potential revenues. </P>

long-term commitments from our suppliers of clinical trial material or guaranteed prices for our product candidates. The manufacture of pharmaceutical products requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the development of
advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls. Manufacturers of pharmaceutical products often encounter difficulties in production, particularly in scaling up initial production. These problems include difficulties with production costs and
yields, quality control, including stability of the product candidate and quality assurance testing, shortages of qualified personnel, as well as compliance with strictly enforced federal, state and foreign regulations. Our manufacturers may not
perform as agreed. If our manufacturers were to encounter any of these difficulties, our ability to provide product candidates to patients in our clinical trials would be jeopardized. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Further, we may rely on proprietary technology developed by our contract manufacturers for purposes of manufacturing certain of our product
candidates and our failure to negotiate the long term use of any such proprietary technology may lead to regulatory approval and/or commercializing delays or interruptions, as well as increased costs. For example, we have developed a formulation of
Oral CR845 based on proprietary technology of Enteris Biopharma Inc., or Enteris. Under our agreement with Enteris, it is developing, testing and providing to us clinical supplies for an oral tablet formulation of CR845 on a fee for service basis.
Under the agreed scope of work for this agreement, Enteris will use its proprietary formulation technology for oral delivery of peptides to develop a tablet formulation of CR845 with suitable characteristics to use in clinical testing. We have not
yet negotiated terms related to our use of such technology for commercial manufacturing of Oral CR845 and we may not be able to do so on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we fail to enter into an agreement to use such proprietary
technology, we may be forced to reformulate Oral CR845 which could result in significantly delaying commercializing Oral CR845 and require us to incur additional costs to in connection with such reformulation and potentially needed to seek
additional approvals from the FDA. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, all manufacturers of our product candidates must comply with cGMP requirements enforced
by the FDA through its facilities inspection program. These requirements include quality control, quality assurance and the maintenance of records and documentation. Manufacturers of our product candidates may be unable to comply with these cGMP
requirements and with other FDA, state and foreign regulatory requirements. If our contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA or other
regulatory authorities, they will not be able to secure and/or maintain regulatory approval for their manufacturing facilities. We have little control over our manufacturers&#146; </P>

comply with these requirements may result in fines and civil penalties, suspension of production, suspension, delay or denial of product approval, product seizure or recall, or withdrawal of product approval. If the safety of any quantities supplied
is compromised due to our manufacturers&#146; failure to adhere to applicable laws or for other reasons, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our product candidates. </P>

Collaborators generally have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaboration arrangements. Disagreements between parties to a

not result in the successful development and commercialization of products or if one of our collaborators terminates its agreement with us, we may not receive any future research funding or milestone or royalty payments under the collaboration. If
we do not receive the funding we expect under these agreements, our development of our product candidates could be delayed and we may need additional resources to develop our product candidates and our product platform. All of the risks relating to
our product development, regulatory approval and commercialization described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K also apply to the activities of our collaborators in their respective jurisdictions. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Additionally, if any current or future collaborator of ours is involved in a business combination, the collaborator might deemphasize or

collaborate with additional pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for their development and potential commercialization. We face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators. Our ability to reach a definitive agreement for
collaboration will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator&#146;s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed collaborator&#146;s evaluation of a number of factors. If
we are unable to reach agreements with suitable collaborators on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all, we may have to curtail the development of a product candidate, reduce or delay its development program or one or more of our other
development programs, delay its potential commercialization or reduce the scope of any sales or marketing activities, or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to fund and
undertake development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional expertise and additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we fail to enter into collaborations and do not
have sufficient funds or expertise to undertake the necessary development and commercialization activities, we may not be able to further develop our product candidates or bring them to market or continue to develop our product platform and our
business may be materially and adversely affected. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We are dependent on third parties to decide to utilize I.V. CR845 and to make it

commercialization of I.V. CR845 will require many third parties, over whom we have no control, to decide to utilize I.V. CR845 and to make it readily available at the point of care throughout their hospitals. These third parties include physicians,
pharmacists, and hospital pharmacy and therapeutics committees, which are commonly referred to as P&amp;T committees. Generally, before we can attempt to sell I.V. CR845 in a hospital, I.V. CR845 must be approved for addition to that hospital&#146;s
list of approved drugs, or formulary list, by the hospital&#146;s P&amp;T committee. A hospital&#146;s P&amp;T committee typically governs all matters pertaining to the use of medications within the institution, including review of medication
formulary data and recommendations for the appropriate use of drugs within the institution to the medical staff. The frequency of P&amp;T committee meetings at various hospitals varies considerably, and P&amp;T committees often require additional
information to aid in their decision-making process, so we may experience substantial delays in obtaining formulary approvals. Additionally, hospital pharmacists may be concerned that the cost of acquiring I.V. CR845 for use in their institutions
will adversely impact their overall pharmacy budgets, which could cause pharmacists to resist efforts to add I.V. CR845 to the formulary, or to implement restrictions on the usage of the drug in order to control costs, either initially or later,
when the increasing use of I.V. CR845 within their institution begins to significantly impact their budgets. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in getting the approvals we need from enough P&amp;T committees and overcoming any financial
objections raised by hospital pharmacists quickly enough to maintain and grow hospital sales of I.V. CR845. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe
harbors available under the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies continue to be prosecuted
under the federal false claims laws for numerous activities, including those related to research, sales, marketing and promotional programs. In addition, recent health care reform legislation has strengthened these laws. For example, the Patient
Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, which we refer to collectively as the Health Care Reform Law among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal anti-kickback and
criminal healthcare fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it. Moreover, the Health Care Reform Law provides that the government may assert that a claim including
items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act. To the extent that any product we make is sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to
similar foreign laws and regulations. If we or our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal
penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from participation in U.S. federal or state health care programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could materially adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our
financial results. Although an effective compliance program can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we
successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management&#146;s attention from the operation of our business. Moreover, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable federal and state
privacy, security and fraud laws may prove costly. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business, including our collaborators, is found not to be in compliance with applicable laws, it may be
subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including but not limited to, exclusions from participation in government healthcare programs, which could also materially affect our business. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>If the government or third-party payors fail to provide coverage and adequate coverage and payment rates for I.V. CR845 or any of our
other product candidates, if any, or if hospitals choose to use therapies that are less expensive, our revenue and prospects for profitability will be limited. </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In both domestic and foreign markets, sales of our future products will depend in part upon the availability of coverage and reimbursement from
third-party payors. Such third-party payors include government health programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Coverage decisions may depend upon clinical and economic standards
that disfavor new drug products when more established or lower cost therapeutic alternatives are already available or subsequently become available. Assuming coverage is approved, the resulting reimbursement payment rates might not be adequate. In
particular, many U.S. hospitals receive a fixed reimbursement amount per procedure for certain surgeries and other treatment therapies they perform, or a predetermined rate for all hospital inpatient care provided as payment in full. Because this
amount may not be based on the actual expenses the hospital incurs, hospitals may choose to use therapies which are less expensive when compared to our product candidates. Accordingly, I.V. CR845 or any of our other product candidates, if approved,
will face competition from other therapies and drugs for these limited hospital financial resources. We may need to conduct post-marketing studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of any future products to the satisfaction of
hospitals, other target customers and their third-party payors. Such studies might require us to commit a significant amount of management time and financial and other resources. Our future products might not ultimately be considered cost-effective.
Adequate third-party coverage and reimbursement might not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on investment in product development. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Third-party payors, whether foreign or domestic, or governmental or commercial, are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of
controlling healthcare costs. In addition, in the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payors. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from
payor to payor. Further, we believe that future </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Health Care Reform Law was enacted. These changes include,
among other things, aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2%&nbsp;per fiscal year, which went effective on April&nbsp;1, 2013. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012,
which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in
additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on customers for our drugs, if approved, and, accordingly, our financial operations. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We expect that the Health Care Reform Law, as well as other federal and state healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future,
may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved drug. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government healthcare programs may result in a similar
reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our drugs. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Legislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for
drugs. We cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of our product candidates, if
any, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of the FDA&#146;s approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject us to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other
requirements. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">These measures could result in decreased net revenues from our pharmaceutical products and decrease potential returns from
our development efforts. Many of the details regarding the implementation of the Health Care Reform Law are yet to be determined, and at this time, the full effect that the Health Care Reform Law would have on our business remains unclear. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, there have been a number of other legislative and regulatory proposals aimed at changing the pharmaceutical industry. In
particular, California has enacted legislation that requires development of an electronic pedigree to track and trace each prescription drug at the saleable unit level through the distribution system. California&#146;s electronic pedigree
requirement is scheduled to take effect on a staggered basis, with 50&nbsp;percent of a manufacturer&#146;s products by January&nbsp;1, 2015 and the remaining 50 percent by 2016. Compliance with California and future federal or state electronic
pedigree requirements may increase our operational expenses and impose significant administrative burdens. As a result of these and other new proposals, we may determine to change our current manner of operation, provide additional benefits or
change our contract arrangements, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent
applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. Moreover, should we enter into
additional collaborations we may be required to consult with or cede control to collaborators regarding the prosecution, maintenance and enforcement of our patents. Therefore, these patents and applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a
manner consistent with the best interests of our business. The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain
unresolved. No consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in pharmaceutical or biotechnology patents has emerged to date in the United States. The patent situation outside the United States is even more uncertain. Changes in either
the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents or
in third-party patents. The degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain, because legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage.
Moreover, the patent application process is also subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, and there can be no assurance that we or any of our future development partners will be successful in protecting CR845 and any other product candidates
that we may develop, license or acquire by obtaining and defending patents. For example: </P> <P STYLE="font-size:6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents. On September&nbsp;16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, was signed
into law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to United States patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. The United States Patent
Office recently developed new regulations and procedures to govern administration of the Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act, and in particular, the first to file provisions, only
became effective on March&nbsp;16, 2013. Accordingly, it is not clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business. However, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs
surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Patent applications in the United States are maintained in confidence for at least 18&nbsp;months after their earliest effective filing date.
Consequently, we cannot be certain we were the first to invent or the first to file patent applications on CR845 or any other product candidates that we may develop, license or acquire. In the event that a third party has also filed a
U.S.&nbsp;patent application relating to our product candidates or a similar invention, we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the U.S.&nbsp;Patent and Trademark Office to determine priority of invention in the United
States. The costs of these proceedings could be substantial and it is possible that our efforts would be unsuccessful, resulting in a material adverse effect on our U.S.&nbsp;patent position. The results of these types of proceedings may reduce the
scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology or products and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing
third-party patent rights. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or
future product candidates. Such results could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, the patentability
of claims in pending patent applications covering a CR845-based product can be challenged by third parties during prosecution in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, for example by third party observations and derivation proceedings, and the
validity of claims in issued patents can be challenged by third parties in various post-grant proceedings such as Post-Grant Review, Inter-partes Reexamination, and Inter-partes Review proceedings. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Furthermore, we may not have identified all United States and foreign patents or published applications that affect our business either by
blocking our ability to commercialize our drugs or by covering similar technologies that affect our drug market. In addition, some countries, including many in Europe, do not grant patent claims directed to methods of treating humans, and in these
countries patent protection may not be available at all to protect our product candidates. Even if patents issue, we cannot guarantee that the claims of those patents will be valid and enforceable or provide us with any significant protection
against competitive products, or otherwise be commercially valuable to us. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We also rely on trade secrets to protect our technology,
particularly where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. While we use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets, our licensors, employees, consultants, contractors,
outside scientific collaborators and other advisors may unintentionally or willfully disclose our information to competitors. Enforcing a claim that a third party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets is expensive and time consuming, and
the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how. </P>

profitability. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Even if our patent applications issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful

non-infringing manner. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, and our
owned and licensed patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or freedom to operate or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held
unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and products. Given the
amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such product candidates might expire before or shortly after such product candidates are commercialized. As a result, our owned
and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours. </P>

manufacture, market and sell I.V. CR845 or any of our other product candidates depends upon our ability to avoid infringing the proprietary rights of third parties, and our commercial success depends upon our ability, and the ability of our
collaborators, to develop, manufacture, market and sell our product candidates and use our proprietary technologies without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. There is considerable intellectual property litigation in the
biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the general field of pain management and cover the use of numerous compounds and
formulations in our targeted markets. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future. Because of the uncertainty inherent in any patent or other litigation involving
proprietary rights, we and our licensors may not be successful in defending intellectual property claims by third parties, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Regardless of the outcome of any litigation,
defending the litigation may be expensive, time-consuming and distracting to management. In addition, because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending applications, unknown to us, which may later result in
issued patents that I.V. CR845 or our other product candidates may infringe. There could also be existing patents of which we are not aware that I.V. CR845 or our other product candidates may inadvertently infringe. </P>

treble damages and attorneys&#146; fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our product candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could
materially harm our business. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar negative impact on our business. </P>

technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly. Furthermore,

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.
</I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Filing, prosecuting and defending patents on product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively
expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the
same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our
inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and further, may export otherwise infringing products
to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement rights are not as strong as those in the United States. These products may compete with our product candidates and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective
or sufficient to prevent them from competing. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending
intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our
patents generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or
interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be
commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>The validity and enforceability of the patents and applications that cover our CR845 product candidate can be challenged by competitors.
</I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If I.V. CR845 is approved by the FDA, one or more third parties may challenge the patents covering this product candidate, which
could result in the invalidation of, or render unenforceable, some or all of the relevant patent claims. For example, if a third party files an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, for a generic drug product containing CR845, and relies in
whole or in part on studies conducted by or for us, the third party will be required to certify to the FDA that either: (1)&nbsp;there is no patent information listed in the FDA&#146;s Orange Book with respect to our NDA for I.V. CR845; (2)&nbsp;the
patents listed in the Orange Book have expired; (3)&nbsp;the listed patents have not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (4)&nbsp;the listed patents are invalid or will not be infringed by
the manufacture, use or sale of the third-party&#146;s generic drug product. A certification that the new product will not infringe the Orange Book-listed patents for CR845, or that such patents are invalid, is called a paragraph IV certification.
If the third party submits a paragraph IV certification to the FDA, a notice of the paragraph IV certification must also be sent to us once the third-party&#146;s ANDA is accepted for filing by the FDA. We may then initiate a lawsuit to defend the
patents identified in the notice. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45&nbsp;days of receipt of the notice automatically prevents the FDA from approving the third-party&#146;s ANDA until the earliest of 30&nbsp;months or the date on
which the patent expires, the lawsuit is settled, or the court reaches a decision in the infringement lawsuit in favor of the third party. If we do not file a patent infringement lawsuit within the required 45-day period, the third-party&#146;s ANDA
will not be subject to the 30-month stay. Litigation or other proceedings to enforce or defend&nbsp;intellectual property rights are often very complex in nature, may be very expensive and time-consuming, may divert our management&#146;s attention
from our core business, and may result in unfavorable results that could adversely impact our ability to prevent third parties from competing with our products. </P>

increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, we expect that these rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and

by our management on our internal control over financial reporting. Commencing with our fiscal year ending December&nbsp;31, 2014, we must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow
management to report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting in our Form 10-K filing for that year, as required by Section&nbsp;404. However, while we remain an emerging growth company, we will not be required to

internal control over financial reporting, which is both costly and challenging. In this regard, we will need to continue to dedicate internal resources, potentially engage outside consultants and adopt a detailed work plan to assess and document
the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, continue steps to improve control processes as appropriate, validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process
for internal control over financial reporting. Despite our efforts, there is a risk that we will not be able to conclude, within the prescribed timeframe or at all, that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as required by

assurance that the control system&#146;s objectives will be met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all

aggregate of approximately 56.8% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, these stockholders have significant influence and may be able to determine all matters requiring stockholder approval. For example, these stockholders may be able to
control elections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, or approval of any merger, sale of assets, or other major corporate transaction. This concentration of ownership could delay or prevent any acquisition of our company on
terms that other stockholders may desire. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Some of these persons or entities may have interests different than yours. For example, because

17,159,440 shares of common stock, including an aggregate of 363,635 shares acquired by certain of our pre-IPO principal stockholders and their affiliated entities, will be available for sale in the public market beginning July&nbsp;29, 2014 upon

Rule 144. The representatives of the underwriters may release these stockholders from their lock-up agreements with the underwriters at any time and without notice, which would allow for earlier sales of shares in the public market. Sales of stock

Section&nbsp;404, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder
approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive

credits may expire and not be used. As of December&nbsp;31, 2013, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $55.6&nbsp;million and $50.7 million, respectively, and we also had federal and state research and
development tax credit carryforwards of approximately $2.3 million and $0.7 million, respectively. Our net operating loss carryforwards will begin expiring in 2026 for federal purposes and 2027 for state purposes if we have not used them prior to
that time, and our federal tax credits will begin expiring in 2025 unless previously used. To the extent we have not exchanged our Connecticut research tax credits for a tax refund, those tax credits carryforward indefinitely. Additionally, our
ability to use any net operating loss and credit carryforwards to offset taxable income or tax, respectively, in the future will be limited under Internal Revenue Code Sections&nbsp;382 and 383, respectively, if we have a cumulative change in
ownership of more than 50% within a three-year period. The completion of our initial public offering, together with private placements and other transactions that have occurred, may trigger, or may have already triggered such an ownership change. In
addition, since we will need to raise substantial additional funding to finance our operations, we may undergo further ownership changes in the future. We have never completed an analysis as to whether such a change of ownership has occurred, but in
such an event, we will be limited regarding the amount of net operating loss carryforwards and research tax credits that could be utilized annually in the future to offset taxable income or tax, respectively. Any such annual limitation may
significantly reduce the utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards and research tax credits before they expire. In addition, certain states have suspended use of net operating loss carryforwards for certain taxable years, and other states
are considering similar measures. As a result, we may incur higher state income tax expense in the future. Depending on our future tax position, continued suspension of our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards in states in which we are
subject to income tax could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Because we do not intend

paying any cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the appreciation of their stock, if any. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock. </P>

difficult for a third party to acquire, or attempt to acquire, control of our company, even if a change in control was considered favorable by you and other stockholders. For example, our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 5,000,000
shares of preferred stock and to fix the price, rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions of the preferred stock without any further vote or action by our stockholders. The issuance of shares of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change
in control transaction. As a result, the market price of our common stock and the voting and other rights of our stockholders may be adversely affected. An issuance of shares of preferred stock may result in the loss of voting control to other
stockholders. </P>

clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing new chemical entities designed to alleviate pain by selectively targeting kappa opioid receptors. We are developing a novel and proprietary class of product
candidates that target the body&#146;s peripheral nervous system and have demonstrated efficacy in patients with moderate-to-severe pain without inducing many of the undesirable side effects associated with currently available pain therapeutics. Our
most advanced product candidate, intravenous, or I.V., CR845, has demonstrated significant pain relief and favorable tolerability in three Phase 2 clinical trials in patients with acute postoperative pain. We are currently planning to request an End
of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA in the second half of 2014 to discuss initiation of Phase 3 trials which we expect to initiate in the second half of 2014. We are also developing an oral version of CR845, or Oral CR845, for acute and chronic pain,
for which we have successfully completed a Phase 1 clinical trial to demonstrate the ability to deliver CR845 orally. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We commenced
operations in 2004, and our primary activities to date have been organizing and staffing our company, developing our product candidates, including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials of CR845-based product candidates and raising
capital. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through sales of our equity and debt securities and payments from license agreements. We have no products currently available for sale, and substantially all of our revenue to date has been
revenue from license agreements, although we have received nominal amounts of revenue under research grants. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Since our inception and
through December&nbsp;31, 2013, we have received net proceeds of $65.9 million from the sale of various series of convertible preferred stock, $3.6 million from the issuance of convertible promissory notes and $3.8 million from the issuance of
long-term debt. In addition to our financing activities, we have received aggregate payments of $28.9 million pursuant to license agreements related to CR845 and an earlier product candidate for which development efforts ceased in 2007. In April
2013, we received $15.0 million as an upfront payment pursuant to a license agreement with Maruishi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., or Maruishi, in connection with the license of rights to CR845 in Japan. In 2012, we received aggregate upfront and
milestone payments of $1.2 million, net of foreign taxes, pursuant to a license agreement with Chong Kun Dang Pharmaceutical Corporation, or CKD, in connection with the license of rights to CR845 in South Korea. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Since inception, we have incurred significant operating and net losses. Our net losses were $9.8 million, $6.3 million and $4.0 million for
the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2011,&nbsp;December&nbsp;31, 2012 and December&nbsp;31, 2013, respectively. We generated a net loss of $4.0 million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013, although we recognized $12.0&nbsp;million of revenue for
the period in connection with the Maruishi license, and we expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating and net losses over at least the next several years. As of December&nbsp;31, 2013, we had an accumulated deficit of $62.5
million. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year, depending on the timing of our clinical trials, the receipt of milestone payments, if any, under our collaborations with Maruishi and CKD, the receipt of
payments under any future collaborations we may enter into, and our expenditures on other research and development activities. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially as we: </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">To fund further operations, we will need to raise capital in addition to the net proceeds of our initial public offering. As of
December&nbsp;31, 2013, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $12.4 million. We may obtain additional financing in the future through the issuance of our common stock, through other equity or debt financings or through collaborations or
partnerships with other companies. We may not be able to raise additional capital on terms acceptable to us, or at all, and any failure to raise capital as and when needed could compromise our ability to execute on our business plan. Although it is
difficult to predict future liquidity requirements, we believe that the net proceeds from our initial public offering (see Recent Developments, below) and our existing cash and cash equivalents as of December&nbsp;31, 2013, together with interest
thereon, will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 24&nbsp;months. However, our ability to successfully transition to profitability will be dependent upon achieving a level of revenues adequate to support our cost structure. We
cannot assure you that we will ever be profitable or generate positive cash flow from operating activities. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Recent Developments </B></P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On February&nbsp;5, 2014, we closed the initial public offering of our common stock. We sold a total of 5,750,000 shares in the offering,
including 750,000 shares upon the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares. The aggregate public offering price was $63.3 million, and we received net proceeds of approximately $55.9 million from the
offering, after deducting $7.4 million of underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Collaborations with
Maruishi and CKD </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">To date, we have entered into two license agreements relating to the development of CR845. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In April 2013, we entered into a license agreement with Maruishi under which we granted Maruishi an exclusive license to develop, manufacture
and commercialize drug products containing CR845 in Japan in the acute pain and uremic pruritus fields. We and Maruishi are required to use commercially reasonable efforts, at our respective expense, to develop, obtain regulatory approval for and
commercialize CR845 in the United States and Japan, respectively. In addition, we will provide Maruishi specific clinical development services for CR845 in Maruishi&#146;s field of use. Under the terms of the agreement, we received a non-refundable
and non-creditable upfront license fee of $15.0 million and are eligible to receive up to an aggregate of $6.0 million in clinical development milestones and $4.5 million in regulatory milestones. We are also eligible to receive tiered royalties,
with percentages ranging from the low double digits to the low twenties, based on net sales of products containing CR845 in Japan, if any, and share in any sub-license fees. In addition, in connection with the license agreement, Maruishi purchased
2,105,263 shares of our Junior A Preferred Stock for $3.80 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $8.0 million, which shares were automatically converted into 842,105 shares of common stock upon the closing of our initial public offering.

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In April 2012, we entered into a license agreement with CKD under which we granted CKD an
exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize drug products containing CR845 in South Korea. We and CKD are required to use commercially reasonable efforts, at our respective expense, to develop, obtain regulatory approval for and
commercialize CR845 in the United States and South Korea, respectively. Under the terms of the agreement, we received a non-refundable and non-creditable upfront license fee of $0.6&nbsp;million and are eligible to receive up to an aggregate of $2.3
million in clinical development milestones and $1.5&nbsp;million in regulatory milestones. We also issued 173,611 shares of our Junior Preferred Stock to CKD in consideration for $0.4&nbsp;million, which shares were automatically converted into
69,444 shares of common stock upon the closing of our initial public offering. During 2012, we received $0.6 million, net of foreign taxes, from CKD upon the achievement of clinical development milestones under the license agreement. We are also
eligible to receive tiered royalties with percentages ranging from the high single digits to the high teens, based on net sales of products containing CR845 in South Korea, if any, and share in any sub-license fees. </P>

in the near future. Substantially all of our revenue recognized to date has consisted of upfront payments under license agreements with Maruishi and CKD for CR845, as well as license agreements for CR665, our first generation drug program for which
development efforts have ceased. During 2012, we also received $0.6&nbsp;million, net of foreign taxes, of clinical development milestone payments under our license agreement with CKD. During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013, we recognized
revenue of $0.1 million from the sale of clinical compound and $11.9 million under the Maruishi license agreement. However, we have not received any other significant development or regulatory milestone payments, or any royalties, under these
collaborations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Research and Development </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">To date, our research and development expenses have related primarily to the development of CR845. Research and development expenses consist of
expenses incurred in performing research and development activities, including compensation and benefits for full-time research and development employees, facilities expenses, including laboratory build-out costs, overhead expenses, cost of
laboratory supplies, clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing expenses, third-party formulation expenses, fees paid to contract research organizations, or CROs, and other consultants, stock-based compensation for research and development
employees and other outside expenses. Our research and development expenses also include expenses related to preclinical activities, such as drug discovery, target validation and lead optimization for CR845 and our other, earlier stage programs.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Non-refundable advance payments for goods or services to be received in the
future for use in research and development activities are deferred and capitalized. The capitalized amounts are expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Most of our research and development costs have been external costs, which we track on a program-by-program basis. Our internal research and
development costs are primarily compensation expenses for our full-time research and development employees. We do not track internal research and development costs on a program-by-program basis. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Research and development activities are central to our business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally
have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect our research and development expenses to increase significantly over the
next several years as we seek to progress I.V. CR845 through Phase 3 trials and the FDA approval process. However, it is difficult to determine with certainty the duration and completion costs of our current or future preclinical programs and
clinical trials of our product candidates, or if, when or to what extent we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates that obtain regulatory approval. We may never succeed in achieving regulatory
approval for any of our product candidates. </P>

connection with the license agreement with CKD in April 2012. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Research and development expenses </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Research and development expenses increased by $4.1 million to $8.7&nbsp;million, for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013, compared to the
same period of 2012. The increase was primarily the result of a $3.7 million increase in direct preclinical studies and CR845 clinical trial costs, a $0.3 million increase in payroll and recruiting costs, a $0.3 million increase in consultant
services in support of preclinical studies and clinical trials and a $0.1&nbsp;million increase in travel costs, partially offset by a $0.2 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense. The increase in CR845 clinical trial costs
resulted primarily from the completion of the Phase 2 bunionectomy trial, the Phase 1 IV CR845 renal impairment trial and preclinical costs for formulation and studies related to oral tablets of CR845. </P>

embedded in the notes and amortization of deferred financing costs, and accrued interest expense on the convertible promissory notes we issued in December 2012 and February 2013. </P>

The increase resulted primarily from a $0.3 million increase in consulting expenses as a result of the engagement of consultants for business development efforts and a $0.3&nbsp;million loss on the sale of fixed assets consisting of idle laboratory
equipment, partially offset by a $0.2&nbsp;million reduction in payroll costs as a result of a workforce reduction in 2011. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Interest

expense for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2011 was $0.2 million. This expense related to an increase in the fair value of the investor right/obligation. There was no corresponding other expense incurred in 2012, as the investor right/obligation

significant amount of milestone payments and royalties under our license agreements with Maruishi and CKD. Our ability to earn these payments and their timing is dependent upon the outcome of I.V. and Oral CR845 development activities and,
potentially, commercialization. As a result, our receipt of any such amounts is uncertain at this time and we may never receive any of these amounts. </P>

December 2012 and February 2013, we issued an aggregate of $4.0 million principal amount of convertible promissory notes due August&nbsp;28, 2013. The notes bore interest at 8%&nbsp;per annum and included both optional and mandatory conversion
features. The optional conversion feature allowed each note holder, at any time prior to maturity, to elect to convert the balance of the note plus accrued interest into shares of our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock at a conversion price of
approximately $1.44 per share. The mandatory conversion feature of the notes provided that, if we issued or sold equity securities of not less than $10.0 million on or before the maturity date, the notes plus all accrued interest thereon would
automatically convert into shares of the issued class of equity securities at a price per share equal to 90% of the cash price paid by the investors in the new equity securities. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We did not need to complete an equity financing prior to August&nbsp;28, 2013, which would have triggered the mandatory conversion of the
notes. In August 2013, certain holders of notes elected to convert their notes in the aggregate amount of $3.9 million in principal plus accrued interest into 2,692,291 shares of Series D Preferred Stock. In October 2013, we repaid the remaining
notes in the aggregate amount of $311 thousand in principal and accrued interest. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Connecticut Innovations, Inc. Term Loan </I></B></P>

installments over five years. In connection with the loan, we also issued a warrant to CII to purchase 19,851 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $10.08. In September 2012, we amended the terms of the loan to defer all payments due
between July&nbsp;1, 2012 and December&nbsp;31, 2012 until January&nbsp;2, 2013 and to increase the interest rate on the loan to 8.5%. We repaid all outstanding amounts under the loan from CII, including accrued interest, in April&nbsp;2013. The
warrant remains outstanding and expires September&nbsp;25, 2014. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Funding Requirements </I></B></P>

stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our existing common stockholders. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities,
these securities could contain covenants that would restrict our operations. If we raise additional funds through collaboration arrangements in the future, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams or
product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our drug development or
future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. </P>

offering, will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 24 months, without giving effect to any potential milestone payments we may receive under our collaboration agreements. Because the
process of testing product candidates in clinical trials is costly and the timing of progress in these trials is uncertain, it is possible that the assumptions upon which we have based this estimate may prove to be wrong, and we could use our
capital resources sooner than we presently expect. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Cash Flows </I></B></P>

have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets
and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheets and the reported amounts of license revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be
reasonable under the circumstances at the time such estimates are made. Actual results and outcomes may differ materially from our estimates, judgments and assumptions. We periodically review our estimates in light of changes in circumstances, facts
and experience. The effects of material revisions in estimates are reflected in the financial statements prospectively from the date of the change in estimate. </P>

Recognition Multiple-Element Arrangements</I>. In order to account for these agreements, we identify the deliverables included within arrangement and evaluate which deliverables represent separate units of accounting based on whether certain
criteria are met, including whether the delivered element has stand-alone value to the counterparty. The consideration received is then allocated among the separate units of accounting based on each unit&#146;s relative selling price. The
identification of individual elements in a multiple-element arrangement and the estimation of the selling price of each element involves significant judgment, including consideration as to whether each delivered element has standalone value. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We determine the estimated selling price for deliverables within each agreement using vendor specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of selling
price, if available, or third party evidence, or TPE, of selling price if VSOE is not available, or our best estimate of selling price, if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. Determining the best estimate of selling price for a deliverable requires
significant judgment. Because we do not have VSOE or TPE of selling price to determine the estimated selling price of a license to our proprietary technology, we typically uses our best estimate of a selling price to estimate the selling prices for
licenses to our proprietary technology. In making these estimates, we consider market conditions and entity-specific factors, including those contemplated in negotiating the agreements, as well as internally developed estimates that include
assumptions related to the market opportunity, estimated development costs, probability of success and the time needed to commercialize a product candidate pursuant to the license. In validating our best estimate of selling price, we evaluate

parties on the basis of the contingent nature of the milestone in accordance with ASC 605-28, <I>Revenue Recognition &#150; Milestone Method</I>. This evaluation includes an assessment of whether (a)&nbsp;the consideration is commensurate with
either (1)&nbsp;the entity&#146;s performance to achieve the milestone, or (2)&nbsp;the enhancement of the value of the delivered item(s) as a result of a specific outcome resulting from the entity&#146;s performance to achieve the milestone,

accounted for in accordance with ASC 718, <I>Stock Compensation</I>. ASC 718 requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the Statements of Operations based on their grant date fair
values. We estimate the grant date fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. Prior to our initial public offering, we utilized methodologies in accordance with the framework of the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants Technical Practice Aid, <I>Valuation of Privately-Held Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation </I>(the &#147;Practice Aid&#148;), to determine our common stock values used in the Black-Scholes model. Since our initial
public offering, our common stock value is based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant on The NASDAQ Global Market. The Black-Scholes model requires us to make judgments about the following: (1)&nbsp;the risk-free rate, which
is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant; (2)&nbsp;the expected life of stock options granted to employees, which was determined using the average of the vesting period and term, an accepted method for the

methodologies in accordance with the framework of the Practice Aid to estimate the fair value of the shares issued to Maruishi and CKD as of the date of issuance. Each valuation includes estimates and assumptions that require our judgment. These
estimates include assumptions regarding future performance, including the probability of successful completion of preclinical studies and clinical trials and FDA approval of product candidates containing CR845, the probability and estimated time to
complete financing and collaborative transactions. Significant changes to the key assumptions used in the valuations could result in different fair values of the preferred stock at the respective valuation dates. </P>

payment, Maruishi also purchased 2,105,263 shares of our newly designated Junior A Preferred Stock pursuant to a stock purchase agreement at a purchase price of $3.80 per share, for total consideration of $8.0 million. Subsequent to the agreement,
we estimate that the fair value of the Junior A Preferred Stock was $3.64 per share at the date of issuance. Based on this valuation, we assigned a value to the Junior A Preferred Stock issued to Maruishi of $7.7 million. As a result, we allocated
an additional $0.3 million to the values of the license and research and development services elements under the Maruishi license arrangement. In the CKD transaction, we received an upfront non-refundable, non-creditable license fee $1.0 million
and, as partial consideration, issued CKD 173,611 shares of our newly designated Junior Preferred Stock. Based on our estimated fair value of the shares of Junior Preferred Stock issued in the transaction of $2.04 per share, or the aggregate of $354
thousand we recorded the remaining proceeds of $646 thousand as license revenue. In each instance, we are accounting for the values allocated to the respective license arrangements in accordance with our revenue recognition policies described above.

Our board of directors may amend or suspend the 2014 Plan at any time, although no such action may impair the rights under any then-outstanding award without the holder&#146;s consent. We will obtain stockholder approval for any amendments to the
2014 Plan as required by law. No incentive stock options may be granted under the 2014 Plan after the tenth anniversary of the effective date of the 2014 Plan. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Types of Awards.</I> The 2014 Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, restricted stock awards,
restricted stock unit awards, stock appreciation rights, performance stock awards and other forms of equity compensation, or collectively, stock awards. Additionally, the 2014 Plan provides for the grant of performance cash awards. Incentive stock
options may be granted only to employees. All other awards may be granted to employees, including officers, non-employee directors, and consultants. </P>

Plan is 1,600,000 shares. Additionally, the number of shares of our common stock reserved for issuance under the 2014 Plan will automatically increase on January&nbsp;1 of each year, beginning on January&nbsp;1, 2015 and continuing through and
including January&nbsp;1, 2024, by 3% of the total number of shares of our capital stock outstanding on December&nbsp;31 of the preceding calendar year, or a lesser number of shares determined by our board of directors. The maximum number of shares
that may be issued pursuant to the exercise of incentive stock options under the 2014 Plan is 30,000,000 shares. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Section&nbsp;162(m)

value is determined by reference to an increase over an exercise or strike price of at least 100% of the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. A stock option with an exercise price equal to the value of the stock on the date of
grant is an example of an appreciation-only award. </P>

affiliates, ceases due to disability or death or an optionee dies within a specified period following cessation of service, the optionee or a beneficiary may exercise the vested portion of any options for a period of 12 months in the event of
disability and 18 months in the event of death. In the event of a termination of an optionee&#146;s service for cause, the option will terminate upon the optionee&#146;s cessation of service and the optionee may not exercise the option following
such termination. The option term may be further extended in the event that exercise of the option following termination of service is prohibited by applicable securities laws, or the sale of any common stock received upon exercise of the option

award may, but need not, be subject to a share repurchase option in our favor in accordance with a vesting schedule to be determined by the plan administrator. Rights to acquire shares under a restricted stock award may be transferred only upon such

pursuant to restricted stock unit award agreements adopted by the plan administrator. Restricted stock unit awards may be granted in consideration for any form of legal consideration. A restricted stock unit award may be settled by cash, delivery of
stock, a combination of cash and stock as deemed appropriate by the plan administrator, or in any other form of consideration set forth in the restricted stock unit award agreement. Additionally, dividend equivalents may be credited in respect to
shares covered by a restricted stock unit award. Except as otherwise provided in the applicable award agreement, restricted stock units that have not vested will be forfeited upon the participant&#146;s cessation of continuous service for any
reason. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Stock Appreciation Rights.</I> A stock appreciation right entitles the participant to a payment equal in value to the
appreciation in the value of the underlying shares of our common stock for a predetermined number of shares over a specified period. Stock appreciation rights are granted pursuant to stock appreciation right agreements adopted by the plan
administrator. The plan administrator determines the strike price for a stock appreciation right which cannot be less than 100% of the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. Upon the exercise of a stock appreciation right, we
will pay the participant an amount equal to the product of (a)&nbsp;the excess of the per share fair market value of our common stock on the date of exercise over the strike price, multiplied by (b)&nbsp;the number of shares of common stock with
respect to which the stock appreciation right is exercised. A stock appreciation right granted under the 2014 Plan vests at the rate specified in the stock appreciation right agreement as determined by the plan administrator. </P>

limitations also do not affect a director&#146;s responsibilities under any other laws, such as the federal securities laws or other state or federal laws. Our amended and restated bylaws provide that we will indemnify our directors and executive
officers, and may indemnify other officers, employees and other agents, to the fullest extent permitted by law. Our amended and restated bylaws also provide that we are obligated to advance expenses incurred by a director or officer in advance of
the final disposition of any action or proceeding and also permit us to secure insurance on behalf of any officer, director, employee or other agent for any liability arising out of his or her actions in connection with their services to us,

fines and settlement amounts incurred by a director or executive officer in any action or proceeding arising out of their services as one of our directors or executive officers, or any of our subsidiaries or any other company or enterprise to which

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In December 2012 and February 2013, we issued an aggregate of $4.0 million principal amount of convertible promissory notes due August&nbsp;28,
2013, or the 2013 Bridge Financing. The notes bore interest at 8%&nbsp;per annum and included both optional and mandatory conversion features. The optional conversion feature allowed each note holder, at any time prior to maturity, to elect to
convert the balance of the note plus accrued interest into shares of our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock at a conversion price of approximately $1.44 per share. The mandatory conversion feature would have resulted in the automatic conversion of
the notes into shares of a newly issued class of equity securities in the event of a qualifying financing prior to maturity. The mandatory conversion did not occur and, upon maturity, note holders elected to convert the aggregate amount of $3.9
million in principal plus accrued interest into 2,692,291 shares of Series D Preferred Stock. We repaid the remaining notes upon maturity in the aggregate amount of approximately $300 thousand in principal and accrued interest. The participants in
the 2013 Bridge Financing included certain executive officers, beneficial owners of more than 5% of our capital stock and entities affiliated with certain of our directors, as set forth in the table below: </P>

standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. We were
not engaged to perform an audit of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,

&#147;Company&#148;) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical corporation formed on July&nbsp;2, 2004. The Company is focused on developing and commercializing new chemical entities designed to alleviate pain by selectively targeting kappa opioid
receptors. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The registration statement relating to the Company&#146;s initial public offering (&#147;IPO&#148;) was declared effective by
the Securities and Exchange Commission on January&nbsp;30, 2014. As a result of the IPO, the Company received net proceeds on February&nbsp;5, 2014 of approximately $55,900 from the sale of 5,750,000 shares of common stock, after deducting
approximately $7,400 of underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company. Refer to Note 22, Subsequent Events. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Prior to the IPO, the Company has raised several rounds of equity financing and issued debt, resulting in aggregate net proceeds of
approximately $73,309 through December&nbsp;31, 2013. The Company has incurred substantial losses and negative cash flows from operations in nearly every fiscal period since inception, and expects operating losses and negative cash flows to continue
into the foreseeable future. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue to operate as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in
the normal course of business. In April&nbsp;2013, the Company entered into a License Agreement and Stock Purchase Agreement with Maruishi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (&#147;Maruishi&#148;), which collectively added $23,000&nbsp;in cash (see
Note&nbsp;12). As of December&nbsp;31, 2013, the Company has unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $12,357 and an accumulated deficit of $62,456. The Company recognized net loss of $3,963, which included revenue from the Maruishi license, and
had net cash flows provided by operations of $2,829 for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013. The Company expects that cash and cash equivalents at December&nbsp;31, 2013, together with the proceeds from its initial public offering, will be
sufficient to fund its operations beyond one year. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company is subject to risks common to other life science companies including, but
not limited to, uncertainty of product development and commercialization, lack of marketing and sales history, development by its competitors of new technological innovations, dependence on key personnel, market acceptance of products, product
liability, protection of proprietary technology, ability to raise additional financing, and compliance with FDA and other government regulations. If the Company does not successfully commercialize any of its product candidates, it will be unable to
generate recurring product revenue or achieve profitability. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In prior years, the Company was a development stage company as defined by

relevant market information. These estimates may be subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. The
carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts payable and accrued liabilities and debt are generally considered to be representative of their respective fair values because of the short-term nature of those instruments. The
fair value of the Company&#146;s investor rights/obligation liability has been estimated utilizing the Company&#146;s own internal analysis, including variables for timing of the preferred stock tranches. The liability under license agreement has
been valued based upon the Black-Scholes option valuation model and other probability estimates. The fair value of the Company&#146;s contingent call option was calculated by estimating the accreted value of the convertible promissory notes upon
conversion, with consideration provided for the 10% price discount and the probability of the Company closing an equity offering in excess of $10,000 before August&nbsp;28, 2013. </P>

estimate of selling price for a deliverable requires significant judgment. Because the Company does not have VSOE or third party evidence of selling price to determine the estimated selling price of a license to its proprietary technology, it
typically uses its best estimate of a selling price to estimate the selling prices for licenses to its proprietary technology. In making these estimates, the Company considers market conditions and entity-specific factors, including those
contemplated in negotiating the agreements, as well as internally developed estimates that include assumptions related to the market opportunity, estimated development costs, probability of success and the time needed to commercialize a product
candidate pursuant to the license. In validating its best estimate of selling price, the Company evaluates whether changes in the key assumptions used to determine its best estimate of selling price will have a significant effect on the allocation

the two-class method, basic net earnings (loss) per share applicable to common stockholders is computed by dividing the net earnings (loss) applicable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period.
Diluted net earnings (loss) per share is computed using the more dilutive of (1)&nbsp;the two-class method, or (2)&nbsp;the &#147;if-converted&#148; method. The Company allocates net earnings on a pari passu (equal) basis to both common and

on a straight-line basis is included in deferred rent and classified within long-term liabilities. Cash reimbursements received from landlords for leasehold improvements and other cash payments received from landlords as lease incentives are
recorded as deferred rent and classified as long-term liabilities. Deferred rent related to landlord incentives is amortized using the straight-line method over the lease term as an offset to rent expense. Penalties paid to landlords to terminate a

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In December&nbsp;2012 and February&nbsp;2013, the Company issued an aggregate of $4,000 principal amount of Convertible Promissory Notes
(&#147;Notes&#148;) due August&nbsp;28, 2013 (&#147;Maturity Date&#148;). The sale was consummated through two closings. The initial closing was on December&nbsp;28, 2012 for $2,538 principal amount. In connection with these notes, the Company
incurred $117 of financing costs which is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets (refer to Notes 3 and 6). The final closing was on February&nbsp;28, 2013 for $1,462 principal amount. All of the Notes were purchased by current
stockholders, all of whom were given the opportunity to buy their pro rata share of the Notes. The holders of preferred stock who did not participate in the Note financing had their shares of preferred stock converted into common stock at their
respective then applicable conversion rates. As a result, as of February 2013, 2,246,743 shares of preferred stock were converted into 959,545 shares of common stock. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Because the original terms of the preferred stock were modified to reflect this mandatory conversion, the Company determined that the
preferred stock had been extinguished. Accordingly, the conversion date difference between the carrying value of the preferred stock converted ($4,466) and the fair value of the common stock issued ($3,575) has been recorded as a gain ($891) within
accumulated deficit. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Notes bore interest at 8%&nbsp;per annum and had a Maturity Date of August&nbsp;28, 2013. The Notes were not
eligible to be repaid prior to the maturity date without the consent of the holders of a majority in interest of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Notes. The Notes included an optional conversion feature and a mandatory conversion
feature. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The optional conversion feature allowed the Note holder, any time prior to the Maturity Date, to elect to convert the balance of
the note plus accrued interest into Series D Preferred Stock at a conversion price of $1.444244 per share. In accordance with ASC 470-20, <I>Debt with Conversion and Other Options</I>, the Company determined that the intrinsic value of the
beneficial conversion feature embedded in the Notes issued in the initial closing was $2,050, based on the estimated fair value of the Series D Preferred Stock as of December&nbsp;31, 2012 of $2.61 per share, and this intrinsic value was recorded as
a debt discount, to be accreted to interest expense over the term of the Notes. As of December&nbsp;31, 2012, the Company amortized $25 of debt discount to interest expense. As of February&nbsp;28, 2013, the final closing of the Note financing, the
Company determined that the intrinsic value of the beneficial conversion feature of the Notes issued in the final closing was $1,382 and recorded this amount as an additional debt discount. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013, the Company
amortized $3,407 of debt discount to interest expense. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The mandatory conversion of the Notes would occur in the event the Company issued or sold
equity securities on or before August&nbsp;28, 2013 of not less than $10,000. In this event, the Notes plus all accrued interest would automatically convert into the issued class of equity securities at a price per share equal to 90% of the cash
price paid by the investors in the new equity securities. In accordance with ASC 815-15, <I>Derivatives and Hedging</I>, the Company was required to record the embedded mandatory conversion feature as a free-standing financial instrument, as the
conversion feature was a substantial contingent call option. The Company recorded $41 as the fair value of the contingent call option liability related to the Notes issued in the initial closing of the Note financing as of December&nbsp;31, 2012,
with a corresponding amount recorded as additional debt discount, with the debt discount to be accreted to interest expense over the life of the Notes. Any increases or decreases to the fair value of the contingent call option would be recorded in
operations through the life of the Notes. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company estimated the fair value of the contingent call option by estimating the accreted
value of the Notes upon conversion, with consideration provided for the 10% price discount and the probability of the Company closing an equity offering in excess of $10,000 before August&nbsp;28, 2013. As of December&nbsp;28, 2012, the Company
estimated the probability of an equity offering in excess of $10,000 closing before August&nbsp;28, 2013 to be 15%. The Company classified the liability within Level 3 as the probability factor is an unobservable input and significant to the
valuation model. Increases in the probability of an equity offering closing before August&nbsp;28, 2013 in excess of $10,000 would increase the fair value of the liability. There was no change in the fair value of the contingent call option as of
December&nbsp;31, 2012. The estimated fair value of the contingent call option was reduced to zero, since the Company estimated the probability of closing a $10,000 equity offering before August&nbsp;28, 2013 as zero, following the receipt of
$23,000 in connection with the Maruishi transaction in April 2013, which removed the need for a $10,000 financing prior to August&nbsp;28, 2013. </P>

accrued interest, into 2,692,291 shares of Series D Preferred Stock, and the remaining Notes, in the aggregate amount of $311 in principal and accrued interest, were repaid during October 2013. As of December&nbsp;31, 2013, there were no Notes

September&nbsp;2007, the Company entered into a $4,000 term loan (&#147;Loan&#148;) with Connecticut Innovations Inc. (&#147;CII&#148;). The Loan carried a 7% interest rate and was payable in monthly installments over five years. In connection with
this Loan, the Company incurred $149 of financing costs which were included in other assets and were being amortized as interest expense over the life of the Loan (refer to Note&nbsp;6). The Loan was collateralized by property and equipment located
in Shelton, Connecticut and owned as of December&nbsp;31, 2007. As of December&nbsp;31, 2012, the net carrying value of the property and equipment, including leasehold improvements, that served as collateral for the Loan was $3,593. The CII Loan
contained certain non-financial covenants, including the requirement that the Company maintain its principal place of business and conduct the majority of its operations in Connecticut. If the Company failed to maintain its Connecticut presence, all
amounts due under the Loan would be immediately due and payable with the cumulative interest rate increasing to 25%. Maintaining Connecticut presence is within management&#146;s control, and the Company had no plans to relocate the majority of its
operations; therefore, the classification of the Loan was based on the scheduled payment dates. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On September&nbsp;4, 2012, the Company
and CII amended the Loan to defer all payments due between July&nbsp;1, 2012 and December&nbsp;31, 2012 until January&nbsp;2, 2013 and to increase the interest rate to 8.5%. The remaining principal balance of the Loan was $307 as of
December&nbsp;31, 2012, which was classified as current installment of long-term debt. The Company repaid all remaining amounts outstanding under the Loan, including accrued interest thereon, in April&nbsp;2013. </P>

initial issuance of Series D Preferred Stock, July&nbsp;19, 2010, and this liability was marked to market at each subsequent reporting date at which it remained outstanding in accordance with ASC 480, <I>Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity</I>.
The fair value of the liability at July&nbsp;19, 2010 was $733. The fair value at December&nbsp;31, 2010 was $844. The fair value at December&nbsp;31, 2011 was zero, because the investor right/obligation was no longer outstanding as it had been
exercised in full upon the closing of the final tranche of the financing in August&nbsp;2011. The change in fair value related to the investor right/obligation was approximately $179 during 2011 and approximately $111 during the period July&nbsp;19,

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In April, 2012, the Company entered into a license agreement with Chong Kun Dang Pharmaceutical Corporation (&#147;CKD&#148;) that provides CKD
with the exclusive rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize products containing CR845, the Company&#146;s lead product candidate, in South Korea. Under the agreement, the Company received a non-refundable and non-creditable amount of $1,000
and is eligible to receive milestone payments totaling $3,750, relating to pre-defined clinical development ($2,250) and regulatory events ($1,500), as well as royalties on sales of any marketed products containing CR845. The Company has accounted
for the milestones under ASC 605 <I>Revenue Recognition &#150; Milestone Method</I>. At the time of execution of this license agreement, there was significant uncertainty as to whether the stated milestones would be achieved. In conjunction with
this uncertainty, the Company has determined that the milestones are substantive in nature as they are commensurate with the enhancement of value of the delivered license as they relate to clinical success and advancement within the FDA drug
development platform. The milestones also relate solely to past performance and monetary investment of the Company to achieve the clinical advancement. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In exchange for the $1,000, the Company provided CKD with the license for CR845 and issued
CKD&nbsp;173,611 shares of Junior Preferred Stock. The Company recorded the issuance of the 173,611 shares of Junior Preferred Stock as a capital transaction for $354, which represented the shares&#146; estimated fair value as of the transaction
date. The remaining proceeds of $646 were recorded as license revenue as the license was the only deliverable within the agreement that had stand-alone value and was determined to be a separate unit of accounting under ASC 605-25, <I>Revenue
Recognition Multiple &#150; Element Arrangements</I>. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, the Company received a milestone payment of $750 during the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2012 related to the Company&#146;s achievement of U.S. clinical development milestones stated in the CKD license agreement. The next potential milestone that the Company will most likely be entitled to receive under the license
agreement will be a clinical development milestone for the completion of a Phase 1b clinical trial in the U.S. for a certain indication. If achieved, this milestone will result in a $250 payment being due to the Company. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2012, the Company recorded revenue related to the CKD license and milestones of $1,190, net of South
Korean withholding tax of $206. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Maruishi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In April 2013, the Company entered into a license agreement with Maruishi under which the Company granted Maruishi an exclusive license to
develop, manufacture, and commercialize products containing CR845 for acute pain and uremic pruritus in Japan. The Company and Maruishi are responsible to use commercially reasonable efforts, at its expense, to develop, obtain regulatory approval
for and commercialize CR845 in the United States and Japan, respectively. In addition, the Company will provide Maruishi specific clinical development services for CR845 used in Maruishi&#146;s field of use. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the terms of the agreement, the Company received an upfront non-refundable, non-creditable license fee of $15,000. The Company is also
entitled to receive aggregate milestone payments of $6,000 for pre-defined clinical development events and $4,500 for regulatory events. The Company will account for any future milestone payments under ASC 605 <I>Revenue Recognition &#150; Milestone
Method</I>. At the time of execution of this license agreement, there was significant uncertainty as to whether the stated milestones would be achieved. In conjunction with this uncertainty, the Company has determined that the milestones are
substantive in nature as they are commensurate with the enhancement of value of the delivered license as they relate to clinical success and advancement within the FDA drug development platform. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company is also eligible to receive tiered, low double digit royalties with respect to any sales of the licensed product sold in Japan by
Maruishi. Additionally, the Company can receive sublicense fees (subject to certain credits for milestone payments already made) if Maruishi enters into a sublicense agreement regarding the product candidates. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Also, in conjunction with this arrangement Maruishi purchased 2,105,263 shares of Junior A Preferred Stock of the Company pursuant to a stock
purchase agreement for a purchase price of $3.80 per share, for total consideration of $8,000. These shares have been recorded at their fair value of $7,663 or $3.64 per share. As a result, the premium of $337 was allocated to the arrangement
consideration. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As indicated in Note 2, the Company accounts for arrangements of this type under ASC 605-25, <I>Multiple Deliverable
Revenue Arrangement</I>. The Company has identified two deliverables under this guidance: (1)&nbsp;the license; and (2)&nbsp;the research and development (&#147;R&amp;D&#148;) services specific to the uremic pruritus field of use. The Company has
determined that the license has standalone value because Maruishi has the right to sublicense and manufacture CR845 in Japan. The second deliverable is the R&amp;D services, which also have standalone value as

similar services are sold separately by other vendors. Since both license and R&amp;D services separability criteria have been met, they are being accounted for as separate units of accounting at
the outset of the arrangement. As a result, the total value of the arrangement of $15,337 (consisting of the $15,000 upfront payment, plus the additional amount assigned to these deliverables as a result of the Junior A Preferred Stock premium) was
allocated between the two units. The Company used its best estimate of the selling price of these units, since, as described in Note 2, neither VSOE nor TPE was available. To determine these estimates, the Company used a discounted cash flow method
that forecasted and analyzed CR845 in the Japanese market, the phase of clinical development as well as considering recent similar license arrangements within the same phase of clinical development, therapeutic area, type of agreement, etc. As a
result, the management of the Company has determined that the license and the R&amp;D services have estimated selling prices of $10,200 and $6,200, respectively. The resulting percentage allocations were applied to the $15,337 of total
consideration, which resulted in $9,637 being assigned to the license and $5,700 assigned to the R&amp;D services. As a result, the Company recognized $9,637 of the license revenue and $2,225 of R&amp;D service revenue during the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2013. The remaining amount assigned to the R&amp;D services has been deferred and will be recognized as the services are provided. </P>

consultants of the Company. The Company&#146;s Board of Directors administers the 2004 Plan. The 2004 Plan provides for the issuance of 1,336,600 shares of common stock. Options granted under the 2004 Plan have a maximum term of ten years. Options
issued generally vest 25% on the first anniversary date of grant and the balance ratably over the next 36 months. As of December&nbsp;31, 2013, options to purchase 490,160 shares of common stock were granted and outstanding under the 2004 Plan. </P>

Agreement&#148;) for a certain G protein-coupled receptor (&#147;GPCR&#148;) assay technology with the University of Glasgow (&#147;Glasgow&#148;). The Company issued 200,000 shares of its common stock to Glasgow as compensation and recorded
research and development expense of $50 during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2005 based on the aggregate fair value of the common stock as determined by the board of directors. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Upon an exit event, as defined in the Glasgow License Agreement, Glasgow has the option to require the Company to guarantee a return of $1,000
on its 200,000 shares of common stock by giving Glasgow cash or through the issuance of additional shares (at the Company&#146;s option), as specified in the Glasgow License Agreement. In accordance with ASC 480, <I>Distinguishing Liabilities from
Equity</I>, the Company initially recorded the fair value of this option of $95 as both a long-term liability and research and development expense as of and for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2005. The Company estimated the fair value of the
option using the Black-Scholes option valuation model with consideration given to the probability of an exit event occurring below the guaranteed amount. The fair value of the liability will be estimated at each subsequent balance sheet date, with
any increases or decreases to the fair value recorded as increases or decreases to research and development expense and the related liability. As of December&nbsp;31, 2012, the estimated fair value of the liability, with consideration given to the
probability of an exit event occurring, was determined to be $35. As of December&nbsp;31, 2013, the estimated fair value of the liability was reduced to zero based on the Company&#146;s estimated fair value of common stock after the Maruishi
transaction. The Company classifies the liability within Level 3 as the probability factor is an unobservable input and significant to the valuation model. The Company has used a probability factor of 10% in all periods from 2005 to 2013. The
probability rate is based on the successful progress of the Company&#146;s product candidates containing CR845 and the Company&#146;s expectation of an exit event value below the guaranteed amount. An increase in the probability rate would result in
a higher liability while an increase in the stock price would reduce the liability. The decrease in the value of the liability of $25 in 2012 and $35 in 2013 was the result of changes in the observable inputs (i.e. stock value, interest rates and
volatility) and was recorded in research and development expense. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>16. Earnings (Loss) per Share </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company computes basic earnings (loss) per share available to common stockholders using the &#147;two-class&#148; method, which includes
the weighted-average number of common stock shares outstanding during the period and other securities that participate in dividends (a participating security). The Company&#146;s convertible preferred stock are participating securities as defined by
ASC&nbsp;260-10, Earnings per Share. Under the two-class method, basic net earnings (loss) per share available to common stockholders is computed by dividing the net earnings (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of
common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted net earnings (loss) per share available to common stockholders is computed using the more dilutive of (1)&nbsp;the two-class method, or (2)&nbsp;the &#147;if-converted&#148; method. The Company
allocates net earnings on a pari passu (equal) basis to both common and preferred stockholders. Net losses are not allocated to preferred stockholders as they do not have an obligation to share in the Company&#146;s net losses. </P>

potentially dilutive securities, including convertible preferred stock, convertible promissory notes and shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants, using the treasury stock method. For the years ended
December&nbsp;31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, the Company has excluded the effects of all potentially dilutive shares, which include convertible preferred stock, convertible promissory notes, warrants for common stock and common stock options, from the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding as their inclusion would be anti-dilutive due to the Company&#146;s net losses. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The

second quarter of the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013, the Company recorded net income, although for the full year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013, the Company recorded net loss. For purposes of calculating basic net income per share for the second
quarter, the Company excluded from the numerator $3,869 of net income attributable to participating securities. For purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share, such amount was included in the numerator together with interest on convertible
promissory notes. Common shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options, assumed conversion of convertible preferred stock and convertible promissory notes were included in the denominator on an as-if converted basis. </P>

January 2014. The 2014 Plan became effective immediately upon the signing of the underwriting agreement for the Company&#146;s initial public offering. The 2014 Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options,
restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, stock appreciation rights, performance stock awards and other forms of equity compensation, or collectively, stock awards. Additionally, the 2014 Plan provides for the grant of performance cash
awards. Incentive stock options may be granted only to employees. All other awards may be granted to employees, including officers, non-employee directors, and consultants. No incentive stock options may be granted under the 2014 Plan after the
tenth anniversary of the effective date of the 2014 Plan. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Initially, the aggregate number of shares of the Company&#146;s common stock

each year, beginning on January&nbsp;1, 2015 and continuing through and including January&nbsp;1, 2024, by 3% of the total number of shares of the Company&#146;s capital stock outstanding on December&nbsp;31 of the preceding calendar year, or a
lesser number of shares determined by the Company&#146;s board of directors. The maximum number of shares that may be issued pursuant to the exercise of incentive stock options under the 2014 Plan is 30,000,000 shares. </P>
