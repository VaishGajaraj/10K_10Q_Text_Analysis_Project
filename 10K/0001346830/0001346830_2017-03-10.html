biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing new chemical entities designed to alleviate pain and pruritus by selectively targeting kappa opioid receptors. We are developing a novel and proprietary class of product candidates
that target the body&#146;s peripheral nervous system. We commenced operations in 2004, and our primary activities to date have been organizing and staffing our company, developing our product candidates, including conducting preclinical studies and
clinical trials of CR845-based product candidates, and raising capital. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through sales of our equity and debt securities and payments from license agreements. We have no products currently available
for sale, and substantially all of our revenue to date has been revenue from license agreements, although we have received nominal amounts of revenue under research grants. </P>

of $8.6&nbsp;billion in that year. Opioid analgesics decrease the perception of pain by stimulating mu, delta and/or kappa opioid receptors. All of these receptors are involved in modulating pain
signals. The most widely used opioid analgesics, including hydrocodone, oxycodone, morphine, and fentanyl, act primarily through the activation of mu opioid receptors in the central nervous system, or CNS. However, because of the wide distribution
of mu opioid receptors throughout the brain, morphine and other mu opioid analgesics also trigger a characteristic pattern of adverse &#147;central&#148; side effects, including nausea and vomiting, itching and respiratory depression. Mu opioids are
also known to cause euphoria, which can lead to misuse, abuse and addiction issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our most advanced product
candidate is based on our new chemical entity, CR845, which is designed to produce pain relief by specifically stimulating kappa, rather than mu, opioid receptors outside of the CNS. We have designed CR845 with specific chemical characteristics to
restrict its entry into the CNS and further limit CR845&#146;s mechanism of action to kappa opioid receptors in the peripheral nervous system, or nerves outside of the brain and spinal cord. In addition to the side effects associated with activation
of mu opioid receptors in the CNS, activation of kappa receptors in the CNS is also known to result in side effects, including acute psychiatric disorders. Since CR845 is designed to modulate pain signals without activation of mu or kappa opioid
receptors in the CNS, it is not expected to produce the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">CNS-related</FONT> side effects of mu opioids or the psychiatric side effects of centrally-active kappa opioids. CR845 has been administered to more than 1,300
human subjects in Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 2/3 and Phase 3 clinical trials as an intravenous, or I.V., infusion, rapid intravenous injection or oral capsule or tablet, and was observed to be safe and well tolerated in these clinical trials. </P>

three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trials, in patients with acute postoperative pain who were undergoing soft tissue (laparoscopic hysterectomy) and hard tissue (bunionectomy) surgery, without inducing many of the

successfully completed a Human Abuse Liability, or HAL, trial of I.V. CR845. The results from this HAL trial indicate that I.V. CR845 met the trial&#146;s primary endpoint by demonstrating highly statistically significant lower &#147;drug
liking&#148; scores as measured by visual analog scale (VAS) Emax (p &lt;0.0001) when compared to pentazocine, an approved Schedule IV opioid receptor agonist. I.V. CR845 also demonstrated highly statistically significant lower &#147;feeling
high,&#148; &#147;overall liking,&#148; and &#147;take drug again&#148; scores (p &lt;0.0001) as compared to pentazocine. Additionally, I.V. CR845 showed no &#147;drug liking&#148; dose response as both doses of I.V. CR845 were the same. Those
scores represent standard subjective measures recommended by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, to assess a drug&#146;s abuse liability. We believe that the totality of the results from the HAL trial are supportive of the potential for

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In April 2015, we completed an
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">End-of-Phase</FONT></FONT> 2 meeting with the FDA, to discuss the design of pivotal trials for our I.V. CR845 product candidate in acute pain. In September 2015, we initiated the
Phase 3 program for our I.V. formulation of CR845 in postoperative pain with the dosing of the first subjects in an adaptive pivotal trial in patients undergoing a range of abdominal surgeries (see <I>Our Product Candidates &#150; I.V. CR845 &#150;
Acute Pain</I> below, for details of the Phase 3 trial). An interim conditional power analysis of our adaptive Phase 3 trial of I.V. CR845 for postoperative pain is expected in the second quarter of 2017. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Based on previous guidance from the FDA, we believe we will require 1,500 total exposures to I.V. CR845, including all Phase 1, Phase 2 and
Phase 3 trials, prior to submitting a new drug application, or NDA. We believe our planned clinical trials and our clinical trials completed to date will result in a sufficient number of drug exposures to support an NDA. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are also developing an oral version of CR845, or Oral CR845, which we believe could be used to provide pain relief to patients with acute
or chronic pain in an outpatient setting and also as an <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">I.V.-to-oral</FONT></FONT> transition, or step-down, therapy for hospital patients being prepared for discharge. In August
2015, we advanced our tablet formulation of Oral CR845 into a Phase 2a clinical trial in patients with osteoarthritis, or OA, of the knee or hip. In December 2015, we announced positive <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">top-line</FONT> results from
this Phase 2a trial. The results showed a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">dose-related</FONT> reduction in mean baseline pain score up to 34% after two weeks, with a statistically significant reduction in mean rescue medication for the top 5.0 mg
dose group of approximately 80%. The results of the Phase 2a clinical trial established therapeutic doses and a dosing regimen for a larger randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2b trial, which we initiated during the third quarter of
2016 (see <I>Our Product Candidates &#150; Oral CR845</I> below, for details of the Phase 2a and Phase 2b trials). We expect to report <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">top-line</FONT> data in the second quarter of 2017. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Pain is generally categorized by its duration as either acute or chronic, by its severity, as either mild, moderate or severe, and its type
and/or causality, such as postoperative or neuropathic. Acute pain is typically caused by an injury resulting in nerve, tissue or bone damage and is expected to subside in severity when the injury heals. Postoperative pain is a subset of the acute
pain market. Chronic pain, on the other hand, is prolonged, and can be the long-term result of an acute injury or an ongoing disease condition, such </P>

as neuropathic pain associated with diabetes. According to a recent Institute of Medicine report, chronic pain affects approximately 100&nbsp;million U.S. adults, while millions of others
experience acute pain caused by events such as surgery, injury, childbirth and illness. According to Quintiles/IMS, the total U.S. market for pain management pharmaceuticals was $41.6&nbsp;billion in 2016. In 2016, according to Visiongain, an
independent industry research company, total sales for pain therapies worldwide, exceeded $67.8&nbsp;billion.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The
severity of pain is the key factor in determining the appropriate therapy. Mild or <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">mild-to-moderate</FONT></FONT> pain is generally treated with
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-opioid</FONT> products, such as oral formulations of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen, naproxen), aspirin, and acetaminophen. <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Moderate-to-severe</FONT></FONT> pain, on the other hand, is typically treated with products containing traditional mu opioids. Mu opioid analgesics are effective to some degree for many patients, but have poor side effect
and abuse liability profiles, which limits or precludes their use in treating less severe pain. For many people with <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">moderate-to-severe</FONT></FONT> pain, opioid analgesics are the
only effective method of treating pain. As a result, these opioid analgesics are among the largest prescription drug classes in the United States. According to Qunitiles/IMS, opioid analgesics represented approximately 56% of the nearly
425&nbsp;million analgesic prescriptions written in 2016, accounting for $8.6&nbsp;billion in sales.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Postoperative Pain
Market </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Postoperative pain represents a substantial part of the overall acute pain market. According to the International
Association for the Study of Pain, more than 46&nbsp;million inpatient and 53&nbsp;million outpatient surgeries are performed annually in the United States.
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Moderate-to-severe</FONT></FONT> pain in a hospital or other medical setting is most often treated with injectable analgesics. The United States I.V./injectable analgesic therapy
market primarily consists of mu opioid agonists, such as morphine, hydromorphone and fentanyl, and certain <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-opioid</FONT> analgesics, such as Toradol (and related generic I.V. ketorolac products), Caldolor (I.V.
ibuprofen), Dyloject (I.V. diclofenac sodium) and Ofirmev (I.V. acetaminophen). In 2014, there were 234.3&nbsp;million doses of injectable opioid analgesics used in United States according to the IMS Health NSP Audit. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">According to Practice Guidelines developed by the American Society of Anesthesiologists, the standard of care for treating acute postoperative
pain is multimodal analgesia, which includes the administration of two or more drugs that act by different mechanisms for providing analgesia in a manner that will minimize the occurrence of adverse events. When patients are ready for discharge, a
transition is typically made to a prescription oral pain medication, allowing patients to self-administer relatively strong analgesics after being discharged home. This transition from an I.V. pain medication to an oral pain medication is commonly
referred to as <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">I.V.-to-oral</FONT></FONT> transition, or &#147;step-down&#148; therapy. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Strong mu opioid analgesics, such as morphine, fentanyl, and hydromorphone, are mainstays of pain treatment in the immediate postoperative
period, and are used as part of a multimodal analgesic approach. However, the use of strong mu opioid analgesics is associated with an array of unwanted and serious side effects, including postoperative opioid-induced respiratory depression, or
POIRD, postoperative nausea and vomiting, or PONV, and opioid-induced bowel dysfunction, which contributes to the severity of postoperative ileus. According to Anesthesiology News<I>, </I>a trade journal, the incidence of POIRD may be as high as
29%, can occur unexpectedly in even the healthiest of patients, and exerts a disproportionately high toll on length of stay and hospital costs due to the significant expenses associated with the treatment of POIRD. According to an article published
in Best Practice&nbsp;&amp; Research Clinical Anaesthesiology, a trade journal, PONV occurs in approximately <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">one-third</FONT> of surgical patients overall, and is one of the most important factors in determining
length of stay after surgery, resulting in estimated annual costs in the U.S. in the range of $1&nbsp;billion. These mu opioid-related adverse events not only significantly increase the cost of care, but also reduce a patient&#146;s quality of care
and lead to <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">sub-optimal</FONT> recovery. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Nonopioid analgesics formulated for injection or infusion,
including I.V. acetaminophen and NSAIDs, such as I.V. ibuprofen, are available as alternatives to mu opioids to relieve acute pain, but their use is limited in a postoperative care setting as a result of their limited efficacy. I.V. acetaminophen
and NSAIDs also have side effects that limit their use at higher, more efficacious doses. Acetaminophen is associated with risk of liver toxicity, which can be fatal, and NSAIDs are associated with risks of bleeding, serious gastrointestinal side
effects including ulcers, kidney damage, and serious cardiovascular thrombotic events such as stroke and heart attack, which can be fatal. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The most common causes of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">moderate-to-severe</FONT></FONT> chronic pain are
musculoskeletal problems and inflammatory conditions. Injuries from accidents resulting in fractures, dislocations or soft tissue injury, as well as lower back pain, are the most frequent causes of musculoskeletal pain. Although these injuries are
mostly <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-fatal,</FONT> the cost in terms of long-term disability, medical expense and lost productivity is large. <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Moderate-to-severe</FONT></FONT>
chronic pain is typically treated with prescription products including immediate release and long-acting opioids, such as the branded products OxyContin (oxycodone), Nucynta ER (tapentadol) and Opana ER (oxymorphone), and combination products that
include an opioid combined with an NSAID or acetaminophen, such as the branded products Vicodin (hydrocodone and acetaminophen) and Percocet (oxycodone and acetaminophen). Prescription products for chronic pain are usually in oral tablet or capsule
form because the vast majority of these patients are taking these medications outside of the hospital setting. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On April&nbsp;7, 2005, the
FDA announced a decision to require boxed warnings of potential cardiovascular risk for all NSAIDs. The 2005 FDA warning related to cardiovascular adverse events associated with NSAIDs and the increased awareness of the risk of liver toxicity
associated with high doses of acetaminophen have led to increased use of mu opioid analgesics for the treatment of chronic pain. However, the use of mu opioid analgesics carries significant additional risks. Chronic opioid use causes patients to
develop tolerance for the opioid, which results in the patient needing increasing opioid doses to achieve the same level of pain relief. For the most commonly prescribed analgesic combination products, the need for increasing doses to achieve the
same level of pain relief means exposure to increasing amounts of NSAIDs or acetaminophen, which carry the risks attendant to these therapeutics. Moreover, due to their CNS activity, mu opioids produce feelings of euphoria, which can give rise to
abuse and addiction. Underlining the severity of this issue, in September 2013, the FDA announced class-wide safety labeling changes and new post-market study requirements for all extended-release and long-acting mu opioid analgesics intended to
treat pain. In support of this action, the FDA Commissioner stated that &#147;[t]he FDA is invoking its authority to require safety labeling changes and post-market studies to combat the crisis of misuse, abuse, addiction, overdose, and death from
these potent drugs that have harmed too many patients and devastated too many families and communities.&#148; In addition, as a result of their potential for misuse, abuse and addiction, currently approved mu opioids are strictly regulated by the
DEA under the Controlled Substances Act, which imposes strict registration, record keeping and reporting requirements, security control and restrictions on prescriptions, all of which significantly increase the costs and the liability attendant to
prescription opioid analgesics. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>The Unmet Need in Pain Management </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Despite the size of the pain management market, there has been little innovation in the development of new analgesics, with nearly all recent
new drug approvals limited to reformulations and improved methods of delivery of existing therapeutics. Mu opioids continue to be the most prescribed drugs for pain management, despite their side effects and the potential for misuse, abuse and
addiction. These concerns often cause healthcare providers to administer or prescribe less than optimal doses of mu opioids, or patients to take lower than prescribed doses, resulting in inadequate pain relief. Consequently, we believe that the pain
market represents a therapeutic area with substantial unmet needs for patients in pain, for physicians who must balance pain control with risks of causing severe adverse events, and for healthcare organizations that bear the costs of managing the
consequences of undertreated pain and drug-related adverse events. We believe that CR845, with its novel mechanism of action, will be attractive to patients and physicians, as well as hospitals and payers, as a treatment for <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">moderate-to-severe</FONT></FONT> pain because of its ability to provide pain relief without opioid-related adverse events or abuse and addiction issues associated with currently approved mu
opioid analgesics. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>The Market Opportunity &#150; Pruritus </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Pruritus, or itch, is defined as an unpleasant sensation that provokes the desire to scratch. Certain systemic diseases have been known to
cause pruritus that ranges in intensity from a mild annoyance to an intractable, disabling condition. The sensation of pruritus is transmitted through slow-conducting unmyelinated <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">C-polymodal</FONT> and possibly type
A delta nociceptive neurons with free nerve endings located near the dermoepidermal junction or in the epidermis. These neurons appear to be located more superficially and are more sensitive to pruritogenic substances than pain receptors. Activators
of these nerves include histamine, neuropeptide substance P, serotonin, bradykinin, proteases (e.g., mast cell tryptase), and endothelin (which stimulates the release of nitric oxide). Impulses are transmitted from the dorsal root ganglion to the
spinothalamic tract. Additionally, opioids are known to modulate the sensation of pruritus, both peripherally and centrally. Stimulation of mu opioid receptors accentuates pruritus, while stimulation of kappa receptors suppress pruritus. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Pruritus may be classified into the following categories on the basis of the underlying causative
disease: renal or uremic pruritus, cholestatic pruritus, hematologic pruritus, endocrine pruritus, pruritus related to malignancy, dermatological pruritus and idiopathic generalized pruritus. According to a study Cara conducted with IMS Health
utilizing medical claims data from 2013, nearly 45&nbsp;million patients have been diagnosed with diseases known to trigger pruritus in the United States alone. Of those patients, nearly half (47%), or 21&nbsp;million, received a prescription for an
anti-pruritic agent such as corticosteroids, antihistamines, select antidepressants, counterirritants, bile acid sequestrants, rifampin, narcotic antagonists and partial agonists, topical immunomodulators (Elidel, Protopic) or gabapentin. </P>

pruritus can occur in patients with chronic renal failure and is most often seen in patients receiving hemodialysis. According to Fresenius Medical Care, a world leading provider of products and medical care for dialysis patients, there were over
400,000 patients in the United States and 2.2&nbsp;million globally undergoing hemodialysis in 2013. It is estimated that <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">40-50%</FONT> of these patients suffer from renal or uremic pruritus according to a study of
dialysis patients (&#147;Pruritus in haemodialysis patients: international results from the Dialysis Observation and Practice Patterns Study (DOPPS)&#148;, Pisoni et al. 2006). </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Currently, there are no approved products in the United States to treat renal or uremic pruritus. Patients are generally managed with a
multitude of products including corticosteroids, gabapentin, antihistamines, antidepressants and others with varying degrees of success. There is one product, nalfurafine, approved to treat uremic pruritus in Japan. Nalfurafine is a kappa opioid
receptor agonist, but it also has partial <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">mu-opioid</FONT> receptor activity. Mu agonists, like morphine, are known to cause itch. Kappa agonists that cross the blood brain barrier, like nalfurafine, are also known
to cause <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">CNS-related</FONT> adverse events resulting in high rates of discontinuation. The limited efficacy in light of concerns about adverse events caused European Medicines Agency to refuse to approve nalfurafine
for the treatment of uremic pruritus in 2013. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Other Causes of Pruritus </I></B></P>

data from 2013, indicate that over 20&nbsp;million patients suffer from some level of pruritus in the United States. Many of these patients are <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">sub-optimally</FONT> treated for their pruritus with products not

reduce the length of hospital stays, thereby reducing overall healthcare costs. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The safety profile of I.V. CR845 has been documented in
six Phase 1 and three Phase 2 studies. In these trials, CR845 was administered to approximately 500 human subjects at single or repeat doses ranging from 1ug/kg to 40 ug/kg up to a 1 week period, in the form of I.V. infusion or I.V. bolus injection.
I.V. CR845 was considered to be generally safe and well tolerated in all of these clinical trials. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events, or TEAEs, across evaluated populations were transient facial tingling or numbness, dizziness and
fatigue. In addition, a transient increase in urine output in the absence of electrolyte loss, otherwise known as aquaresis, was also observed, which in some subjects was accompanied by asymptomatic elevations in plasma sodium that were generally
considered to be clinically unimportant. No clinically significant changes in electrocardiogram characteristics have been observed in any of these studies. Importantly, there appeared to be no cases of the characteristic <FONT

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the fourth quarter of 2014, we successfully completed a HAL trial of I.V. CR845 in which I.V. CR845 met the primary endpoint of
demonstrating statistically significant lower &#147;drug liking&#148; scores as compared to the approved schedule IV opioid, pentazocine. We believe that the totality of results from the HAL trial are supportive of the potential for CR845 to be the

2015, we initiated our Phase 3 clinical trial program for I.V. CR845 in postoperative pain with the dosing of the first subjects in an adaptive pivotal trial in patients undergoing a range of abdominal surgeries. This trial is a multi-center,
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group adaptive design trial with repeated doses of I.V. CR845 or placebo administered both prior to and following abdominal surgery in male and female patients. The trial protocol initially
included three dose levels of I.V. CR845 (1.0 ug/kg, 2.0 ug/kg and 5.0 ug/kg), which were compared to placebo with an interim conditional power assessment to identify optimal doses to be used to complete the enrollment of this trial. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In February 2016, the FDA advised us that our adaptive pivotal trial of I.V. CR845 for postoperative pain had been placed on IND clinical hold
pending a safety review. The clinical hold was based on a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-specified</FONT> stopping rule related to elevated serum sodium levels of greater than 150 mmol/L that was included in the clinical trial protocol. A
subsequent review of unblinded safety data from the first 90 patients dosed was completed by us, the trial&#146;s Independent Data Monitoring Committee and the FDA. In April 2016, we received notice from the FDA that it had removed the clinical hold

total of 80 OA patients enrolled in the U.S. (Figure 2). In addition to safety and PK observations, CR845&#146;s effectiveness was assessed by: change from baseline in joint pain using the NRS, which was measured daily, change from baseline in the
Western Ontario and McMaster Osteoarthritis Index, or WOMAC, which was measured at the end of Weeks 1 and 2 of treatment, change from baseline in rescue medication use, measured daily, and Patient Global Assessment, or PGA, which was measured on the
last day of the study. Acetaminophen was the only allowable rescue medication. PK analyses indicated dose-proportional exposure of CR845 after oral administration, with the 5.0 mg dose group exhibiting an approximately five-fold increased mean AUC

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition to our CR845 family of peripheral kappa agonists, we have discovered and are developing lead molecules that selectively modulate
peripheral cannabinoid receptors. Studies on the effects of cannabis have led to the discovery of an endogenous system of ligands in humans involved in a number of physiological processes, including pain and inflammation. The main <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">naturally-occurring</FONT> ligands for this system, anandamide and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">2-arachidonoylglycerol</FONT> <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">(2-AG),</FONT> activate a number of cannabinoid receptors,
including CB1 and CB2 receptors. Like opioid receptors, CB1 and CB2 receptors are members of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. CB1 receptors and associated ligands are mainly localized in the brain, whereas CB2 receptors are found mainly
in peripheral tissues, particularly immune cells such as leukocytes and mast cells, which have been shown to be involved in pain and inflammatory responses. We are developing lead molecules that selectively modulate peripheral CB receptors without
targeting CNS cannabinoid receptors. Our most advanced CB compound, CR701, is a peripherally-restricted, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">mixed-CB1/CB2</FONT> receptor agonist that selectively interacts with these cannabinoid receptor subtypes, with
no <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">off-target</FONT> activities. The compound is orally bioavailable, active in preclinical models of inflammatory and neuropathic pain, and does not produce the side effects characteristic of centrally-active
cannabinoids, such as sedation and hypothermia. Accordingly, CR701 would be expected to have substantially less abuse potential than centrally-active cannabinoids, but retain activity against therapeutically valuable peripheral targets, similar in
principle to CR845. </P>

and subsequently on cannabinoid receptor agonists. We have designed and are developing product candidates which have clearly defined clinical development programs and target large commercial market opportunities. The key elements of our strategy are
as follows: </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Continue to advance I.V. CR845 to approval for treating
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">moderate-to-severe</FONT></FONT> acute pain in acute care settings in the United States. </I></B>We are conducting an adaptive Phase 3 trial of I.V. CR845 for postoperative pain. An
interim conditional power analysis of our adaptive Phase 3 trial of I.V. CR845 for postoperative pain is expected in the second quarter of 2017. Based on previous guidance from the FDA, we believe we will require 1,500 total exposures to I.V. CR845,
including all Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials, prior to submitting an NDA. We believe our planned clinical trials and our clinical trials completed to date will result in a sufficient number of drug exposures to support an NDA. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We strive to protect the proprietary technologies that we believe are important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patent
protection intended to cover the composition of matter of our product candidates, their methods of use, related technology and other inventions that are important to our business. As more fully described below, patent applications have been filed
covering compositions of matter for and methods of using CR845. Ten U.S. patents directed to CR845 and its uses have been issued, which are expected to expire no earlier than 2027. We also rely on trade secrets and careful monitoring of our
proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our success will depend significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important
technology, inventions and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">know-how</FONT> related to our business, defend and enforce our patents, maintain our licenses to use intellectual property owned by third parties, preserve the confidentiality of our trade
secrets and operate without infringing valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">know-how,</FONT> and continuing technological innovation to develop, strengthen, and
maintain our proprietary position in the field of peripheral analgesia. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A third party may hold intellectual property, including patent
rights, which are important or necessary to the development of our products. It may be necessary for us to use the patented or proprietary technology of third parties to commercialize our products, in which case we would be required to obtain a
license from these third parties on commercially reasonable terms, or our business could be harmed, possibly materially. If we were not able to obtain a license, or were not able to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms, our business
could be harmed, possibly materially. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We plan to continue to expand our intellectual property estate by filing patent applications
directed to novel peripheral analgesics and novel uses of our proprietary compounds. We anticipate seeking patent protection in the United States and internationally for the chemistries and processes for manufacturing these compounds and the use of
these compounds in a variety of therapies. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies like us are generally uncertain and
involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and the patent&#146;s scope can be modified after issuance. Consequently, we
do not know whether any of our product candidates will be protectable or remain protected by enforceable patents. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or
whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. Any patents that we hold may be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Because patent applications in the United States and certain other jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for 18 months, and since
publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain of our entitlement to the inventions covered by pending patent applications. Moreover, we may have to participate in
interference proceedings declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, to determine priority of invention, or in post-grant challenge proceedings in the USPTO or a foreign patent office such as oppositions, inter-partes
review, post grant review, or a derivation proceeding, that challenge our entitlement to an invention or the patentability of one or more claims in our patent applications or issued patents. Such proceedings could result in substantial cost, even if
the eventual outcome is favorable to us. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The patent portfolios for our most advanced programs are summarized below. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in
which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a PCT application or a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-provisional</FONT> patent application. The term of a patent in the United States can be adjusted and extended due
to the failure of the United States Patent and Trademark Office following certain statutory and regulation deadlines for progressing prosecution and issuing a patent. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the United States, the patent term of a patent that covers an <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">FDA-approved</FONT> drug may also be
eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for a portion of the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond
the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of
product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-United</FONT> States jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that
covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our pharmaceutical products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. Although we intend to seek patent term extensions to any of our
issued patents in any jurisdiction where these are available there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and even if

competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies, and medical technology companies. Any product
candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There are a large number of companies developing or marketing pain therapies for the indications that we are pursuing. Many of our
competitors, including many of the organizations named below, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other
regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of competitors.
Small or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. We also compete with these companies in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific
personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe the key competitive factors that
will affect the development and commercial success of our product candidates, if approved for marketing, are likely to be their safety, efficacy and tolerability profile, reliability, convenience of dosing, price and reimbursement from government
and third party payers. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive
than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position
before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third party payers seeking to encourage the use of generic products. Generic products that broadly address these
indications are currently on the market for the indications that we are pursuing, and additional products are expected to become available on a generic basis over the coming years. If our product candidates achieve marketing approval, we expect that
they will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic products. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If our product candidates are approved for the

Additionally, patients may try several other agents such as gabapentin, naltrexone, and UVB light therapy, generally with limited success. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Because of the substantial unmet need for products that are safe and effective in uremic pruritus, there are several companies involved in the
discovery, development, and/or marketing of such products. Such product candidates include nalbuphine, asimadoline, nalfurafine and serlopitant. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Oral CR845.</I></B> We are developing Oral CR845 for the management of
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">moderate-to-severe</FONT></FONT> acute and chronic pain. The market for the management of
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">moderate-to-severe</FONT></FONT> acute and chronic pain is highly fragmented and includes numerous generic as well as brand name products, including oral formulations of NSAIDs and
controlled-release mu opioids. Common NSAIDs include Celebrex, which is marketed by Pfizer, and naproxen and ibuprofen, which are available generically. Common branded oral mu opioids include, among others: Avinza, an extended-release morphine
sulfate capsule marketed by Pfizer; EXALGO, an extended-release hydromorphone hydrochloride tablet marketed by Mallinckrodt; KADIAN, an extended-release morphine sulfate capsule marketed by Allergan; NUCYNTA ER, an extended release formulation of
tapentadol marketed by Depomed and OxyContin, a controlled-release oxycodone hydrochloride tablet marketed by Purdue Pharma. In addition to oral therapies, Janssen Pharmaceuticals markets Duragesic, a fentanyl transdermal patch. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Because of the size of the chronic pain market and the substantial unmet need for products that are safe and effective, there are a large
number of companies involved in the discovery, development, and/or marketing of such products. These product candidates include immediate release and extended release formulations of various NSAIDs and mu opioids. These include combination products
that include mu opioid combined with an NSAID or acetaminophen, such as Vicodin (hydrocodone and acetaminophen) and Percocet (oxycodone and acetaminophen). Additionally, there are other product candidates in development with <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-opioid</FONT> mechanisms of action. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>CR701.</I></B> We plan to develop CR701 for neuropathic pain
indications such as postherpetic neuralgia, or PHN, and neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, or DPN. If approved for marketing, CR701 will compete against more established products that have been approved for treatment of
various neuropathic pain indications. One of the most widely-prescribed drug in the United States for treatment of neuropathic pain is gabapentin, which is marketed by Pfizer and is also available generically. Gralise, a once-daily tablet
formulation of gabapentin for the treatment of PHN, is marketed by Depomed. Pfizer markets Lyrica, an oral anticonvulsant, for use in the treatment of PHN and neuropathic pain associated with DPN. Depomed also markets Nucynta ER, an extended-release
mu opioid tablet, for neuropathic pain associated with DPN. Topical prescription products currently marketed in the United States for neuropathic pain indications include Lidoderm, a lidocaine patch marketed by Endo Pharmaceuticals for PHN, and
Qutenza, a capsaicin patch marketed by Acorda Therapeutics for PHN. </P>

approved for treatment of other diseases are used by physicians to treat PHN, and it is possible that other such products will be shown to exhibit efficacy in the future and thereby emerge as competitors to CR701 for the treatment of different types
of neuropathic pain. There are many other companies working to develop new drugs and other therapies to treat neuropathic pain. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Manufacturing </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We do not have any manufacturing facilities. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of our
product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture if our product candidates receive marketing approval. At this time, none of our contract manufacturing agreements limit where, or with whom we can
contract for commercial manufacture or distribution. It is our intention that by the time of any regulatory approvals for commercialization, we will have negotiated long-term commitments with at least one primary and one secondary supplier for each
manufacturing and distribution function. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">All of our product candidates are either small peptides or organic small molecules and are
manufactured in reliable and reproducible synthetic processes from readily available starting materials. The chemistry is amenable to scale up and does not require any special equipment or technology in the manufacturing process. We expect to
continue to develop product candidates that can be produced cost-effectively at contract manufacturing facilities.<B> </B> </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Government Regulation and

the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local
and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after
approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA&#146;s refusal to approve pending NDAs, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning or untitled letters,
product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. </P>

formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature,
among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Manufacture of drug substance, drug product and the labeling and distribution of clinical supplies must all comply with cGMP standards. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is
submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on a clinical hold. In such a case,
the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Clinical Trials. </I></B>Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the
supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with cGCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are
conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol
amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must
continue to oversee the clinical trial while it is being conducted. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on their
ClinicalTrials.gov website. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined.
In Phase 1, the drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an initial
indication of its effectiveness. In Phase 2, the drug typically is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted
diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. In Phase 3, the drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough
data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious
adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various
grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in
accordance with the IRB&#146;s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Marketing
Approval. </I></B>Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product&#146;s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed
labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee. Under the
Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has agreed to certain performance goals regarding the timing of its review of an application. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, an NDA or supplement to an NDA
must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the
product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from
the pediatric data requirements. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to mitigate
any identified or suspected serious risks and ensure safe use of the drug. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods,
patient registries or other risk minimization tools. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after
submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be
resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">in-depth</FONT>
substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the
product&#146;s continued safety, quality and purity. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an external advisory committee.
An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is
not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Before
approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured, referred to as a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Pre-Approval</FONT> Inspection. The FDA will not approve an application unless it
determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will
typically inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with cGCP. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The testing and approval process for an NDA requires
substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take several years to complete. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit
or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval of an NDA on a timely basis, or at all. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">After evaluating the NDA and all
related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response
letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for FDA to reconsider the
application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA&#146;s satisfaction,
the FDA may issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. For some products, an additional step of DEA review and scheduling is required. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or
precautions be included in the product labeling, including a boxed warning, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug&#146;s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance
programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management </P>

post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and
FDA review and approval. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Post-Approval Requirements. </I></B>Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are
subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion, reporting of adverse experiences with
the product, and compliance with any post-approval requirements imposed as a condition of approval, such as Phase 4 clinical trials and surveillance to assess safety and effectiveness after commercialization. After approval, most changes to the
approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products
are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data. In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their
establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated
and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third party
manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or

marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Although physicians, in the practice of medicine, may prescribe approved drugs for unapproved indications, pharmaceutical companies generally are required to

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">I.V. CR845, Oral CR845 or our other product candidates, if approved, may be regulated as a &#147;controlled substance&#148; as defined in the
Controlled Substances Act of 1970, or CSA, which establishes registration, security, recordkeeping, reporting, storage, distribution and other requirements administered by the DEA. The DEA is concerned with the control of handlers of controlled
substances, and with the equipment and raw materials used in their manufacture and packaging, in order to prevent loss and diversion into illicit channels of commerce. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The DEA regulates controlled substances as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances. Schedule I substances by definition have no established
medicinal use, and may not be marketed or sold in the United States. A pharmaceutical product may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V, with Schedule II substances considered to present the highest risk of abuse and Schedule V substances the
lowest relative risk of abuse among such substances. The manufacture, shipment, storage, sale and use of Schedule II substances are subject to a high degree of regulation. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Annual registration is required for any facility that manufactures, distributes, dispenses, imports or exports any controlled substance. The
registration is specific to the particular location, activity and controlled substance schedule. For example, separate registrations are needed for import and manufacturing, and each registration will specify which schedules of controlled substances
are authorized. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The DEA typically inspects a facility to review its security measures prior to issuing a registration. Security
requirements vary by controlled substance schedule, with the most stringent requirements applying to Schedule I and Schedule II substances. Required security measures include background checks on employees and physical control of inventory through
measures such as cages, surveillance cameras and inventory reconciliations. Records must be maintained for the handling of all controlled substances, and periodic reports made to the DEA, for example distribution reports for Schedule I and II
controlled substances, Schedule III substances that are narcotics, and other designated substances. Reports must also be made for thefts or losses of any controlled substance, and to obtain authorization to destroy any controlled substance. In
addition, special authorization and notification requirements apply to imports and exports. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, a DEA quota system controls and
limits the availability and production of controlled substances in Schedule I or II. Distributions of any Schedule I or II controlled substance must also be accompanied by special order forms, with copies provided to the DEA. The DEA may adjust
aggregate production quotas and individual production and procurement quotas from time to time during the year, although the DEA has substantial discretion in whether or not to make such adjustments. Our quota of an active ingredient may not be
sufficient to meet commercial demand or complete clinical trials. Any delay or refusal by the DEA in establishing our quota for controlled substances could delay or stop our clinical trials or product launches. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">To meet its responsibilities, the DEA conducts periodic inspections of registered establishments that handle controlled substances. Individual
states also regulate controlled substances, and we and our collaborators will be subject to state regulation with respect to the distribution of these products. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, federal and state health care regulatory laws restrict business
practices in the biopharmaceutical industry. These laws include, among other things, anti-kickback and false claims laws and regulations, physician payment transparency laws and regulations, as well as data privacy and security laws and regulations.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying,
soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, or order of any item or
service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term &#147;remuneration&#148; has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements
between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. Practices

alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the
requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">case-by-case</FONT></FONT> basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Additionally, the intent standard under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as
amended by the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the &#147;Health Care Reform Law&#148;), to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate
it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Health Care Reform Law provided that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false
or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Federal false claims laws, including the federal civil False
Claims Act prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made
or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes &#147;any request or demand&#148; for money or property presented to the U.S. government. The civil False Claims Act has been
used to assert liability on the basis of kickbacks and other improper referrals, improperly reported government pricing metrics such as Best Price or Average Manufacturer Price, improper use of Medicare provider or supplier numbers when detailing a
provider of services, improper promotion of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">off-label</FONT> uses not expressly approved by FDA in a drug&#146;s label, and allegations as to misrepresentations with respect to the services rendered. Additionally,
the civil monetary penalties statute, which, among other things, imposes fines against any person or entity who is determined to have presented, or caused to be presented, claims to a federal healthcare program that the person knows, or should know,
is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. Additionally, the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit
knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any
healthcare benefit program, including private third party payers and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in
connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters. Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid
and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payer. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and
security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their respective implementing
regulations, including the Final HIPAA Omnibus Rule published on January&nbsp;25, 2013, imposes specified requirements on certain types of individuals and entities subject to the law, such as healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare
clearinghouses, relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes security standards and certain privacy standards directly applicable to the business associates of
covered entities that perform services for them that involve the creation, use, maintenance or disclosure of, individually identifiable health information. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil
and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney&#146;s fees and
costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws may govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same
effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Additionally, federal transparency laws, including the federal Physician Payment Sunshine
Act created under Section&nbsp;6002 of the Health Care Reform Law and its implementing regulations, require that manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the
Children&#146;s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) report annually to the Centers for Medicare&nbsp;&amp; Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians

Additionally, applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations are required to report annually to CMS certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians (as defined above) and their immediate family members. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There are also an increasing number of analogous state laws that require manufacturers to file reports with states on pricing and marketing
information, such as tracking and reporting of gifts, compensations, other remuneration and items of value provided to healthcare professionals and healthcare entities. Many of these laws contain ambiguities as to what is required to comply with
such laws. For example, several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to, among other things, establish and implement commercial compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures
on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities and/or register their sales representatives. Certain state laws also regulate manufacturers&#146; use of prescriber-identifiable data. These laws may affect our future sales,
marketing and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens. In addition, given the lack of clarity with respect to these laws and their implementation, our reporting actions once we commercialize could be subject to
the penalty provisions of the pertinent state and federal authorities. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the
health regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including criminal and significant civil monetary penalties, damages, fines, individual imprisonment, exclusion from participation in
government healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to
resolve allegations of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-compliance</FONT> with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of
operations. To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance,
anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals. </P>

commercial success of our product candidates and our ability to commercialize any approved product candidates successfully will depend in part on the extent to which governmental payer programs at the federal and state levels, including Medicare and
Medicaid, private health insurers and other third-party payers provide coverage for and establish adequate reimbursement levels for our product candidates. In the United States, private health insurers and other third party payers often provide
reimbursement for products and services based on the level at which the government provides reimbursement through the Medicare or Medicaid programs for such products and services. In the United States, the European Union and other potentially
significant markets for our product candidates, government authorities and third party payers are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative products and therapies,
which often has resulted in average selling prices lower than they would otherwise be. Further, the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States and on country and regional pricing and reimbursement controls in the European Union
will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and utilization, which may adversely affect our future product sales and results of operations. For example, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed
bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the cost of drugs under Medicare, and reform government program reimbursement
methodologies for drugs. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, judicial decisions and laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, pharmaceutical coverage and reimbursement policies
and pricing in general. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services
generally rely on third-party payers to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. In addition, many U.S. hospitals receive a fixed reimbursement amount per procedure for certain surgeries and other treatment therapies they perform,
or a predetermined rate for all hospital inpatient care provided as payment in full. Because this amount may not be based on the actual expenses the hospital incurs, hospitals may choose to use therapies which are less expensive when compared to our
product candidates. Sales of our product </P>

candidates will therefore depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of our products will be paid by health maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit
and similar healthcare management organizations, or reimbursed by government health administration authorities, such as Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers and other third-party payers. Third-party payers are increasingly imposing
additional requirements and restrictions on coverage and limiting reimbursement levels for medical products, including pharmaceuticals. For example, federal and state governments reimburse covered prescription drugs at varying rates generally below
average wholesale price. These restrictions and limitations influence the purchase of healthcare services and products. Third-party payers may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of
the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">FDA-approved</FONT> drug products for a particular indication. Additionally, third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical
products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. Therefore, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs
required to obtain the FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. Moreover, a payer&#146;s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate
will be approved, and one payer&#146;s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payers will also provide coverage. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels
sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in drug development. Legislative proposals to reform healthcare or reduce costs under government insurance programs may result in lower reimbursement for our products and product
candidates or exclusion of our products and product candidates from coverage. The cost containment measures that healthcare payers and providers are instituting and any healthcare reform could significantly reduce our revenues from the sale of any
approved product candidates. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Healthcare Regulatory Developments </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, the legislative landscape with respect to healthcare continues to evolve. There have been
a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payers in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting
changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly
affected by major legislative initiatives. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For example, the Health Care Reform Law was passed in March 2010 and includes provisions that
have substantially changed healthcare financing by both governmental and private insurers. Among other provisions that could have an impact on our business, the Health Care Reform Law, among other things, revised the methodology by which rebates
owed by manufacturers to the state and federal government for covered outpatient drugs under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program,
extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals&nbsp;enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, subjected manufacturers to new annual fees and taxes for certain branded prescription drugs, and provided
incentives to programs that increase the federal government&#146;s comparative effectiveness research. Additionally, the Health Care Reform Law implemented a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program in which manufacturers must agree to
offer 50% <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">point-of-sale</FONT></FONT> discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period as a condition for the
outpatient drugs being covered under Medicare Part D. The Health Care Reform Law&#146;s future impact on our business is unclear. There have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Health Care Reform Law. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In January, Congress voted to adopt a budget resolution for fiscal year 2017, or the Budget Resolution, that authorizes the implementation of
legislation that would repeal portions of the Health Care Reform Law. The Budget Resolution is not a law, however, it is widely viewed as the first step toward the passage of repeal legislation. Further, on January&nbsp;20, 2017, President Trump
signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the Health Care Reform Law to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the Health Care Reform Law that would
impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. Congress also could consider subsequent legislation to replace elements of the Health Care
Reform Law that are repealed. In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Health Care Reform Law was enacted. In </P>

August 2011, the President signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend proposals in
spending reductions to Congress. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction did not achieve its targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation&#146;s automatic reductions to
several government programs. These reductions include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2%&nbsp;per fiscal year starting in 2013 and, following passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, will remain in effect until
2025, unless additional congressional action is taken. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the
statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These and other healthcare reform initiatives may result in additional reductions in Medicare payments and other healthcare funding,
which could have a material adverse effect on our financial operations. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments
will pay for healthcare products and services, which could further limit the prices we are able to charge, or the amounts of reimbursement available, for our product candidates once they are approved.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>

market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization,
commercial sales and distribution of our products. For example, in the European Union, we must obtain authorization of a clinical trial application, or CTA, in each member state in which we intend to conduct a clinical trial. Whether or not we
obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval
process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA
approval. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. </P>

For the last several years, we have focused our efforts primarily on developing I.V. and Oral CR845 with the goal of achieving regulatory approval. Since inception, we have incurred significant operating and net losses. Our net losses were
$57.3&nbsp;million, $24.7&nbsp;million and $17.7&nbsp;million for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2016, December&nbsp;31, 2015 and December&nbsp;31, 2014, respectively. As of December&nbsp;31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of
$162.2&nbsp;million. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating and net losses over the next several years, as we continue to develop I.V. and Oral CR845 and our other product candidates. Our net losses may fluctuate
significantly from year to year, depending on the timing of our clinical trials, the receipt of additional milestone payments, if any, under our collaborations with Maruishi and CKD, the receipt of payments under any future collaborations we may
enter into, and our expenditures on other R&amp;D activities. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, we expect to incur significant sales, marketing and

was removed in April 2016 and we resumed the clinical trial in June 2016. In addition to this clinical development, I.V. CR845 will require regulatory approval, commercial manufacturing arrangements, establishment of a commercial organization,
significant marketing efforts and further investment before we generate any revenues from product sales. We are not permitted to market or promote any of our product candidates, including I.V. CR845, before we receive regulatory approval from the
FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, and we may never receive such regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. If we do not receive FDA approval for, and successfully commercialize, I.V. CR845, we will not be able to generate

development of product candidates based on peripheral kappa opioid receptor agonists is an emerging field, and the scientific discoveries that form the basis for our efforts to discover and develop product candidates that work through this mechanism
are relatively recent. The scientific evidence to support the feasibility of developing differentiated product candidates based on these discoveries is both preliminary and limited. We believe that we are among a relatively small group of companies
that are pursuing the development of product candidates based on peripherally acting kappa opioid receptor agonists. In addition, we believe that companies that previously explored the development of kappa opioid receptor agonists abandoned these
efforts because those prior generation kappa agonists, which were centrally active, resulted in psychiatric side effects. Although CR845 is a peripherally acting kappa opioid receptor agonist and these side effects have not been observed in any of
our clinical trials to date, it is possible that we could observe similar side effects, or other unacceptable adverse events. As a result, our approach to developing product candidates based on peripheral kappa opioid receptor agonists may not be

refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data is insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies. In addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing
could delay, limit or prevent marketing approval of a product candidate. Any marketing approval we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the approved product not commercially viable.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Finally, even if we were to obtain approval, regulatory authorities may approve any of our product candidates for fewer or more limited
indications than we request, may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials, or may approve a product candidate with a label that does not include the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the
successful commercialization of that product candidate. Any of these scenarios could compromise the commercial prospects for our product candidates to assure safe use of the product candidates, either as a condition of product candidate approval or
on the basis of new safety information. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If we experience delays in obtaining approval, if we fail to obtain approval of a product
candidate or if the label for a product candidate does not include the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of that product candidate, the commercial prospects for such product candidate may be harmed and our
ability to generate revenues will be materially impaired. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>The FDA may determine that I.V. CR845, or any of our other product

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Undesirable side effects caused by our product candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to limit dosage in development or interrupt,
delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other comparable foreign authorities. For example, in February 2016, the FDA placed our adaptive pivotal trial of
I.V. CR845 for postoperative pain on IND clinical hold pending a safety review. The clinical hold was based on a stopping rule related to elevated serum sodium levels of greater than 150 mmol/L. After the safety review was completed, the FDA removed
this clinical hold in April 2016 and the clinical trial was resumed in June 2016. If other concerns are raised regarding the safety of a new drug as a result of undesirable side effects identified during clinical testing, the FDA may order us to
cease further development, decline to approve the drug or issue a letter requesting additional data or information prior to making a final decision regarding whether or not to approve the drug. The number of such requests for additional data or
information issued by the FDA in recent years has increased, and resulted in substantial delays in the approval of several new drugs. Undesirable side effects caused by I.V. CR845 or any of our other product candidates could also result in denial of
regulatory approval by the FDA or other regulatory authorities for any or all targeted indications or the inclusion of unfavorable information in our product labeling, and in turn prevent us from commercializing and generating revenues from the sale
of I.V. CR845 or any other product candidate. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">To date, the side effects observed in the completed I.V. CR845 clinical trials include
dizziness, transient facial tingling, a state of near-sleep, or somnolence, and hypernatremia, an electrolyte disturbance that is defined by an elevated sodium level in the blood, which we believe is secondary, at least in part, to another side
effect, aquaresis, that is defined as electrolyte-free urination. As described above, the observation of mild to moderate hypernatremia in our ongoing adaptive pivotal trial for postoperative pain triggered a stopping rule in the trial protocol and
led the FDA to institute an IND clinical hold related to the trial, pending a safety review. Prolonged aquaresis can result in a negative fluid balance if the excreted water is not replaced by oral or intravenous fluids, and although we recommend
steps to control fluid balance, we cannot be certain that such instructions will be followed by healthcare providers and/or patients, and failure to follow such instructions may be accompanied by adverse events associated with negative fluid
balance, including disability and death. We believe that one such adverse event, which has been observed, postural tachycardia, an elevation of heart rate upon standing up, is a physiological reflex that can be triggered as a result of decreased
intravascular volume caused by a negative fluid balance. We have observed transient prolactin elevations, which are brief increases in the concentration of the hormone prolactin in the bloodstream, in response to I.V. CR845, which we have measured
as a nonselective opioid biomarker since both kappa and mu opioids elicit this effect. We cannot be certain that such elevations in prolactin will be transient, safe, and well tolerated in all patients. In addition, previously developed kappa opioid
agonists, the pharmacological class of drugs that I.V. CR845 belongs to, have been associated with poorly tolerated psychiatric side effects, such as a feeling of emotional and mental discomfort, or dysphoria, and hallucinations, at high doses,

intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on
one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. For drugs that have been designated as breakthrough therapies, interaction and communication between the FDA and the sponsor
of the trial can help to identify the most efficient path for clinical development while minimizing the number of patients placed in ineffective control regimens. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies by the FDA may also be eligible for
accelerated approval if the relevant criteria are met. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Designation as a breakthrough therapy is within the discretion of the FDA.
Accordingly, even if we believe I.V. CR845 meets the criteria for designation as a breakthrough therapy, the FDA may disagree and instead determine not to make such designation. In any event, the receipt of a breakthrough therapy designation for a
product candidate may not result in a faster development process, review or approval compared to drugs considered for approval under conventional FDA procedures and does not assure ultimate approval by the FDA. In addition, even if I.V. CR845
qualifies as a breakthrough therapy, the FDA may later decide that it no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. </P>

inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients for our clinical trials would result in significant delays and could require us to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether. Our current development plan for I.V. CR845 contemplates
recruiting and enrolling more than a thousand patients for our Phase 3 clinical trials. We may encounter difficulties and/or delays in completing our planned enrollments. Enrollment delays in our clinical trials may result in increased development

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Many currently approved mu opioid receptor agonists require REMS as part of their approval by the FDA. REMS programs may require medication
guides for patients, special communication plans to healthcare professionals or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and/or other risk minimization tools. While CR845 has been well tolerated in
clinical trials to date and has not shown any evidence of the euphoria that has led to misuse, abuse and addiction of mu opioids, including the results of our Human Abuse Liability, or HAL, trial, which we successfully completed in the fourth
quarter of 2014, the FDA may still determine that CR845-based products require a REMS program. We cannot predict whether REMS will be required as part of the FDA&#146;s approval of our product candidates and, if required, what those requirements
might be. Any limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of our product candidates, if approved. If a REMS program is required, depending on the extent of the REMS
requirements, the program might significantly increase our costs to commercialize these product candidates. Furthermore, risks of our product candidates that are not adequately addressed through proposed REMS for such product candidates may also
prevent or delay their approval for commercialization. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, currently approved mu opioids with which CR845-based products may
compete are controlled substances, which are subject to state, federal and foreign laws and regulations regarding their manufacture, use, sale, importation, exportation and distribution. Controlled substances are regulated under the federal
Controlled Substances Act of 1970 and regulations of the DEA. The DEA regulates controlled substances as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances. Schedule I substances by definition have no established medicinal use and may not be marketed or sold
in the United States. A pharmaceutical product may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V, with Schedule II substances considered to present the highest risk of abuse and Schedule V substances the lowest relative risk of abuse among such substances.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The results from our HAL trial suggest that CR845 may have the potential to be a Schedule V or

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Various states also independently regulate controlled substances. Though state controlled
substances laws often mirror federal law, because the states are separate jurisdictions, they may separately schedule drugs as well. While some states automatically schedule a drug when the DEA does so, in other states there must be rulemaking or a
legislative action. State scheduling may delay commercial sale of any controlled substance drug product for which we obtain federal regulatory approval and adverse scheduling could impair the commercial attractiveness of such product. We or our
collaborators may also be requested to obtain separate state registrations in order to be able to obtain, handle and distribute controlled substances for clinical trials or commercial sale, and failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements
could lead to enforcement and sanctions from the states in addition to those from the DEA or otherwise arising under federal law. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If any
of our product candidates are classified as controlled substances, we and our suppliers, manufacturers, contractors, customers and distributors would be required to obtain and maintain applicable registrations from state, federal and foreign law
enforcement and regulatory agencies and comply with state, federal and foreign laws and regulations regarding the manufacture, use, sale, importation, exportation and distribution of controlled substances. Also, if any of our product candidates that
were classified as controlled substances, there is a risk that DEA regulations could limit the supply of the compounds used in clinical trials and, in the future, the ability to produce and distribute our products in the volume needed to meet
commercial demand. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Regulations associated with controlled substances govern manufacturing, labeling, packaging, testing, dispensing,
production and procurement quotas, record keeping, reporting, handling, shipment and disposal. These regulations increase the personnel needs and the expense associated with development and commercialization of product candidates including
controlled substances. The DEA, and some states, conduct periodic inspections of registered establishments that handle controlled substances. Failure to obtain and maintain required registrations or comply with any applicable regulations could delay
or preclude us from developing and commercializing our product candidates containing controlled substances and subject us to enforcement action. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations or initiate proceedings to
revoke those registrations. In some circumstances, violations could lead to criminal proceedings. Because of the restrictive nature of these regulations, if it were determined that our product candidates are subject to these restrictions, the
commercialization of our product candidates could be limited. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Failure to obtain marketing approval in international jurisdictions

testing. The time required to obtain approval may differ substantially from that required to obtain FDA approval. The regulatory approval process outside the United States generally includes all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval.
In addition, in many countries outside the United States, it is required that the product be approved for reimbursement before the product can be approved for sale in that country. We or these third parties may not obtain approvals from regulatory
authorities outside the United States on a timely basis, if at all. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one regulatory authority outside the United States does
not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions or by the FDA. However, the failure to obtain approval in one jurisdiction may compromise our ability to obtain approval elsewhere. We may not be able to file for
marketing approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our products in any market. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Regulatory approval is

There are a number of large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that currently market and sell products or are pursuing the development of products for the treatment of pain. Potential competitors also include academic institutions,

more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may
obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payers
seeking to encourage the use of generic products. Generic products are currently on the market for the indications that we are pursuing, and additional products are expected to become available on a generic basis over the coming years. If our

candidates, and do not plan to independently conduct clinical trials of any other potential product candidates. We expect to continue to rely on third parties, such as CROs, clinical data management organizations, medical institutions and clinical
investigators, to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials. These agreements might terminate for a variety of reasons, including a failure to perform by the third parties. If we need to enter into alternative arrangements, that would
delay our product development activities and adversely affect our business. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our reliance on these third parties for development
activities will reduce our control over these activities. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory and scientific standards and our reliance on
the CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. For example, we will remain responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial and
for ensuring that our preclinical trials are conducted in accordance with GLP, as appropriate. Moreover, the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities require us to comply with standards, commonly referred to as good clinical practices, or
GCPs, for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial participants are protected. Regulatory
authorities enforce these requirements through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, clinical investigators and trial sites. If we or any of our CROs fail to comply with applicable GCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be
deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot assure you that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority,
such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical trials complies with GCP regulations. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with product produced under cGMP regulations. Our failure to comply with these regulations may
require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process. We also are required to register certain clinical trials and post the results of certain completed clinical trials on a government-sponsored database,
ClinicalTrials.gov, within specified timeframes. Failure to do so can result in fines, adverse publicity and civil and criminal sanctions. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our CROs may also have relationships with other entities, some of which may be our competitors. In addition, our CROs are not our employees,
and except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such CROs, we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">on-going</FONT> clinical,
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-clinical</FONT> and preclinical programs. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines or conduct our preclinical studies or clinical trials in accordance
with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols, if they need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols, regulatory requirements or for
other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated and we may not be able to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, marketing approvals for our product candidates and will not be able to, or may be delayed in our efforts to,
successfully commercialize our product candidates. As a result, our results of operations and the commercial prospects for our product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed. </P>

do so on commercially reasonable terms. Switching or adding additional CROs involves additional cost and requires management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new CRO commences work. As a result, delays could
occur, which could compromise our ability to meet our desired development timelines. Though we carefully manage our relationships with our CROs, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter similar challenges or delays in the future or that
these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and prospects. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>If the

candidates, for which we obtain approval in the future. Any problems or delays we experience in preparing for commercial-scale manufacturing of a product candidate may result in a delay in FDA
approval of the product candidate or may impair our ability to manufacture commercial quantities, which would adversely affect our business. For example, our manufacturers will need to produce specific batches of our product candidates to
demonstrate acceptable stability under various conditions and for commercially viable lengths of time. We and our contract manufacturers will need to demonstrate to the FDA and other regulatory authorities this acceptable stability data for our
product candidates, as well as validate methods and manufacturing processes, in order to receive regulatory approval to commercialize I.V. CR845 or any of our other product candidates. Furthermore, if our commercial manufacturers fail to deliver the
required commercial quantities of bulk drug substance or finished product on a timely basis and at commercially reasonable prices, we would likely be unable to meet demand for our products and we would lose potential revenues. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We only have one contract manufacturer for each of I.V. CR845 and Oral CR845 for use in our clinical trials; Polypeptide for I.V. CR845 and
Enteris for Oral CR845. In addition, we do not have any long-term commitments from our suppliers of clinical trial material or guaranteed prices for our product candidates. The manufacture of pharmaceutical products requires significant expertise
and capital investment, including the development of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls. Manufacturers of pharmaceutical products often encounter difficulties in production, particularly in scaling up initial production. These
problems include difficulties with production costs and yields, quality control, including stability of the product candidate and quality assurance testing, shortages of qualified personnel, as well as compliance with strictly enforced federal,
state and foreign regulations. Our manufacturers may not perform as agreed. If our manufacturers were to encounter any of these difficulties, our ability to provide product candidates to patients in our clinical trials would be jeopardized. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Further, we may rely on proprietary technology developed by our contract manufacturers for purposes of manufacturing certain of our product
candidates and our failure to negotiate the long-term use of any such proprietary technology may lead to delays or interruptions in the regulatory approval or commercialization process, as well as increased costs. For example, we have developed a
formulation of Oral CR845 based on proprietary technology of Enteris. Under our agreement with Enteris, it is providing to us clinical supplies for an oral tablet formulation of CR845 on a fee for service basis. Under the agreed scope of work for
this agreement, Enteris is using its proprietary formulation technology for oral delivery of peptides to provide a tablet formulation of CR845 with suitable characteristics to use in clinical testing. We have not yet negotiated terms related to our
use of such technology for commercial manufacturing of Oral CR845 and we may not be able to do so on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we fail to enter into an agreement to use such proprietary technology, we may be forced to reformulate
Oral CR845 which could result in significantly delaying commercializing Oral CR845 and require us to incur additional costs in connection with such reformulation and potentially needed to seek additional approvals from the FDA. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, all manufacturers of our product candidates must comply with cGMP requirements enforced by the FDA through its facilities
inspection program. These requirements include quality control, quality assurance and the maintenance of records and documentation. Manufacturers of our product candidates may be unable to comply with these cGMP requirements and with other FDA,
state and foreign regulatory requirements. If our contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA or other regulatory authorities, they will not be
able to secure and/or maintain regulatory approval for their manufacturing facilities. We have little control over our manufacturers&#146; compliance with these regulations and standards. If the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority does
not approve these facilities for the manufacture of our product candidates or if it withdraws any such approval in the future, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would significantly impact our ability to develop, obtain
regulatory approval for or market our product candidates, if approved. A failure to comply with these requirements may result in fines and civil penalties, suspension of production, suspension, delay or denial of product approval, product seizure or
recall, or withdrawal of product approval. If the safety of any quantities supplied is compromised due to our manufacturers&#146; failure to adhere to applicable laws or for other reasons, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or
successfully commercialize our product candidates. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Collaborators generally have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaboration

pharmacists, and hospital pharmacy and therapeutics committees, which are commonly referred to as P&amp;T committees. Generally, even if I.V. CR845 is approved by the FDA, before we can attempt to sell I.V. CR845 in a hospital, I.V. CR845 must be
approved for addition to that hospital&#146;s list of approved drugs, or formulary list, by the hospital&#146;s P&amp;T committee. A hospital&#146;s P&amp;T committee typically governs all matters pertaining to the use of medications within the
institution, including review of medication formulary data and recommendations for the appropriate use of drugs within the institution to the medical staff. The frequency of P&amp;T committee meetings at various hospitals varies considerably, and
P&amp;T committees often require additional information to aid in their decision-making process, so we may experience substantial delays in obtaining formulary approvals. Additionally, hospital pharmacists may be concerned that the cost of acquiring
I.V. CR845 for use in their institutions will adversely impact their overall pharmacy budgets, which could cause pharmacists to resist efforts to add I.V. CR845 to the formulary, or to implement restrictions on the usage of the drug in order to

possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies continue to be prosecuted under the federal false claims laws for numerous activities,
including those related to research, sales, marketing and promotional programs. In addition, recent health care reform legislation has strengthened these laws. For example, the Health Care Reform Law among other things, amends the intent requirement
of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and certain other criminal healthcare fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them in order to commit a violation. Moreover, the
Health Care Reform Law provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False
Claims Act. To the extent that any product we make is sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations. If we or our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other

third-party payers fail to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement and payment rates for I.V. CR845 or any of our other product candidates, if any, or if providers choose to use therapies that are less expensive, our revenue and prospects for

availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers. Such third-party payers include government health programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Coverage decisions
may depend upon clinical and economic standards that disfavor new drug products when more established or lower cost therapeutic alternatives are already available or subsequently become available. Assuming coverage is approved, the resulting
reimbursement payment rates might not be adequate. In particular, many U.S. hospitals receive a fixed reimbursement amount per procedure for certain surgeries and other treatment therapies they perform, or a predetermined rate for all hospital
inpatient care provided as payment in full. Also, I.V. CR845 for the treatment of pruritus in hemodialysis patients may be designated as a component of the government&#146;s bundled reimbursement for end stage renal disease treatment. Because, in
these instances, the amount of reimbursement that such providers receive may not be based on the actual expenses the provider incurs, providers may choose to use therapies which are less expensive when compared to our product candidates.
Accordingly, I.V. CR845 or any of our other product candidates, if approved, will face competition from other therapies and drugs for these limited provider financial resources. We may need to conduct post-marketing studies in order to demonstrate
the cost-effectiveness of any future products to the satisfaction of hospitals, other target customers and their third-party payers. Such studies might require us to commit a significant amount of management time and financial and other resources.
Our future products might not ultimately be considered cost-effective. Adequate third-party coverage and reimbursement might not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on investment in product
development. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Third-party payers, whether foreign or domestic, or governmental or commercial, are developing increasingly sophisticated
methods of controlling healthcare costs. In addition, in the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payers. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ
significantly from payer to payer. Further, we believe that future coverage and reimbursement will likely be subject to increased restrictions both in the United States and in international markets. Third-party coverage and reimbursement for our
products or product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval may not be available or adequate in either the United States or international markets, which could have a negative effect on our business, results of operations, financial

passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, will remain in effect until 2025, unless additional congressional action is taken. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things,
further reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare

may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved drug. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government healthcare programs may result in a similar
reduction in payments from private payers. In addition, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing
and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the cost of drugs under Medicare, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being

imposes new obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products, among others, related to product tracking and tracing, which will be phased in over several years beginning in 2015.&nbsp;Among the requirements of this new legislation,
manufacturers will be required to provide certain information regarding the drug product to individuals and entities to which product ownership is transferred, label drug product with a product identifier, and keep certain records regarding the drug
product.&nbsp;The transfer of information to subsequent product owners by manufacturers will eventually be required to be done electronically.&nbsp;Manufacturers will also be required to verify that purchasers of the manufacturers&#146; products are

January, Congress voted to adopt a budget resolution for fiscal year 2017, or the Budget Resolution, that authorizes the implementation of legislation that would repeal portions of the Health Care Reform Law. The Budget Resolution is not a law;
however, it is widely viewed as the first step toward the passage of repeal legislation. Further, on January&nbsp;20, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the Health
Care Reform Law to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the Health Care Reform Law that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or

prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product. To obtain coverage and
reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product candidate to other available therapies. There can be no assurance that our products will be
considered cost-effective by third-party payers, that an adequate level of reimbursement will be available or that the third-party payers&#146; reimbursement policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably. If

However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. While we use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets, our licensors, employees, consultants, contractors, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors may unintentionally or willfully
disclose our information to competitors. Enforcing a claim that a third party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets is expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States are

biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although no claims against us are currently pending, we may be subject to claims that these employees or we have inadvertently or otherwise used or
disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs
and be a distraction to management. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.

expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the
same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our
inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and further, may export otherwise infringing products
to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement rights are not as strong as those in the United States. These products may compete with our product candidates and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective
or sufficient to prevent them from competing. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending
intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our
patents generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or
interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be
commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license. </P>

product candidates can be challenged by competitors. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If I.V. CR845, Oral CR845 or our other product candidates are approved by the
FDA, one or more third parties may challenge the patents covering these product candidates, which could result in the invalidation of, or render unenforceable, some or all of the relevant patent claims. For example, if a third party files an
Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, for a generic drug product containing CR845, and relies in whole or in part on studies conducted by or for us, the third party will be required to certify to the FDA that either: (1)&nbsp;there is no patent
information listed in the FDA&#146;s Orange Book with respect to our NDA for I.V. CR845; (2)&nbsp;the patents listed in the Orange Book have expired; (3)&nbsp;the listed patents have not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is
sought after patent expiration; or (4)&nbsp;the listed patents are invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use or sale of the third-party&#146;s generic drug product. A certification that the new product will not infringe the Orange
Book-listed patents for CR845, or that such patents are invalid, is called a paragraph IV certification. If the third party submits a paragraph IV certification to the FDA, a notice of the paragraph IV certification must also be sent to us once the
third-party&#146;s ANDA is accepted for filing by the FDA. We may then initiate a lawsuit to defend the patents identified in the notice. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45&nbsp;days of receipt of the notice automatically prevents
the FDA from approving the third-party&#146;s ANDA until the earliest of 30&nbsp;months or the date on which the patent expires, the lawsuit is settled, or the court reaches a decision in the infringement lawsuit in favor of the third party. If we
do not file a patent infringement lawsuit within the required <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">45-day</FONT> period, the third-party&#146;s ANDA will not be subject to the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">30-month</FONT> stay. Litigation or other
proceedings to enforce or defend&nbsp;intellectual property rights are often very complex in nature, may be very expensive and time-consuming, may divert our management&#146;s attention from our core business, and may result in unfavorable results
that could adversely impact our ability to prevent third parties from competing with our products. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Risks Related to Employee Matters and Managing

are highly dependent on the skills and leadership of our management team, including Derek Chalmers, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Our senior management may terminate their employment with us at any time. If we lose one or more members
of our senior management team, our ability to successfully implement our business strategy could be seriously harmed. Replacing these employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in
our industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to develop, gain regulatory approval of and commercialize products successfully. Competition to hire from this limited pool is intense, and we may be unable to hire, train, retain or

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and regulations of The NASDAQ Global Market. Pursuant to Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Section&nbsp;404, we are required to perform system and process evaluation and testing of our

a material misstatement of our financial statements. Our internal control over financial reporting will not prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not
absolute, assurance that the control system&#146;s objectives will be met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur
or that all control issues and instances of fraud will be detected. If we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal controls, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, the market price of our

disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden
parachute payments not previously approved. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on
these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our net operating loss carryforwards and R&amp;D tax credits may expire and not be used. As of December&nbsp;31, 2016, we had federal and state
net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $151.6&nbsp;million and $145.2&nbsp;million, respectively, and we also had federal and state R&amp;D tax credit carryforwards of approximately $5.5&nbsp;million and $0.8&nbsp;million, respectively.
Our net operating loss carryforwards will begin expiring in 2026 for federal purposes and 2027 for state purposes if we have not used them prior to that time, and our federal tax credits will begin expiring in 2025 unless previously used. To the
extent that we have not exchanged our Connecticut research tax credits for a tax refund, those tax credits carryforward indefinitely. Additionally, our ability to use any net operating loss and credit carryforwards to offset taxable income or tax,
respectively, in the future will be limited under Internal Revenue Code Sections&nbsp;382 and 383, respectively, if we have a cumulative change in ownership of more than 50% within a three-year period. The completion of our initial public offering
in 2014 and our <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">follow-on</FONT> public offering in 2015, together with private placements and other transactions that have occurred, may trigger, or may have already triggered such an ownership change. In addition,
since we will need to raise substantial additional funding to finance our operations, we may undergo further ownership changes in the future. We have never completed an analysis as to whether such a change of ownership has occurred, but in such an
event, we will be limited regarding the amount of net operating loss carryforwards and research tax credits that could be utilized annually in the future to offset taxable income or tax, respectively. Any such annual limitation may significantly
reduce the utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards and research tax credits before they expire. In addition, certain states have suspended use of net operating loss carryforwards for certain taxable years, and other states are
considering similar measures. As a result, we may incur higher state income tax expense in the future. Depending on our future tax position, continued suspension of our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards in states in which we are
subject to income tax could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. </P>

January&nbsp;30, 2014, our registration statement on Form <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">S-1</FONT> (File No <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">333-192230)</FONT> was declared effective for our initial public offering, pursuant to which we
registered the offering and sale of 5,750,000 shares of common stock, $0.001 par value per share (including 750,000 shares issued upon the underwriters&#146; exercise of an option to purchase additional shares) at a public offering price of $11.00
per share for an aggregate public offering price of $63.3&nbsp;million. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As a result of the initial public offering, we received net
proceeds on February&nbsp;5, 2014 of approximately $58.8&nbsp;million from the sale of 5,750,000 shares of common stock, after deducting approximately $4.4&nbsp;million of underwriting discounts and commissions but before giving effect to any
offering expenses borne by us. In addition, we have paid approximately an additional $2.5&nbsp;million of offering expenses in connection with our IPO. None of such payments were direct or indirect payments to any of (i)&nbsp;our directors or
officers or their associates, (ii)&nbsp;persons owning 10&nbsp;percent or more of our common stock, or (iii)&nbsp;our affiliates. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There
has been no material change in the planned use of proceeds from our initial public offering from that described in the final prospectus related to the offering, which we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February&nbsp;3, 2014. As
of December&nbsp;31, 2016, we have used all of the proceeds from our initial public offering for clinical trials and payments to R&amp;D consultants. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing new chemical entities designed to alleviate pain
and pruritus by selectively targeting kappa opioid receptors. We are developing a novel and proprietary class of product candidates that target the body&#146;s peripheral nervous system. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We commenced operations in 2004, and our primary activities to date have been organizing and staffing our company, developing our product
candidates, including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials of CR845-based product candidates, and raising capital. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through sales of our equity and debt securities and payments from
license agreements. We have no products currently available for sale, and substantially all of our revenue to date has been revenue from license agreements, although we have received nominal amounts of revenue under research grants. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Product Development Pipeline </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The current status of the development of our product candidates is as follows: </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>I.V. CR845 for Treatment of Acute Postoperative Pain </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our most advanced product candidate, I.V. CR845, demonstrated significant pain relief and a favorable safety and tolerability profile in three
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trials in patients with acute postoperative pain, without inducing many of the undesirable side effects typically associated with currently available pain therapeutics. In addition, in
the fourth quarter of 2014, we successfully completed a Human Abuse Liability, or HAL, trial of I.V. CR845 in which I.V. CR845 met the primary endpoint of demonstrating statistically significant lower &#147;drug liking&#148; scores as compared to
the approved schedule IV opioid, pentazocine. We believe that the totality of results from the HAL trial are supportive of the potential for CR845 to be the first <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-scheduled</FONT> or low (Schedule V) scheduled
peripheral opioid for acute pain. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In September 2015, we initiated our Phase 3 clinical trial program for I.V. CR845 in postoperative pain
with the dosing of the first subjects in an adaptive pivotal trial in patients undergoing a range of abdominal surgeries. This trial is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group adaptive design trial with repeated
doses of I.V. CR845 or placebo administered both prior to and following abdominal surgery in male and female patients. The trial protocol initially included three dose levels of I.V. CR845 (1.0 ug/kg, 2.0 ug/kg and 5.0 ug/kg), which were compared to
placebo with an interim conditional power assessment to identify optimal doses to be used to complete the enrollment of this trial. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In
June 2016, we modified the trial protocol and resumed the trial as a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">three-arm</FONT> trial, testing two doses of CR845 (1.0 ug/kg and 0.5 ug/kg) versus placebo, based on a safety review by us, the trial&#146;s
Independent Data Monitoring Committee and the FDA of unblinded safety data from the first 90 patients dosed. The safety review was conducted in response to a clinical hold that the FDA placed on the trial in February 2016 and removed in April 2016
following the safety review. The clinical hold was based on a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-specified</FONT> stopping rule related to elevated serum sodium levels of greater than 150 mmol/L that was included in the clinical trial protocol.

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The revised trial is enrolling up to 450 patients undergoing various abdominal surgeries, all of
which are associated with <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">moderate-to-severe</FONT></FONT> postoperative pain, within the United States. The primary efficacy measure is the Change in Pain Intensity over the <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">24-hour</FONT> postoperative period using a common measurement method known as area under the curve, or AUC, using the patient-reported Numeric Rating Scale, or NRS, score collected at pre-specified time points through 24
hours. Postoperative nausea and vomiting is also being evaluated as a secondary efficacy measure. The impact of I.V. CR845 treatment on inflammatory biomarkers is also being explored. An interim conditional power analysis of our adaptive Phase 3
trial of I.V. CR845 for postoperative pain is expected in the second quarter of 2017. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Based on previous guidance from the FDA, we believe
we will require 1,500 total exposures to I.V. CR845, including all Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials, prior to submitting a new drug application, or NDA. We believe our planned clinical trials and our clinical trials completed to date will result
in a sufficient number of drug exposures to support an NDA. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Oral CR845 for Treatment of Osteoarthritis </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are also developing an oral version of CR845, or Oral CR845, for acute and chronic pain. In August 2015, we advanced our tablet formulation
of Oral CR845 into a Phase 2a clinical trial in patients with osteoarthritis, or OA, of the knee or hip. The Phase 2a trial was a single-blind, randomized, multiple ascending dose trial designed to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, or PK, and
effectiveness of oral CR845 tablets dosed over a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">two-week</FONT> treatment period in OA patients experiencing <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">moderate-to-severe</FONT></FONT> pain,
defined as &gt;4 on an <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">11-point</FONT> NRS at baseline. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In December 2015, we announced positive <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">top-line</FONT> results from this Phase 2a trial. The results showed a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">dose-related</FONT> reduction in mean baseline pain score up to 34% after two weeks, with statistically significant
reduction in mean rescue medication for the top 5.0 mg dose group of approximately 80&nbsp;percent. In this trial, all four tablet strengths were observed to be safe and well tolerated. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Phase 2a trial established therapeutic doses and a dosing regimen for a larger randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2b
trial, which we initiated during the third quarter of 2016. The Phase 2b trial is a trial of three tablet strengths of CR845, 1.0 mg, 2.5 mg and 5.0 mg, dosed twice-daily over an eight-week treatment period in approximately 330 OA patients
experiencing <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">moderate-to-severe</FONT></FONT> pain across the United States. The primary efficacy endpoint is the change from baseline at week eight, with respect to the weekly mean
of the daily pain intensity score using an NRS. Secondary endpoints include change from baseline in the WOMAC, the Patient Global Impression of Change, or PGIC, and amount of rescue medication used. We expect to report
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">top-line</FONT> data in the second quarter of 2017. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>I.V. CR845 for Treatment of Uremic (Chronic
Kidney Disease-Associated) Pruritus </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">CR845 has exhibited anti-pruritic, or anti-itch, potency in standard preclinical models. In July
2015, we reported positive <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">top-line</FONT> efficacy results from a Phase 2 <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">proof-of-concept</FONT></FONT> trial of I.V. CR845 for the treatment of
uremic pruritus, a systemic condition with high prevalence in dialysis patients, for which there are no approved therapeutics in the United States. We observed that I.V. CR845 demonstrated statistically significant results on the primary endpoint of
reducing worst itch intensity as well as the secondary endpoint of quality of life improvements<B>. </B>We also observed I.V. CR845 to have a favorable safety and tolerability profile in the trial. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In June 2016, we initiated a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">two-part</FONT> Phase 2/3 adaptive design trial of I.V. CR845 in dialysis
patients suffering from <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">moderate-to-severe</FONT></FONT> uremic pruritus. Part A of the trial, is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 160 patients of three doses
of I.V. CR845 (0.5ug/kg, 1.0 ug/kg and 1.5 ug/kg) administered three times per week after dialysis over an <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">8-week</FONT> period. Part B will be a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial in up to 240 patients
of one optimized dose of I.V. CR845 administered three times per week after dialysis over a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">12-week</FONT> treatment period. The primary endpoint will be reduction in worst itching scores from baseline values
measured on a standard NRS alongside secondary quantitative quality of life endpoints. We expect to report <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">top-line</FONT> data from Part A of this trial in the first quarter of 2017. </P>

agreement with Maruishi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., or Maruishi, in Japan, under which we granted Maruishi an exclusive license, or the Maruishi Agreement, to develop, manufacture and commercialize drug products containing CR845 in Japan in the acute
pain and uremic pruritus fields. We and Maruishi are each required to use commercially reasonable efforts, at our respective expense, to develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize CR845 in the United States and Japan, respectively. In
addition, we have provided Maruishi specific clinical development services for CR845 in Maruishi&#146;s field of use. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the terms of
the Maruishi Agreement, we received a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-refundable</FONT> and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-creditable</FONT> upfront license fee of $15.0&nbsp;million and are eligible to receive up to an aggregate of
$6.0&nbsp;million in clinical development milestones and $4.5&nbsp;million in regulatory milestones. In August 2014, we received a clinical development milestone payment of $0.5&nbsp;million upon completion by Maruishi of a Phase 1 clinical trial in
Japan related to CR845 in acute post-operative pain. In October 2015, we received a $1.7&nbsp;million milestone payment (net of contractual foreign currency exchange adjustments of $0.3 million) related to the initiation by Maruishi of a Phase 2
clinical trial of CR845 in Japan for uremic pruritus. We are also eligible to receive tiered royalties, with percentages ranging from the low double digits to the low twenties, based on net sales of products containing CR845 in Japan, if any, and
share in any <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">sub-license</FONT> fees. In addition, in connection with the Maruishi Agreement, Maruishi purchased 2,105,263 shares of our Junior A Preferred Stock for $3.80 per share, for an aggregate purchase price
of $8.0&nbsp;million, which shares were automatically converted into 842,105 shares of common stock upon the closing of our initial public offering in 2014. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In April 2012, we entered into a license agreement with Chong Kun Dang Pharmaceutical Corporation, or CKD, in South Korea, under which we
granted CKD an exclusive license, or the CKD Agreement, to develop, manufacture and commercialize drug products containing CR845 in South Korea. We and CKD are each required to use commercially reasonable efforts, at our respective expense, to
develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize CR845 in the United States and South Korea, respectively. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the terms of
the CKD Agreement, we received a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-refundable</FONT> and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-creditable</FONT> upfront license fee of $0.6&nbsp;million and are eligible to receive up to an aggregate of
$2.3&nbsp;million in clinical development milestones and $1.5&nbsp;million in regulatory milestones. We also issued 173,611 shares of our Junior Preferred Stock to CKD in consideration for $0.4&nbsp;million, which shares were automatically converted
into 69,444 shares of common stock upon the closing of our initial public offering in 2014. During 2012, we received $0.6&nbsp;million, net of foreign taxes, from CKD upon the achievement of clinical development milestones under the CKD Agreement.
During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, we met the milestone criteria, as set forth in the CKD Agreement, for completion of a Phase 1b trial of Oral CR845 in the United States and for completion of a Phase 2 trial of CR845 in uremic pruritus
patients in the United States, respectively. As a result, we received milestone payments totaling $0.6&nbsp;million (net of South Korean withholding tax) from CKD. We are also eligible to receive tiered royalties with percentages ranging from the
high single digits to the high teens, based on net sales of products containing CR845 in South Korea, if any, and share in any <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">sub-license</FONT> fees. </P>

have ceased. To date, we have earned a total of $3.5&nbsp;million in clinical development or regulatory milestone payments, net of contractual foreign currency adjustments and South Korean withholding taxes, but have not received any royalties,

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">To date, our R&amp;D expenses have related primarily to the development of CR845. R&amp;D expenses consist of expenses incurred in performing
R&amp;D activities, including compensation and benefits for full-time R&amp;D employees, facilities expenses, including laboratory <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">build-out</FONT> costs, overhead expenses, cost of laboratory supplies, clinical
trial and related clinical manufacturing expenses, third-party formulation expenses, fees paid to contract research organizations, or CROs, and other consultants, stock-based compensation for R&amp;D employees and
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-employee</FONT> consultants and other outside expenses. Our R&amp;D expenses also include expenses related to preclinical activities, such as drug discovery, target validation and lead optimization for CR845 and
our other, earlier stage programs. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">R&amp;D costs are expensed as incurred. <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Non-refundable</FONT> advance
payments for goods or services to be received in the future for use in R&amp;D activities are deferred and capitalized. The capitalized amounts are expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed. Most of our R&amp;D costs
have been external costs, which we track on a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">program-by</FONT> program basis. Our internal R&amp;D costs are primarily compensation expenses for our full-time R&amp;D employees. We do not track internal R&amp;D
costs on a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">program-by-program</FONT></FONT> basis. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">R&amp;D activities
are central to our business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of
later-stage clinical trials. Based on our current development plans, we presently expect that our R&amp;D expenses will continue near their current level through 2017. However, it is difficult to determine with certainty the duration and completion
costs of our current or future preclinical programs and clinical trials of our product candidates, or if, when or to what extent we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates that obtain regulatory
approval. We may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The duration, costs and timing of

</TABLE> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016 compared to the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, the net increase
in direct clinical trial costs and related consultant costs primarily resulted from increases totaling $22.3&nbsp;million resulting from the Phase 2/3 I.V. CR845 clinical trial in patients with uremic pruritus, the Phase 2b clinical trial of Oral
CR845 in OA patients, the Phase 3 I.V. CR845 adaptive pivotal clinical trial and the Phase 1 trial of Oral CR845 in hemodialysis patients, coupled with a net increase of $2.7&nbsp;million of CR845 drug manufacturing costs and a net increase of
$4.0&nbsp;million for toxicology studies. Those costs were partially offset by decreases totaling $4.4&nbsp;million in clinical trial costs primarily in connection with the completion of the Phase 2a Oral CR845 clinical trial in patients with OA, in
the fourth quarter of 2015, and the completion of the Phase 2a I.V. CR845 <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">proof-of-concept</FONT></FONT> trial in patients with uremic pruritus, in the third quarter of 2015. The
increase in stock-based compensation expense relates primarily to increased employee headcount, partially offset by a decrease in expense related to stock option awards granted to <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-employee</FONT> consultants,
which are marked to market each quarter, due to the decrease in the market price of our common stock. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense reflects the acceleration of amortization of the leasehold improvements at our Shelton,
Connecticut facility related to research and development activities prior to the relocation of our corporate headquarters (see Note 19 of Notes to Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">10-K).</FONT> The
increase in other R&amp;D operating expenses was primarily the result of an increase in payroll and related costs associated with R&amp;D personnel and rent, which includes recognition of all of the remaining rent expense allocable to research and
development activities due during the remaining term of the Shelton operating lease (see Note 19 of Notes to Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">10-K).</FONT> </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 compared to the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, the net increase in direct clinical trial costs
and related consultant costs primarily resulted from increases totaling $5.4&nbsp;million resulting from the I.V. CR845 Phase 2/3 adaptive study in patients with uremic pruritus and the Phase 2a Oral CR845 study in patients with OA, as well as a net
increase of $1.4&nbsp;million of CR845 drug manufacturing costs. Those costs were partially offset by decreases totaling $4.0&nbsp;million in clinical trial costs in connection with the I.V. CR845 HAL trial and the Oral CR845 Phase 1a/1b trials,
which were completed in 2014. There was also a net increase of $0.6&nbsp;million for toxicology studies. The increase in stock-based compensation expense mostly reflects an increase in the number of option grants, in part as a result of growth in
employee headcount. The increase in other R&amp;D operating expenses was primarily the result of an increase in payroll and related costs associated with R&amp;D personnel, recruiting costs and the cost of meetings and travel. </P>

professional fees and public/investor relations costs primarily included increases in public/investor relations costs and in accounting and auditing fees. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense reflects the acceleration of
amortization of our leasehold improvements at our Shelton, Connecticut facility related to general and administrative activities prior to the relocation of our corporate headquarters (see Note 19 of Notes to Financial Statements in this Annual
Report on Form <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">10-K).</FONT> The increase in other G&amp;A operating expenses included increases in payroll and related costs and in insurance and rent, which includes recognition of all of the remaining rent expense

public/investor relations costs primarily included increases in public/investor relations costs, in legal fees and in accounting and auditing fees. Those increases were partially offset by decreases in consultant fees and patent costs. The increase
in stock-based compensation expense primarily reflects additional option grants than in 2014, in part due to increased headcount. The increase in other G&amp;A operating expenses included increases in payroll and related costs, in connection with
increased headcount, and in insurance costs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>

of the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015; (2) higher interest rates in the 2016 period and a higher average balance of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016 as a result of our <FONT

a decline in interest income attributable to lower interest rates on a higher average balance of our portfolio of investments during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015. The decrease in the amount of interest income included in other income was
partially offset by an increase in dividend income during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Liquidity and Capital Resources </B></P>

thereof. On August&nbsp;4, 2015, we completed a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">follow-on</FONT> public offering of 4,327,956 shares of our common stock, including 564,516 shares sold pursuant to the full exercise by the underwriters of their
option to buy additional shares, pursuant to this shelf registration statement and a related prospectus supplement dated July&nbsp;29, 2015, filed with the SEC on July&nbsp;30, 2015. We received gross proceeds from the offering of approximately
$80.5&nbsp;million, or net proceeds of $75.2&nbsp;million after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses paid by us. We may offer additional securities under this or a future shelf registration statement from time
to time in response to market conditions or other circumstances if we believe such a plan of financing is in the best interests of our stockholders. We believe that the use of a shelf registration statement provides us with the flexibility to raise
additional capital to finance our operations as needed. </P>

based on net sales of products containing CR845 in Japan, if any, and share in any <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">sub-license</FONT> fees. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">During the second quarter of 2014, Maruishi completed a Phase 1 clinical trial in Japan related to CR845 in acute post-operative pain for
which we earned a clinical development milestone payment of $480&nbsp;thousand, net of contractual foreign currency exchange adjustments of $20&nbsp;thousand. During the third quarter of 2015, Maruishi initiated a Phase 2 trial in Japan related to
CR845 for the treatment of uremic pruritus for which we earned a clinical development milestone payment of $1.7&nbsp;million, net of contractual foreign currency exchange adjustments of $275&nbsp;thousand. </P>

needed, on reasonable terms, or at all. In particular, because we do not have sufficient financial resources to meet all of our development objectives, especially the completion of our planned development of Oral CR845 and I.V. CR845 in uremic
pruritus, we will need to raise additional capital. If we are not able to do so, we could be required to postpone, scale back or eliminate some, or all, of these objectives. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the future sale of
equity or convertible debt, the ownership interest of our stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our existing common stockholders. If we raise
additional funds through the issuance of debt securities, these securities could contain covenants that would restrict our operations. If we raise additional funds through collaboration arrangements in the future, we may have to relinquish valuable
rights to our technologies, future revenue streams or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our management&#146;s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements, which
have been prepared in accordance with Generally-Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheets and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We base our estimates on historical experience and on
various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time such estimates are made. Actual results and outcomes may differ materially from our estimates, judgments and assumptions. We periodically review our
estimates in light of changes in circumstances, facts and experience. The effects of material revisions in estimates are reflected in the financial statements prospectively from the date of the change in estimate. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We define our critical accounting policies as those accounting principles generally accepted in the United States that require us to make
subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations as well as the specific manner in which we apply those principles. We believe the
critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements which require significant estimates and judgments are as follows: </P>

we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; our price to the customer is fixed or determinable; collectability is reasonably assured and delivery has occurred or services have been
rendered. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have entered into license agreements to develop, manufacture and commercialize drug products. The terms of these agreements
typically contain multiple elements, including licenses and R&amp;D services. Payments to us under these agreements may include <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-refundable</FONT> upfront license fees, payments for research activities, payments
based upon the achievement of certain clinical development and regulatory milestones and royalties on any resulting net product sales. There are no performance, cancellation, termination or refund provisions in any of the arrangements that contain
material financial consequences to us. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We record revenue related to these agreements in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification
or ASC, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">605-25,</FONT> <I>Revenue Recognition Multiple-Element Arrangements</I>. In order to account for these agreements, we identify the deliverables included within an arrangement and evaluate which deliverables
represent separate units of accounting based on whether certain criteria are met, including whether the delivered element has stand-alone value to the counterparty. The consideration received is then allocated among the separate units of accounting
based on each unit&#146;s relative selling price. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The identification of individual elements in a multiple-element arrangement and the
estimation of the selling price of each element involves significant judgment, including consideration as to whether each delivered element has standalone value. We have determined that our license deliverables represent separate units of accounting
because the counterparty has the right to sublicense and manufacture in its territory, as defined. We have determined that our R&amp;D services deliverables, as applicable, represent separate units of accounting because similar services are sold
separately by other vendors. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We determine the estimated selling price for deliverables within each agreement using vendor specific

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
selling price, if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. Determining the best estimate of selling price for a deliverable requires significant judgment. Because we do not have VSOE or TPE of selling
price to determine the estimated selling price of a license to our proprietary technology, we typically use our best estimate of a selling price to estimate the selling prices for licenses to our proprietary technology. In making these estimates, we
consider market conditions and entity-specific factors, including those contemplated in negotiating the agreements, as well as internally developed estimates that include assumptions related to the market opportunity, estimated development costs,
probability of success and the time needed to commercialize a product candidate pursuant to the license. In validating our best estimate of selling price, we evaluate whether changes in the key assumptions used to determine our best estimate of
selling price will have a significant effect on the allocation of arrangement consideration between deliverables. We recognize consideration allocated to an individual element when all other revenue recognition criteria are met for that element.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Arrangement consideration allocated to license deliverables that represent separate units of accounting are recognized as revenue at the
outset of the agreement assuming the general criteria for revenue recognition noted above have been met. Arrangement consideration allocated to license deliverables which do not represent separate units of accounting are deferred. Arrangement
consideration allocated to R&amp;D services which represent separate units of accounting are recognized as the services are performed, assuming the general criteria for revenue recognition noted above have been met. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In connection with arrangement consideration allocated to R&amp;D services, our performance period estimates are principally based on
projections of the scope, progress and results of our R&amp;D activities. Due to the variability in the scope of activities and length of time necessary to develop a drug product, changes to development plans as programs progress, and uncertainty in
the ultimate requirements to obtain governmental approval for commercialization, revisions to performance period estimates are likely to occur periodically, and could result in material changes to the amount of revenue recognized each year in the
future. In addition, our estimated performance periods may change if development programs encounter delays or we decide to expand or contract our clinical plans for a drug candidate. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our license agreements include contingent milestone payments related to specified clinical development milestones and regulatory milestones.
Development milestones are payable when a product candidate initiates or advances into different clinical trial phases. Regulatory milestones are payable upon submission for marketing approval with the FDA or other countries&#146; regulatory
authorities or on receipt of actual marketing approvals for the compound or for additional indications. At the inception of each agreement that includes milestone payments, we evaluate whether each such payment is a milestone payment as defined by
ASC <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">605-28,</FONT> <I>Revenue Recognition</I><I></I><I>&nbsp;&#150; Milestone Method</I>, because achievement requires performance by us and, at inception of the arrangement, there is substantive uncertainty that the
event will be achieved, or whether the payment is a contingent payment, because achievement requires performance by the counterparty. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If
the payment meets the criteria of a milestone payment, we evaluate whether such milestone is considered to be substantive. This evaluation includes an assessment of whether (a)&nbsp;the consideration is commensurate with either (1)&nbsp;the
entity&#146;s performance to achieve the milestone, or (2)&nbsp;the enhancement of the value of the delivered item(s) as a result of a specific outcome resulting from the entity&#146;s performance to achieve the milestone, (b)&nbsp;the consideration
relates solely to past performance and (c)&nbsp;the consideration is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms within the arrangement. We evaluate factors such as the scientific, regulatory, commercial and other risks that
must be overcome to achieve the respective milestone and the level of effort and investment required to achieve the respective milestone in making this assessment. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We recognize substantive milestone payments as revenue upon the achievement of the milestone, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria
are met. If any milestone payment is considered not to be a substantive milestone or if considered to be a contingent payment, we initially defer the milestone payment, allocate it to the deliverables based on relative selling price in the same
proportion as at inception of the agreement, immediately recognize revenue to the extent of any delivered elements and recognize the portion attributable to any undelivered elements over the remaining term of our performance obligations. If no such
performance obligations exist, milestones that are considered not to be substantive or are considered to be contingent payments are generally recognized as revenue upon achievement, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We grant stock options to employees, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-employee</FONT> directors and
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-employee</FONT> consultants as compensation for services performed. Employee and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-employee</FONT> members of the Board of Directors&#146; awards of stock-based compensation are
accounted for in accordance with ASC 718, <I>Compensation </I>- <I>Stock Compensation, </I>or ASC 718. ASC 718 requires all share-based payments to employees and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-employee</FONT> directors, including grants of
stock options, to be recognized in the Statements of Comprehensive Loss based on their grant date fair values. The grant date fair value of stock options is estimated using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Using this model, fair value is calculated based on assumptions with respect to (i)&nbsp;the fair value or market price of our common stock on
the grant date; (ii)&nbsp;expected volatility of our common stock price, (iii)&nbsp;the periods of time over which employees and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-employee</FONT> directors are expected to hold their options prior to exercise
(expected term), (iv) expected dividend yield on our common stock, and (v)&nbsp;risk-free interest rates. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our common stock has been
traded on a public exchange only since January&nbsp;31, 2014. Since that time, exercises of stock options have been limited due to various factors, including fluctuations in our stock price to below the exercise prices of awards, blackout periods
during which exercises are not allowed, among others. Therefore, we believe that as of December&nbsp;31, 2016, we do not have sufficient company-specific information available to determine the expected term based on our historical data. As a result,
the expected term of stock options granted to employees and members of our Board of Directors is determined using the average of the vesting period and term (6.25 years), an accepted method for our option grants under the SEC&#146;s Staff Accounting
Bulletin No.&nbsp;107, <I>Share-Based Payment. </I> </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Similarly, because our stock price has fluctuated significantly since
January&nbsp;31, 2014, we believe that the future volatility of our common stock will differ materially during the expected term from the volatility that would be calculated from our historical stock prices to date. Consequently, expected volatility
is based on an analysis of guideline companies in accordance with ASC 718. The expected dividend yield is zero as we have never paid dividends and do not currently anticipate paying any in the foreseeable future. Risk-free interest rates are based
on quoted U.S. Treasury rates for securities with maturities approximating the option&#146;s expected term. A higher volatility input to the Black-Scholes option valuation model increases the resulting compensation expense, while a shorter expected
term would result in a lower compensation expense. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For all share-based payments granted to employees and
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-employees,</FONT> compensation cost relating to awards with service-based graded vesting schedules is recognized using the straight-line method over the requisite service period. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On the grant date of each stock option award, we apply a forfeiture rate in order to accrue share-based compensation expense based on an
estimate of the number of stock options that are expected to vest. Estimated forfeiture rates are based upon historical data of awards that were cancelled prior to vesting. We adjust the total amount of compensation cost recognized for each award,
in the period in which each award vests, to reflect the actual forfeitures related to that award. To the extent that the actual forfeiture rate for an award is lower than the estimated forfeiture rate, additional compensation expense is recorded in

a debt security in ASC <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">320-10-20</FONT></FONT> and has a maturity at the time of purchase of more than three months. We consider our marketable securities to be <FONT

number of factors, including the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been below its cost basis and adverse conditions related specifically to the security, including any changes to the credit rating of the security, and the
intent to sell, or whether we will more likely than not be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Our assessment of whether a security is other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new

representing a credit loss, which is recorded in net income, and the remainder is recorded in Other Comprehensive Income, net of taxes. Credit losses are identified where we do not expect to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the amortized

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We apply fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial
statements on a recurring basis. We define fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair
value measurements for assets and liabilities which are required to be recorded at fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market
participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as risks inherent in valuation techniques, transfer restrictions and credit risks. </P>

accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their carrying values due to the short-term nature of these financial instruments. Marketable securities are reported on our Balance Sheets at their fair values, based upon pricing of securities
with the same or similar investment characteristics as provided by pricing services, as described below. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In accordance with the
accounting standard for fair value measurements, we have classified our financial instruments as level 1 or level 2 within the fair value hierarchy that is intended to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related

markets for identical assets and liabilities&nbsp;&#150; such as quoted prices for similar instruments, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We estimate the fair values of our financial instruments categorized as level 2 in the fair value
hierarchy, including U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. government agency obligations, corporate bonds and commercial paper by taking into consideration valuations obtained from third-party pricing services. The pricing services use industry standard
valuation models, including both income- and market-based approaches, for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly, to estimate fair value. These inputs include reported trades of and broker/dealer quotes on the
same or similar securities, benchmark yields, issuer credit spreads, benchmark securities, and other observable inputs. We obtain a single price for each financial instrument and do not adjust the prices obtained from the pricing service. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We validate the prices provided by our third-party pricing services by reviewing their pricing methods, obtaining market values from other
pricing sources and comparing them to the share prices presented by the pricing service. After completing our validation procedures, we did not adjust or override any fair value measurements provided by our pricing services as of December&nbsp;31,
2016, or 2015. While we believe that the valuation methodologies are appropriate, the use of valuation methodologies is highly judgmental and changes in methodologies can have a material impact on our results of operations. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In December 2015, we entered into a lease agreement, or the Stamford Lease, with Four Stamford Plaza Owner LLC, or the Landlord, for office
space in Stamford, Connecticut, or the Premises, for the purpose of relocating our headquarters. The initial term of the Stamford Lease commenced in May 2016, or the Commencement Date, and ends in November 2023. The Stamford Lease requires monthly
lease payments, totaling $8.3&nbsp;million, including rent escalations and rent holidays, during the initial lease term. We began to make rental payments from the Commencement Date. We record monthly rent expense on a straight-line basis from March
2016, upon taking possession of the Premises, through October 2023. The Stamford Lease is renewable for one five-year term. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Stamford
landlord has made tenant improvements to the leased premises, the amount of which was included in Property and equipment, net and in Deferred lease obligation on our Balance Sheet on the Commencement Date. The portion of Deferred lease obligation
that is related to tenant improvements is being amortized as a reduction to rent expense over the same term as rent expense. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We recognize
rent expense for operating leases on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, beginning on the date we take possession of the property. Rent expense includes the base amounts stated in the lease agreement as well as the effect of reduced or
free rent and rent escalations. At lease inception, we determine the lease term by assuming the exercise of those renewal options that are reasonably assured because of the significant economic penalty that exists for not exercising those options.
The exercise of renewal options is at our sole discretion. The expected lease term is one of the factors used to determine whether a lease is classified as operating or capital and is used to calculate the straight-line rent expense. The difference
between the cash paid to the landlord and the amount recognized as rent expense on a straight-line basis is included in deferred lease obligation and classified within long-term liabilities. Lease incentives made by landlords to or on our behalf
leasehold improvements are recorded as deferred rent and classified as long-term liabilities. Deferred rent related to landlord incentives is amortized using the straight-line method over the lease term as an offset to rent expense. Penalties paid
to landlords to terminate a lease before the contractual end date of the lease are recognized on an undiscounted basis in the Statements of Comprehensive Loss. </P>

corporate bonds, commercial paper and direct obligations of the U.S. government and government-sponsored entities, and in cash equivalents. As of December&nbsp;31, 2016, we have invested $46.2&nbsp;million of our cash reserves in such marketable
securities. Those marketable securities include $37.9&nbsp;million of investment grade debt instruments with an average interest rate of approximately 1.0% and maturities through August 2017 and $8.3&nbsp;million of money market funds with an
average interest rate of 0.92%. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we had invested $91.6&nbsp;million of our cash reserves in such marketable securities. Those marketable securities included $49.7&nbsp;million of investment grade debt instruments with an
average interest rate of approximately 0.53% and maturities through September 2016 and $41.9&nbsp;million of money market funds with an average interest rate of 0.26%. </P>

interest rates. Applying the duration model, a hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates as of December&nbsp;31, 2016, and 2015, would have resulted in immaterial decreases in the fair values of our portfolio of marketable securities at those
dates. We do not currently use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Credit

identification, review, consideration and approval or ratification of &#147;related-persons transactions.&#148; For purposes of our policy only, a &#147;related-person transaction&#148; is a transaction, arrangement or relationship (or any series of
similar transactions, arrangements or relationships) in which we and any &#147;related person&#148; are participants involving an amount that exceeds $120,000. Transactions involving compensation for services provided to us as an employee, director,
consultant or similar capacity by a related person are not covered by this policy. A related person is any of our executive officers, directors, or more than 5% stockholders, including any of their immediate family members, and any entity owned or
controlled by such persons. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the policy, where a transaction has been identified as a related-person transaction, management must
present information regarding the proposed related-person transaction to the Audit Committee (or, where Audit Committee approval would be inappropriate, to another independent body of the Board) for consideration and approval or ratification. The
presentation must include a description of, among other things, the material facts, the interests, direct and indirect, of the related persons, the benefits to us of the transaction and whether any alternative transactions were available. To
identify related-person transactions in advance, we rely on information supplied by our executive officers, directors and certain significant stockholders. In considering related-person transactions, the Committee takes into account the relevant
available facts and circumstances including, but not limited to (a)&nbsp;the risks, costs and benefits to us, (b)&nbsp;the impact on a director&#146;s independence in the event the related person is a director, immediate family member of a director
or an entity with which a director is affiliated, (c)&nbsp;the terms of the transaction, (d)&nbsp;the availability of other sources for comparable services or products and (e)&nbsp;the terms available to or from, as the case may be, unrelated third
parties or to or from employees generally. In the event a director has an interest in the proposed transaction, the director must recuse himself or herself from the deliberations and approval. The policy requires that, in determining whether to
approve, ratify or reject a related-person transaction, the Committee consider, in light of known circumstances, whether the transaction is in, or is not inconsistent with, our best interests and our stockholders, as the Committee determines in the
good faith exercise of its discretion. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Certain Related Person Transactions </B></P>

available under Delaware law. These limitations also do not affect a director&#146;s responsibilities under any other laws, such as the federal securities laws or other state or federal laws. Our amended and restated bylaws provide that we will
indemnify our directors and executive officers, and may indemnify other officers, employees and other agents, to the fullest extent permitted by law. Our amended and restated bylaws also provide that we are obligated to advance expenses incurred by
a director or officer in advance of the final disposition of any action or proceeding and also permit us to secure insurance on behalf of any officer, director, employee or other agent for any liability arising out of his or her actions in
connection with their services to us, regardless of whether our amended and restated bylaws permit such indemnification. We have obtained a directors&#146; and officers&#146; liability insurance policy. </P>

fines and settlement amounts incurred by a director or executive officer in any action or proceeding arising out of their services as one of our directors or executive officers, or any of our subsidiaries or any other company or enterprise to which
the person provides services at our request. We believe that these bylaw provisions and indemnification agreements are necessary to attract and retain qualified persons as directors and officers. </P>

might benefit us and our stockholders. A Stockholder&#146;s investment may be harmed to the extent we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against directors and officers pursuant to these indemnification provisions. </P>

comprehensive loss, convertible preferred stock and stockholders&#146; (deficit) equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2016. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#146;s

standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. We were
not engaged to perform an audit of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Cara Therapeutics, Inc., or the Company, is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical corporation formed on July&nbsp;2, 2004. The Company is focused
on developing and commercializing new chemical entities designed to alleviate pain and pruritus by selectively targeting kappa opioid receptors. The Company&#146;s primary activities to date have been organizing and staffing the Company, developing
its product candidates, including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials of CR845-based product candidates and raising capital. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of December&nbsp;31, 2016, the Company has raised aggregate net proceeds of approximately $204,800 from several rounds of equity financing,
including its initial public offering, or IPO, which closed in February 2014 and its <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">follow-on</FONT> offering, which closed in August 2015 (see Note 11, <I>Stockholders&#146; Equity</I>), and the issuance of debt.
In addition, the Company earned approximately $32,600 under its license agreements for CR845, primarily with Maruishi Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., or Maruishi, and Chong Kun Dang Pharmaceutical Corp. or CKD, and for an earlier product candidate for
which development efforts ceased in 2007 (see Note 13, <I>Collaborations</I>). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of December&nbsp;31, 2016, the Company had unrestricted
cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $58,276 and an accumulated deficit of $162,171. The Company has incurred substantial net losses and negative cash flows from operating activities in nearly every fiscal period since inception
and expects this trend to continue for the foreseeable future. The Company recognized a net loss of $57,280 and had net cash used in operating activities of $47,381 for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company is subject to risks common to other life science companies including, but not limited to, uncertainty of product development and
commercialization, lack of marketing and sales history, development by its competitors of new technological innovations, dependence on key personnel, market acceptance of products, product liability, protection of proprietary technology, ability to
raise additional financing, and compliance with Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and other government regulations. If the Company does not successfully commercialize any of its product candidates, it will be unable to generate recurring product
revenue or achieve profitability. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies </B></P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally-accepted accounting principles in the United States or GAAP, requires the
Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from the Company&#146;s estimates and assumptions. Significant estimates include the fair value of marketable securities that are classified as level 2 of the fair value
hierarchy, useful lives of fixed assets, the periods over which certain revenues will be recognized, including licensing and collaborative revenue recognized from <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-refundable</FONT>
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">up-front</FONT> and milestone payments, the determination of prepaid R&amp;D clinical costs and accrued research projects, the amount of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-cash</FONT> compensation costs related to
share-based payments to employees and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-employees</FONT> and the periods over which those costs are expensed and the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents
and marketable securities. The Company invests its cash reserves in money market funds or high-quality marketable securities in accordance with its investment policy. The stated objectives of its investment policy are to preserve capital, provide
liquidity consistent with forecasted cash flow requirements, maintain appropriate diversification and generate returns relative to these investment objectives and prevailing market conditions. The Company&#146;s investment policy includes guidelines
on acceptable investment securities, limits interest-bearing security investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by the U.S. government and institutions with investment grade credit ratings and places restrictions on
maturities and concentration by asset </P>

value with unrealized gains and losses generally recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), or AOCI, as a separate component of stockholders&#146; equity. Marketable securities are reported as Marketable securities in the Balance
Sheets. Other income includes interest and dividends, realized gains and losses on sales of securities and other-than-temporary impairment, or OTTI, declines in the fair value of securities, if any. The cost of securities sold is based on the
specific identification method. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company reviews its

the cost basis of an asset may not be recoverable. This evaluation is based on a number of factors, including the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been below its cost basis and adverse conditions related specifically to the
security, including any changes to the credit rating of the security, and the intent to sell, or whether the Company will more likely than not be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. The Company&#146;s
assessment of whether a security is other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular security. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If a decline in the fair value of an <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">available-for-sale</FONT></FONT>
marketable debt security in the Company&#146;s investment portfolio is deemed to be other-than-temporary, the Company writes down the security to its current fair value. If the Company intends to sell the security or it is more likely than not that
the Company will be forced to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost of the security, the loss is recognized in net income. Otherwise, the loss is separated into a portion representing a credit loss, which is recorded in net income,
and the remainder is recorded in Other comprehensive income, or OCI, net of taxes. See Note 3, M<I>arketable Securities</I>, and Note 12, <I>Fair Value Measurement</I>. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company applies fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the
financial statements on a recurring basis. The Company defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When
determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities which are required to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and the market-based risk measurements or
assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as risks inherent in valuation techniques, transfer restrictions and credit risks. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company&#146;s financial instruments consist of cash, cash equivalents,

accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their carrying values due to the short-term nature of these financial instruments. Marketable securities are reported on the Company&#146;s Balance Sheets at their fair values, based upon pricing
of securities with the same or similar investment characteristics as provided by pricing services, as described below. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In general, the Company recognizes revenue when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; the
Company&#146;s price to the customer is fixed or determinable; collectability is reasonably assured and delivery has occurred or services have been rendered. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company has entered into license agreements to develop, manufacture and commercialize drug products. The terms of these agreements
typically contain multiple elements, including licenses and R&amp;D services. Payments to the Company under these agreements may include nonrefundable license fees, payments for research activities, payments based upon the achievement of certain
milestones and royalties on any resulting net product sales. There are no performance, cancellation, termination or refund provisions in any of the arrangements that contain material financial consequences to the Company. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company records revenue related to these agreements in accordance with ASC <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">605-25,</FONT> <I>Revenue
Recognition Multiple-Element Arrangements</I>. In order to account for these agreements, the Company identifies the deliverables included within an arrangement and evaluates which deliverables represent separate units of accounting based on whether
certain criteria are met, including whether the delivered element has stand-alone value to the counterparty. The consideration received is then allocated among the separate units of accounting based on each unit&#146;s relative selling price. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The identification of individual elements in a multiple-element arrangement and the estimation of the selling price of each element involves
significant judgment, including evaluation as to whether each delivered element has standalone value. The Company has determined that its license deliverables represent separate units of accounting because the counterparty has the right to
sublicense and manufacture in its territory, as defined. The Company has determined that its R&amp;D services deliverables, as applicable, represent separate units of accounting because similar services are sold separately by other vendors. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company determines the estimated selling price for deliverables within each agreement using vendor specific objective evidence, or VSOE,
of selling price, if available, or third party evidence, or TPE, of selling price if VSOE is not available, or the Company&#146;s best estimate of selling price, if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. Determining the best estimate of selling price
for a deliverable requires significant judgment. Because the Company does not have VSOE or third party evidence of selling price to determine the estimated selling price of a license to its proprietary technology, it typically uses its best estimate
of a selling price to estimate the selling prices for licenses to its proprietary technology. In making these estimates, the Company considers market conditions and entity-specific factors, including those contemplated in negotiating the agreements,
as well as internally developed estimates that include assumptions related to the market opportunity, estimated development costs, probability of success and the time needed to commercialize a product candidate pursuant to the license. In validating
its best estimate of selling price, the Company evaluates whether changes in the key assumptions used to determine its best estimate of selling price will have a significant effect on the allocation of arrangement consideration between deliverables.
The Company recognizes consideration allocated to an individual element when all other revenue recognition criteria are met for that element. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Arrangement consideration allocated to license deliverables that represent separate units of accounting is recognized as revenue at the outset
of the agreement assuming the general criteria for revenue recognition noted above have been met. Arrangement consideration allocated to license deliverables which do not represent separate units of accounting is deferred. Arrangement consideration
allocated to R&amp;D services which represent separate units of accounting is recognized as the services are performed, assuming the general criteria for revenue recognition noted above have been met. </P>

specified clinical development milestones and regulatory milestones. Development milestones are payable when a product candidate initiates or advances into different clinical trial phases. Regulatory milestones are payable upon submission for
marketing approval with the FDA or other countries&#146; regulatory authorities or on receipt of actual marketing approvals for the compound or for additional indications. At the inception of each agreement that includes milestone payments, the
Company evaluates whether each such payment is a milestone payment as defined by ASC <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">605-28,</FONT> <I>Revenue Recognition</I><I></I><I>&nbsp;&#150; Milestone Method</I>, because achievement requires performance by
the Company and, at inception of the arrangement, there is substantive uncertainty that the event will be achieved, or whether the payment is a contingent payment, because achievement requires performance by the counterparty. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If the payment meets the criteria of a milestone payment, the Company evaluates whether such milestone is considered to be substantive. This
evaluation includes an assessment of whether (a)&nbsp;the consideration is commensurate with either (1)&nbsp;the entity&#146;s performance to achieve the milestone, or (2)&nbsp;the enhancement of the value of the delivered item(s) as a result of a
specific outcome resulting from the entity&#146;s performance to achieve the milestone, (b)&nbsp;the consideration relates solely to past performance and (c)&nbsp;the consideration is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms
within the arrangement. The Company evaluates factors such as the scientific, regulatory, commercial and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the respective milestone and the level of effort and investment required to achieve the respective
milestone in making this assessment. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company recognizes substantive milestone payments as revenue upon the achievement of the
milestone, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met. If any milestone payment is considered not to be a substantive milestone or is considered to be a contingent payment, the Company initially defers the milestone payment, allocates
it to the deliverables based on relative selling price in the same proportion as at inception of the agreement, immediately recognizes revenue to the extent of any delivered elements and recognizes the portion attributable to any undelivered
elements over the remaining term of its performance obligations. If no such performance obligations exist, milestones that are considered not to be substantive or are considered to be contingent payments are generally recognized as revenue upon
achievement, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Royalty revenue is recognized when earned. To date, no royalties
have been earned or were otherwise due to the Company. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Research and Development Expenses </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Research and development, or R&amp;D, costs are charged to expense as incurred. Costs incurred under agreements with third parties are charged
to expense as incurred in accordance with the specific contractual performance terms of such agreements. R&amp;D expenses include, among other costs, salaries and other personnel-related costs, including consultant costs, and costs to conduct
clinical trials using CRO&#146;s, which include upfront, milestone and monthly expenses as well as reimbursement for pass through costs. The amount of clinical trial expense recognized in any period varies depending on the duration and progress of
each clinical trial, including the required level of patient enrollment, the rate at which patients actually enroll in and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">drop-out</FONT> of the clinical trial, and the number of sites involved in the trial as well
as the activities to be performed by the sites each period. R&amp;D costs also include costs to manufacture product candidates and clinical supplies, laboratory supplies costs and facility-related costs.

Company&#146;s common stock has been traded on a public exchange only since January&nbsp;31, 2014. Since that time, exercises of stock options have been limited due to various factors, including fluctuations in the Company&#146;s stock price to
below the exercise prices of awards, blackout periods during which exercises are not allowed, among others. Therefore, the Company believes that as of December&nbsp;31, 2016, it does not have sufficient company-specific information available to
determine the expected term based on its historical data. As a result, the expected term of stock options granted to employees and members of the Company&#146;s Board of Directors is determined using the average of the vesting period and term (6.25
years), an accepted method for the Company&#146;s option grants under the SEC&#146;s Staff Accounting Bulletin No.&nbsp;107, <I>Share-Based Payment. </I> </P>

its future volatility will differ materially during the expected term from the volatility that would be calculated from its historical stock prices to date. Consequently, expected volatility is based on an analysis of guideline companies in
accordance with ASC 718. The expected dividend yield is zero as the Company has never paid dividends and does not currently anticipate paying any in the foreseeable future. Risk-free interest rates are based on quoted U.S. Treasury rates for
securities with maturities approximating the option&#146;s expected term. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company applies a forfeiture rate to the number of unvested

outstanding. Diluted net income per share includes the potential dilutive effect of common stock equivalents as if such securities were exercised during the period, when the effect is dilutive. Common stock equivalents may include outstanding stock
options, which are included under the treasury stock method when dilutive. For each of the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company excluded the effects of potentially dilutive shares that were outstanding during those

assuming the exercise of those renewal options that are reasonably assured because of the significant economic penalty that exists for not exercising those options. The exercise of renewal options is at the Company&#146;s sole discretion. The
expected lease term is one of the factors used to determine whether a lease is classified as operating or capital and is used to calculate the straight-line rent expense. The difference between the cash paid to the landlord and the amount recognized
as rent expense on a straight-line basis is included in deferred rent and classified within long-term liabilities. Lease incentives made by landlords to or on behalf of the Company for leasehold improvements are recorded as deferred rent and
classified as long-term liabilities. Deferred rent related to landlord incentives is amortized using the straight-line method over the lease term as an offset to rent expense. Penalties paid to landlords to terminate a lease before the contractual
end date of the lease are recognized on an undiscounted basis in the Statements of Comprehensive Loss. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Litigation Reserves

principle under which the Company will recognize revenue from contracts with customers from one which requires the Company to satisfy specific criteria before recognizing revenue to one which requires the Company to recognize revenue in an amount
that reflects the consideration to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The Company currently recognizes revenue only from contracts with Maruishi and CKD, under both of which the

STYLE="white-space:nowrap">2016-10,</FONT> <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">2016-12</FONT> and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">2016-20,</FONT> and has tentatively concluded that, due to the similarity of the guidance under ASC <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">605-25</FONT> and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">605-28</FONT> and under ASC 606, as amended, as relates to revenue recognition for licenses of IP, the Company expects that, under both the CKD Agreement and the Maruishi
Agreement, the distinct performance obligations, transaction prices, amount of the transaction price allocated to the performance obligations and timing and amount of revenue recognition under ASC 606, as amended, will be the same as under ASC 605
for all periods presented. However, the Company is continuing to evaluate whether those two contracts contain performance obligations in accordance with ASC 606 that were not deemed to be deliverables under ASC 605. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In particular, regarding the CKD Agreement and the Maruishi Agreement, the following aspects of ASC 606, as amended, are the same as those
under ASC <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">605-25</FONT> and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">605-28.</FONT> The CKD Agreement has one distinct performance obligation, granting of the license, and the Maruishi Agreement has two distinct performance
obligations, granting of the license and the R&amp;D services. The methodology for determining the selling price of the performance obligations is the same under both standards. The licenses granted to the counterparties under those two contracts
are deemed to be functional IP for which revenue is recognized at a point in time, which has been determined to be inception of the respective license agreements. The R&amp;D services under the Maruishi Agreement were performed from inception of the
agreement in 2013 through the third quarter of 2015. Accordingly, revenue related to the R&amp;D services will be recognized proportionately as those services are performed. Although the milestone method guidance under ASC <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">605-28</FONT> no longer applies under ASC 606, the guidance under ASC 606 for licenses of IP is effectively the same as pertains to milestones achieved by the Company and those achieved by the counterparty to each license
agreement. In addition, due to the probability, at inception of each license agreement, that revenue recognized related to the achievement of milestones and sales-based royalty payments will be reversed in the future, the constraint on not including
those potential payments in the transaction price applies under ASC 606, as amended. Consequently, under ASC 606, recognition of revenue for achievement of milestones and sales-based royalty payments will occur at the time that they are achieved and
in the amount earned. As a result of the foregoing considerations, the Company currently expects that upon adoption of ASC 606, as amended, there will be no impact on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows for any period
presented. </P>

which may be maturity. </P>

(the date that the Shelton facility was vacated) (see Note 19, <I>Commitments and Contingencies</I>). In addition, the Company <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">wrote-off</FONT> $397 of fully-depreciated Shelton property and equipment that was not <FONT

Shelton Lease and the Stamford Lease (refer to Note&nbsp;19, <I>Commitments and Contingencies</I>). The fair value of each letter of credit approximates its contract value. In each case, the Company&#146;s bank requires the Company to maintain
restricted cash balances to serve as collateral for the letter of credit issued to the respective landlords by the bank. As of December&nbsp;31, 2016, the restricted cash balances for the Shelton Lease and the Stamford lease were both invested in a
commercial money market account. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The restricted cash balance for the Shelton lease remains at $700 through the end of the lease term in
October 2017. For the Stamford Lease, the letter of credit balance remains at $769 for the first three years following commencement of the Stamford Lease and may, upon request from the Company, thereafter be reduced to $408 through the end of the
lease term in 2023. The reduction in the balance of the Letter of Credit for the Stamford Lease is contingent upon the Company not being in default of any provisions of that lease prior to request for the reduction. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, the
money market account into which the Company subsequently deposited the cash collateral for the letter of credit for the Stamford Lease had not been established and none of that cash was restricted. The restricted money market account was funded in
January 2016. As of December&nbsp;31, 2016, the Company had $700 of restricted cash related to the Shelton lease in current assets and $769 of restricted cash related to the Stamford lease in long-term assets. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, the
Company had $700 of restricted cash related to the Shelton lease in long-term assets. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In April, 2012, the Company entered into a license agreement with CKD, or the CKD Agreement, that provides CKD with the exclusive rights to
develop, manufacture and commercialize products containing CR845 in South Korea. Under the CKD Agreement, the Company received a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-refundable</FONT> and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-creditable</FONT> amount
of $1,000 and is eligible to receive milestone payments totaling $3,750, relating to <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-defined</FONT> clinical development ($2,250) and regulatory events ($1,500), as well as royalties on sales of any marketed
products containing CR845. The Company is accounting for the milestones under ASC 605 <I>Revenue Recognition &#150; Milestone Method</I>. At the time of execution of the CKD Agreement, there was significant uncertainty as to whether the stated
milestones would be achieved. In conjunction with this uncertainty, the Company has determined that the milestones are substantive in nature as they are commensurate with the enhancement of value of the delivered license because they relate to
clinical success and advancement within the FDA drug development platform. The milestones also relate solely to past performance and monetary investment of the Company to achieve the clinical advancement. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In exchange for the $1,000, the Company provided CKD with the license for CR845 and issued CKD&nbsp;173,611 shares of Junior convertible
preferred stock, which shares were automatically converted into 69,444 shares of common stock upon the closing of the Company&#146;s initial public offering. The Company recorded the issuance of the 173,611 shares of Junior Preferred Stock as a
capital transaction for $354, which represented the shares&#146; estimated fair value as of the transaction date. The remaining proceeds of $646 were recorded as license revenue as the license was the only deliverable within the agreement that had
stand-alone value and was determined to be a separate unit of accounting under ASC <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">605-25,</FONT> <I>Revenue Recognition Multiple &#150; Element Arrangements</I>. In addition, the Company received milestone payments

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, the Company met the milestone criteria, as set
forth in the CKD Agreement, for the completion of both a Phase 1b trial of Oral CR845 in the United States and a Phase 2 trial of CR845 in uremic pruritus patients in the United States. Both milestones were considered to be substantive and,
therefore, the total amount of the milestone payments earned, $626 (net of South Korean withholding tax of $124), was recognized as milestone revenue upon achievement of the milestones, of which $417 (net of South Korean withholding tax of $83) was
due to the Company as of December&nbsp;31, 2015. The next potential milestone that the Company could be entitled to receive under the CKD Agreement will be a clinical development milestone for the listing in the South Korean National Health
Insurance Program of I.V. CR845 for pain. If achieved, this milestone will result in a payment of $500, before South Korean withholding taxes, being due to the Company. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Maruishi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In April 2013, the Company entered into a license agreement with Maruishi, or the Maruishi Agreement, under which the Company granted Maruishi
an exclusive license to develop, manufacture, and commercialize drug products containing CR845 for acute pain and uremic pruritus in Japan. Under the Maruishi Agreement, the Company and Maruishi are required to use commercially reasonable efforts,
at their own expense, to develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize CR845 in the United States and Japan, respectively. In addition, the Company provided Maruishi specific clinical development services for CR845 used in
Maruishi&#146;s field of use. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the terms of the agreement, the Company received an upfront
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-refundable,</FONT> <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-creditable</FONT> license fee of $15,000. As indicated in Note 2,<I> Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#150; Revenue Recognition</I>, the Company
accounts for arrangements of this type under ASC <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">605-25,</FONT> <I>Revenue Recognition - Multiple Element Arrangements.</I> The Company has identified two deliverables under this guidance: (1)&nbsp;the license; and
(2)&nbsp;the R&amp;D services specific to the uremic pruritus field of use. The Company has determined that the license has standalone value because Maruishi has the right to sublicense and manufacture CR845 in Japan. The second deliverable is the
R&amp;D services, which also have standalone value as similar services are sold separately by other vendors. Since both license and R&amp;D services separability criteria have been met, they are being accounted for as separate units of accounting
from the outset of the arrangement. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As a result, the total value of the arrangement of $15,337 (consisting of the $15,000 upfront
payment, plus the additional amount assigned to these deliverables as a result of the Junior A Preferred Stock premium, see below) was allocated between the two units of accounting. The Company used its best estimate of the selling price of these
units of accounting, since, as described in Note 2<I> Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#150; Revenue Recognition</I>, neither VSOE nor TPE was available. To determine these estimates, the Company used a discounted cash flow method that
forecasted and analyzed CR845 in the Japanese market, the phase of clinical development as well as considering recent similar license arrangements within the same phase of clinical development, therapeutic area, type of agreement, etc. As a result,
at inception of this license agreement, the management of the Company determined that the license and the R&amp;D services had estimated selling prices of $10,200 and $6,200, respectively. The resulting percentage allocations were applied to the
$15,337 of total consideration, which resulted in $9,637 being assigned to the license unit of accounting, which was recognized immediately as license revenue, while $5,700 was assigned to the R&amp;D services unit of accounting. The amount assigned
to the R&amp;D services unit of accounting was initially recorded as deferred revenue and was recognized as collaborative revenue as the services were provided through July 2015. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the terms of the Maruishi Agreement, the Company is also entitled to receive aggregate milestone payments of $8,000 for events performed
by Maruishi in Japan and $2,500 for events performed by the Company in the United States. At the time of execution of the Maruishi Agreement, there was significant uncertainty as to whether the stated milestones would be achieved. In conjunction
with this uncertainty, the Company has determined that the milestones achieved in the United States are substantive in nature as they are commensurate with the enhancement of value of the delivered license as they relate to clinical success and
advancement within the FDA drug development platform. The Company accounts for those milestone payments under ASC <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">605-28</FONT> <I>Revenue Recognition &#150; Milestone Method</I>. However, the milestones achieved by
Maruishi in Japan are not substantive and are accounted for in accordance with the multiple-element arrangement guidance in ASC <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">605-25.</FONT> </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">During June 2014, Maruishi completed a Phase 1 clinical trial in Japan related to CR845 in
acute post-operative pain, which constituted achievement of one of the milestones specified in the license agreement and was considered not to be substantive. Accordingly, the Company allocated the
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-refundable</FONT> payment of $480, net of a contractual foreign currency exchange adjustment of $20, to the two deliverables in the same proportion as the initial upfront payment had been allocated. The portion
of the payment allocated to the previously delivered license deliverable ($302) was recognized as license revenue entirely at the time of achievement of the milestone. A portion of the payment allocated to the R&amp;D services deliverable ($88) was
recognized as collaborative revenue at the time of achievement of the milestone to the extent of R&amp;D services provided through that date&nbsp;and the remainder ($90) was deferred and was recognized as collaborative revenue through July 2015,
which was the period during which the Company provided R&amp;D services to Maruishi. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In September 2015, Maruishi initiated a Phase 2
clinical trial of CR845 in Japan for uremic pruritus, which triggered a $1,725 milestone payment (net of contractual foreign currency exchange adjustments of $275) to the Company. At the time of achievement of the milestone, the Company had
delivered all deliverables under the Maruishi Agreement. Since the milestone was achieved in Japan, it was deemed not to be substantive. Accordingly, the Company recognized $1,084 as milestone revenue and $641 as collaborative revenue in connection
with achievement of this milestone. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The next potential milestone that the Company could be entitled to receive under the Maruishi
Agreement will be a clinical development milestone for the completion of the first Phase 3 pivotal trial of CR845 in acute pain in the United States. If achieved, this milestone will result in a payment of $1,000, before contractual foreign currency
exchange adjustments, being due to the Company.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Along with the R&amp;D services performed by the Company for
Maruishi, the Company supplied Maruishi with CR845 clinical material as an accommodation. The Company had previously entered into manufacturing and service agreements with third parties to manufacture CR845. Payments made by the Company to third
parties based on firm and fixed commitments by Maruishi to purchase CR845 from the Company were capitalized as prepaid expense. During the manufacturing process, title and risk of loss remained with the third party until the Company paid in full for
the material.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Once the Company had title to the CR845 and had delivered it to Maruishi, prepaid expense related
to that CR845 was reduced with an offset to R&amp;D expense. At that time, Maruishi reimbursed the Company for its external and internal costs for purchasing CR845 and processing the sale to Maruishi and the Company recognized clinical compound
revenue for the reimbursement amount. During the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company recognized clinical compound revenue of $86, $0 and $674, respectively. Deposits received from Maruishi prior to delivery of CR845 were
recorded as deferred revenue. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company is also eligible to receive tiered, low double digit royalties with respect to any sales of the
licensed product sold in Japan by Maruishi. Additionally, the Company can receive sublicense fees (subject to certain credits for milestone payments already made) if Maruishi enters into a sublicense agreement regarding the product candidates. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Also, in conjunction with entering into this arrangement, Maruishi purchased 2,105,263 shares of Junior A convertible preferred stock of the
Company pursuant to a stock purchase agreement for a purchase price of $3.80 per share, for total consideration of $8,000. These shares were recorded at their fair value of $7,663 or $3.64 per share. As a result, the premium of $337 was allocated to
the arrangement consideration (see above). In connection with the Company&#146;s IPO in 2014, all shares of Junior A convertible preferred stock were automatically converted into 842,105 shares of the Company&#146;s common stock (see Note 11,
Stockholders&#146; Equity, above). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company incurred R&amp;D expense related to the Maruishi Agreement of $0, $1,583 (consisting of
clinical trial costs related to the R&amp;D services deliverable) and $3,558 (consisting of $3,000 of clinical trial costs related to the R&amp;D services deliverable and $558 related to the cost of clinical compound sold to Maruishi) during years
ended December&nbsp;31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. </P>

Company also had federal and state R&amp;D tax credit carryforwards of approximately $5,480 and $810, respectively. The federal credits will begin expiring in 2025 unless previously utilized. The Connecticut credit carryforwards have no expiration

however, there were no matching contributions paid through December&nbsp;31, 2014. Effective January&nbsp;1, 2015, all eligible employees receive an employer contribution equal to 3% of their salary up to the annual IRS limit. During the years ended

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In December 2015, the Company entered into a lease agreement, or the Stamford Lease, with Four Stamford Plaza Owner LLC, or the Landlord, for
office space in Stamford, Connecticut, or the Premises, for the purpose of relocating its headquarters. The initial term of the Stamford Lease commenced in May 2016, or the Commencement Date, and ends in November 2023. The Stamford Lease requires
monthly lease payments, including rent escalations and rent holidays, during the initial lease term. The Company began to make rental payments from the Commencement Date. The Company records monthly rent expense on a straight-line basis from March
2016, upon taking possession of the Premises, through October 2023. As of December&nbsp;31, 2016, the balance of deferred lease obligation, representing the difference between cash rent paid and straight-line rent expense, was $583. The Stamford
Lease is renewable for one five-year term. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of December&nbsp;31, 2016, the Stamford landlord had made tenant improvements of
approximately $1,094 to the leased premises. Such amount was included in Property and equipment, net and in Deferred lease obligation on the Company&#146;s Balance Sheet on the Commencement Date. The portion of Deferred lease obligation that is
related to tenant improvements is being amortized as a reduction to rent expense over the same term as rent expense. During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016, the Company amortized $107 of Deferred lease obligation related to tenant
improvements. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Total rent expense under the Stamford operating lease was $797 for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In connection with the signing of the Stamford Lease, the Company entered into a standby letter of credit agreement for $769, which serves as
a security deposit for the Premises. The standby letter of credit expires on December&nbsp;16, 2016 and is automatically renewed annually through November 2023. This standby letter of credit is secured with restricted cash in a money market account
(refer to Note&nbsp;7,<I> Restricted Cash</I>). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Shelton Operating Lease </I></P>
