<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing gene therapy products designed to transform the lives of patients with severe diseases
in ophthalmology and lung disease. We believe our proprietary gene therapy platform and our expertise in viral vector selection and design, delivery and manufacturing will facilitate the rapid clinical advancement and regulatory approval of our
product candidates and enhance their commercial and therapeutic potential. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our lead product candidates are treatments for X-linked
retinoschisis, or XLRS, achromatopsia, or ACHM, and X-linked retinitis pigmentosa, or XLRP. These orphan diseases of the eye are caused by mutations in single genes, significantly affect visual function and currently lack effective medical
treatments. XLRS is characterized by abnormal splitting of the layers of the retina, resulting in poor visual acuity in young boys, which can progress to legal blindness in adult men. For our XLRS product candidate, we expect to file an
Investigational New Drug Application, or IND, with the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in late 2014, and thereafter to initiate Phase 1/2 clinical trials in the United States, with initial clinical data expected in mid-2015. ACHM
is characterized by the absence of cone photoreceptor function, resulting in extremely poor visual acuity, light sensitivity, day blindness and complete loss of color discrimination. We expect to file an IND for our first

ACHM product candidate in early 2015, and thereafter to initiate Phase 1/2 clinical trials in the United States, with clinical data expected in late 2015. We expect development of our second ACHM
product candidate to follow shortly behind this timeline. We have also begun preclinical studies for our product candidate addressing XLRP, a disease characterized by progressive degeneration of the retina, which can lead to total blindness in adult
men. For our XLRP product candidate, we expect to file an IND in late 2016, and thereafter to initiate Phase 1/2 clinical trials in the United States, with clinical data expected in mid-2017. Finally, we are utilizing our previous experience in wet
AMD to evaluate potential product candidates that may be synergistic with existing therapies. We expect to place a new product candidate for this large market opportunity into development during 2015. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our gene therapy platform is based on viral vectors that utilize a modified version of the non-replicating adeno-associated virus, or AAV, to
deliver a functional copy of a gene to the patient&#146;s own cells through a variety of delivery methods, and we have obtained preliminary indications of safety and efficacy in clinical trials. These vectors deliver the functional genetic material
to the nucleus of the cell, providing safe, sustained expression of the therapeutic protein to treat the disease without modifying the existing DNA of the patient. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have developed extensive internal expertise in viral vector selection and design, delivery and manufacturing that is supported by a broad
intellectual property estate. Our proprietary AAV vector manufacturing process is both reproducible and scalable. We have assembled an experienced management team and a world-class group of scientific advisors, and we have strong collaborative
relationships with key opinion leaders in the field of gene therapy. Combining these attributes, we have built a gene therapy platform that we believe will provide patients with treatments that may have life-long clinical benefits, potentially based
on a one-time therapeutic administration. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We and our scientific collaborators have generated human proof-of-concept data that we believe
provide preliminary evidence of the safety and efficacy of our gene therapy approach through preclinical studies and clinical trials in two other eye diseases: Leber congenital amaurosis (type 2) caused by mutations in the RPE65 gene, or LCA2, a
form of early onset retinal degeneration, and the wet form of age-related macular degeneration, or wet AMD, an eye disease affecting a large patient population. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our strategy is to leverage the capabilities of our gene therapy platform to address diseases in ophthalmology where there is significant
unmet medical need. We have concentrated initially on underserved orphan indications that are small enough to allow for clinical trials on a manageable scale but prevalent by orphan disease standards and that provide markets that we believe we can
serve using a small, targeted commercial infrastructure. The eye diseases we are targeting are well understood with highly predictive animal models and clearly defined clinical endpoints, characteristics that we believe will facilitate clinical
development and regulatory approval of our product candidates. We believe our initial focus on these orphan eye diseases will provide us with an attractive business opportunity and position us to drive the advancement of gene therapy technology. We
plan to leverage our experience in orphan ophthalmology to develop new treatments for eye diseases with larger patient populations, such as wet AMD. We will also evaluate opportunities to extend the commercial application of our gene therapy
platform in other underserved indications beyond ophthalmology. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our AAV vectors can be used to introduce functional genes into many
different cell types by a variety of delivery methods and can carry genes of up to 4,000 base pairs in length, a payload capacity sufficient to accommodate more than 90% of the individual genes in the human genome. We have developed a proprietary
manufacturing process that we believe will enable our vectors to be manufactured reliably on a commercial scale. Our gene therapy platform therefore has the potential to provide treatments for many other diseases outside of our current focus on
orphan ophthalmology, including those with large dosing requirements or in larger markets. We have already conducted preclinical proof-of-concept studies and Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials of a treatment for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, or
AAT deficiency, an inherited orphan lung disease. We expect to explore other therapeutic areas selectively, either alone or through partnerships. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Ophthalmology is also attractive to us as a clinical stage company because treatments for
diseases affecting vision have clearly defined, objective clinical endpoints with validated measurement tools that are accepted by the FDA. Other orphan drug companies have spent considerable time and resources working with the FDA to identify
acceptable clinical endpoints and develop measurement tools in sometimes ill-defined diseases. In ophthalmology the four accepted endpoints&#151;visual acuity, visual fields, contrast sensitivity and color vision&#151;are well understood, routinely
measured by clinicians, and the FDA consistently applies them and provides guidance on how much improvement is required for clinical relevancy. We believe these clearly defined endpoints will help accelerate the process of clinical study and
regulatory approval for our ophthalmic products. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Finally, through our internal research work and in collaboration with partners, we have

a modified version of the non-replicating adeno-associated virus to deliver the correct DNA directly to the nucleus of the cells affected by the disease. We believe that AAV vectors are particularly well suited for treating our target diseases and
have advantages over other viral vectors, such as adenovirus, herpes virus and lentivirus. These advantages include: </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Simplicity</B>&#151;AAV is a small, simple non-enveloped virus with only two native genes. This makes the virus straightforward to work with

enzymes, facilitating purification and final formulation. AAV stability could also enable development of a freeze-dried formulation, should this become necessary for larger markets where shipping and distribution of the current frozen formulation
would be challenging. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Sustained expression</B>&#151;Unlike vectors based on other viruses, our AAV vectors are capable of inserting the
functional gene into the patient&#146;s cells as an extra-chromosomal episome, which is a stable, circular form of DNA in the nucleus of cells. Inserting the functional gene as an episome supports long-term production of the protein, leading to
sustained therapeutic effect, without altering the patient&#146;s existing DNA. Sustained expression is a powerful advantage of using AAV as a vector: a one-time therapeutic administration of a functional gene into a cell can potentially support
protein production for the life of the cell, which, in the cell types we are currently focused on treating, may approximate the duration of the patient&#146;s lifetime. </P>

develop the product independently of us. As a result of this decision by Genzyme, we were released from non-competition covenants with Genzyme that limited our ability to operate within the field of ocular neovascularization, and we are currently

</I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">XLRS is an inherited retinal disease caused by mutations in the RS1 gene, which is located on the X&nbsp;chromosome and encodes
the retinoschisin, or RS1, protein. Retinoschisin is expressed and secreted primarily from photoreceptor cells and binds strongly and specifically to the surface of photoreceptor and bipolar cells in the retina. Mutated forms of retinoschisin are
unable to bind properly, resulting in schisis, or splitting of the nerve fiber layers of the retina, primarily in the macula. The disease begins early in childhood, and affected boys typically have best-corrected visual acuity of 20/60 to 20/120 at
initial diagnosis. Complications such as retinal hemorrhage or retinal detachment occur in up to 40% of patients, especially in older patients. According to&nbsp;<I>Molecular Genetics of Inherited Eye Diseases</I>&nbsp;(1988), the incidence rate for
XLRS is between one in 5,000 and one in 20,000 males. Using an incidence rate of 1 in 11,500 and assuming half the population is male, we estimate that there are about 13,000 persons in the United States and about 22,000 persons in Europe with XLRS,
or 35,000 persons in the United States and Europe combined. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The diagnosis of XLRS is made based on clinical findings and results of
imaging studies and ERG. Clinical findings include reduced visual acuity and a characteristic spoke-wheel appearance of the macula when viewed by an ophthalmoscope, which is the instrument commonly used by ophthalmologists and optometrists to view
the retina. Images obtained by optical coherence tomography, or OCT, a method of viewing layers of the eye somewhat like a sonogram, show spaces between the layers of the retina within the macula and fovea in most school-age boys with XLRS. These
spaces mean that electrical signals cannot move from the photoreceptors to other retinal neurons and on to the brain, resulting in poor vision. When this is measured by ERG testing it can be detected by a markedly abnormal ERG response. </P>

reports suggest that topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors may provide some reduction in the degree of schisis detected by OCT and improvement in visual acuity in some but not all patients, but the absence of controlled clinical trials makes
interpretation of these reports difficult. In addition, treatment with carbonic anhydrase inhibitors does not address the fundamental genetic defect in persons affected by XLRS. Neither carbonic anhydrase inhibitors nor any other medicinal products

the RS1 gene enters a retinal cell, the gene is processed by normal biochemical processes into a stable DNA episome in the nucleus of the cell. This stable form of the gene allows production of the normal retinoschisin protein which is then secreted
from the retinal cells and binds to the surfaces of photoreceptor and bipolar cells in the retina, pulling them together and eliminating any splitting between the layers of the cells. Upon light stimulation of the photoreceptor cells, the presence
of the retinoschisin allows normal transmission of electrical signals from the photoreceptor cells to the bipolar cells and then to other retinal neurons that transmit the signals to the visual cortex in the brain. Production of normal retinoschisin
continues as long as the episome persists in the cell, which may be for many years or even life-long, thereby providing long-term potential benefit after a one-time therapeutic administration. </P>

an inherited retinal disease characterized by the lack of cone photoreceptor function. Cone photoreceptors are concentrated in the macula and the fovea. ACHM is present from birth and throughout life. Individuals with this condition have no cone
photoreceptor function, markedly reduced visual acuity, photophobia, or light sensitivity, and complete loss of color discrimination. Their only functioning photoreceptors are rod photoreceptors, which respond to low intensity light conditions and
mediate night vision but cannot achieve fine visual acuity. Best-corrected visual acuity in persons affected by ACHM, even under subdued light conditions, is usually about 20/200, a level at which people are considered legally blind. They also
experience extreme light sensitivity resulting in even worse visual acuity under normal daylight conditions, or day blindness. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">ACHM can
be caused by mutations in any of at least five genes that are required for normal cone photoreceptor function. The most common causes are mutations in the CNGB3 gene (about half of all cases) or CNGA3 gene (about one-fourth of all cases). These
genes encode the CNGB3 and CNGA3 proteins, which combine to form a channel in the photoreceptor membrane that is required for phototransduction, the process whereby a light signal is converted to an electrical signal that is then transmitted to the
brain. According to&nbsp;<I>Retinal Dystrophies and Degenerations&nbsp;</I>(1988), the incidence rate for ACHM is approximately one in 30,000 people, and we therefore estimate that there are about 10,000 people in the United States and about 17,000
people in Europe with ACHM. Of these, about half, or a total of 13,500 in the United States and Europe combined, have the form of the disease caused by mutations in the CNGB3 gene. </P>

patient&#146;s own photoreceptor cells. Our first ACHM product candidate contains the CNGB3 gene and a promoter, the PR1.7 promoter, that has been shown in preclinical studies to drive efficient gene expression in primate cone photoreceptors and
restores cone photoreceptor function in dog and mouse models of achromatopsia. We have identified an AAV capsid that works well for subretinal delivery and are evaluating additional AAV capsids to identify those that work well for intravitreal
delivery that could be used in follow-on products. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">After our ACHM product candidate containing the functional CNGB3 gene enters a

already being produced in the cell, to form a channel in the photoreceptor membrane that is required for phototransduction. Restoration of phototransduction enables cone photoreceptors to convert light entering the eye into an electrical signal that
is transmitted to other retinal neurons and then to the visual cortex in the brain. Production of normal CNGB3 protein continues as long as the episome persists in the cell, which may be for many years or even life-long, thereby providing long-term
potential benefit after a one-time therapeutic administration. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There are several other genes in which mutations are known to cause ACHM,
with signs and symptoms that are the same as in ACHM caused by CNGB3 mutations. AAV vectors expressing these genes would be additional potential product candidates for treatment of ACHM caused by mutations in these genes, and we believe they would
have the potential for rapid regulatory approval, if our product candidate for ACHM caused by CNGB3 mutations were already approved. Mutations in the CNGA3 gene are responsible for about 25% of ACHM cases in the US and Europe but are responsible for
almost all cases in patients from the Middle East. Proof-of-concept efficacy after subretinal injection of AAV vectors expressing CNGA3 has also been demonstrated in mouse and sheep models of CNGA3-related ACHM. </P>

the CNGB3 gene that either produce an abnormal protein or completely prevent production of the protein. Both breeds have clinical characteristics similar to human ACHM patients, with day blindness and absence of retinal cone function as measured by
ERG. Treatment by subretinal injection of an AAV vector expressing human CNGB3 restored cone function in dogs with either mutation. Cone-specific ERG responses were undetectable in these dogs before treatment but were clearly detected after
treatment. Day blindness was demonstrated before treatment by testing the ability of the dogs to navigate a maze under progressively brighter conditions. Before treatment, it took the ACHM dogs progressively longer to navigate the maze as the
ambient light increased from dim light to normal room lighting and even longer with normal outdoor daytime lighting. After treatment, the day blindness was substantially eliminated, and the treated ACHM dogs were able to navigate the maze under

and efficacy of the ACHM product candidate administered by subretinal injection. Results of this trial, which we expect to receive in late 2015, will guide us in finalizing the design of a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial. In the planned pivotal Phase

in boys and young men who notice problems with vision under low light conditions, or night blindness, followed by a restriction of peripheral visual fields, or tunnel vision, leading to poor central vision and eventual total blindness. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The incidence rate for retinitis pigmentosa is about one in 4,000 people, according to&nbsp;<I>Retinitis
Pigmentosa</I>&nbsp;(1988)<I>,</I>&nbsp;and we estimate that there are about 75,000 people in the United States and 125,000 people in Europe with retinitis pigmentosa, or 200,000 people in the United States and Europe combined. According to a paper
by Dr.&nbsp;Marianne Haim published in&nbsp;<I>Acta Ophthalmologica</I>&nbsp;(1992), about 10% of cases of retinitis pigmentosa are caused by mutations in a gene on the X chromosome and are referred to as X-linked retinitis pigmentosa, or XLRP, from
which we therefore estimate that there are about 20,000 persons with XLRP in the United States and Europe combined. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A preclinical study
in a dog model of XLRP caused by mutations in the RPGR gene demonstrated a delay in the rate of disease progression in eyes that received a subretinal injection of an AAV vector expressing RPGR. We have inserted a stable form of the RPGR cDNA into
an HSV helper to produce our XLRP product candidate and are currently designing preclinical studies to further evaluate the ability of this product candidate to delay disease progression in animal models of XLRP. If these studies are successful, we
will conduct additional preclinical studies required for submission of an IND to the FDA. These studies will include single-dose toxicology studies in animals that will evaluate the safety and distribution within the animals after our XLRP product
candidate is delivered by both subretinal and intravitreal injection. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Other opportunities in ophthalmology </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe our current gene therapy platform will enable us to develop and test new AAV vectors that carry different gene sequences for other
inherited diseases in ophthalmology, reducing the need for early research work. In this way, we anticipate being able to move products rapidly through preclinical studies and into clinical development. We also believe that there are large market
ophthalmology diseases where AAV vectors may provide benefit, such as wet AMD. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Wet AMD </I></B></P>

impairment in older adults and occurs in &#147;dry&#148; and neovascular, or &#147;wet,&#148; forms. In the wet form, abnormal growth of blood vessels in the retina is stimulated by a protein
called vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF. The abnormal blood vessel growth, or neovascularization, causes vision loss due to blood and protein leakage below the macula. A paper by Friedman et al. published in Archives of Ophthalmology
(2004)&nbsp;estimated the total number of persons with wet AMD in the United States is about 1.2&nbsp;million, from which we estimate there are about 3.2&nbsp;million persons with wet AMD in the United States and Europe combined. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Wet AMD is currently treated with intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF agents delivered every one to two months, for an indefinite period.
While these VEGF-targeted therapies have proven efficacious for many patients, there is an urgent medical need to improve on the approximately 35% success rate for existing therapies by targeting other critical factors, and to reduce the burdensome
injection frequency for patients and physicians. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Based on our proof-of-concept studies, we believe that gene therapy offers a potential
long-term solution to treat wet AMD with one injection. Additionally, as in the case of &#147;cocktail&#148; treatment paradigms in oncology, there is a strong rationale for combination therapy to become the standard of care in wet AMD. For
instance, we are aware that others are conducting Phase 3 trials of an anti-platelet-derived growth factor, or PDGF, agent in combination with anti-VEGF agents for wet AMD. We believe that, while the predictability of targeting VEGF itself would
mitigate development risk, the most compelling gene therapy approach would offer not only sustained expression but also pathway synergy with existing anti-VEGF options. We have defined our preferred target profile and are proceeding with a
comprehensive review of possible targets. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The development pathway for wet AMD therapies has been well-established. Preclinical CROs offer
highly predictive animal models that reproduce the neovascularization typical of wet AMD in humans and yield results within a few months. In the clinic, physicians can readily detect therapeutic effects by measuring visual function with an eye chart
and anatomical biomarkers using widely available imaging devices. We intend to test several lead targets head-to-head in animal models. If sufficient rationale exists for more than one target, we will investigate deploying one viral vector to
address multiple targets. Given our experience gained from our prior partnership with Genzyme, our already-established manufacturing infrastructure and our planned regulatory path, we expect to be able to file an IND for a wet AMD product candidate
within 18 to 24&nbsp;months. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Other autosomal recessive retinal diseases </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of June&nbsp;30, 2014, 220 genes causing inherited retinal disease have been identified, of which 146 are autosomal recessive and therefore
most amenable to treatment by gene therapy. Among the 42 most common autosomal recessive forms of retinitis pigmentosa, LCA and cone or cone-rod dystrophy, 38 have gene coding regions of less than 3,760 nucleotides and can therefore be readily
accommodated within our AAV vectors. We are continuing to evaluate indications having these characteristics to select those most appropriate for addition to our longer-term product development pipeline. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We also plan to pursue gene therapy programs that target muscle cells via direct intramuscular injections or vascular delivery, to leverage the
unique properties of AAV vectors. For example, in one of our first proof-of-concept programs, we have developed a product candidate for the treatment of AAT deficiency, which is characterized by reduced serum levels of AAT protein and increased risk
of developing emphysema and liver disease. AAT normally functions to prevent lung tissue damage. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">AAT deficiency is implicated in 2.7% of
all deaths due to obstructive pulmonary disease among persons in the 35-44 year-old age group, and emphysema is the most common cause of death in AAT-deficient patients, accounting for about 72% of cases. According to the National Institutes of

article by de Serres and Blanco in&nbsp;Therapeutic Advances in Respiratory Disease&nbsp;(2013)&nbsp;estimates that there are approximately 44,000&nbsp;people in North America and 74,000 people
in Northern and Central Europe with the most severe form of AAT deficiency, or about 118,000 people in the United States and Europe combined. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Prevention of lung disease in AAT deficiency is well-understood, since the presence of serum AAT levels of 11 &micro;M or higher is considered
to be an indicator of protection from tissue damage. AAT augmentation therapy, consisting of intravenous infusions of AAT protein purified from plasma obtained from healthy human donors, can achieve effective serum levels of AAT. However, the annual
cost of augmentation therapy, administered by weekly intravenous infusions over the lifetime of the patient, can be more than $100,000 per year. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our alternative, gene therapy approach involves using an AAV vector to insert a functional copy of the normal AAT gene into the patient&#146;s
muscle cells. In preclinical studies, our AAT deficiency product candidate was evaluated in single-dose toxicology studies in mice and rabbits. These studies demonstrated that vector administration was not associated with clinical signs of toxicity
and there were no adverse effects on hematology or serum chemistry parameters or gross pathology findings. We plan to perform an additional toxicology study in monkeys to evaluate administration of our AAT deficiency product candidate to muscle
cells by a vascular route of delivery that in animals was able to achieve much higher serum levels compared to direct intramuscular delivery. </P>

<TD ALIGN="left" VALIGN="top">First, the therapeutic gene and the appropriate AAV capsid genes are inserted into individual HSV helpers, and these helpers are individually grown in a complementing cell line called V27. The complementing cell line is
required to provide critical functions that allow the replication-incompetent HSV helpers to grow; the same cell line is used to produce HSV helpers for all disease targets. This step occurs in disposable culture vessels of increasing size, up to
and including disposable stirred tank bioreactors. The HSV helpers are harvested, minimally processed and concentrated to prepare them for use in producing our AAV vectors. These HSV helpers can be stored frozen for years before use.

<TD ALIGN="left" VALIGN="top">Next, the two HSV helpers are used together to infect a cell line called sBHK, allowing for packaging of the therapeutic gene into the AAV capsid and to produce our AAV vectors. The sBHK cell line does not provide the
critical functions that would allow for growth of the HSV helpers, which provides an added layer of safety. The same sBHK cell line is used to produce AAV vectors for all disease targets. This step occurs in disposable culture vessels of increasing
size depending on the amount of AAV vector that is required. The AAV vector is recovered by using a detergent solution to break open the sBHK cells and release the AAV vectors. This step also destroys any residual HSV helpers that were used to
infect the sBHK cells. </TD></TR></TABLE> <P STYLE="font-size:6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

developed purification methods for multiple AAV capsids. We have shown in formal clearance studies that the combination of detergent treatment and two chromatography columns can remove up to
10<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">14</SUP>&nbsp;(100 trillion) units of HSV. This step also helps to eliminate any remaining parts, such as proteins or DNA, of the HSV helpers and sBHK production cells. </TD></TR></TABLE>

 </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The HAVE method is inherently flexible, allowing the manufacture of a wide range of AAV vectors without the
need to modify the manufacturing steps used to produce the HSV helpers or AAV vectors. We have already demonstrated our manufacturing knowledge through multiple successful production batches of both HSV helpers and AAV vectors at SAFC Pharma, our
contract manufacturing organization, under current good manufacturing practices, or GMP. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Research is already underway to meet our future
manufacturing needs. Projects include scale-up to larger batch production for use in our AAT deficiency program, continued modifications of the purification step to accommodate new AAV capsids, complete removal of animal-derived products from the
V27 cell growth step, and formulations that allow for higher AAV vector concentrations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are also in the process of acquiring capital
equipment and staffing a facility capable of process development and non-cGMP manufacturing at 100 L scale. Such a facility would enable us to complete all process development at final manufacturing scale appropriate for many indications prior to
transfer of manufacturing to a cGMP facility, giving us better control of our future manufacturing requirements. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Strategic collaborations and

potential gene therapy product candidates. To access the substantial funding and other resources required to develop and commercialize gene therapy products, we intend to seek other opportunities to form strategic alliances with collaborators who
can augment our industry-leading gene therapy expertise. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As an example we entered into an agreement with SAFC Pharma, which also is our
current contract manufacturing organization, for cGMP manufacture of clinical grade material for third parties. This arrangement allows us to approach other gene therapy companies that might benefit from our manufacturing and vector design
capabilities. Under such an arrangement, we could potentially license our manufacturing technology and receive upfront payments, milestones and royalties. SAFC Pharma would do the manufacturing of commercial grade material. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our plan to bring in-house a pilot manufacturing facility will further support these efforts.
Such a facility will allow us to manufacture small amounts of non-clinical grade material for other gene therapy companies as they perform their pre-clinical experiments. It will also enable us to develop additional expertise in viral vector design
as we look to forge partnerships and alliances within the gene therapy space. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We also plan to continue to in-license additional
intellectual property to support our current programs, to establish new development programs and to support our manufacturing technology. Additionally we will seek to partner with both new commercial gene therapy companies and academic institutions
to leverage our expertise in vector design, research, manufacturing and the regulatory process. The goal of these collaborations would be to forge strategic partnerships around technologies and programs that would fit with our current development
pipeline. In general, we would seek new intellectual property, development programs in rare diseases, pipeline products where the regulatory pathway is understood, partners with strong scientific, clinical and management expertise, and programs that
have synergy with our current knowledge base and product pipeline that would add to our industry leadership. We would also be looking at programs where the disease being treated has a large enough patient population that there would be adequate
financial returns for the investment of resources. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We will also evaluate opportunities to add products, technology and talent in areas
consistent with our strategy through selective acquisitions. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Our license to Genzyme </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In 2004, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Genzyme to develop a recombinant AAV product to treat wet AMD. Our agreement originally
provided that the parties would share responsibility for planning, budgeting, workload, decision-making, costs and future revenues. The parties had joint ownership of any intellectual property that arose as a direct result of the work done for the
partnership. In collaboration with Genzyme, early product development work, production of materials for animal studies, development of several manufacturing and clinical assays, completion of IND-enabling toxicology and biodistribution studies,
technology transfer of our HSV-based manufacturing process to Genzyme, production of the AAV vector under GMP for the Phase 1 human clinical trial, and drafting of the IND were conducted. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In early 2010, as the product candidate was moving into human clinical trials required for wet AMD, we renegotiated our agreement to take the
form of a license of our HSV-based manufacturing technology and interest in the wet AMD program to Genzyme. The license provides for modest late-stage milestone payments to us and royalties on sales, as well as forgiveness of our share of
development costs from mid-2006 to the date the license was signed. Genzyme is responsible for all further development and commercialization of the wet AMD product candidate. We maintain non-exclusive rights to jointly developed technology. Genzyme
also has options, expiring in 2015 and 2017, to license our manufacturing technology, as it existed at the time of the license, for specified genes associated with diseases outside our current area of focus. Genzyme has informed us that it no longer
intends to use our HSV-based manufacturing technology to produce the AAV vector being used for the wet AMD product. Our license agreement with Genzyme was further amended in December 2013 to reflect this fact and, among other things, to terminate
our exclusive license to Genzyme for use of our HSV-based manufacturing technology in wet AMD except as to specified pending research activities, and to eliminate restrictions on our activities in the field of treatments for ocular
neovascularization disorders, including AMD. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We currently do not expect to derive substantial revenue from our license to Genzyme. </P>

manufacturing, animal model development and facilities for both small and large animal testing, and in certain instances we have benefited from the ability to conduct important research at UF
without having to expand in-house facilities and personnel. We interact frequently with the Powell Gene Therapy Center at UF and have an excellent working relationship with the UF Office of Technology Licensing. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In May 2013, we and UF were jointly awarded an $8.3 million dollar grant from the NEI to support development of our ACHM product candidate,
with Dr.&nbsp;William Hauswirth, one of our scientific founders and Professor and holder of the Rybaczki-Bullard Chair in the Department of Ophthalmology at UF, as principal investigator. As a sub-awardee, as of June&nbsp;30, 2014, we had received
$0.4 million and we expected to receive an additional $3.5 million over four years under this grant. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Our relationships with patient advocacy groups
and academic centers </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have long believed that when developing products to treat orphan indications it is important to form strong
relationships with patient advocacy groups, and we have done this successfully with both the Foundation Fighting Blindness, or FFB, and the Alpha-1 Foundation. Both organizations are well known for their advocacy of patients&#146; interests in
obtaining diagnosis, developing treatments and providing for reimbursement. Both actively support research into treatment, and we have been awarded three research grants totaling $1.6 million from the FFB and one grant of $0.3 million from the
Alpha-1 Foundation. More importantly, both organizations have been instrumental in assisting us in forming ties with disease experts, recruiting patients into clinical trials and helping us to understand the needs, wants and concerns of patients.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We also have formed strong relationships with key academic centers across the United States that have core competencies in gene therapy,
orphan ophthalmology and AAT deficiency. These centers conduct sponsored research, act as advisors and collaborate with us on grant proposals. We have been awarded grant funding aggregating $10.6 million between our inception and June&nbsp;30, 2014,
either independently or with our collaborators. This funding provides peer-reviewed scientific validation of our programs and has facilitated critical early stage research for our leading product candidates. </P>

protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business, including seeking, maintaining and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed
from third parties. We also rely on trade secrets relating to our proprietary technology platform and on know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in the
field of gene therapy that may be important for the development of our business. We additionally rely on regulatory protection afforded through orphan drug designations, data exclusivity, market exclusivity, and patent term extensions where
available. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our commercial success may depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for
commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business; defend and enforce our patents; preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and operate without infringing the valid enforceable patents and proprietary
rights of third parties. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products may depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these
activities. With respect to both licensed and company-owned intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the
future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our commercial products and methods of manufacturing the same. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have developed or in-licensed numerous patents and patent applications and possess substantial
know-how and trade secrets relating to the development and commercialization of gene therapy products. Our proprietary intellectual property, including patent and non-patent intellectual property, is generally directed to, for example, certain
genes, methods of transferring genetic material into cells, processes to manufacture our AAV-based product candidates and other proprietary technologies and processes related to our lead product candidates. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of September&nbsp;8, 2014, our patent portfolio included approximately 48 patents and patent applications that we own and approximately
64&nbsp;patents and patent applications that we have licensed. More specifically, we own five U.S. patents, four pending U.S. applications, 25 foreign patents and 14 foreign patent applications. We have licensed 22 U.S. patents, four pending U.S.
applications, 35 foreign patents and three pending foreign patent applications. Of the patents and patent applications that we own or license, 32 cover methods to manufacture AAV vectors, the longest lived and most significant of which is expected
to expire in 2025. Ten of the patent applications that we own are directed to small cone promoters and uses thereof. A patent issuing from this group could have an expiration date in 2034. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our objective is to continue to expand our portfolio of patents and patent applications in order to protect our gene therapy product
candidates and AAV manufacturing process. Our owned and licensed patent portfolio includes patents and patent applications directed to our AAT deficiency, XLRS and ACHM programs, as well as our foundational AAV platform. See also &#147;&#151;License
agreements.&#148; </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition to the above, we have established expertise and development capabilities focused in the areas of
preclinical research and development, manufacturing and manufacturing process scale-up, quality control, quality assurance, regulatory affairs and clinical trial design and implementation. We believe that our focus and expertise will help us develop
products based on our proprietary intellectual property and to expand our intellectual property. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The term of individual patents depends
upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the date of filing the non-provisional application. In the United States, a patent&#146;s term may
be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the United States Patent and Trademark Office in granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier-filed
patent. The issued patents that we own and license are expected to expire on various dates from 2016 to 2029. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The term of a patent that
covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration of a U.S. patent as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a
patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of
a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent per approved drug may be extended. Moreover, a patent can only be extended once, and thus, if a single patent is applicable to multiple products, it can only
be extended based on one product. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. When possible, depending upon the length of clinical trials and other factors
involved in the filing of a new drug application, or NDA, we expect to apply for patent term extensions for patents covering our product candidates and their methods of use. </P>

proprietary products, and any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will have to compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. While we believe that our proprietary technology
estate and scientific expertise in the gene therapy field provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including larger and better-funded pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and
biotechnology companies, as well as from academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions that may develop potentially competitive products or technologies. To the extent that we develop product candidates
for indications with larger patient populations, such as wet AMD, we expect to experience particularly intense competition from larger and better funded pharmaceutical companies. Any product candidate for wet AMD that we may develop will compete
with established drugs such as Genentech&#146;s Lucentis and Avastin and Regeneron&#146;s Eylea and new drug candidates being developed by others, including Genzyme, that are currently in clinical trials, as well as other treatment modalities such
as photodynamic therapy. </P>

approvals of treatments and the commercialization of those treatments. Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Our
commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we
may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to

Act, and the Public Health Service Act, or PHS Act, and other federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations. Both the FD&amp;C Act and the PHS Act and their corresponding regulations govern, among other things, the testing,
manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, reporting, advertising and other promotional practices involving biological products. Before clinical testing of biological products may begin, we must
submit an IND which must go into effect, and each clinical trial protocol for a gene therapy product candidate is reviewed by the FDA and, in some instances, the NIH, through its Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, or RAC. FDA approval of a BLA also
must be obtained before marketing of biological products. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial
time and financial resources and we may not be able to obtain the required regulatory approvals. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Within the FDA, the Center for Biologics
Evaluation and Research, or CBER, regulates gene therapy products. The CBER works closely with the NIH and its RAC, which makes recommendations to the NIH on gene therapy issues and engages in a public discussion of scientific, safety, ethical and
societal issues related to proposed and ongoing gene therapy protocols. The FDA and the NIH have published guidance documents with respect to the development and submission of gene therapy protocols. The FDA also has published guidance documents
related to, among other things, gene therapy products in general, their preclinical assessment, observing subjects involved in gene therapy studies for delayed adverse events, potency testing, and chemistry, manufacturing and control information in
gene therapy INDs. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Ethical, social and legal concerns about gene therapy, genetic testing and genetic research have led to the enactment
of legislation such as the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 and could result in additional regulations restricting or prohibiting the processes we may use. Federal and state agencies, congressional committees and foreign governments
have expressed interest in further regulating biotechnology. More restrictive regulations or claims that our products are unsafe or pose a hazard could prevent us from commercializing any products. New government requirements may be established that
could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, regulations, policies or guidance changed, or interpretations by agencies or courts
changed, or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The clinical trial sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any
available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA,
unless the FDA places the clinical trial on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. With gene therapy protocols, if the
FDA allows the IND to proceed, and the RAC decides that full public review of the protocol is warranted but did not take place before the IND review is complete, the FDA will request at the completion of its IND review that sponsors delay initiation
of the protocol until after completion of the RAC review process. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a biological product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a
clinical hold, trials may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once
begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such trials. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Clinical trials involve the administration of the biological product
candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor&#146;s control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other
things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain
adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA&#146;s GCP requirements, including the
requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be
conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated
benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Clinical trials also must be
reviewed by an institutional biosafety committee, or IBC, a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees basic and clinical research conducted at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential
risk to public health or the environment. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be
combined: </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Phase 1</I>. The biological product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety. In
the case of some product candidates for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product candidate may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Phase 2</I>. The biological product candidate is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Phase 3</I>. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency, and safety in an expanded patient
population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted
after initial marketing approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up. The FDA recommends that sponsors
observe subjects for potential gene therapy-related delayed adverse events for a 15-year period, including a minimum of five years of annual examinations followed by 10&nbsp;years of annual queries, either in person or by questionnaire, of trial
subjects. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical
activities, clinical data, and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA, the NIH and the
investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other trials, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a
serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor
also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor&#146;s initial receipt of the information. Phase&nbsp;1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be
completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are
being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB&#146;s requirements or if the biological
product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Human gene therapy products are a new category of
therapeutics. Because this is a relatively new and expanding area of novel therapeutic interventions, there can be no assurance as to the length of the trial period, the number of patients the FDA will require to be enrolled in the trials in order
to establish the safety, efficacy, purity and potency of human gene therapy products, or that the data generated in these trials will be acceptable to the FDA to support marketing approval. The NIH and the FDA have a publicly accessible database,
the Genetic Modification Clinical Research Information System, which includes information on gene transfer trials and serves as an electronic tool to facilitate the reporting and analysis of adverse events on these trials. Over the last several
years the FDA has issued helpful guidance on development of gene therapy products and shown a willingness to work closely with developers, especially with those working in orphan disease areas. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the
physical characteristics of the biological product candidate as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product candidate in commercial quantities in accordance with GMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of
adventitious agents with the use of biological products, the PHS Act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing
quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected
and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. </P>

of the biological product candidate. The BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal studies, human trials, information on the manufacture and composition of the product candidate, proposed labeling and other relevant
information. In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product candidate for the claimed indications in all relevant

candidate is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any biological
product candidate for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the BLA for filing and, even if filed,
that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each BLA
must be accompanied by a user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. According to the FDA&#146;s fee schedule for fiscal year 2014, effective October&nbsp;1, 2013, the user fee for an application requiring clinical data, such
as a BLA, is $2,169,100. PDUFA also imposes an annual product fee for biologics ($104,060) and an annual establishment fee ($526,500) on facilities used to manufacture prescription biologics. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain
circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for product candidates designated as orphan drugs, unless the product candidate also
includes a non-orphan indication. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if
it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA
must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA.
The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product candidate is safe and potent, or effective, for its intended use, and has an acceptable purity profile, and whether the product candidate is being manufactured in
accordance with GMP regulations to assure and preserve the product candidate&#146;s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel biological products or biological products that present difficult
questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA
is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the biological product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation
Strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the biological product candidate. A REMS may be imposed to ensure safe use of the drug, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use,
such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the BLA without a REMS, if required.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product candidate is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the
product candidate unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with GMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product candidate within required specifications. Additionally, before
approving a BLA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND trial requirements and GCP requirements. To assure GMP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant
expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production, and quality control. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Notwithstanding the
submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret
data differently than we interpret the same data. If the agency decides not to approve the BLA in its present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the
FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might
take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to
specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product candidate. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included
in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a REMS, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing clinical
trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, designed to further assess a biological product&#146;s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been
commercialized. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">One of the performance goals agreed to by the FDA under the PDUFA is to review 90% of standard BLAs in 10 months and 90%
of priority BLAs in six months, whereupon a review decision is to be made. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs and its review goals are subject to change from time to time. The review process and the
PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the BLA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA
goal date. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Orphan drug designation </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product candidate intended to treat a rare disease or
condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing
and making a drug or biological product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product candidate. Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After
the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory
review and approval process. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If a product candidate that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the
disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biological product for the same indication for
seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has
exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains
approval of the same biological product as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor&#146;s product for the same indication or disease. If a drug or biological product designated as an orphan
product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the European Union has similar, but not identical, benefits. </P>

meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs and biological products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical
needs for the disease or condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product candidate and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new drug or biologic may request the FDA to designate the drug

be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product candidate is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective
therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an
application for a new drug or biological product candidate designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review, and aims to review such applications within six months as opposed to ten months for standard review. Additionally, a
product candidate may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug or biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing
treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the product candidate has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely
to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the
availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biological product candidate receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical
trials. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. </P>

request designation of a product candidate as a &#147;breakthrough therapy.&#148; A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or
condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical
development. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval and receive the same benefits as drugs with Fast Track designation. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing
advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Fast Track designation,

financial resources. Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of biological products continues after approval, particularly with respect to GMP requirements. We will rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical
and commercial quantities of any products that we may commercialize. Manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable requirements in the GMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records
and documentation. Other post-approval requirements applicable to biological products include reporting of GMP deviations that may affect the identity, potency, purity and overall safety of a distributed product, record-keeping requirements,
reporting of adverse effects, reporting updated safety and efficacy information, and complying with electronic record and signature requirements. After a BLA is approved, the product may also be subject to official lot release. In this case, as part
of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each

the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical trial or trials. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the
reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one
has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. However, complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structure of biological
products, as well as the process by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation that are still being worked out by the FDA. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A reference biologic is granted twelve years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product. On April&nbsp;10, 2013,
President Obama released his proposed budget for fiscal year 2014 and proposed to cut this twelve-year period of exclusivity down to seven years. He also proposed to prohibit additional periods of exclusivity for brand biologics due to minor changes
in product formulations, a practice often referred to as &#147;evergreening.&#148; The first biologic product submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway that is determined to be interchangeable with the reference product has exclusivity
against other biologics submitting under the abbreviated approval pathway for the lesser of (i)&nbsp;one year after the first commercial marketing, (ii)&nbsp;18 months after approval if there is no legal challenge, (iii)&nbsp;18 months after the
resolution in the applicant&#146;s favor of a lawsuit challenging the biologics&#146; patents if an application has been submitted, or (iv)&nbsp;42 months after the application has been approved if a lawsuit is ongoing within the 42-month period.

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Sales of our products, when and if approved for marketing, will depend, in part, on the extent to which our products will be covered by
third-party payors, such as federal, state, and foreign government health care programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical products, drugs and
services. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of
generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Decreases in third-party
reimbursement for our product candidates or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover our product candidates could reduce physician usage of our products once approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and
financial condition. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Other Healthcare Laws </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Although we currently do not have any products on the market, we may be subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the
federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security and physician
sunshine laws and regulations, many of which may become more applicable to us if our product candidates are approved and we begin commercialization. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental
regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state
healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. </P>

lead product candidates and to build the sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure that we believe will be necessary to commercialize our lead product candidates, if approved, we will require substantial additional funding. Also, our current

development and approval process is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. We have not submitted an application for or received marketing approval for any of our product candidates. We have limited
experience in conducting and managing the later stage clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approvals, including approval by the FDA. To receive approval, we must, among other things, demonstrate with substantial evidence from clinical
trials that the product candidate is both safe and effective for each indication for which approval is sought, and failure can occur in any stage of development. Satisfaction of the approval requirements typically takes several years and the time
needed to satisfy them may vary substantially, based on the type, complexity and novelty of the pharmaceutical product. We cannot predict if or when we might receive regulatory approvals for any of our product candidates currently under development.

may seek to develop in the future will ever obtain the appropriate regulatory approvals necessary for us or our collaborators to commence product sales. Any delay in obtaining, or an inability to obtain, applicable regulatory approvals would prevent
us from commercializing our product candidates, generating revenues and achieving and sustaining profitability. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Our gene therapy

efforts on our gene therapy platform, and our future success depends on the successful development of this approach. There can be no assurance that any development problems we experience in the future related to our gene therapy platform will not
cause significant delays or unanticipated costs, or that such development problems can be solved. We may also experience unanticipated problems or delays in expanding our manufacturing capacity or transferring our manufacturing process to commercial
partners, which may prevent us from completing our clinical trials or commercializing our products on a timely or profitable basis, if at all. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, the clinical trial requirements of the FDA, the EMA and other regulatory agencies and the criteria these regulators use to
determine the safety and efficacy of a product candidate vary substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use and market of such product candidates. The regulatory approval process for novel product candidates such as ours
can be more expensive and take longer than for other, better known or extensively studied pharmaceutical or other product candidates. At the moment, only one gene therapy product, uniQure B.V.&#146;s Glybera, which received marketing authorization
from the EMA in 2012, has been approved in Europe but has not yet been launched for commercial sale, which makes it difficult to determine how long it will take or how much it will cost to obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates in
either the United States or Europe. Approvals by the EMA may not be indicative of what the FDA may require for approval. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Regulatory
requirements governing gene and cell therapy products have changed frequently and may continue to change in the future. For example, the FDA has established the Office of Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies within its Center for Biologics Evaluation
and Research, or CBER, to consolidate the review of gene therapy and related products, and the Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee to advise CBER on its review. Gene therapy clinical trials conducted at institutions that receive
funding for recombinant DNA research from the United States National Institutes of Health, or the NIH, are also subject to review by the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities&#146; Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, or the RAC. Although the FDA
decides whether individual gene therapy protocols may proceed, the RAC review process can delay the initiation </P>

of a clinical trial, even if the FDA has reviewed the trial design and details and approved its initiation. Conversely, the FDA can put an IND on clinical hold even if the RAC has provided a
favorable review of the drug. Also, before a clinical trial can begin at an NIH-funded institution, that institution&#146;s institutional review board, or IRB, and its Institutional Biosafety Committee have to review the proposed clinical trial to
assess the safety of the trial. In addition, adverse developments in clinical trials of gene therapy products conducted by others may cause the FDA or other regulatory bodies to change the requirements for approval of any of our product candidates.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">These regulatory review committees and advisory groups and the new guidelines they promulgate may lengthen the regulatory review process,
require us to perform additional studies, increase our development costs, lead to changes in regulatory positions and interpretations, delay or prevent approval and commercialization of these product candidates or lead to significant post-approval
limitations or restrictions. As we advance our product candidates, we will be required to consult with these regulatory and advisory groups, and comply with applicable guidelines. If we fail to do so, we may be required to delay or discontinue
development of our product candidates. These additional processes may result in a review and approval process that is longer than we otherwise would have expected for orphan ophthalmology product candidates. Delay or failure to obtain, or unexpected
costs in obtaining, the regulatory approval necessary to bring a potential product to market could decrease our ability to generate sufficient product revenue to maintain our business. </P>

or results, and interim results of a clinical trial are not necessarily indicative of final results. Our product candidates may also fail to show the desired safety and efficacy in clinical development despite demonstrating positive results in
animal studies or having successfully advanced through initial clinical trials. For example, our animal studies of our AAT product candidate resulted in evidence of significant production of AAT levels, but early clinical trials of our product
candidate showed significantly lower levels of AAT production in treated patients. There can be no assurance that the success we achieved in the animal studies for our lead product candidates will result in success in our clinical trials of those
product candidates. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There is a high failure rate for drugs and biological products proceeding through clinical trials. A number of
companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in later stage clinical trials even after achieving promising results in earlier stage clinical trials. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical
activities are subject to varying interpretations, which may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. In addition, we may experience regulatory delays or rejections as a result of many factors, including due to changes in regulatory policy
during the period of our product candidate development. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We may find it difficult to enroll patients in our clinical trials, which

trials of our product candidates is critical to our success. The timing of our clinical trials depends on the speed at which we can recruit patients to participate in testing our product candidates as well as completion of required follow-up
periods. If patients are unwilling to participate in our gene therapy studies because of negative publicity from adverse events in the biotechnology or gene therapy industries or for other reasons, including competitive clinical trials for similar
patient populations, the timeline for recruiting patients, conducting studies and obtaining regulatory approval of our product candidates may be delayed. For example, trials using early versions of lentiviral vectors, which integrate with, and
thereby alter, the host cell&#146;s DNA, have led to several well-publicized adverse events, including reported cases of leukemia. If there are delays in accumulating the required number of clinical events in trials for our product candidates where
clinical events are a primary endpoint, there may be delays in completing the trial. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As with many pharmaceutical and biological products, treatment with our product candidates may produce undesirable side effects or adverse
reactions or events. These adverse events may occur despite our belief that our AAV vectors have an improved safety profile over prior such treatments. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Known adverse side effects that could occur with treatment with AAV vectors include an immunologic reaction to the capsid protein or gene at
early timepoints after administration. In previous clinical trials involving AAV viral vectors for gene therapy, some subjects experienced serious adverse events, including the development of T-cell response due to immune response against the vector
capsid proteins. If our vectors demonstrate a similar effect, or other adverse events, we may be required to halt or delay further clinical development of our product candidates. In addition, theoretical adverse side effects of AAV vectors include
replication and spread of the virus to other parts of the body and insertional oncogenesis, which is the process whereby the insertion of a functional gene near a gene that is important in cell growth or division results in uncontrolled cell
division, also known as cancer, which could potentially enhance the risk of malignant transformation. Potential procedure-related events, including inflammation or injury to the eye, are similar to those associated with standard ophthalmic
intervention procedures. There is also the potential risk of delayed adverse events following exposure to gene therapy products due to persistent biological activity of the genetic material or other components of products used to carry the genetic
material. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If any such adverse events occur, our clinical trials could be suspended or terminated and the FDA, the EMA or other foreign
regulatory authorities could order us to cease further development of or deny approval of our product candidates for any or all targeted indications. The product-related side effects could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled
patients to complete the trial. If we elect or are required to delay, suspend or terminate any clinical trial of any of our product candidates, the commercial prospects of such product candidates will be harmed and our ability to generate product
revenues from any of these product candidates will be delayed or eliminated. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Additionally, if any of our product candidates receive marketing approval, the FDA could require us to adopt a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation

product candidates. If our competitors are able to obtain orphan product exclusivity for their products that are the same as our product candidates, we may not be able to have competing products approved by the applicable regulatory authority for a
significant period of time. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Regulatory authorities in some jurisdictions, including the United States and Europe, may designate
drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. Under the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, the FDA may designate a product candidate as an orphan drug if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as
having a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals diagnosed annually in the United States, or a patient population greater than 200,000 in the United States where there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing the drug
will be recovered from sales in the United States. In the European Union, the EMA&#146;s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, or COMP, grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis,
prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than 5 in 10,000&nbsp;persons in the European Union Community. Additionally, designation is granted for products intended for the diagnosis,
prevention or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition and when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the European Union would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment
in developing the drug or biological product. Our product candidates for the treatment of LCA2, XLRS, ACHM (in the form caused by mutations in the CNGB3 gene) and AAT deficiency have been granted orphan drug designations by the FDA, but at this time
we have neither requested nor obtained orphan drug designation for any of our other product candidates. Even if we request orphan drug designation for our other product candidates, there can be no assurances that the FDA will grant any of our
product candidates such designation. Additionally, the designation by the FDA of any of our product candidates as an orphan drug does not guarantee that the FDA will accelerate regulatory review of or ultimately approve that product candidate. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Generally, if a product candidate with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for the indication for
which it has such designation, the product is entitled to a period of marketing exclusivity, which precludes the EMA or the FDA from approving another marketing application for the same drug and indication for that time period, except in limited
circumstances. The applicable period is seven years in the United States and 10 years in Europe. The European exclusivity period can be reduced to six years if a product no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation or if the product is
sufficiently profitable so that market exclusivity is no longer justified. Orphan drug exclusivity may be lost if the FDA or EMA determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure
sufficient quantity of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Even if we obtain orphan drug
exclusivity for a product candidate, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product candidate from competition because different drugs can be approved for the same condition. In the United States, even after an orphan drug is approved, the
FDA can subsequently approve another drug for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later drug is clinically superior in that it is shown to be safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. </P>

product candidate or the approval may be for a more narrow indication than we expect. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We cannot commercialize a product candidate
until the appropriate regulatory authorities have reviewed and approved the product candidate. Even if our product candidates demonstrate safety and efficacy in clinical trials, the regulatory agencies may not complete their review processes in a
timely manner, or we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval. Additional delays may result if an FDA Advisory Committee or other regulatory authority recommends non-approval or restrictions on approval. In addition, we may experience delays or
rejections based upon additional government regulation from future legislation or administrative action, or changes in regulatory agency policy during the period of product development, clinical trials and the review

advises that patients treated with some types of gene therapy undergo follow-up observations for potential adverse events for as long as 15&nbsp;years. The holder of an approved BLA must also submit new or supplemental applications and obtain FDA
approval for certain changes to the approved product, product labeling or manufacturing process. Advertising and promotional materials must comply with FDA rules and are subject to FDA review,&nbsp;in addition to other potentially applicable federal

regulatory approval of our product candidates. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. If we are slow or
unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained and we may not achieve or
sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Even if

other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or by the FDA. Sales of our product candidates outside of the United States will be
subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing clinical trials and marketing approval. Even if the FDA grants marketing approval for a product candidate, comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries must also approve the
manufacturing and marketing of the product candidates in those countries. Approval procedures vary among jurisdictions and can involve requirements and administrative review periods different from, and greater than, those in the United States,
including additional preclinical studies or clinical trials. In many countries outside the United States, a product candidate must be approved for reimbursement before it can be approved for sale in that country. In some cases, the price that we
intend to charge for our products, if approved, is also subject to approval. We intend to submit a marketing authorization application to the EMA for approval in the EEA, but obtaining such approval is a lengthy and expensive process and the EMA has
its own procedures for approval of product candidates. Even if a product candidate is approved, the FDA or the EMA, as the case may be, may limit the indications for which the product may be marketed, require extensive warnings on the product
labeling or require expensive and time-consuming clinical trials or reporting as conditions of approval. Regulatory authorities in countries outside of the United States and the EEA also have requirements for approval of product candidates with
which we must comply prior to marketing in those countries. Obtaining foreign regulatory approvals and compliance with foreign regulatory requirements could result in significant delays, difficulties and costs for us and could delay or prevent the
introduction of our product candidates in certain countries. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Further, clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by
regulatory authorities in other countries and regulatory approval of a product candidate in one country does not ensure approval in any other country, while a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may have a negative
effect on the regulatory approval process in others. Also, regulatory approval for any of our product candidates may be withdrawn. If we fail to comply with the regulatory requirements in international markets and/or receive applicable marketing
approvals, our target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of our product candidates will be harmed and our business will be adversely affected. </P>

among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator&#146;s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed collaborator&#146;s evaluation of a number of factors. Moreover, we may not be
successful in our efforts to establish a strategic partnership or other alternative arrangements for our product candidates because our research and development pipeline may be insufficient, our product candidates may be deemed to be at too early of
a stage of development for collaborative effort and third parties may not view our product candidates as having the requisite potential to demonstrate safety and efficacy. If we license product candidates, we may not be able to realize the benefit

arising from the collaboration. In other cases, publication rights are controlled exclusively by us, although in some cases we may share these rights with other parties. We also conduct joint research and development programs that may require us to

third-party payors, including private and governmental payors, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs, play an important role in determining the extent to which new drugs and biologics will be covered and reimbursed. The Medicare and Medicaid
programs increasingly are used as models for how private payors and other governmental payors develop their coverage and reimbursement policies for drugs and biologics. Currently, no gene therapy products have been approved for coverage and
reimbursement by the Centers for Medicare&nbsp;&amp; Medicaid Services, or CMS, the agency responsible for administering the Medicare program, and it is difficult to predict what CMS will decide with respect to coverage and reimbursement for
fundamentally novel products such as ours, as there is no body of established practices and precedents for these new products. Moreover, reimbursement agencies in Europe may be more conservative than CMS. For example, a number of cancer drugs have
been approved for reimbursement in the United States and have not been approved for reimbursement in certain European countries. It is difficult to predict at this time what third-party payors will decide with respect to the coverage and

product approved to date in Europe. Public perception may be influenced by claims that gene therapy is unsafe, and gene therapy may not gain the acceptance of the public or the medical community. In particular, our success will depend upon
physicians specializing in the treatment of those diseases that our product candidates target prescribing treatments that involve the use of our product candidates in lieu of, or in addition to, existing treatments they are already familiar with and
for which greater clinical data may be available. More restrictive government regulations or negative public opinion would have a negative effect on our business or financial condition and may delay or impair the development and commercialization of
our product candidates or demand for any products we may develop. For example, trials using early versions of lentiviral vectors, which integrate with, and thereby alter, the host cell&#146;s DNA, have led to several well-publicized adverse events,
including reported cases of leukemia. Although none of our current product candidates utilize lentiviral vectors, our product candidates use a viral delivery system. Adverse events in our clinical trials, even if not ultimately attributable to our
product candidates, and the resulting publicity could result in increased governmental regulation, unfavorable public perception, potential regulatory delays in the testing or approval of our product candidates, stricter labeling requirements for
those product candidates that are approved and a decrease in demand for any such product candidates. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:2%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Healthcare legislative reform
measures may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the United States, there have been and
continue to be a number of legislative initiatives to contain healthcare costs. For example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or PPACA, was passed, which
substantially changes the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The PPACA, among other things, subjects biologic products to potential competition by
lower-cost biosimilars, addresses a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, increases the minimum Medicaid
rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extends the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, establishes annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription
drugs, and subjects additional drugs to lower pricing under the 340B drug pricing program by adding new entities to the program. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since
the PPACA was enacted. On August&nbsp;2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit
reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation&#146;s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare
payments to providers up to 2%&nbsp;per fiscal year, which went into effect on April&nbsp;1, 2013. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that
federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures. </P>

could result in additional regulations restricting or prohibiting the products and processes we may use. Even with the requisite approvals from the FDA in the United States and other government bodies internationally, the commercial success of our
product candidates will depend in part on the medical community&#146;s, patients&#146;, and third-party payors&#146; acceptance of gene therapy products in general, and our product candidates in particular, as medically necessary, cost-effective,
and safe. Any product that we bring to the market may not gain market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community. If these products do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate
significant product revenue and may not become profitable. The degree of market acceptance of our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors, including: </P>

expenses that we did not incur as a private company. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules subsequently implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, and The NASDAQ Global Market impose various requirements on public
companies. In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, was enacted. There are significant corporate governance and executive compensation related provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act that require
the SEC to adopt additional rules and regulations in these areas. Recent legislation permits us, as a smaller &#147;emerging growth company,&#148; to implement many of these requirements over a longer period and up to five years from the date of our
initial public offering, which was March&nbsp;26, 2014. We are taking advantage of the flexibility accorded to us by this legislation but cannot guarantee that we will not be required to implement these requirements sooner than budgeted or planned
and thereby incur unexpected expenses. Stockholder activism, the current political environment and the current high level of government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations, which may
lead to additional compliance costs and impact the manner in which we operate our business in ways we cannot currently anticipate. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We may
not be successful in complying with these obligations, and compliance with these obligations could be time-consuming and expensive. If these requirements divert the attention of our management and personnel from other business concerns, they could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly.
For example, we expect that these rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, which in turn could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified
members of our board of directors. The increased costs will decrease our net income or increase our net loss, and may require us to reduce costs in other areas of our business or increase the prices of our products or services. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our management has determined that as of June&nbsp;30, 2014 and 2013, we had material weaknesses in our internal control over financial
reporting, which relate to the design and operation of our closing and financial reporting processes and our accounting for debt, equity and convertible instruments. We have concluded that these material weaknesses in our internal control over
financial reporting are due to the fact that we do not have the appropriate resources with the appropriate level of experience and technical expertise to oversee our closing and financial reporting processes and to address the accounting and
financial reporting requirements related to our issuances of convertible notes, preferred stock warrants, stock options, preferred stock and preferred stock purchase rights. These material weaknesses have not yet been remediated. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If we fail to fully remediate these material weaknesses or fail to maintain effective internal controls in the future, it could result in a
material misstatement of our financial statements that would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis, which could cause investors to lose confidence in our financial information or cause our stock price to decline. Our independent registered

to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of products we develop. While we believe our product liability insurance coverage is sufficient in light of our current clinical programs, The
amount of the product liability coverage that we carry varies from time to time, depending on a number of factors, the most significant of which are the nature and scope of the clinical trials in which we are engaged and the number of patients being
treated with our product candidates in these trials. The amount of our product liability coverage as of June&nbsp;30, 2014 was $10.0 million. This amount may increase or decrease in the future. We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a
reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability and any claim that may be brought against us could result in a court judgment or settlement in an amount that is not covered, in whole or in part, by our
insurance or that is in excess of the limits of our insurance coverage. If and when we obtain marketing approval for product candidates, we intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the commercial sale of our products; however, we may be
unable to obtain product liability insurance on commercially reasonable terms or in adequate amounts. Our insurance policies also have various exclusions, and we may be subject to a product liability claim for which we have no coverage. A successful
product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our stock price to decline and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could adversely affect our results of operations and business. </P>

using, handling, storing and disposing of these materials comply with legally prescribed standards, we cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from our use of

of our operations are conducted from our headquarters located near Gainesville, Florida. Hurricanes or other natural disasters could severely disrupt our operations, damage our research facilities or destroy stored research materials that could be
difficult to replace, and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. In addition, despite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of
our current and any future CROs and other contractors and consultants and collaborators are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. If such an
event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our development programs and our business operations. If a natural disaster, power outage or other event occurred that prevented us from using
all or a significant portion of our headquarters, that damaged critical infrastructure or that otherwise disrupted our operations or the operations of our third-party contract manufacturer, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible for us
to continue our business for a substantial period of time. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from our clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce
the data. If our security measures, disaster recovery and business continuity plans are not adequate in the event of such a breach, serious disaster or similar event, we could incur substantial expenses and the further development and
commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. </P>

materials and other production constraints. The complexity of these processes, as well as strict company and government standards for the manufacture and storage of our products, subjects us to production risks. While product batches released for
use in clinical trials or for commercialization undergo sample testing, some defects may only be identified following product release. In addition, process deviations or unanticipated effects of approved process changes may result in these
intermediate products not complying with stability requirements or specifications. Most of our product candidates must be stored and transported at temperatures within a certain range. If these environmental conditions deviate, our product
candidates&#146; remaining shelf-lives could be impaired or their efficacy and safety could become adversely affected, making them no longer suitable for use. The occurrence or suspected occurrence of production and distribution difficulties can
lead to lost inventories, and in some cases product recalls, with consequential reputational damage and the risk of product liability. The investigation and remediation of any identified problems can cause production delays, substantial expense,
lost sales and delays of new product launches. Any interruption in the supply of finished products or the loss thereof could hinder our ability to timely distribute our products and satisfy customer demand. Any unforeseen failure in the storage of
the product or loss in supply could delay our clinical trials and, if our product candidates are approved, result in a loss of our market share and negatively affect our revenues and operations. </P>

operating loss carryforwards that could be utilized annually in the future to offset our taxable income. Specifically, this limitation may arise in the event of a cumulative change in ownership of our company of more than 50% within a three-year
period. Any such annual limitation may significantly reduce the utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards before they expire. We have not completed a study to assess whether an ownership change has occurred, or whether there have been
multiple ownership changes since our inception, due to the significant costs and complexities associated with such a study. However, we believe it is likely that transactions that have occurred in the past and other transactions that may occur in
the future, would trigger an ownership change pursuant to Section&nbsp;382, which could limit the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that could be utilized annually in the future to offset our taxable income, if any. </P>

sensitive information about the us, our patients or our intellectual property, or if we fail to protect the privacy of patient and employee confidential data against breaches of network or information technology security, it would result in damage

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain,
involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. In addition, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. For example,
European patent law restricts the patentability of methods of treatment of the human body more than United States law does. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in
the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot know with certainty whether we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our owned or
licensed patents or pending patent applications, or that we were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain.
Our pending and future patent applications may not result in issued patents that protect our technology or products, in whole or in part, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. Changes in
either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Moreover, we may be subject to a third-party preissuance submission of prior art to the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or become
involved in opposition, derivation, reexamination, inter partes review, post-grant review or interference proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or
litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology or products and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize
products without infringing third-party patent rights. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or
commercialize current or future product candidates. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Even if our owned and licensed patent applications issue as patents, they may not
issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors from competing with us or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Our competitors may be able to circumvent our owned or licensed patents by
developing similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, the issuance of a patent is not
conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, and our owned and licensed patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or freedom
to operate or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of
the patent protection of our technology and products. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such
candidates are commercialized. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Third parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging claims of intellectual property infringement, the outcome of which would be

avoiding infringement of the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. There is a substantial amount of litigation, both within and outside the United States, involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and
pharmaceutical industries, including patent infringement lawsuits, interferences, oppositions and<I>&nbsp;inter partes</I>&nbsp;reexamination proceedings before the United&nbsp;States Patent and Trademark Office and corresponding foreign patent
offices. Numerous United States and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we are pursuing development candidates. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries
expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our product candidates may be subject to claims of infringement of the patent rights of third parties. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Third parties may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without
authorization. There may be third-party patents or patent applications with claims to materials, formulations, methods of manufacture or methods for treatment related to the use or manufacture of our product candidates. Because patent applications
can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending patent applications that may later result in issued patents that our product candidates may infringe. In addition, third parties may obtain patents in the future and claim that use of our
technologies infringes upon these patents. If any third-party patents were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover the manufacturing process of any of our product candidates, any molecules formed during the manufacturing process or any
final product itself, the holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to commercialize such product candidate unless we obtained a license under the applicable patents, or until such patents expire. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Similarly, if any third-party patents were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover aspects of our formulations, methods for
manufacture or methods of use, including combination therapy, the holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to develop and commercialize the applicable product candidate unless we obtained a license or until such patent expires.
In either case, such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Parties making claims against us may obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to further develop
and commercialize one or more of our product candidates. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business. In the event of a
successful claim of infringement against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys&#146; fees for willful infringement, pay royalties, redesign our infringing products or obtain one or more licenses from
third parties, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We may not be successful in obtaining

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Presently we have rights to the intellectual property to develop our gene therapy product candidates. Because a key element of our business
strategy is to pursue in-licensing and intellectual property acquisitions for additional product candidates that may require the use of proprietary rights held by third parties, the growth of our business will likely depend in part on our ability to
acquire, in-license or use these proprietary rights. In addition, our product candidates may require specific formulations to work effectively and efficiently and these rights may be held by others. We may be unable to acquire or in-license any
compositions, methods of use, processes or other third-party intellectual property rights from third parties that we identify on terms that we find acceptable, or at all. The licensing and acquisition of third-party intellectual property rights is a
competitive area, and a number of more established companies are also pursuing strategies to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights that we may consider attractive. These established companies may have a competitive advantage
over us due to their size, cash resources and greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For example, we sometimes
collaborate with United States and foreign academic institutions to accelerate our preclinical research or development under written agreements with these institutions. Typically, these institutions provide us with an option to negotiate a license
to any of the institution&#146;s rights in technology resulting from the collaboration. Regardless of such right of first negotiation for intellectual property, we may be unable to negotiate a license within the specified time frame or under terms
that are acceptable to us. If we are unable to do so, the institution may offer the intellectual property rights to other parties, potentially blocking our ability to pursue our program. </P>

complicated by the rapid pace of scientific discovery in our industry. We are a party to intellectual property license agreements with the University of Florida Research Foundation, an affiliate of the University of Florida, Johns Hopkins
University, the UAB Research Foundation, an affiliate of The University of Alabama at Birmingham and the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania, each of which is important to our business, and we expect to enter into additional license
agreements in the future. Our existing license agreements impose, and we expect that future license agreements will impose, various diligence, milestone payment, royalty and other obligations on us. If we fail to comply with our obligations under
these agreements, or we are subject to a bankruptcy, the licensor may have the right to terminate the license, in which event we would not be able to market products covered by the license. </P>

done so from time to time. It is possible that we may fail to obtain any of these licenses at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, if at all. In that event, we may be required to expend significant time and resources to develop or license
replacement technology. If we are unable to do so, we may be unable to develop or commercialize the affected product candidates, which could harm our business significantly. We cannot provide any assurances that third-party patents do not exist
which might be enforced against our current product candidates or future products, resulting in either an injunction prohibiting our sales, or, with respect to our sales, an obligation on our part to pay royalties and/or other forms of compensation

market competing products using the intellectual property. In certain cases, we control the prosecution of patents resulting from licensed technology. In the event we breach any of our obligations related to such prosecution, we may incur
significant liability to our licensing partners. Disputes may arise regarding intellectual property subject to a licensing agreement, including: </P> <P STYLE="font-size:6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Competitors may infringe our patents or other intellectual property or the patents or other intellectual property of our licensors. In
response, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. Any claims we assert against perceived infringers could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us, alleging that we infringe their
patents. In addition, in a patent infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours or our licensors is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, construe the patent&#146;s claims narrowly or refuse to stop the other party from
using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted
narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Interference proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by
us may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patents or patent applications or those of our licensors. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights
to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms. Our defense of litigation or interference proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in
substantial costs and distract our management and other employees. We may not be able to prevent, alone or with our licensors, misappropriation of our intellectual property rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those
rights as fully as in the United States. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with
intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other
interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If we or one of our licensing partners initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering one of our product
candidates, the defendant could counterclaim that the patent covering our product candidate is invalid or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity or unenforceability are commonplace.
Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness or non-enablement. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone
connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or made a misleading statement, during prosecution. Third parties may also raise similar claims before administrative bodies
in the United States or abroad, even outside the context of litigation. Such mechanisms include re-examination, post grant review, and equivalent proceedings in foreign jurisdictions. Such proceedings could result in the revocation of or amendment
to our patents in such a way that they no longer cover our product candidates. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that
there is no invalidating prior art, of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity or unenforceability, we could lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the
patent protection on one or more of our product candidates. Such a loss of patent protection could have a material adverse impact on our business. </P>

changes to U.S. patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. The United States Patent and Trademark Office recently developed new regulations and procedures to
govern administration of the Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act, and in particular, the first to file provisions, only became effective on March&nbsp;16, 2013. Accordingly, it is

weakened the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents,
once obtained. Depending on decisions by the United&nbsp;States&nbsp;Congress, the federal courts, and the United States&nbsp;Patent and Trademark Office, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would

companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of
patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biotechnology products, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of
our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being
invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if
any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.

stock market in general, and The NASDAQ Global Market and the market for biotechnology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of
the particular companies affected. The trading prices and valuations of these stocks, and of ours, may not be predictable. A loss of investor confidence in the market for technology or software stocks or the stocks of other companies which investors
perceive to be similar to us, the opportunities in the digital simulation market or the stock market in general, could depress our stock price regardless of our business, prospects, financial conditions or results of operations. </P>

research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us, our business, our markets and our competitors. We do not control these analysts. As a&nbsp;newly public company, we have only limited coverage by securities analysts. If
securities analysts do not continue to cover our common stock, the lack of research coverage may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Furthermore, if one or more of the analysts who do cover us downgrade our stock or if those
analysts issue other unfavorable commentary about us or our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fails to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the market and
interest in our stock could decrease, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline and may also impair our ability to expand our business with existing customers and attract new customers. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of June&nbsp;30, 2014, our executive officers, employees, directors, current 5% or greater stockholders, and their respective affiliates
together beneficially own or control, in aggregate, approximately 63.2% of the shares of our outstanding common stock. As a result, these executive officers, directors and principal stockholders, acting together, will have substantial influence over
most matters that require approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors, any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all or of our assets or any other significant corporate transaction. Corporate action might be
taken even if other stockholders oppose such action. These stockholders may delay or prevent a change of control or otherwise discourage a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of our company, even if such change of control would
benefit our other stockholders. This concentration of stock ownership may adversely affect investors&#146; perception of our corporate governance or delay, prevent or cause a change in control of our company, any of which could adversely affect the
market price of our common stock. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We are an &#147;emerging growth company,&#148; and the reduced reporting requirements applicable

company,&#148; as defined in the JOBS Act. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging
growth companies, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation and
exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years from the
date of our initial public offering on March&nbsp;26, 2014, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0&nbsp;million as of any
December&nbsp;31 before that time or if we have total annual gross revenue of $1.0 billion or more during any fiscal year before that time, in which cases we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following June&nbsp;30 or, if we
issue more than $1.0&nbsp;billion in non-convertible debt during any three-year period before that time, we would cease to be an emerging growth company immediately. Even after we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, we may still qualify
as a &#147;smaller reporting company&#148; which would allow us to take advantage of many of the same exemptions from disclosure requirements, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section&nbsp;404 of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock
less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. </P>

standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, will be subject to the same new or revised
accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. As a result, changes in rules of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles or their interpretation, the adoption of new guidance or the application of
existing guidance to changes in our business could significantly affect our financial position and results of operations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>A
significant portion of our total outstanding shares is restricted from immediate resale but may be sold into the market in the near future, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline significantly, even if our business is

or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares of common stock intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock. As of September 19, 2014, we have 16,387,711 shares of common stock outstanding.
Other than the aggregate 7,091,667 shares sold by us in our initial public offering and our July 2014 follow-on offering, substantially all of the outstanding shares of our common stock are subject to a 180-day contractual lock-up with the
underwriters for our initial public offering, which period began on March&nbsp;26, 2014. Of these, approximately 9.1&nbsp;million shares are subject to an additional 90-day contractual lock-up with the underwriters for our follow-on offering, which
period began on July&nbsp;24, 2014. These shares can be sold, subject to any applicable volume limitations under federal securities laws, after the earlier of the expiration of, or release from, the applicable lock-up period. The balance of our
outstanding shares of common stock may be freely sold in the public market at any time to the extent permitted by Rules 144 and 701 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, which we refer to as the Securities Act. Moreover, holders of a
substantial portion of our common stock have rights, subject to conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other
stockholders. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, as of June&nbsp;30, 2014, there were 1,023,748&nbsp;shares subject to outstanding options under our equity
incentive plans, all of which shares we plan to register under the Securities Act on a registration statement on Form S-8. These shares, once vested and issued upon exercise, will be able to be freely sold in the public market, subject to volume
limits applicable to affiliates and the lock-up agreements described above, to the extent applicable. Furthermore, as of June&nbsp;30, 2014, there were 49,811 shares subject to outstanding warrants. These shares will become eligible for sale in the
public market to the extent such warrants are exercised and to the extent permitted by the lock-up agreements and Rule 144 under the Securities Act. </P>

expect that significant additional capital may be needed in the future to continue our planned operations, including conducting clinical trials, commercialization efforts, expanded research and development activities, potential acquisitions,
in-licenses, or collaborations and costs associated with operating a public company. To raise capital, we may sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine
from time to time. If we sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in more than one transaction, investors may be materially diluted by subsequent sales. Such sales may also result in material dilution to our existing
stockholders, and new investors could gain rights, preferences and privileges senior to the holders of our common stock. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We do not

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company that uses our proprietary gene therapy platform to develop products designed to transform the
lives of patients with severe inherited orphan diseases in ophthalmology. Our lead product candidates, which are each in the preclinical stage, are treatments for X-linked retinoschisis, or XLRS, achromatopsia, or ACHM, and X-linked retinitis
pigmentosa, or XLRP. These rare diseases of the eye are caused by mutations in single genes, significantly affect visual function and currently lack effective medical treatments. For our XLRS product candidate, we expect to file an IND and initiate
Phase 1/2 clinical trials in the United States in late 2014 with initial clinical data expected in mid-2015. For our ACHM product candidate, we expect to file an IND and initiate Phase 1/2 clinical trials in the United States in early 2015, with
clinical data expected in late 2015. We have also begun preclinical studies for our product candidate addressing XLRP, a disease characterized by progressive degeneration of the retina, leading to total blindness in adult men. We also plan to
develop new treatments for wet AMD by leveraging our experience developing products in orphan ophthalmology and our work with Genzyme on a first generation product for wet AMD. In the longer term, we will seek opportunities to take advantage of the
adaptability of our gene therapy platform to address a range of genetic diseases, both within and beyond our initial focus area of orphan ophthalmology. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Since our inception in 1999, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to our development efforts relating to our proof-of-concept
programs in ophthalmology and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, or AAT deficiency, an inherited orphan lung disease, including activities to manufacture product in compliance with good manufacturing practices, preparing to conduct and conducting
clinical trials of our product candidates, providing general and administrative support for these operations and protecting our intellectual property. We do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product
sales. We have funded our operations primarily through the private placement of preferred stock, common stock, convertible notes and warrants to purchase preferred stock and our initial public offering, which closed in April 2014. We have also been
awarded grant funding aggregating $10.6 million between our inception and June&nbsp;30, 2014, either independently or with our collaborators. Most recently, in May 2013, we and the University of Florida, or UF, were jointly awarded an
$8.3&nbsp;million dollar grant from the National Eye Institute, or NEI, of the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, to support development of our ACHM product candidate. As a sub-awardee, as of June&nbsp;30, 2014, we had received $0.4 million and
we expected to receive an additional $3.5 million over the remaining three years of this grant. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have incurred losses from operations
in each year since inception. Our net losses were $15.9 million, $5.0&nbsp;million and $1.9 million for each of the fiscal years ended June&nbsp;30, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Substantially all our net losses resulted from costs incurred in
connection with our research and development programs and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for at least the next several years.
We expect our expenses will increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, as we: </P> <P STYLE="font-size:6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

complete development and obtain regulatory approval for one or more of our product candidates, which we expect will take a number of years and which we believe is subject to significant uncertainty. We believe that our existing cash and cash
equivalents at June 30, 2014, together with the net proceeds from our public offering in July 2014, will be sufficient to enable us to advance planned preclinical studies and clinical trials for our lead product candidates for at least the next 24
months. In order to complete the process of obtaining regulatory approval for our lead product candidates and to build the sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure that we believe will be necessary to commercialize our lead product
candidates, if approved, we will require substantial additional funding. Also, our current operating plan may change as a result of many factors currently unknown to us, and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned, through public or
private equity or debt financings, government or other third-party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements and other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements or a combination of these approaches. However, we may be
unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed on favorable terms or at all. Our failure to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial
condition and our ability to develop our products. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future, and we expect these losses to
increase as we continue our development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our product candidates and begin to commercialize any approved products. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development, we are
unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when or if we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Our ability to generate revenue from product sales will depend on a number of factors, including, among others,
obtaining and maintaining adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors for our product candidates and for gene therapy as a viable treatment option. Even if we are able to generate revenues from the sale of our products, we may not
become profitable. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce our operations. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our ability to generate product revenue and become profitable depends upon our ability to successfully commercialize products. To date, we have
not generated any revenues from the sales of products. In the three fiscal years ended June&nbsp;30, 2014, 2013 and 2012, all our revenues were derived from grants. Our grant revenue is primarily generated through research and development grant
programs offered by federal, state, and local governments and agencies, including the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and by patient advocacy groups such as the Foundation Fighting Blindness, or FFB, and the Alpha-1 Foundation.
Grant revenue is recognized when there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and we have complied with the terms of the grant. Prior to fiscal year 2012, we also derived revenue from collaboration and license fees received under
our agreement with Genzyme Corporation, or Genzyme. We currently do not expect to derive substantial additional revenue from our agreement with Genzyme. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Revenue recognition </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have
generated revenue primarily through sponsored research arrangements with nonprofit organizations for the development and commercialization of product candidates and revenues from federal research and development grant programs. We recognize revenue
when amounts are realized or realizable and earned. Revenue is considered realizable and earned when the following criteria are met: (1)&nbsp;persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2)&nbsp;delivery has occurred or services have been
rendered; (3)&nbsp;the price is fixed or determinable; and (4)&nbsp;collection of the amounts due are reasonably assured. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Amounts
received prior to satisfying the revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue in our balance sheets. Amounts expected to be recognized as revenue within the twelve months following the balance sheet date are classified as current
liabilities. We recognize revenue for reimbursements of research and development costs under collaboration agreements as the services are performed. We record these reimbursements as revenue and not as a reduction of research and development
expenses, as we have the risks and rewards as the principal in the research and development activities. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We evaluate the terms of
sponsored research agreement grants and federal grants to assess our obligations and if our obligations are satisfied by the passage of time, revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis. In situations where the performance of our obligations has
been satisfied when the grant is received, revenue is recognized upon receipt of the grant. Certain grants contain refund provisions. We review those refund provisions to determine the likelihood of repayment. If the likelihood of repayment of the

grant requirements have been satisfied. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Research and development costs and expenses </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred. We recognize costs for certain development activities based on an evaluation
of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information and data provided to us by our vendors and our clinical sites. When outside contracts for research products or testing require advance payments, they are recorded on the balance sheet
as a prepaid item and expensed when the service is provided or reaches a specific milestone outlined in the contract. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Share-based compensation
</I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We account for our share-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718,&nbsp;<I>Compensation&#151;Stock Compensation</I>.
ASC&nbsp;718 establishes accounting for share-based awards exchanged for employee services. Under the fair value recognition provisions of ASC 718, share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and
is recognized as expense over the requisite service/vesting period. Determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share-based payment awards require the use of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected
life of the share-based payment awards and stock price volatility. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We estimate the grant date fair value of stock options and the related compensation
expense using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. This option valuation model requires the input of subjective assumptions including: (1)&nbsp;estimated period of time outstanding, or expected term, of the options granted, (2)&nbsp;volatility,
(3)&nbsp;risk-free interest rate and (4)&nbsp;expected dividend yield. Because share-based compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, it is reduced for estimated forfeitures. ASC 718 requires forfeitures to be estimated at
the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeiture rates differ from those estimates. We have estimated expected forfeitures of stock options based on our historical turnover rate and used these rates in
developing a future forfeiture rate. If our actual forfeiture rate varies from our estimates, additional adjustments to compensation expense may be required in future periods. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based payment
awards represent management&#146;s best estimates, but the estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As a result, if facts change and we use different assumptions, our share-based compensation expense could
be materially different in the future. We will no longer be required to estimate the fair value of our common stock underlying new equity awards after our initial public offering, now that our shares have begun trading on The NASDAQ Global Market.

June&nbsp;30, 2013 and 2012, we had warrants outstanding to purchase shares of our Series A-1, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Series&nbsp;A-1A</FONT> and Series B-1 preferred stock. Because our Series A-1, Series A-1A and Series B-1 preferred
stock were subject to redemption under circumstances outside of our control, the outstanding shares of these series of preferred stock are presented as temporary equity for those periods. Consequently, the warrants to purchase shares of Series A-1,
Series A-1A and Series B-1 preferred stock were accounted for as liabilities and adjusted to fair value at the end of each reporting period. The fair value of the warrants classified as liabilities was estimated using the Black-Scholes option
pricing model. The estimates in the Black-Scholes option pricing model were based, in part, on subjective assumptions, including stock price volatility, term of the warrants, risk free interest rate, dividend yield, and fair value of the preferred
stock underlying the warrants. The gain or loss associated with the change in the fair value of the preferred stock warrant liability from the prior period is recognized as a component of other (expense) income, net. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Series B purchase rights </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In November 2012, we entered into a Series B-1, B-2 and B-3 Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement, or Series B Purchase Agreement, which
authorized the sale of up to 290,781,972 shares of convertible preferred stock in three separate tranches of Series B-1, Series B-2 and Series B-3 preferred stock, respectively. Simultaneously with the execution of the Series B Purchase Agreement,
we issued and sold an aggregate of 66,147,709 shares of Series B-1 preferred stock at a price per share of $0.1297. The Series B Purchase Agreement provided that the holders of the Series B-1 shares, or Series B holders, were also entitled to
purchase up to an aggregate of 140,542,178 shares of Series B-2 preferred stock for an aggregate purchase price equal to $18.2 million, or second tranche, and up to an aggregate of 82,670,167 shares of Series B-3 preferred stock for an aggregate
purchase price equal to $10.7 million, or third tranche. The price per share and number of shares to be issued in exchange for such amount was to be determined separately for each tranche by reference to which, if any, of three milestones specified
in the agreement had been satisfied by us. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The purchase rights were legally separable and exercisable apart from the Series B-1 shares
and, because representatives of the Series B holders hold a majority of the seats on the board of directors, the decision to complete the second and third tranche was deemed to be outside our control. We therefore recorded, at the time of entry into
the Series B Purchase Agreement, a Series B purchase rights liability of $1.7 million for the fair value of our obligation to sell the Series B-2 and Series B-3 preferred stock in the second and third tranche. The Series B purchase rights liability
was valued separately for each series using the Black-Scholes option-pricing method to assign a value to the purchase right relating to that series under each of the possible applicable valuation scenarios, depending on which milestones were met,
with each scenario being assigned an estimated probability as of the valuation date. The aggregate of these probability-weighted valuations was assigned as the value of the purchase right for each tranche. The initial fair value of the Series B
purchase rights liability was estimated to be $0.6 million for the second tranche and $1.1 million for the third tranche. The total value allocated to the Series B purchase rights reduced the amount allocated to the carrying value of the Series B-1
preferred stock on our balance sheet. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The most significant and judgmental inputs driving the fair value of our Series B purchase rights
are the assumptions regarding the fair value of the underlying preferred shares and the volatility factor. With all other inputs constant, an increase or decrease in the assumed fair value of the preferred shares would result in a higher or lower
estimate of the fair value of the Series B purchase rights, respectively, although there would not be a direct correlation. Similarly, an increase or decrease in the assumed volatility factor would result in a higher or lower estimate of the fair
value of the Series B purchase rights, respectively. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In April 2013, following the satisfaction by us of the first milestone, the Series B
holders exercised their rights with respect to the second tranche and purchased an aggregate of 122,749,639 shares of Series B-2 preferred stock at a price per share of $0.1485, for gross cash proceeds of $18.2 million. During fiscal year 2013, we
recorded a change in value of the Series B purchase rights liability of $1.2 million to other expense and the $0.8 million balance of the value allocated to the Series B-2 purchase rights liability immediately prior to the closing of the second
tranche was recorded as proceeds from the issuance of the Series B-2 preferred stock. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In October 2013, the Series B holders exercised
their rights with respect to the third tranche and on November&nbsp;5, 2013, we sold to the Series B holders an aggregate of 58,816,897 shares of our Series B-3 preferred stock at a price per share of $0.1823 (or $6.38 on an as-converted to common
stock basis), for gross cash proceeds of $10.7 million. In connection with the closing of the third tranche, we and the Series B holders amended the terms of the Series B purchase agreement to provide that if the two remaining milestones specified
in the Series B Purchase Agreement are not satisfied by September 2014, the Series B holders who continue to hold shares of Series B-3 preferred stock will be entitled to receive an aggregate of approximately 13.4&nbsp;million additional shares of
Series B-3 preferred stock. This right was extinguished upon the conversion to common stock of all outstanding shares of our preferred stock upon the closing of our initial public offering. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In May&nbsp;2014, the FASB issued guidance that requires companies to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to
customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. It also requires enhanced disclosures about revenue, provides guidance for transactions that were not previously
addressed comprehensively, and improves guidance for multiple-element arrangements. The guidance applies to any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of
nonfinancial assets unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards. The guidance is effective for public companies for annual periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2016 as well as interim periods within those annual period using
either the full retrospective approach or modified retrospective approach. Early adoption is not permitted. We are currently evaluating the impacts of the new guidance on our financial statements. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In July 2013, the FASB issued amended guidance on the financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating
loss carryforward, similar tax loss, or tax credit carryforward exists. The guidance requires an unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit, to be presented as a reduction of a deferred tax asset when a net operating loss
carryforward, similar tax loss, or tax credit carryforward exists, with certain exceptions. This accounting guidance was effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2013. We adopted this new guidance beginning with our
interim financial statements for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2014. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our financial statements. </P>

2013. The higher expense was largely the result of fair value adjustments associated with our Series B purchase rights and our warrant liabilities, which increased by $1.7 million and $433 thousand, respectively, compared to fiscal year 2013. As
previously discussed above, the fair values of the Series&nbsp;B purchase rights and warrant liabilities were estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model which requires some subjective assumptions as some of its inputs. As of
June&nbsp;30, 2014, these Series&nbsp;B purchase rights had been fully exercised and the warrants had been converted into warrants exercisable for common stock. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Applied Genetic Technologies Corporation </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Applied Genetic Technologies Corporation (the Company) as of June 30, 2014 and 2013, and the related
statements of operations, convertible preferred stock and stockholders&#146; equity (deficit) and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2014. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule of the Company
listed in Item 15(a). These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company&#146;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over
financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Applied Genetic Technologies
Corporation as of June 30, 2014 and 2013, the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2014, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the
related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein. </P>

corporation on January&nbsp;19, 1999 and reincorporated as a Delaware corporation on October&nbsp;24, 2003. The Company is a clinical-stage biotechnology company primarily developing gene therapy products designed to transform the lives of patients
with severe inherited orphan diseases in ophthalmology. On April&nbsp;1, 2014, AGTC completed its initial public offering (&#147;IPO&#148;) and now trades on NASDAQ under the ticker symbol AGTC. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company has devoted substantially all of its efforts to research and development, including clinical trials. The Company has not completed
the development of any products. The Company has generated revenue from collaboration agreements, sponsored research payments and grants, but has not generated product revenue to date and is subject to a number of risks similar to those of other
early stage companies in the biotechnology industry, including dependence on key individuals, the difficulties inherent in the development of commercially viable products, the need to obtain additional capital necessary to fund the development of
its products, development by the Company or its competitors of technological innovations, risks of failure of clinical studies, protection of proprietary technology, compliance with government regulations and ability to transition to large-scale
production of products. As of June&nbsp;30, 2014, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $64.3 million and expects to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. The Company has financed its operations to date primarily through sales of
common stock, private placements of its convertible preferred stock, collaborations, bank debt, convertible debt financings, grant funding and cash receipts for sponsored research. At June&nbsp;30, 2014, the Company had capital resources of $73.1
million consisting of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and believes that these resources will be sufficient to allow it to fund its current operating plan for at least the next 24&nbsp;months. </P>

used when available. Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the
Company&#146;s assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, and are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. The fair value hierarchy applies only to the valuation
inputs used in determining the reported fair value of financial instruments and is not a measure of the investment credit quality. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below: </TD></TR></TABLE>

<TD ALIGN="left" VALIGN="top"><B>New Accounting Pronouncements</B>&#151;In May&nbsp;2014, the FASB issued guidance that requires companies to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in amounts that reflect the
consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. It also requires enhanced disclosures about revenue, provides guidance for transactions that were not previously addressed comprehensively, and
improves guidance for multiple-element arrangements. The guidance applies to any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets unless those
contracts are within the scope of other standards. The guidance is effective for public companies for annual periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2016 as well as interim periods within those annual period using either the full retrospective
approach or modified retrospective approach. Early adoption is not permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impacts of the new guidance on its financial statements. </TD></TR></TABLE>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In July 2013, the FASB issued amended guidance on the financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss
carryforward, similar tax loss, or tax credit carryforward exists. The guidance requires an unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit, to be presented as a reduction of a deferred tax asset when a net operating loss
carryforward, similar tax loss, or tax credit carryforward exists, with certain exceptions. This accounting guidance was effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2013. The Company adopted this new guidance beginning
with its interim financial statements for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2014. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company&#146;s financial statements. </P>

$23.10 on that date. The total fair value of options that vested during the fiscal years ended June&nbsp;30, 2014, 2013, and 2012 was $280&nbsp;thousand, $43&nbsp;thousand, and $37&nbsp;thousand, respectively. </P>

The Company revalues non-vested, non-employee options each reporting period using the estimated fair value of the Company&#146;s common stock as of the last day of each reporting period. </P>

</TABLE> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The dividend yield is based upon the assumption that the Company will not declare a dividend over the life of
the options. Since adopting ASC&nbsp;718, the Company has been unable to use historical employee exercise and option expiration data to estimate the expected term assumption for the Black-Scholes grant-date valuation. The Company therefore has
utilized the &#147;simplified&#148; method, as prescribed by the SEC&#146;s Staff Accounting Bulletin No.&nbsp;107, <I>Share-Based Payment</I>, to estimate on a formula basis the expected term of our stock options considered to have &#147;plain
vanilla&#148; characteristics. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S.&nbsp;Treasury yield curve on the date of the grant. As a new public company, the Company does not have sufficient history to estimate the volatility of its common stock
price or the expected life of the options. The Company calculates expected volatility based on reported data for similar publicly traded companies for which historical information is available and will continue to do so until the historical
volatility of its common stock is sufficient to measure expected volatility for future option grants. The group of similar publicly traded companies was determined based upon companies considered to be direct competition or having been presented by
independent parties as a &#147;comparable&#148; company based upon market sector. In determining this group, the Company has excluded &#147;large-cap&#148; entities. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of the grant and revised, if necessary, in
subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Share-based compensation expense recognized in the statements of operations for the fiscal years ended June&nbsp;30, 2014, 2013 and 2012 does not record tax related effects on
stock-based compensation given the Company&#146;s historical and anticipated operating losses and offsetting changes in its valuation allowance that fully reserves against potential deferred tax assets. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The fair value of the shares of common stock that underlie the stock options the Company has granted has historically been determined by the
Company&#146;s board of directors based upon information available to it at the time of grant. The Company&#146;s board of directors considered numerous objective and subjective factors in the assessment of fair value, including reviews of the
Company&#146;s business and financial condition, the conditions of the industry in which the Company operates and the markets that the Company serves and general economic, market and United States and global capital market conditions, the lack of
marketability of its common stock, the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event for the shares of common stock underlying these stock options, the preferences and privileges of the preferred stock over the rights of the common stock, the status of
the clinical trials and preclinical studies relating to its product candidates and third-party valuations of its common stock. The Company&#146;s board has generally considered the most persuasive evidence of fair value to be the prices at which the
Company&#146;s securities were sold in actual arms&#146; length transactions. Following its IPO, the Company&#146;s shares of common stock are now traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market and it is no longer required to estimate the fair value of
common stock underlying new equity awards. </P>

<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Series&nbsp;A-1A</FONT> and Series B-1 preferred stock. Because our Series A-1, Series A-1A and Series B-1 preferred stock were subject to redemption under circumstances outside of our control, the outstanding shares
of these series of preferred stock are presented as temporary equity for those periods. Consequently, the warrants to purchase shares of Series A-1, Series A-1A and Series B-1 preferred stock were accounted for as liabilities and adjusted to fair
value at the end of each reporting period. The fair value of the warrants classified as liabilities was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The estimates in the Black-Scholes option pricing model were based, in part, on
subjective assumptions, including stock price volatility, term of the warrants, risk free interest rate, dividend yield, and fair value of the preferred stock underlying the warrants. The gain or loss associated with the change in the fair value of
the preferred stock warrant liability from the prior period was recognized as a component of other (expense) income, net. The fair value of the warrants on the date of issuance, and on each financial reporting date for those warrants classified as
liabilities, was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In November 2012, we entered into a Series B-1, B-2 and B-3 Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement, or Series B Purchase Agreement, which
authorized the sale of up to 290,781,972 shares of convertible preferred stock in three separate tranches of Series B-1, Series B-2 and Series B-3 preferred stock, respectively. Simultaneously with the execution of the Series B Purchase Agreement,
we issued and sold an aggregate of 66,147,709 shares of Series B-1 preferred stock at a price per share of $0.1297. The Series B Purchase Agreement provided that the holders of the Series B-1 shares, or Series B holders, were also entitled to
purchase up to an aggregate of 140,542,178 shares of Series B-2 preferred stock for an aggregate purchase price equal to $18.2 million, or second tranche, and up to an aggregate of 82,670,167 shares of Series B-3 preferred stock for an aggregate
purchase price equal to $10.7 million, or third tranche. The price per share and number of shares to be issued in exchange for such amount was to be determined separately for each tranche by reference to which, if any, of three milestones specified
in the agreement had been satisfied by us. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The purchase rights were legally separable and exercisable apart from the Series B-1 shares
and, because representatives of the Series B holders hold a majority of the seats on the board of directors, the decision to complete the second and third tranche was deemed to be outside our control. We therefore recorded, at the time of entry into
the Series B Purchase Agreement, a Series B purchase rights liability of $1.7 million for the fair value of our obligation to sell the Series B-2 and Series B-3 preferred stock in the second and third tranche. The Series B purchase rights liability
was valued separately for each series using the Black-Scholes option-pricing method to assign a value to the purchase right relating to that series under each of the possible applicable valuation scenarios, depending on which milestones were met,
with each scenario being assigned an estimated probability as of the valuation date. The aggregate of these probability-weighted valuations was assigned as the value of the purchase right for each tranche. The initial fair value of the Series B
purchase rights liability was estimated to be $0.6 million for the second tranche and $1.1&nbsp;million for the third tranche. The total value allocated to the Series B purchase rights reduced the amount allocated to the carrying value of the Series
B-1 preferred stock on our balance sheet. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The most significant and judgmental inputs driving the fair value of our Series B purchase
rights are the assumptions regarding the fair value of the underlying preferred shares and the volatility factor. With all other inputs constant, an increase or decrease in the assumed fair value of the preferred shares would result in a higher or
lower estimate of the fair value of the Series B purchase rights, respectively, although there </P>

with respect to the second tranche and purchased an aggregate of 122,749,639 shares of Series&nbsp;B-2 preferred stock at a price per share of $0.1485, for gross cash proceeds of $18.2 million. During fiscal year 2013, we recorded a change in value
of the Series B purchase rights liability of $1.2 million to other expense and the $0.8 million balance of the value allocated to the Series B-2 purchase rights liability immediately prior to the closing of the second tranche was recorded as
proceeds from the issuance of the Series&nbsp;B-2 preferred stock. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In October 2013, the Series B holders exercised their rights with

for gross cash proceeds of $10.7 million. In connection with the closing of the third tranche, we and the Series&nbsp;B holders amended the terms of the Series B purchase agreement to provide that if the two remaining milestones specified in the
Series B Purchase Agreement are not satisfied by September 2014, the Series&nbsp;B holders who continue to hold shares of Series B-3 preferred stock will be entitled to receive an aggregate of approximately 13,387,000 additional shares of Series B-3
preferred stock. This right was extinguished upon the conversion to common stock of all outstanding shares of our preferred stock upon the closing of our initial public offering. </P>

business, principally relating to licensed technology, that require future payments relating to milestones or royalties on future sales of specified products. At June&nbsp;30, 2014, the Company had nine license agreements with six different
entities, including five with the University of Florida Research Foundation. Several of these entities are stockholders of the Company. The Company is required to pay minimum annual royalty and license maintenance for all licenses until such time
when the license is terminated by either expiration of underlying patents or voluntary termination by either party per the agreement. Once a product reaches commercialization, the above-mentioned minimum annual payments will be replaced by annual
royalties ranging from 0.5% to 4.0% on net sales. The Company is responsible for all costs related to preparation, filing, issuance, prosecution and maintenance of the underlying patents covered in the license agreements. As of June&nbsp;30, 2014,
the Company held one license where certain milestones requiring additional royalty payments had been met. The Company may terminate its license agreements with zero to ninety days written notice depending upon the terms of each specific agreement.
The Company paid annual royalty and license maintenance payments of $87 thousand, $61 thousand and $41 thousand for each of the fiscal years ended June&nbsp;30, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. All royalty and license maintenance payments are

taxable income and expire in various years from 2022 to 2034. At June&nbsp;30, 2014, the Company also has research and development tax credits of approximately $1.3 million that may provide future tax benefits and expire from 2027 to 2043. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company has evaluated the positive and negative evidence bearing upon the realizability of its deferred tax assets. Based on the Company&#146;s history of
operating losses, the Company has concluded that it is more likely than not that the benefit of its deferred tax assets will not be realized. Therefore, any tax benefits to be realized in future years as a result of the utilization of the
Company&#146;s net operating loss carry forwards as of June&nbsp;30, 2014, computed based on statutory federal and state rates, are completely offset by valuation allowances established because realization of the deferred tax benefits are not
considered more likely than not. The valuation allowance increased by approximately $5.1 million during the fiscal year ended June&nbsp;30, 2014, due primarily to net operating losses generated during the period. </P>

subject to review and possible adjustment by the Internal Revenue Service and state tax authorities. Net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards may become subject to an annual limitation in the event of certain cumulative changes in the
ownership interest of significant shareholders over a three-year period in excess of 50 percent, as defined under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code, respectively, as well as similar state provisions. This could limit the amount of
tax attributes that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income or tax liabilities. The amount of the annual limitation is determined based on the value of the Company immediately prior to the ownership change. Subsequent ownership
changes may further affect the limitation in future years. The Company has completed several financings since its inception which may have resulted in a change in control as defined by Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code, or could
result in a change in control in the future. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For fiscal years through June 30, 2014, the Company generated research credits but has not conducted a study

uncertain tax position at June 30, 2014 and 2013. A full valuation allowance has been provided against the Company&#146;s research and development credits and, if an adjustment is required, this adjustment would be offset by an adjustment to the
deferred tax asset established for the research and development credit carry forwards and the valuation allowance. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company files income tax returns
in the United States and in the state of Florida. The federal and state returns are generally subject to tax examinations for the tax years ended June 30, 2010 through June 30, 2014. To the extent the Company has tax attribute carry forwards, the
tax years in which the attribute was generated may still be adjusted upon examination by the Internal Revenue Service, or state authorities, to the extent such attributes are utilized in a future period. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company&#146;s policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. As of June&nbsp;30, 2014 and 2013,

Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#147;Exchange Act&#148;), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to us,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and
procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, as ours are designed to do, and we necessarily were required to apply our judgment in evaluating whether the
benefits of the controls and procedures that we adopt outweigh their costs. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, an
evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of June&nbsp;30, 2014 was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June&nbsp;30, 2014. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for our company. Internal
control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary for preparation of our financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of our assets are made in accordance with management&#146;s authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not
intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected. Furthermore, our controls and procedures can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more
people or by management override of the control, and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected on a timely basis. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our management has determined that as of June&nbsp;30, 2014 and 2013, we had material weaknesses in our internal control over financial
reporting which relate to the design and operation of our closing and financial reporting processes and our accounting for debt, equity and convertible instruments. We have concluded that these material weaknesses in our internal control over
financial reporting are due to the fact that we do not have the appropriate resources with the appropriate level of experience and technical expertise to oversee our closing and financial reporting processes and to address the accounting and
financial reporting requirements related to our issuances of convertible notes, preferred stock warrants, stock options, preferred stock and preferred stock purchase rights. </P>
