    We are a biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics
    based on RNA interference, or RNAi. RNAi is a naturally
    occurring biological pathway within cells for selectively
    silencing and regulating the expression of specific genes. Since
    many diseases are caused by the inappropriate activity of
    specific genes, the ability to silence genes selectively through
    RNAi could provide a new way to treat a wide range of human
    diseases. We believe that drugs that work through RNAi have the
    potential to become a broad new class of drugs, like small
    molecule, protein and antibody drugs. Using our intellectual
    property and the expertise we have built in RNAi, we are
    developing a set of biological and chemical methods and know-how
    that we apply in a systematic way to develop RNAi therapeutics
    for a variety of diseases.

    We are applying our technological expertise to build a pipeline
    of RNAi therapeutics to address significant medical needs, many
    of which cannot effectively be addressed with small molecules or
    antibodies, the current major classes of drugs. We are working
    to develop RNAi therapeutics that are delivered directly to
    specific sites of disease, as well as RNAi therapeutics that are
    administered systemically through the bloodstream by
    intravenous, subcutaneous or intramuscular approaches. Our lead
    RNAi therapeutic program, ALN-RSV01, is in Phase&#160;II
    clinical trials for the treatment of human respiratory syncytial
    virus, or RSV, infection, which is reported to be the leading
    cause of hospitalization in infants in the United States and
    also occurs in the elderly and in immune compromised adults. In
    February 2008, we reported positive results from our
    Phase&#160;II experimental RSV infection clinical trial,
    referred to as the GEMINI study. In July 2009, we and Cubist
    Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Cubist, reported results from a Phase
    IIa clinical trial assessing the safety and tolerability of
    aerosolized
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">ALN-RSV01</FONT>
    versus placebo in adult lung transplant patients naturally
    infected with RSV. This study achieved its primary objective of
    demonstrating the safety and tolerability of ALN-RSV01. In
    February 2010, we initiated a multi-center, global, randomized,
    double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase IIb clinical trial to
    evaluate the clinical efficacy endpoints, as well as safety, of
    aerosolized ALN-RSV01 in adult lung transplant patients
    naturally infected with RSV. The objective of this Phase IIb
    study is to repeat and extend the clinical results observed in
    the Phase IIa study.

    We have formed collaborations with Cubist and Kyowa Hakko Kirin
    Co., Ltd., or Kyowa Hakko Kirin, for the development and
    commercialization of RNAi products for RSV. We have an agreement
    to jointly develop and commercialize certain RNAi products for
    RSV with Cubist in North America. Cubist has responsibility for
    developing and commercializing any such products in the rest of
    the world outside of Asia, and Kyowa Hakko Kirin has the
    responsibility for developing and commercializing any RNAi
    products for RSV in Asia. In November 2009, we and Cubist agreed
    that Alnylam would move forward with the development of
    ALN-RSV01, and together we would focus our collaboration and
    joint development efforts on ALN-RSV02, a second-generation
    compound, intended for use in pediatric patients. We and Cubist
    each bears one-half of the related development costs for

    We are also continuing to develop ALN-RSV01 for adult transplant
    patients at our sole discretion and expense. Cubist has the

    which right may be exercised for a specified period of time

    Beginning in 1999, our scientific founders described and
    provided evidence that the RNAi mechanism occurs in mammalian
    cells and that its immediate trigger is a type of molecule known
    as a small interfering RNA, or siRNA. They showed that
    laboratory-synthesized siRNAs could be introduced into the cell
    and suppress production of specific target proteins by cleaving
    and degrading the messenger RNA, or mRNA, of the specific gene
    that encodes that specific protein. Because it is possible to
    design and synthesize siRNAs specific to any gene of interest,
    the entire human genome is accessible to RNAi, and we therefore
    believe that RNAi therapeutics have the potential to become a
    broad new class of drugs.

    Our product platform provides a capability for a systematic
    approach to identifying RNAi therapeutic candidates through
    sequence selection, potency selection, stabilization by chemical
    modification, improvement of biodistribution and cellular uptake
    by various chemical conjugates and formulations. Key to the
    therapeutic application of siRNAs is the ability to successfully
    deliver siRNAs to target tissues and achieve cellular uptake of
    the siRNA into the inside of the cell where the RNAi machinery,
    called RNA-induced silencing complex, or RISC, is active. In
    some tissues, including the lung and central nervous system, the
    direct RNAi delivery approach, which employs the direct or local
    application of siRNAs, achieves cellular uptake and gene
    knockdown. For other tissues, such as the liver, systemic RNAi
    delivery has been employed, where tissue access comes via
    intravenous or subcutaneous injection of the siRNA into the
    bloodstream and where cellular uptake can be achieved by the
    conjugation of the siRNA with other molecules, such as small
    chemical groups, or by formulation with other biomaterials, such
    as LNPs. siRNA delivery is a key focus for our internal research
    team and is also the focus of numerous current government,
    academic and corporate collaborations. We have demonstrated RNAi
    therapeutic activity towards multiple genes, in multiple organs
    and in multiple species, including humans, as demonstrated by

    Our progress has enabled us to advance a number of development
    programs for RNAi therapeutics that are administered directly to
    diseased tissues, including ALN-RSV01 and ALN-HTT. Our progress
    in achieving delivery of RNAi therapeutics through systemic RNAi
    was demonstrated by the advancement in early 2009 of our first
    systemically delivered RNAi therapeutic candidate ALN-VSP, for
    the treatment of liver cancers, to the clinic, and the filing of
    regulatory applications in December 2009 to initiate a clinical
    trial for ALN-TTR01, our second systemically delivered RNAi
    therapeutic candidate, for the treatment of ATTR. ALN-VSP and
    ALN-TTR01 both utilize a first generation LNP formulation known
    as stable nucleic acid-lipid particles, or SNALP, developed in
    collaboration with Tekmira. In parallel with ALN-TTR01, we are
    also advancing ALN-TTR02 utilizing the newer second-generation

    development programs for other systemically delivered RNAi

    hypercholesterolemia, which we recently identified as our next
    clinical candidate. ALN-PCS is being advanced using
    second-generation LNPs for systemic delivery. We recognize,

    In July 2009, we and Cubist reported results from a Phase IIa
    clinical trial assessing the safety and tolerability of
    aerosolized ALN-RSV01 versus placebo in adult lung transplant
    patients naturally infected with RSV. In total, 24&#160;patients
    confirmed with RSV infection were randomized two-to-one to
    receive inhaled ALN-RSV01 or placebo once daily for three
    consecutive days. The study achieved its primary objective of
    demonstrating the safety and tolerability of ALN-RSV01. In
    particular, there were no drug-related serious adverse events or
    discontinuations, and there were no clinically significant
    differences in the overall adverse event profile between
    ALN-RSV01 and placebo. Importantly, there was no evidence of
    disease exacerbation related to ALN-RSV01 treatment. At the
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">90-day</FONT>
    endpoint, all patients survived and the incidence of intubation,
    new respiratory infection, or acute rejection was comparable
    across ALN-RSV01 and placebo groups. In addition,
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">90-day</FONT>
    clinical data were collected. The study was not powered to
    demonstrate clinical outcomes due to the small sample size and,
    accordingly, such data were therefore considered exploratory.
    Prospectively defined clinical secondary endpoints at
    90&#160;days included recovery of lung function (forced
    expiratory volume in the first second, or
    FEV<SUB style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-bottom">1</SUB>)
    as measured by spirometry and clinical determination of new or
    progressive bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome, or BOS. Based on
    the data from this small study, ALN-RSV01 treatment was
    associated with a statistically significant decrease in the
    total incidence of new or progressive BOS at 90&#160;days
    compared to placebo (p=0.02) with 50% of placebo patients
    showing new or progressive BOS as compared with only 7.1% of
    ALN-RSV01-treated patients. Despite the small patient numbers,
    we believe that these data may be important since the incidence
    of BOS following RSV infection in lung transplant patients can
    be a predictor of graft failure and overall survival. The
    incidence of BOS in lung transplant patients infected with RSV
    results in approximately 50% mortality within three to five

    combination with a statin. Despite these therapies, there are
    many patients who have refractory or poorly controlled
    hypercholesterolemia and require more intensive treatment. In
    addition, some patients do not tolerate current treatments and
    at least five percent of those treated with a statin have to
    stop because of side-effects. In patients with very high
    uncontrolled cholesterol levels, a procedure called lipid
    apheresis is used, which effectively removes cholesterol from
    the blood using a machine specifically designed for this

    PCSK9 is a widely acknowledged target for the treatment of
    hypercholesterolemia by lowering of LDL-c levels. PCSK9 is a
    protein that is produced by the liver but circulates in the
    bloodstream. The liver determines cholesterol levels, in part by
    taking up or absorbing LDL-c from the bloodstream. PCSK9 reduces
    the liver&#146;s capacity to absorb LDL-c. Recent evidence
    indicates that, if PCSK9 activity could be reduced, the liver
    should increase its uptake of LDL-c and blood cholesterol levels
    should decrease. In fact, some individuals have been shown to
    have a genetic mutation in PCSK9 that lowers its activity and
    results in increased liver LDL-c uptake and lowered blood
    cholesterol levels. In turn, these individuals have been shown
    to have a dramatically reduced risk of CAD, including myocardial
    infarction or heart attack. In addition, studies have shown that
    PCSK9 levels are increased by statin therapy while LDL-c levels
    are decreased, suggesting that the introduction of a PCSK9
    inhibitor to statin therapy may result in even further
    reductions in LDL-c levels.

    Regulus is exploring therapeutic opportunities that arise from
    alterations in microRNA expression. Since microRNAs are believed
    to regulate the expression of broad networks of genes and
    biological pathways, microRNA-based therapeutics define a new
    and potentially high-impact strategy to target multiple points
    on disease pathways. Conventional messenger RNAs are genetically
    encoded and in turn instruct the creation of proteins through
    the process of translation. However, these small microRNAs do
    not instruct creation of proteins but instead regulate the
    expression of other genes. There are approximately 700 microRNAs
    that have been identified in the human genome, and these are
    believed to regulate the expression of up to 30% of all human
    genes. Since microRNAs may act as master regulators for
    physiological pathways or genetic networks to achieve integrated
    biological functions, affecting the expression of multiple genes
    in the pathway of disease, microRNAs potentially represent an
    exciting new platform for drug discovery and development.

    To date, microRNAs have been implicated in several disease areas
    such as cancer, viral infection, inflammatory diseases and
    metabolic disorders. Regulus&#146; most advanced program, which
    is in pre-clinical research, is a microRNA-based therapeutic
    candidate that targets miR-122. miR-122 is a liver-expressed
    microRNA that has been shown to be a critical endogenous host
    factor for the replication of HCV, and anti-miRs targeting
    miR-122 have been shown to block HCV infection. HCV infection is
    a significant disease worldwide, for which emerging therapies
    target viral genes and, therefore, are prone to viral
    resistance. Regulus is also pursuing a program that targets
    miR-21. Pre-clinical studies by Regulus and collaborators have
    shown that miR-21 is implicated in several therapeutic areas,
    including heart failure and fibrosis. In addition to these
    programs, Regulus is also actively exploring additional areas
    for development of microRNA-based therapeutics, including
    cancer, other viral diseases, metabolic disorders and
    inflammatory diseases.

    In April 2008, Regulus entered into a worldwide strategic
    alliance with GSK to discover, develop and market novel
    microRNA-targeted therapeutics to treat inflammatory diseases
    such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. In
    connection with this alliance, Regulus received
    $20.0&#160;million in upfront payments from GSK, including a
    $15.0&#160;million option fee and a loan of $5.0&#160;million
    evidenced by a promissory note (guaranteed by Isis and us) that
    will convert into Regulus common stock under certain specified
    circumstances. Regulus could be eligible to receive development,
    regulatory and sales milestone payments for each of the four
    microRNA-targeted therapeutics discovered and developed as part
    of the alliance, and would also receive royalty payments on
    worldwide sales of products resulting from the alliance, if any.
    In May 2009, Regulus achieved the first demonstration of a
    pharmacological effect in immune cells by specific microRNA
    inhibition, the initial discovery milestone under the GSK
    alliance, which triggered a payment under the agreement.

    During 2009, we presented new data regarding the application of
    RNAi technology to improve the manufacturing processes for
    biologics, which is comprised of recombinant proteins,
    monoclonal antibodies and vaccines. This initiative, which we
    are advancing in an internal effort referred to as Alnylam

    to improve the quantity and quality of biologics manufacturing
    processes using mammalian cell culture, such as CHO cells. This
    RNAi technology potentially could be applied to the improvement
    of manufacturing processes for existing marketed drugs, new
    drugs in development and for the emerging biosimilars market. We
    have developed proprietary delivery lipids that enable the
    efficient transfection of siRNAs into CHO cells when grown in
    suspension culture. Studies have demonstrated that silencing
    certain target genes involved in certain CHO cell apoptotic and
    metabolic pathways resulted in 40% to 60% improved cell

    Specifically, these <I>in&#160;vitro </I>and <I>in vivo
    </I>research findings establish the role of ApoE as an
    endogenous targeting ligand for neutrally charged ionizable
    LNPs, or iLNPs, but not certain cationic LNPs, or cLNPs, and
    demonstrate an alternative targeting strategy for the delivery
    of RNAi therapeutics to the liver using the carbohydrate
    N-acetylgalactosamine, or GalNAc, as an exogenous ligand.

    We are pursuing additional approaches for delivery that include

    awarded us a contract to advance the development of a broad

    $10.9&#160;million through February 2009, which included a
    six-month extension granted by DTRA in July 2008. Following a
    program review in early 2009, we and DTRA determined not to

    to $27.7&#160;million were not accessed.

    We believe that we have a strong portfolio of broad rights to
    fundamental RNAi patents and patent applications. Many of these
    rights are exclusive, which we believe prevents potential
    competitors from commercializing products in the field of RNAi
    without taking a license from us. In securing these rights, we
    have focused on obtaining the strongest rights for those
    intellectual property assets we believe will be most important

    We believe that the Crooke patent series, issued in several
    countries around the world, covers the use of all modified
    oligonucleotides to achieve enzyme-mediated cleavage of a target
    mRNA and, as such, has broad issued claims that cover RNAi. We
    have obtained rights to the Crooke patents through a license
    agreement with Isis. Under the terms of our amended and restated
    Isis agreement, Isis agreed not to grant licenses under these
    patents to any other organization for oligonucleotide products
    designed to work through an RNAi mechanism, except in the
    context of a collaboration in which Isis plays an active role.

    Through our acquisition of Ribopharma AG, now known as Alnylam
    Europe, we own the entire Kreutzer-Limmer patent portfolio,
    which includes pending applications in the United States and
    many countries worldwide. The first patent to issue in the
    Kreutzer-Limmer series (EP 1144623)&#160;was granted in Europe
    in 2002, and specifically covered the use of small dsRNAs as
    therapeutics. This patent was revoked in appeal. The second
    European Kreutzer-Limmer patent (EP 1214945)&#160;to issue in
    the series was granted in Europe in 2005. This patent covers
    dsRNA structures of 15 to 49 successive nucleotide pairs in
    length. In January 2009, the European Patent Office, or EPO,
    ruled in favor of the opposing parties in an opposition
    proceeding related to the second Kreutzer-Limmer patent. We have
    appealed this ruling. In December 2008, the EPO granted a third
    patent in the Kreutzer-Limmer series (EP 1550719). This patent
    covers therapeutic dsRNAs which are 15 to 21 consecutive
    nucleotide pairs in length. The third Kreutzer-Limmer patent has
    been opposed. In July 2009, the EPO issued a Notice of Intent to
    Grant for a fourth patent in the Kreutzer-Limmer series (EP App.
    No.&#160;02702247.4). This patent covers methods and medicaments
    having dsRNAs that are less than 25 nucleotides in length having
    a 3&#146; nucleotide overhang on the antisense strand which
    inhibit anti-apoptotic genes in tumor cells. We have also
    received grants for patents in the Kreutzer-Limmer series in
    several other countries, as reflected in the table above. The
    decision with respect to EP 1144623 and the outcome of the EP
    1214945 opposition will only affect the granted or pending
    claims of other members of the Kreutzer-Limmer patent series to
    the extent the same issue arises in the formal examination or
    post-grant review proceedings of the other members of the
    series. We do not expect this to occur, but in the event it
    does, the ruling in the former proceeding would be controlling.

    The Glover patent series has resulted in several patent grants,
    including in Europe (EP 1230375). The European Glover patent was
    revoked in June 2008 during opposition proceedings and our
    appeal of this decision is pending. Broad claims from this
    patent cover dsRNAs of any length or structure as mediators of
    RNAi in mammalian systems. We have an exclusive license to the
    Glover patent for therapeutic uses from Cancer Research

    including those of mammalian or viral origin, with dsRNAs

    also includes claims covering methods of examining the function
    of a gene, as well as the use of both unmodified and chemically

    The Fire and Mello patent owned by the Carnegie Institution
    covers the use of dsRNAs to induce RNAi. The Carnegie
    Institution has made this patent broadly available for licensing
    and we, like many companies, have taken a non-exclusive license
    to the patent for therapeutic purposes. We believe, however,
    that the claims of the Fire and Mello patent do not cover the
    structural features of dsRNAs that are important for the
    biological activity of siRNAs in mammalian cells. We believe
    that these specific features are the subjects of the Crooke,

    the intellectual property assets of Nucleonics, Inc., a
    privately held biotechnology company. This acquisition included
    over 100 active patent filings, including 15 patents that have
    been granted worldwide, of which five have been granted in the

    In July 2009, we announced that we will contribute more than

    technology patent estate to a patent pool established by GSK in
    March 2009. We are the first company to add its patents to the
    approximately 800 patent filings GSK provided to the pool. The
    patent pool was formed to aid in the discovery and development
    of new medicines for the treatment of 16 neglected tropical
    diseases, or NTDs, as defined by the FDA, in the world&#146;s
    least developed countries. Through our contribution to the

    technology and know-how on a royalty-free, non-profit basis
    worldwide to research, develop and manufacture therapies for use
    in the least developed countries through licensing agreements
    with qualified third parties. Such organizations will be engaged
    in research efforts focused on discovery of new medicines for
    NTDs. In January 2010, we and GSK announced the appointment of
    BIO Ventures for Global Health, or BVGH, to administer the

    organize disease-specific meetings that identify the gaps in
    expertise and intellectual property that currently exist in
    product development for NTDs. BVGH will then help global health
    researchers work with industry to fill these gaps so that the
    resources made available by companies will be used to create

    As the field of RNAi therapeutics is maturing, patent
    applications are being fully processed by national patent
    offices around the world. There is uncertainty about which
    patents will issue, and, if they do, as to when, to whom, and
    with what claims. It is likely that there will be significant
    litigation and other proceedings, such as interference,
    reexamination and opposition proceedings, in various patent
    offices relating to patent rights in the RNAi field. For
    example, as noted above, various third parties have initiated
    oppositions to patents in our Kreutzer-Limmer and Tuschl&#160;II
    series in the EPO, as well as in other jurisdictions. We expect
    that additional oppositions will be filed in the EPO and
    elsewhere, and other challenges will be raised relating to other
    patents and patent applications in our portfolio. In many cases,
    the possibility of appeal exists for either us or our opponents,
    and it may be years before final, unappealable rulings are made
    with respect to these patents in certain jurisdictions. Given
    the importance of our intellectual property portfolio to our

    In June 2009, we joined with Max-Planck-Gesellschaft Zur
    Forderung Der Wissenschaften E.V. and Max-Planck-Innovation
    GmbH, collectively, Max Planck, in taking legal action against
    Whitehead, MIT and UMass. The complaint, initially filed in
    Suffolk County Superior Court in Boston, Massachusetts and
    subsequently removed to the U.S.&#160;District Court for the
    District of Massachusetts, alleges, among other things, that the
    defendants have improperly prosecuted the Tuschl I patent
    applications and wrongfully incorporated inventions covered by
    the Tuschl&#160;II patent applications into the Tuschl I patent
    applications, thereby potentially damaging the value of
    inventions reflected in the Tuschl I and Tuschl&#160;II patent

    The complaint seeks to enjoin the defendants from taking any
    further action in connection with the prosecution of any Tuschl
    I application, a declaratory judgment and unspecified monetary
    damages. In August 2009, the court denied our motion for a
    preliminary injunction. In addition, in August 2009, Whitehead
    and UMass filed counterclaims against us and Max Planck,
    including for breach of contract. A trial on the merits was
    originally scheduled to begin in February 2010. In January 2010,
    we and Max Planck filed a motion for leave to file an amended
    complaint expanding upon the allegations in the original
    complaint. In January 2010, the court granted this motion
    allowing our amended complaint and postponed the start of the
    trial. We currently expect the trial to start in June 2010.

    In addition, in September 2009, the USPTO granted Max
    Planck&#146;s petition to revoke power of attorney in connection

    USPTO in connection with further prosecution of the Tuschl I

    Antisense technology uses short, single-stranded, DNA-like
    molecules to block mRNAs encoding specific proteins. An
    antisense oligonucleotide, or ASO, contains a sequence of bases
    complementary to a sequence within its target mRNA, enabling it
    to attach to the mRNA by base-pairing. The attachment of the ASO
    may lead to breakdown of the mRNA, or may physically block the
    mRNA from associating with the protein synthesis machinery of
    the cell. In either case, production of the protein encoded by
    the mRNA may be reduced. Typically, the backbone of an ASO, the
    linkages that hold its constituent bases together, will carry a
    number of chemical modifications that do not exist in naturally
    occurring DNA. These modifications are intended to improve the
    stability and pharmaceutical properties of the ASO.

    While we believe that RNAi drugs may potentially have
    significant advantages over ASOs, including greater potency and
    specificity, others are developing ASO drugs that are currently
    at a more advanced stage of development than RNAi drugs. For
    example, Isis has developed an ASO drug,
    Vitravene<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP>,

    which is currently on the market, and has several ASO product
    candidates in clinical trials. In addition, a number of other
    companies have product candidates in various stages of
    pre-clinical and clinical development. Included in these
    companies are Genta Incorporated and AVI BioPharma, Inc. Because
    of their later stage of development, ASOs, rather than siRNAs,
    may become the preferred technology for drugs that target mRNAs
    in order to turn off the activity of specific genes.

    Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are
    typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may
    overlap or be combined. In Phase&#160;I, the initial
    introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or
    patients, the drug is tested to primarily assess safety,
    tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions and
    metabolism associated with increasing doses. Phase&#160;II
    usually involves trials in a limited patient population, to
    assess the optimum dosage, identify possible adverse effects and
    safety risks, and provide preliminary support for the efficacy
    of the drug in the indication being studied.

    If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an
    acceptable safety profile in Phase&#160;II trials,
    Phase&#160;III trials are undertaken to further evaluate
    clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded
    patient population, typically at geographically dispersed
    clinical trial sites. Phase&#160;I, Phase&#160;II or
    Phase&#160;III testing of any product candidates may not be
    completed successfully within any specified time period, if at
    all. After successful completion of the required clinical
    testing, generally an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA.

    We believe that any RNAi product candidate we develop, whether
    for RSV, liver cancers, ATTR, hypercholesterolemia, HD or the
    various indications targeted in our pre-clinical discovery
    programs, will be regulated as a new drug by the FDA. FDA
    approval of an NDA is required before marketing of the product
    may begin in the United States. The NDA must include the results
    of extensive clinical and other testing, as described above, and
    a compilation of data relating to the product&#146;s
    pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture and controls. In addition,
    an NDA for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage
    form, new dosing regimen, or new route of administration must
    contain data assessing the safety and efficacy for the claimed
    indication in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and support
    dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for
    which the drug is shown to be safe and effective. In some
    circumstances, the FDA may grant deferrals for the submission of
    some or all pediatric data, or full or partial waivers. The cost
    of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. Under federal
    law, NDAs are subject to substantial application user fees and
    the sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to annual product
    and establishment user fees.

    The FDA has 60&#160;days from its receipt of an NDA to determine
    whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the
    agency&#146;s threshold determination that the NDA is
    sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the
    submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth
    review of the NDA. The review process is often significantly
    extended by FDA requests for additional information or
    clarification regarding information already provided in the
    submission. The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug
    products or drug products that present difficult questions of
    safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel
    that includes clinicians and other experts, for review,
    evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application
    should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation
    of an advisory committee. The FDA normally also will conduct a
    pre-approval inspection to ensure the manufacturing facility,
    methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug&#146;s
    identity, strength, quality, purity and stability, and are in
    compliance with regulations governing cGMPs.

    While we believe that any RNAi therapeutic we develop will be
    regulated as a new drug under the Federal Food, Drug, and
    Cosmetic Act, the FDA could decide to regulate certain RNAi
    therapeutic products as biologics under the Public Health
    Service Act. Biologics must have a biologics license
    application, or BLA, approved prior to commercialization. Like
    NDAs, BLAs are subject to user fees. To obtain BLA approval, an
    applicant must provide non-clinical and clinical evidence and
    other information to demonstrate that the biologic product is
    safe, pure and potent, and like NDAs, must complete clinical
    trials that are typically conducted in three sequential phases
    (Phase&#160;I,&#160;II and III). Additionally, the applicant
    must demonstrate that the facilities in which the product is
    manufactured, processed, packaged or held meet standards,
    including cGMPs and any additional standards in the license
    designed to ensure its continued safety, purity and potency.
    Biologics establishments are subject to pre-approval
    inspections. The review process for BLAs is also time consuming
    and uncertain, and BLA approval may be conditioned on
    post-approval testing and surveillance. Once granted, BLA
    approvals may be suspended or revoked under certain

    Once an NDA or BLA is approved, a product will be subject to
    certain post-approval requirements, including requirements for
    adverse event reporting, submission of periodic reports,
    recordkeeping, product sampling and distribution. Additionally,
    the FDA also strictly regulates the promotional claims that may
    be made about prescription drug products and biologics. In
    particular, a drug or biologic may not be promoted for uses that
    are not approved by the FDA as reflected in the product&#146;s
    approved labeling. In addition, the FDA requires substantiation
    of any claims of superiority of one product over another,
    including that such claims be proven by adequate and
    well-controlled
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">head-to-head</FONT>

    products may depend on their superiority over existing
    therapies, any restriction on our ability to advertise or
    otherwise promote claims of superiority, or requirements to
    conduct additional expensive clinical trials to provide proof of
    such claims, could negatively affect the sales of our products
    or our costs. We must also notify the FDA of any change in an
    approved product beyond variations already allowed in the
    approval. Certain changes to the product, its labeling or its
    manufacturing require prior FDA approval and may require the
    conduct of further clinical investigations to support the
    change. Such approvals may be expensive and time-consuming and,

    Once an NDA or BLA is approved, the product covered thereby
    becomes a listed drug that can, in turn, be cited by potential
    competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug
    application, or ANDA, upon expiration of relevant patents, if
    any. An approved ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product
    that has the same active ingredients in the same strength,
    dosage form and route of administration as the listed drug and
    has been shown through bioequivalence testing to be
    therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug. There is no
    requirement, other than the requirement for bioequivalence
    testing, for an ANDA applicant to conduct or submit results of
    non-clinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or
    effectiveness of its drug product. Drugs approved in this way
    are commonly referred to as generic equivalents to the listed
    drug, are listed as such by the FDA and can often be substituted
    by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original
    listed drug.

    Federal law provides for a period of three years of exclusivity
    following approval of a listed drug that contains previously
    approved active ingredients but is approved in a new dosage,
    dosage form, route of administration or combination, or for a
    new use, if the FDA deems that the sponsor was required to
    provide support from new clinical trials to obtain such
    marketing approval. During such three-year exclusivity period,
    the FDA cannot grant approval of an ANDA to commercially
    distribute a generic version of the drug based on that listed
    drug. However, the FDA can approve generic or other versions of
    that listed drug, such as a drug that is the same in every way
    but its indication for use, and thus the value of such
    exclusivity may be undermined. Federal law also provides a
    period of up to five years exclusively following approval of a
    drug containing no previously approved active ingredients,
    during which ANDAs for generic versions of those drugs cannot be
    submitted unless the submission accompanies a challenge to a
    listed patent, in which case the submission may be made four

    Additionally, in the event that the sponsor of the listed drug
    has properly informed the FDA of patents covering its listed
    drug, applicants submitting an ANDA referencing that drug are
    required to make one of four patent certifications, including
    certifying that it believes one or more listed patents are
    invalid or not infringed. If an applicant certifies invalidity
    or non-infringement, it is required to provide notice of its
    filing to the NDA sponsor and the patent holder. If the patent
    holder then initiates a suit for patent infringement against the
    ANDA sponsor within 45&#160;days of receipt of the notice, the
    FDA cannot grant effective approval of the ANDA until either
    30&#160;months have passed or there has been a court decision
    holding that the patents in question are invalid, unenforceable
    or not infringed. If the patent holder does not initiate a suit
    for patent infringement within the 45&#160;days, the ANDA may be
    approved immediately upon successful completion of FDA review,
    unless blocked by a regulatory exclusivity period. If the ANDA
    applicant certifies that it does not intend to market its
    generic product before some or all listed patents on the listed
    drug expire, then the FDA cannot grant effective approval of the
    ANDA until those patents expire. The first of the ANDA
    applicants submitting substantially complete applications
    certifying that one or more listed patents for a particular
    product are invalid or not infringed may qualify for an
    exclusivity period of 180&#160;days running from when the
    generic product is first marketed, during which subsequently
    submitted ANDAs cannot be granted effective approval. The

    generic exclusivity can be forfeited in various ways, including

    cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs
    required to obtain FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not
    be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A
    payor&#146;s decision to provide coverage for a drug product
    does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be
    approved. Adequate third party reimbursement may not be
    available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to
    realize an appropriate return on our investment in product
    development.

    Federal, state and local governments in the United States
    continue to consider legislation to limit the growth of
    healthcare costs, including the cost of prescription drugs.
    Future legislation could limit payments for pharmaceuticals such
    as the drug candidates that we are developing.

    Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other
    countries. In the European Community, governments influence the
    price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and
    reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems
    that fund a large part of the cost of those products to
    consumers. Some jurisdictions operate systems under which
    products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has
    been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some
    of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials
    that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product
    candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states
    allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but
    monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on
    health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs,
    has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers
    are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in
    some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets
    exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.

    The marketability of any products for which we receive
    regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the
    government and third party payors fail to provide adequate
    coverage and reimbursement. In addition, an increasing emphasis
    on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect
    will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical
    pricing. Coverage policies and third party reimbursement rates
    may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and
    reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for
    which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage
    policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the
    future.

    We have concentrated our efforts and therapeutic product
    research on RNAi technology, and our future success depends on
    the successful development of this technology and products based
    on it. Neither we nor any other company has received regulatory
    approval to market therapeutics utilizing siRNAs, the class of

    discoveries that form the basis for our efforts to discover and
    develop new drugs are relatively new. The scientific evidence to
    support the feasibility of developing drugs based on these
    discoveries is both preliminary and limited. Skepticism as to
    the feasibility of developing RNAi therapeutics has been
    expressed in scientific literature. For example, there are
    potential challenges to achieving safe RNAi therapeutics based
    on the so-called off-target effects and activation of the

    Relatively few product candidates based on these discoveries
    have ever been tested in animals or humans. siRNAs may not
    naturally possess the inherent properties typically required of
    drugs, such as the ability to be stable in the body long enough
    to reach the tissues in which their effects are required, nor
    the ability to enter cells within these tissues in order to
    exert their effects. We currently have only limited data, and no
    conclusive evidence, to suggest that we can introduce these
    drug-like properties into siRNAs. We may spend large amounts of
    money trying to introduce these properties, and may never
    succeed in doing so. In addition, these compounds may not
    demonstrate in patients the chemical and pharmacological
    properties ascribed to them in laboratory studies, and they may
    interact with human biological systems in unforeseen,
    ineffective or harmful ways. As a result, we may never succeed
    in developing a marketable product, we may not become profitable
    and the value of our common stock will decline.

    Further, our focus solely on RNAi technology for developing
    drugs, as opposed to multiple, more proven technologies for drug
    development, increases the risks associated with the ownership
    of our common stock. If we are not successful in developing a
    product candidate using RNAi technology, we may be required to

    Even if our estimates are correct, we will be required to seek
    additional funding in the future and intend to do so through
    either collaborative arrangements, public or private equity
    offerings or debt financings, or a combination of one or more of
    these funding sources. Additional funds may not be available to
    us on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, the terms of any
    financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our
    stockholders. For example, if we raise additional funds by
    issuing equity securities, further dilution to our stockholders
    will result. In addition, our investor rights agreement with
    Novartis provides Novartis with the right generally to maintain
    its ownership percentage in us and our common stock purchase
    agreement with Roche contains a similar provision. In May 2008,
    Novartis purchased 213,888&#160;shares of our common stock at a
    purchase price of $25.29 per share. In May 2009, Novartis
    purchased 65,922&#160;shares of our common stock at a purchase
    price of $17.50 per share. These purchases allowed Novartis to
    maintain its ownership position of 13.4% of our outstanding
    common stock. While the exercise of these rights by Novartis has
    provided us with an aggregate of $6.6&#160;million in cash, and
    the exercise in the future by Novartis or Roche may provide us
    with additional funding under some circumstances, this exercise
    and any future exercise of these rights by Novartis or Roche
    will also cause further dilution to our stockholders. Debt
    financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants that
    could limit our flexibility in conducting future business
    activities and, in the event of insolvency, would be paid before
    holders of equity securities received any distribution of
    corporate assets. If we are unable to obtain funding on a timely
    basis, we may be required to significantly curtail one or more
    of our research or development programs. We also could be
    required to seek funds through arrangements with collaborators
    or others that may require us to relinquish rights to some of
    our technologies, product candidates or products that we would
    otherwise pursue on our own.

    In October 2005, we entered into a collaboration agreement with
    Novartis. Under this agreement, Novartis can select up to 30
    exclusive targets to include in the collaboration, which number
    may be increased to 40 under certain circumstances and upon
    additional payments. Novartis pays the costs to develop these
    product candidates and will commercialize and market any
    products derived from this collaboration. For RNAi therapeutic
    products developed under the agreement, if any, we are entitled
    to receive milestone payments upon achievement of certain
    specified development and annual net sales events, up to an
    aggregate of $75.0&#160;million per therapeutic product, as well
    as royalties on the annual net sales, if any. If Novartis fails
    to successfully develop products using our technology, we may
    not receive any additional milestone payments or any royalty
    payments under this agreement. The Novartis agreement had an
    initial term of three years, with an option for two additional
    one-year extensions at the election of Novartis. In July 2009,
    Novartis elected to further extend the term of our collaboration
    agreement for the fifth and final planned year, through October
    2010. Novartis may elect to terminate this collaboration prior
    to expiration in the event of a material uncured breach by us.
    Over the term of this agreement, we have received a substantial
    amount of funding from Novartis. If this collaboration is
    unsuccessful, if Novartis terminates this agreement prior to
    expiration or if Novartis does not elect to exercise its

    Our agreement with Novartis also provides Novartis with a
    non-exclusive option to integrate into its operations our
    intellectual property relating to RNAi technology, excluding any
    technology related to delivery of nucleic acid based molecules.
    Novartis may exercise this integration option at any point
    during the research term, which term is currently expected to
    expire in the fourth quarter of 2010. In connection with the
    exercise of the integration option, Novartis would be required
    to make additional payments to us totaling $100.0&#160;million,
    payable in full at the time of exercise, which payments would
    include an option exercise fee, a milestone based on the overall
    success of the collaboration and pre-paid milestones and
    royalties that could become due as a result of future
    development of products using our technology. This amount would
    be offset by any license fees due to our licensors in accordance
    with the applicable license agreements with those parties. In
    addition, under this license grant, Novartis may be required to
    make milestone and royalty payments to us in connection with the
    development and commercialization of RNAi therapeutic products,
    if any. The license grant under the integration option, if
    exercised, would be structured similarly to our non-exclusive
    platform licenses with Roche and Takeda. If Novartis elects to
    exercise this option, Novartis could become a competitor of ours
    in the development of RNAi-based drugs targeting the same
    diseases that we choose to target. Novartis has significantly
    greater financial resources and far more experience than we do
    in developing and marketing drugs, which could put us at a
    competitive disadvantage if we were to compete

    products that function through RNAi, subject to our existing
    contractual obligations to third parties. The license is limited
    to the therapeutic areas of oncology, respiratory diseases,

    comprising substantially all other fields of human disease, as
    identified and agreed upon by the parties, upon payment to us by

    royalty payments based on worldwide annual net sales, if any. In
    May 2008, we entered into a similar license and collaboration
    agreement with Takeda, which is limited to the therapeutic areas
    of oncology and metabolic diseases, and which may be expanded to
    include up to 20 additional therapeutic areas, comprising
    substantially all other fields of human disease, as identified

    We do not have any capability for sales, marketing or
    distribution and have limited capabilities for drug development.
    In addition, we believe that other companies are expending
    substantial resources in developing safe and effective means of
    delivering siRNAs to relevant cell and tissue types.
    Accordingly, we have entered into alliances with other companies
    and collaborators that we believe can provide such capabilities,
    and we intend to enter into additional alliances in the future.
    For example, we intend to enter into (1)&#160;non-exclusive
    platform alliances which will enable our collaborators to
    develop RNAi therapeutics and will bring in additional funding
    with which we can develop our RNAi therapeutics, and
    (2)&#160;alliances to jointly develop specific product
    candidates and to jointly commercialize RNAi therapeutics, if
    they are approved,
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">and/or</FONT>
    ex-U.S.&#160;market geographic partnerships on specific RNAi
    therapeutic programs. In such alliances, we may expect our
    collaborators to provide substantial capabilities in delivery of
    RNAi therapeutics to the relevant cell or tissue type, clinical
    development, regulatory affairs,
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">and/or</FONT>
    marketing, sales and distribution. For example, under our
    collaboration with Medtronic, we are jointly developing ALN-HTT,
    an RNAi therapeutic for HD, which would be delivered using an
    implanted infusion device developed by Medtronic. The success of
    this collaboration will depend, in part, on Medtronic&#146;s
    expertise in the area of delivery of drugs by infusion device,
    something that they have never done before with our product
    candidates. In other alliances, we may expect our collaborators
    to develop, market and sell certain of our product candidates.
    We may have limited or no control over the development, sales,
    marketing and distribution activities of these third parties.
    Our future revenues may depend heavily on the success of the
    efforts of these third parties. For example, we are jointly
    developing and will commercialize certain RNAi products for RSV
    with Cubist in North America. We will rely entirely on Cubist
    for the development and commercialization of certain RNAi
    products for RSV in the rest of the world outside of Asia, where
    we will rely on Kyowa Hakko Kirin for development and
    commercialization of any RNAi products for RSV. If Cubist and
    Kyowa Hakko Kirin are not successful in their commercialization
    efforts, our future revenues from RNAi therapeutics for RSV may
    be adversely affected.

    We may not be successful in entering into such alliances on
    favorable terms due to various factors, including Novartis&#146;
    right of first offer on our drug targets, our ability to
    successfully demonstrate proof of concept for our technology in
    man, our ability to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our
    specific drug candidates, and the strength of our intellectual
    property. Even if we do succeed in securing such product
    alliances, we may not be able to maintain them if, for example,
    development or approval of a product candidate is delayed or
    sales of an approved drug are disappointing. Furthermore, any
    delay in entering into collaboration agreements could delay the
    development and commercialization of our product candidates and
    reduce their competitiveness even if they reach the market. Any
    such delay related to our collaborations could adversely affect
    our business.

    For certain product candidates that we may develop, we have
    formed collaborations to fund all or part of the costs of drug
    development and commercialization, such as our collaborations

    may not, however, be able to enter into additional
    collaborations, and the terms of any collaboration agreement we
    do secure may not be favorable to us. If we are not successful
    in our efforts to enter into future collaboration arrangements
    with respect to a particular product candidate, we may not have
    sufficient funds to develop that or any other product candidate
    internally, or to bring any product candidates to market. If we

    Pre-clinical testing and clinical trials of new product
    candidates are lengthy and expensive and the historical failure
    rate for product candidates is high. We are developing our most
    advanced product candidate, ALN-RSV01, for the treatment of RSV
    infection. In January 2008, we completed our GEMINI study, a
    Phase&#160;II trial designed to evaluate the safety,
    tolerability and anti-viral activity of ALN-RSV01 in adult
    subjects experimentally infected with RSV. During 2009, we
    completed a Phase IIa trial assessing the safety and
    tolerability of ALN-RSV01 in adult lung transplant patients
    naturally infected with RSV and we intend to continue the
    ALN-RSV01 clinical development program for adult lung transplant
    patients, and pursue jointly with Cubist the development of
    ALN-RSV02, a second-generation RNAi therapeutic candidate,
    intended for use in pediatric patients with RSV infection. In
    February 2010, we initiated a Phase IIb clinical trial to
    evaluate the clinical efficacy endpoints as well as safety of
    aerosolized
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">ALN-RSV01</FONT> in
    adult lung transplant patients naturally infected with RSV. The
    objective of this Phase IIb study is to repeat and extend the
    clinical results observed in the Phase IIa study. In addition,
    in March 2009, we initiated a Phase I study of ALN-VSP, our
    first systemically delivered RNAi therapeutic candidate. We are
    developing
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">ALN-VSP</FONT> for
    the treatment of primary and secondary liver cancer. We have
    also made regulatory filings to initiate a clinical trial for
    ALN-TTR01, our second systemically delivered RNAi therapeutic
    candidate, which targets the TTR gene for the treatment of ATTR.
    However, we may not be able to further advance these or any
    other product candidate through clinical trials. If we
    successfully enter into clinical studies, the results from
    pre-clinical testing or early clinical trials of a product
    candidate may not predict the results that will be obtained in

    Clinical trials of a new product candidate require the
    enrollment of a sufficient number of patients, including
    patients who are suffering from the disease the product
    candidate is intended to treat and who meet other eligibility
    criteria. Rates of patient enrollment are affected by many
    factors, including the size of the patient population, the age
    and condition of the patients, the nature of the protocol, the
    proximity of patients to clinical sites, the availability of
    effective treatments for the relevant disease, the seasonality
    of infections and the eligibility criteria for the clinical
    trial. Delays in patient enrollment or difficulties retaining
    study participants can result in increased costs, longer
    development times or termination of a clinical trial.

    Clinical trials also require the review and oversight of IRBs,

    protect the rights and welfare of human subjects. Inability to
    obtain or delay in obtaining IRB approval can prevent or delay
    the initiation and completion of clinical trials, and the FDA or

    data or information derived from a clinical investigation not

    Some product candidates that we develop may need to be
    administered using specialized drug delivery devices that
    deliver RNAi therapeutics directly to diseased parts of the
    body. For example, we believe that product candidates we develop
    for HD, Parkinson&#146;s disease or other central nervous system
    diseases may need to be administered using such a device. For
    neurodegenerative diseases, we have entered into a collaboration
    agreement with Medtronic to pursue potential development of
    drug-device combinations incorporating RNAi therapeutics. We may
    not achieve successful development results under this
    collaboration and may need to seek other collaborations to
    develop alternative drug delivery systems, or utilize existing
    drug delivery systems, for the direct delivery of RNAi
    therapeutics for these diseases. While we expect to rely on drug
    delivery systems that have been approved by the FDA or other
    regulatory agencies to deliver drugs like ours to diseased parts
    of the body, we, or our collaborator, may need to modify the
    design or labeling of such delivery device for some products we
    may develop. In such an event, the FDA may regulate the product
    as a combination product or require additional approvals or
    clearances for the modified delivery device. Further, to the
    extent the specialized delivery device is owned by another
    company, we would need that company&#146;s cooperation to
    implement the necessary changes to the device, or its labeling,
    and to obtain any additional approvals or clearances. In cases
    where we do not have an ongoing collaboration with the company
    that makes the device, obtaining such additional approvals or
    clearances and the cooperation of such other company could
    significantly delay and increase the cost of obtaining marketing
    approval, which could reduce the commercial viability of our
    product candidate. In summary, we may be unable to find, or
    experience delays in finding, suitable drug delivery systems to
    administer RNAi therapeutics directly to diseased parts of the
    body, which could negatively affect our ability to successfully
    commercialize these RNAi therapeutics.

    pre-clinical testing and clinical trials and an extensive

    completed in the United States and in many foreign jurisdictions
    before a new drug can be marketed. Satisfaction of these and
    other regulatory requirements is costly, time consuming,

    We have very limited experience in conducting and managing the
    clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approvals,
    including approval by the FDA. The time required to obtain FDA
    and other approvals is unpredictable but typically takes many
    years following the commencement of clinical trials, depending
    upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidate.
    The standards that the FDA and its foreign counterparts use when
    regulating us are not always applied predictably or uniformly
    and can change. Any analysis we perform of data from
    pre-clinical and clinical activities is subject to confirmation
    and interpretation by regulatory authorities, which could delay,
    limit or prevent regulatory approval. We may also encounter
    unexpected delays or increased costs due to new government
    regulations, for example, from future legislation or
    administrative action, or from changes in FDA policy during the
    period of product development, clinical trials and FDA
    regulatory review. It is impossible to predict whether
    legislative changes will be enacted, or whether FDA or foreign
    regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or
    what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.

    Because the drugs we are intending to develop may represent a
    new class of drug, the FDA and its foreign counterparts have not
    yet established any definitive policies, practices or guidelines
    in relation to these drugs. While the product candidates that we
    are currently developing are regulated as new drugs under the
    Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the FDA could decide to
    regulate them or other products we may develop as biologics
    under the Public Health Service Act. The lack of policies,
    practices or guidelines may hinder or slow review by the FDA of
    any regulatory filings that we may submit. Moreover, the FDA may
    respond to these submissions by defining requirements we may not
    have anticipated. Such responses could lead to significant
    delays in the clinical development of our product candidates. In
    addition, because there may be approved treatments for some of
    the diseases for which we may seek approval, in order to receive
    regulatory approval, we will need to demonstrate through
    clinical trials that the product candidates we develop to treat
    these diseases, if any, are not only safe and effective, but
    safer or more effective than existing products. Furthermore, in
    recent years, there has been increased public and political
    pressure on the FDA with respect to the approval process for new
    drugs, and the number of approvals to market new drugs has
    declined.

    We expect that governments will be the only purchasers of any
    products we may develop for the prevention or treatment of
    hemorrhagic fever viruses such as Ebola. In the future, we may
    also initiate additional programs for the development of product
    candidates for which governments may be the only or primary
    purchasers. However, governments will not be required to
    purchase any such products from us and may elect not to do so,
    which could adversely affect our business. For example, although
    the focus of our Ebola program is to develop RNAi therapeutic
    targeting gene sequences that are highly conserved across known
    Ebola viruses, if the sequence of any Ebola virus that emerges
    is not sufficiently similar to those we are targeting, any
    product candidate that we develop may not be effective against
    that virus. Accordingly, while we believe that any RNAi
    therapeutic we develop for the treatment of Ebola could be
    stockpiled by governments as part of their biodefense
    preparations, they may not elect to purchase such product, or if
    they purchase our products, they may not do so at prices and
    volume levels that are profitable for us. In addition,
    government contractors and subcontractors are generally subject
    to contractual and regulatory requirements that differ from
    typical commercial business arrangements. These requirements may
    make it more costly for us to serve government customers and may
    expose us to legal and regulatory liability risks that would not
    arise in sales to non-governmental customers.

    The regulations that govern marketing approvals, pricing and
    reimbursement for new drugs vary widely from country to country.
    Some countries require approval of the sale price of a drug
    before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review
    period begins after marketing or product licensing approval is
    granted. In some foreign markets, prescription pharmaceutical
    pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even
    after initial approval is granted. Although we intend to monitor
    these regulations, our programs are currently in the early
    stages of development and we will not be able to assess the
    impact of price regulations for a number of years. As a result,
    we might obtain regulatory approval for a product in a
    particular country, but then be subject to price regulations
    that delay our commercial launch of the product and negatively
    impact the revenues we are able to generate from the sale of the

    Net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or
    rebates required by government health care programs or private
    payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently
    restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold
    at lower prices than in the United States. Third party payors
    often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations
    in setting their own reimbursement rates. Our inability to
    promptly obtain coverage and profitable reimbursement rates from
    both government-funded and private payors for new drugs that we
    develop and for which we obtain regulatory approval could have a

    We believe that the efforts of governments and third-party
    payors to contain or reduce the cost of healthcare and
    legislative and regulatory proposals to broaden the availability
    of healthcare will continue to affect the business and financial
    condition of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies. A
    number of legislative and regulatory changes in the healthcare
    system in the United States and other major healthcare markets
    have been proposed in recent years, and such efforts have
    expanded substantially in the last year. These developments have
    included prescription drug benefit legislation that was enacted
    and took effect in January 2006, healthcare reform legislation
    recently enacted by certain states, and major health care reform
    legislation that is currently pending in Congress. Many such
    proposals could, directly or indirectly, affect our ability to
    sell our products, if approved, at a favorable price. We cannot
    predict the initiatives that may be adopted in the future.
    Further federal and state legislative and regulatory
    developments are likely and we expect ongoing initiatives in the
    United States to increase pressure on drug pricing. Such reforms
    could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenues from
    product candidates that we may successfully develop and for
    which we may obtain regulatory approval and may affect our
    overall financial condition and ability to develop drug
    candidates.

    Our pending patent applications may not result in issued
    patents. The patent position of pharmaceutical or biotechnology
    companies, including ours, is generally uncertain and involves
    complex legal and factual considerations. The standards that the
    USPTO and its foreign counterparts use to grant patents are not
    always applied predictably or uniformly and can change. In
    addition, there are periodic discussions in the Congress of the
    United States and in international jurisdictions about modifying
    various aspects of patent law. If any such changes are enacted
    and do not provide adequate protection for discoveries,
    including our ability to pursue infringers of our patents for
    substantial damages, our business could be adversely affected.
    There is also no uniform, worldwide policy regarding the subject
    matter and scope of claims granted or allowable in
    pharmaceutical or biotechnology patents. Accordingly, we do not
    know the degree of future protection for our proprietary rights
    or the breadth of claims that will be allowed in any patents

    RNAi is a relatively new scientific field, the commercial
    exploitation of which has resulted in many different patents and
    patent applications from organizations and individuals seeking
    to obtain patent protection in the field. We have obtained
    grants and issuances of RNAi patents and have licensed many of
    these patents from third parties on an exclusive basis. The
    issued patents and pending patent applications in the United
    States and in key markets around the world that we own or
    license claim many different methods, compositions and processes
    relating to the discovery, development, manufacture and
    commercialization of RNAi therapeutics. Specifically, we have a
    portfolio of patents, patent applications and other intellectual
    property covering: fundamental aspects of the structure and uses
    of siRNAs, including their manufacture and use as therapeutics,
    and RNAi-related mechanisms; chemical modifications to siRNAs
    that improve their suitability for therapeutic uses; siRNAs
    directed to specific targets as treatments for particular
    diseases; and delivery technologies, such as in the field of

    As the field of RNAi therapeutics is maturing, patent
    applications are being fully processed by national patent
    offices around the world. There is uncertainty about which
    patents will issue, and, if they do, as to when, to whom, and
    with what claims. It is likely that there will be significant
    litigation and other proceedings, such as interference,
    reexamination and opposition proceedings, in various patent
    offices relating to patent rights in the RNAi field. For
    example, various third parties have initiated oppositions to
    patents in our Kreutzer-Limmer and Tuschl&#160;II series in the
    EPO and in other jurisdictions. We expect that additional
    oppositions will be filed in the EPO and elsewhere, and other
    challenges will be raised relating to other patents and patent
    applications in our portfolio. In many cases, the possibility of
    appeal exists for either us or our opponents, and it may be
    years before final, unappealable rulings are made with respect
    to these patents in certain jurisdictions. The timing and
    outcome of these and other proceedings is uncertain and may
    adversely affect our business if we are not successful in
    defending the patentability and scope of our pending and issued
    patent claims. In addition, third parties may attempt to
    invalidate our intellectual property rights. Even if our rights
    are not directly challenged, disputes could lead to the
    weakening of our intellectual property rights. Our defense
    against any attempt by third parties to circumvent or invalidate
    our intellectual property rights could be costly to us, could
    require significant time and attention of our management and
    could have a material adverse effect on our business and our

    the litigation would divert our management&#146;s efforts. Some

    several antisense product candidates in clinical trials. The

    changes in market valuations of pharmaceutical and biotechnology
    companies. Recently, when the market price of a stock has been
    volatile as our stock price may be, holders of that stock have
    occasionally brought securities class action litigation against
    the company that issued the stock. If any of our stockholders
    were to bring a lawsuit of this type against us, even if the
    lawsuit is without merit, we could incur substantial costs
    defending the lawsuit. The lawsuit could also divert the time
    and attention of our management.

    In June 2009, we joined with Max Planck in taking legal action
    against Whitehead, MIT and UMass. The complaint, initially filed
    in Suffolk County Superior Court in Boston, Massachusetts and
    subsequently removed to the U.S.&#160;District Court for the
    District of Massachusetts, alleges, among other things, that the
    defendants have improperly prosecuted the Tuschl I patent
    applications and wrongfully incorporated inventions covered by
    the Tuschl&#160;II patent applications into the Tuschl I patent
    applications, thereby potentially damaging the value of
    inventions reflected in the Tuschl I and Tuschl&#160;II patent
    applications. In the field of RNAi therapeutics, we are the
    exclusive licensee of the Tuschl I patent applications from Max
    Planck, MIT and Whitehead and of the Tuschl&#160;II patent
    applications from Max Planck.

    The complaint seeks to enjoin the defendants from taking any
    further action in connection with the prosecution of any Tuschl
    I application, a declaratory judgment and unspecified monetary
    damages. In August 2009, the court denied our motion for a
    preliminary injunction. In addition, in August 2009, Whitehead
    and UMass filed counterclaims against us and Max Planck,
    including for breach of contract. A trial on the merits was
    originally scheduled to begin in February 2010. In January 2010,
    we and Max Planck filed a motion for leave to file an amended
    complaint expanding upon the allegations in the original
    complaint. In January 2010, the court granted this motion
    allowing our amended complaint and postponed the start of the
    trial. We currently expect the trial to start in June 2010.

    In addition, in September 2009, the USPTO granted Max
    Planck&#146;s petition to revoke power of attorney in connection
    with the prosecution of the Tuschl I patent application. This
    action prevents the defendants from filing any papers with the
    USPTO in connection with further prosecution of the Tuschl I
    patent application without the agreement of Max Planck.
    Whitehead&#146;s petition to overturn the ruling on Max
    Planck&#146;s petition was denied.

    Although we, along with Max Planck, are vigorously asserting our
    rights in this case, litigation is subject to inherent

    our management and other resources that would otherwise be
    engaged in running our business.

    We are a biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics
    based on RNA interference, or RNAi. RNAi is a naturally
    occurring biological pathway within cells for selectively
    silencing and regulating the expression of specific genes. Since
    many diseases are caused by the inappropriate activity of
    specific genes, the ability to silence genes selectively through
    RNAi could provide a new way to treat a wide range of human
    diseases. We believe that drugs that work through RNAi have the
    potential to become a broad new class of drugs, like small
    molecule, protein and antibody drugs. Using our intellectual
    property and the expertise we have built in RNAi, we are
    developing a set of biological and chemical methods and know-how
    that we apply in a systematic way to develop RNAi therapeutics
    for a variety of diseases.

    We are applying our technological expertise to build a pipeline
    of RNAi therapeutics to address significant medical needs, many
    of which cannot effectively be addressed with small molecules or
    antibodies, the current major classes of drugs. We are working
    to develop RNAi therapeutics that are delivered directly to
    specific sites of disease, as well as RNAi therapeutics that are
    administered systemically through the bloodstream by
    intravenous, subcutaneous or intramuscular approaches. Our lead
    RNAi therapeutic program, ALN-RSV01, is in Phase&#160;II
    clinical trials for the treatment of human respiratory syncytial
    virus, or RSV, infection, which is reported to be the leading

    placebo-controlled Phase IIb clinical trial to evaluate the
    clinical efficacy endpoints, as well as safety of aerosolized
    ALN-RSV01 in adult lung transplant patients naturally infected

    We also seek opportunities to form new ventures in areas outside
    our core strategic focus. For example, during 2009, we presented
    new data regarding the application of RNAi technology to improve
    the manufacturing processes for biologics, which is comprised of
    recombinant proteins, monoclonal antibodies and vaccines. This
    initiative, which we are advancing in an internal effort
    referred to as Alnylam Biotherapeutics, has the potential to
    create new business opportunities. Additionally, in 2007, we and
    Isis established Regulus Therapeutics Inc., formerly Regulus
    Therapeutics LLC, or Regulus, a company focused on the
    discovery, development and commercialization of microRNA-based
    therapeutics. Because microRNAs are believed to regulate whole
    networks of genes that can be involved in discrete disease
    processes, microRNA-based therapeutics represent a possible new
    approach to target the pathways of human disease. Given the
    broad applications for RNAi technology, we believe additional

    drug discovery for one or more disease targets. We are pursuing
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">50-50</FONT>
    co-development programs with Cubist and Medtronic for the
    development and commercialization of ALN-RSV02 and ALN-HTT,
    respectively. In addition, we have entered into a product
    alliance with Kyowa Hakko Kirin for the development and
    commercialization of ALN-RSV in territories not covered by the
    Cubist agreement, which include Japan and other markets in Asia.
    We also have discovery and development alliances with Isis,
    Novartis and Biogen Idec.

    We also seek opportunities to form new ventures in areas outside
    our core strategic focus. For example, during 2009, we
    established Alnylam Biotherapeutics, an internal effort
    regarding the application of RNAi technology to improve the
    manufacturing processes for biologics, an approach that has the
    potential to create new business opportunities. This initiative
    is focused on applying RNAi technologies to the biologics
    marketplace, which is comprised of recombinant proteins,
    monoclonal antibodies, and vaccines. In addition, during 2007,
    we formed Regulus, together with Isis, to capitalize on our
    technology and intellectual property in the field of
    microRNA-based therapeutics. Given the broad applications for
    RNAi technology, we believe additional opportunities exist for
    new ventures.

    To generate revenues from our intellectual property rights, we
    grant licenses to biotechnology companies under our InterfeRx
    program for the development and commercialization of RNAi
    therapeutics for specified targets in which we have no direct
    strategic interest. We also license key aspects of our
    intellectual property to companies active in the research
    products and services market, which includes the manufacture and
    sale of reagents. Our InterfeRx and research product licenses
    aim to generate modest near-term revenues that we can re-invest
    in the development of our proprietary RNAi therapeutics
    pipeline. As of January&#160;31, 2010, we had granted such
    licenses, on both an exclusive and non-exclusive basis, to
    approximately 20&#160;companies.

    Since delivery of RNAi therapeutics remains a major objective of
    our research activities, we also look to form collaboration and
    licensing agreements with other companies and academic
    institutions to gain access to delivery technologies. For
    example, we have entered into agreements with Tekmira
    Pharmaceuticals Corporation, or Tekmira, the Massachusetts
    Institute of Technology, or MIT, The University of British
    Columbia, or UBC, and AlCana Technologies, Inc., or AlCana,
    among others, to focus on various delivery strategies. We have
    also entered into license agreements with Isis, Max Planck
    Innovation GmbH, Tekmira and MIT, as well as a number of other
    entities, to obtain rights to important intellectual property in
    the field of RNAi. In April 2009, we established a new
    collaboration with Isis focused on the development of
    single-stranded RNAi, or ssRNAi, technology.

    <B>Novartis.</B>&#160;&#160;Beginning in September 2005, we
    entered into a series of transactions with Novartis which we
    refer to as our broad Novartis alliance. At that time, we and
    Novartis executed a stock purchase agreement and an investor
    rights agreement. When the transactions contemplated by the
    stock purchase agreement closed in October 2005, the investor
    rights agreement became effective and we and Novartis executed a
    research collaboration and license agreement. The collaboration
    and license agreement had an initial term of three years, with
    an option for two additional one-year extensions at the election
    of Novartis. In July 2009, Novartis elected to further extend
    the term for the fifth and final planned year, through October

    The collaboration and license agreement also includes terms
    under which Novartis has been providing us with research funding
    and development milestone payments, and may provide us in the
    future with sales milestone payments as well as royalties on
    annual net sales of products resulting from the collaboration,
    if any. The amount of research funding provided by Novartis
    under the collaboration and license agreement during the
    research term is dependent upon the number of active programs on
    which we are collaborating with them at any given time and the
    number of our employees that are working on those programs, in
    respect of which Novartis reimburses us at an agreed upon rate.
    Under the terms of the collaboration and license agreement,
    Novartis has the right to select up to 30 exclusive targets to
    include in the collaboration, which number may be increased to
    40 under certain circumstances and upon additional payments. For
    RNAi therapeutic products developed under the agreement, if any,
    we would be entitled to receive milestone payments upon
    achievement of certain specified development and annual net
    sales events, up to an aggregate of $75.0&#160;million per

    The collaboration and license agreement also provides Novartis

    are sponsoring an exclusive five-year research program focused
    on the delivery of RNAi therapeutics. In addition, during 2007,
    we obtained an exclusive worldwide license to the liposomal
    delivery formulation technology of Tekmira for the discovery,
    development and commercialization of LNP formulations for the
    delivery of RNAi therapeutics and a non-exclusive worldwide
    license to certain liposomal delivery formulation technology of
    Protiva Biotherapeutics Inc., or Protiva, for the discovery,
    development and commercialization of certain LNP formulations
    for the delivery of RNAi therapeutics. In May 2008, Tekmira
    acquired Protiva. In connection with this acquisition, we
    entered into new agreements with Tekmira and Protiva, which
    provide us access to key existing and future technology and
    intellectual property for the systemic delivery of RNAi
    therapeutics with liposomal delivery technologies. Under these
    agreements, we continue to have exclusive rights to the Semple
    (U.S.&#160;Patent No.&#160;6,858,225) and Wheeler
    (U.S.&#160;Patent Nos. 5,976,567 and 6,815,432) patents for
    RNAi, which we believe are critical for the use of LNP delivery
    technology. In July 2009, we and Tekmira agreed to jointly
    participate in a new research collaboration with scientists at
    UBC and AlCana focused on the discovery of novel lipids for use
    in LNPs for the systemic delivery of RNAi therapeutics. We are
    funding the collaborative research over a two-year period, and
    the work is being conducted by our scientists together with
    scientists at UBC and AlCana. We will receive exclusive rights
    to all new inventions as well as sole rights to sublicense any
    resulting intellectual property to our current and future
    collaborators. Tekmira will receive rights to use new inventions
    for their own RNAi therapeutic programs that are licensed under
    our InterfeRx program.

    We are developing ALN-VSP, a systemically delivered RNAi
    therapeutic candidate, for the treatment of primary and

    collaboration with Tekmira. We also have rights to use SNALP
    technology in the advancement of our other systemically

    In connection with Tekmira&#146;s acquisition of Protiva, in May
    2008 we made an equity investment of $5.0&#160;million in
    Tekmira, purchasing 2,083,333&#160;shares of Tekmira common
    stock at a price of $2.40 per share, which represented a premium
    of $1.00 per share, or an aggregate of $2.1&#160;million. This
    premium was calculated on the difference between the purchase
    price and the closing price of Tekmira&#146;s common stock on
    the effective date of the acquisition. We allocated this
    $2.1&#160;million premium to the expansion of our access to key
    technology and intellectual property rights and, accordingly,
    recorded a charge to research and development expense during the
    year ended December&#160;31, 2008. During 2008, we recorded an
    impairment charge of $1.6&#160;million related to our investment
    in Tekmira, as the decrease in the fair value of this investment
    was deemed to be other than temporary.

    obligations under the license agreement. Multiple element
    arrangements, such as license and development arrangements, are
    analyzed to determine whether the deliverables, which often
    include a license and performance obligations such as research
    and steering committee services, can be separated or whether
    they must be accounted for as a single unit of accounting. We
    recognize upfront license payments as revenue upon delivery of

    fair value of the undelivered performance obligations, typically

    not have stand-alone value or have stand-alone value but the
    fair value of any of the undelivered performance obligations
    cannot be determined, the arrangement would then be accounted
    for as a single unit of accounting and the license payments and

    For revenue generating arrangements where we, as a vendor,
    provide consideration to a licensor or collaborator, as a
    customer, we apply the accounting standard that governs such
    transactions. This standard addresses the accounting for revenue
    arrangements where both the vendor and the customer make cash
    payments to each other for services
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">and/or</FONT>
    products. A payment to a customer is presumed to be a reduction
    of the selling price unless we receive an identifiable benefit
    for the payment and we can reasonably estimate the fair value of
    the benefit received. Payments to a customer that are deemed a
    reduction of selling price are recorded first as a reduction of
    revenue, to the extent of both cumulative revenue recorded to
    date and probable future revenues, which include any unamortized
    deferred revenue balances, under all arrangements with such
    customer, and then as an expense. Payments that are not deemed
    to be a reduction of selling price would be recorded as an
    expense.

    Although we follow detailed guidelines in measuring revenue,
    certain judgments affect the application of our revenue policy.
    For example, in connection with our existing collaboration
    agreements, we have recorded on our balance sheet short-term and
    long-term deferred revenue based on our best estimate of when
    such revenue will be recognized. Short-term deferred revenue
    consists of amounts that are expected to be recognized as
    revenue in the next 12&#160;months. Amounts that we expect will
    not be recognized prior to the next 12&#160;months are
    classified as long-term deferred revenue. However, this estimate
    is based on our current operating plan and, if our operating
    plan should change in the future, we may recognize a different
    amount of deferred revenue over the next

    The estimate of deferred revenue also reflects management&#146;s
    estimate of the periods of our involvement in certain of our
    collaborations. Our performance obligations under these
    collaborations consist of participation on steering committees
    and the performance of other research and development services.
    In certain instances, the timing of satisfying these obligations
    can be difficult to estimate. Accordingly, our estimates may
    change in the future. Such changes to estimates would result in
    a change in revenue recognition amounts. If these estimates and
    judgments change over the course of these agreements, it may
    affect the timing and amount of revenue that we recognize and

    <B>Novartis.</B>&#160;&#160;In consideration for rights granted
    to Novartis under the collaboration and license agreement,
    Novartis made an upfront payment of $10.0&#160;million to us in

    to develop <I>in vivo </I>RNAi technology. The collaboration and
    license agreement includes terms under which Novartis is
    providing us with research funding. In addition, for RNAi
    therapeutic products developed under the agreement, if any, we
    are entitled to receive milestone payments upon achievement of
    certain specified development and annual net sales events, up to
    an aggregate of $75.0&#160;million per therapeutic product. We
    initially recorded as deferred revenue the non-refundable
    $10.0&#160;million upfront payment and the $6.4&#160;million
    premium that represented the difference between the purchase
    price and the closing price of our common stock on the date of
    the stock purchase from Novartis. In addition to these payments,
    research funding and certain milestone payments, the receipt of
    which is considered probable, are being amortized into revenue
    using the proportional performance method over the estimated
    duration of the collaboration and license agreement, or ten
    years. Under this method, we estimate the level of effort to be

    undelivered services are not separable and, accordingly, the
    licenses and services are being treated as a single unit of
    accounting. Under the Cubist agreement, the last element to be
    delivered is the development and manufacturing services, which
    have an expected life of approximately eight years. We are
    recognizing the upfront payment of $20.0&#160;million on a
    straight-line basis over approximately eight years because we
    are unable to reasonably estimate the level of effort to fulfill
    our performance obligations in order to utilize a proportional
    performance model. As future substantive milestones are
    achieved, a portion of the milestone payment, equal to the
    percentage of the performance period completed when the
    milestone is achieved, multiplied by the amount of the milestone
    payment, will be recognized as revenue upon achievement of such
    milestone. The remaining portion of the milestone will be
    recognized over the remaining performance period on a
    straight-line basis.

    Under the terms of the Cubist agreement, we and Cubist share

    In January 2007, we adopted a newly issued accounting standard
    which requires additional accounting and disclosure about
    uncertain tax positions. This standard clarifies the accounting
    for income tax positions by prescribing a minimum recognition
    threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being
    recognized in the financial statements. It also provides
    guidance on the derecognition of previously recognized deferred
    tax items, measurement, classification, interest and penalties,
    accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. Under
    this standard, we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain
    tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax
    position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing
    authorities, based on the technical merits of the tax position.
    The tax benefits recognized in our financial statements from
    such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that
    has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon
    ultimate resolution.

    We operate in the United States and Germany where our income tax
    returns are subject to audit and adjustment by local tax
    authorities. The nature of the uncertain tax positions is often
    very complex and subject to change and the amounts at issue can
    be substantial. We develop our cumulative probability assessment
    of the measurement of uncertain tax positions using internal
    experience, judgment and assistance from professional advisors.
    Estimates are refined as additional information becomes known.
    Any outcome upon settlement that differs from our current
    estimate may result in additional tax expense in future periods.

    For the years ended December&#160;31, 2009 and 2008, we recorded
    a provision for income taxes of $0.6&#160;million and
    $0.7&#160;million, respectively. We provide income tax expense
    for federal alternative minimum tax, state and foreign taxes. We
    generated U.S.&#160;taxable income during 2009 and 2008 due to
    the recognition of certain proceeds received from the Roche and
    Takeda alliances. Our 2009 and 2008 U.S.&#160;taxable income
    will be offset by net operating loss carryforwards and other
    deferred tax attributes. However, we were subject to federal
    alternative minimum tax and state income taxes in 2009 and 2008.

    At December&#160;31, 2009, we had a valuation allowance against
    our net deferred tax assets to the extent it is more likely than
    not that the assets will not be realized. At December&#160;31,
    2009, we had utilized all federal and Massachusetts state net
    operating loss carryforwards and all foreign tax credits. At
    December&#160;31, 2009, we had $2.2&#160;million of state
    research and development tax credit carryforwards derived from
    stock option exercises that are available to reduce future
    Massachusetts tax liabilities. At December&#160;31, 2009, the
    California state net operating loss carryforward was
    $8.6&#160;million (related to Regulus, located in California).
    We have placed a valuation allowance against the state net
    operating loss and state credit deferred tax assets as it is
    unlikely that we will realize these assets. Ownership changes,
    as defined in the Internal Revenue Code, including those
    resulting from the issuance of common stock in connection with
    our public offerings, may limit the amount of net operating loss
    and tax credit carryforwards that can be utilized to offset
    future taxable income or tax liability. The amount of the
    limitation is determined in accordance with Section&#160;382 of
    the Internal Revenue Code. We have determined that there is no
    limitation on the utilization of net operating loss and tax
    credit carryforwards in accordance with Section&#160;382 of the

    Effective January&#160;1, 2006, we adopted a newly issued
    accounting standard addressing recognition and disclosure of
    stock compensation. We adopted the fair value recognition
    provisions of this standard, using the modified prospective
    transition method. All stock-based awards granted to
    non-employees are accounted for at their fair value and
    compensation expense is generally recognized over the vesting
    period of the award. Determining the amount of stock-based
    compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates of
    fair values of stock options as of the grant date. We calculate
    the grant date fair values using the Black-Scholes valuation
    model. Our expected stock price volatility assumption is based
    on a combination of the historical and implied volatility of our
    publicly traded stock. For stock option grants issued during the
    year ended December&#160;31, 2009, we used a weighted-average
    expected stock-price volatility assumption of 56%. Our expected
    life assumption is based on the equal weighting of our
    historical data and the historical data of our pharmaceutical
    and biotechnology peers. Our weighted average expected term was
    6.2&#160;years for the year ended December&#160;31, 2009. We
    utilize a dividend yield of zero based on the fact that we have
    never paid cash dividends and have no present intention to pay
    cash dividends. The risk-free interest rate used for each grant
    is based on the U.S.&#160;Treasury yield curve in effect at the
    time of grant for instruments with a similar expected life.

    As of December&#160;31, 2009, the estimated fair value of
    unvested employee awards was $44.7&#160;million, net of
    estimated forfeitures. This amount will be recognized over the
    weighted average remaining vesting period of approximately
    1.5&#160;years for these awards. Stock-based employee
    compensation expense was $18.9&#160;million for the year ended
    December&#160;31, 2009. However, the total amount of stock-based
    compensation expense recognized in any future period cannot be
    predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of
    stock-based payments granted in the future as well as the
    portion of the awards that actually vest. The stock compensation
    accounting standard requires forfeitures to be estimated at the
    time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods
    if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The term
    &#147;forfeitures&#148; is distinct from
    &#147;cancellations&#148; or &#147;expirations&#148; and
    represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered option.
    We currently expect, based on an analysis of our historical
    forfeitures, that approximately 83% of our options will actually
    vest, and therefore have applied an annual

    We account for our interest in Regulus using the equity method
    of accounting. We reviewed the consolidation guidance that
    defines a variable interest entity, or VIE, and concluded that
    Regulus currently qualifies as a VIE. The founding investor
    rights agreement contains transfer restrictions on each of
    Isis&#146; and our interests and, as a result, we and Isis are
    considered related parties. Because we and Isis are related
    parties and collectively own 100% of Regulus, the determination
    of which entity would be considered the primary beneficiary is
    based on which entity is most closely associated with Regulus.
    Following consolidation guidance, we have concluded that Isis is
    the primary beneficiary and, accordingly, we have not
    consolidated Regulus and account for our investment under the
    equity method of accounting. Under new consolidation guidance
    effective January&#160;1, 2010, we do not expect Isis to

    Revenues increased for the year ended December&#160;31, 2009 as
    compared to the year ended December&#160;31, 2008 primarily as a
    result of a full year of revenues from our May 2008 alliance
    with Takeda. We are recognizing as revenue the
    $150.0&#160;million in upfront and technology transfer milestone
    payments made or due to us under the Takeda alliance on a
    straight-line basis over seven years, which equates to
    approximately $5.0&#160;million per quarter. Also contributing
    to the increase in 2009 were higher revenues under the Roche
    alliance related primarily to a development milestone achieved
    in 2009. Under the Roche alliance, we are recognizing revenue on
    a straight-line basis over five years, which equates to
    approximately $14.0&#160;million per quarter.

    The decrease in Novartis revenues during the year ended
    December&#160;31, 2009 as compared to the year ended
    December&#160;31, 2008 was due in part to a reduction in the
    number of resources allocated to the broad Novartis alliance.
    The Novartis collaboration and related portion of Novartis
    revenues are currently expected to end in the fourth quarter of
    2010. The Novartis collaboration and license agreement provides
    Novartis with a non-exclusive option to integrate into its
    operations our intellectual property relating to RNAi
    technology, excluding any technology related to delivery of
    nucleic acid based molecules. Novartis may exercise this
    integration option at any point during the research term. In
    connection with the exercise of the integration option, Novartis
    would be required to make additional payments to us totaling
    $100.0&#160;million, payable in full at the time of exercise,
    which payments would include an option exercise fee, a milestone
    based on the overall success of the collaboration, and pre-paid
    milestones and royalties that could become due as a result of
    future development of products using our technology.
    Novartis&#146; exercise of this integration option would
    increase revenues substantially.

    For the year ended December&#160;31, 2009 as compared to the
    year ended December&#160;31, 2008, government contract revenues
    decreased primarily as a result of the wind down of our
    collaboration with DTRA. Following a program review, in February
    2009, we and DTRA determined not to continue this program and
    accordingly, the remaining funds were not accessed.

    Other research collaborator revenues increased in the year ended
    December&#160;31, 2009 as compared to the year ended
    December&#160;31, 2008 due primarily to our alliance with
    Cubist. In consideration for the rights granted to Cubist under
    the agreement, in January 2009, Cubist paid us an upfront cash
    payment of $20.0&#160;million. We are recognizing this
    $20.0&#160;million payment as revenue on a straight-line basis
    over approximately eight years.

    The decrease in InterfeRx program, research reagent license and

    Total deferred revenue of $271.8&#160;million at
    December&#160;31, 2009 consists of payments received from

    Research and development expenses increased during the year
    ended December&#160;31, 2009 due primarily to increased clinical
    program and manufacturing expenses associated with our ALN-TTR
    pre-clinical program and our ALN-VSP clinical trial. Also
    contributing to the increase in research and development
    expenses for the year ended December&#160;31, 2009 was an
    increase in compensation and related, non-cash stock-based
    compensation and facilities-related expenses due primarily to
    additional research and development headcount to support our
    alliances and expanding product pipeline. Partially offsetting
    these increases, external services expenses decreased during the
    year ended December&#160;31, 2009 as a result of lower
    pre-clinical activities due primarily to the wind down of our
    collaboration with DTRA. In addition, under the terms of our
    January 2009 agreement with Cubist, we and Cubist each were
    responsible for one-half of the development costs for our
    ALN-RSV program through November 2009. In November 2009, we and
    Cubist agreed to focus our collaboration and joint development
    efforts on ALN-RSV02 for use in pediatric patients. In turn,
    Alnylam is funding the advancement of ALN-RSV01 for adult lung
    transplant patients and Cubist retains an opt-in right. For the
    year ended December&#160;31, 2009, we recorded amounts due from
    Cubist of $5.3&#160;million as a reduction to research and
    development expenses.

    We expect to continue to devote a substantial portion of our
    resources to research and development expenses and we expect
    that research and development expenses will remain consistent or
    increase slightly in 2010 as we continue development of our and
    our collaborators&#146; product candidates and focus on
    continuing to develop drug delivery-related technologies.

    We do not track actual costs for most of our research and
    development programs or our personnel and personnel-related
    costs on a
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">project-by-project</FONT>
    basis because our most-advanced programs are in the early stages
    of clinical development. In addition, a significant portion of
    our research and development costs are not tracked by project as
    they benefit multiple projects or our technology platform.
    However, our collaboration agreements contain cost-sharing
    arrangements whereby certain costs incurred under the project
    are reimbursed. Costs reimbursed under the agreements typically
    include certain direct external costs and a negotiated full-time
    equivalent labor rate for the actual time worked on the project.
    In addition, we are reimbursed under our government contracts
    for certain allowable costs including direct internal and
    external costs. As a result, although a significant portion of
    our research and development expenses are not tracked on a
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">project-by-project</FONT>
    basis, we do track direct external costs attributable to, and
    the actual time our employees worked on, our collaborations and
    government contracts.

    The increase in general and administrative expenses during the
    year ended December&#160;31, 2009 was due primarily to higher
    consulting and professional services expenses related to
    business activities, primarily legal activities, a description
    of which is set forth in Part&#160;I, Item&#160;3 of this annual
    report on
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">Form&#160;10-K.</FONT>
    Also contributing to the increase were higher non-cash
    stock-based compensation and compensation and related expenses
    due to a modest increase in general and administrative headcount
    over the past year to support our growth. We expect that general
    and administrative expenses, excluding expenses associated with
    legal activities, will remain consistent or increase slightly in
    2010.

    We incurred $4.9&#160;million equity in loss of joint venture
    (Regulus Therapeutics Inc.) for the year ended December&#160;31,
    2009 as compared to $9.3&#160;million for the year ended
    December&#160;31, 2008 related to our share of the net losses
    incurred by Regulus. Through December&#160;31, 2008, we were
    recognizing the first $10.0&#160;million of losses of Regulus as
    equity in loss of joint venture (Regulus Therapeutics Inc.) in
    our consolidated statements of operations because we were
    responsible for funding those losses through our initial
    $10.0&#160;million cash contribution. Beginning in January 2009,
    in connection with the conversion of Regulus to a C corporation,
    we are recognizing approximately 49% of the income and losses of
    Regulus. The carrying value of our investment in joint venture
    (Regulus Therapeutics Inc.) immediately prior to the conversion
    to a C corporation exceeded 49% of the net assets of Regulus by
    approximately $0.8&#160;million. Upon conversion, this amount
    was allocated to the intellectual property of Regulus and,
    because the intellectual property was determined to be
    in-process research and development, the $0.8&#160;million was
    recorded as a charge to expense. This charge is included in
    equity in loss of joint venture (Regulus Therapeutics Inc.) in
    the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended
    December&#160;31, 2009. Separate financial information for
    Regulus is included in Exhibit&#160;99.1 to this annual report

    Interest income was $5.4&#160;million in 2009 as compared to
    $14.4&#160;million in 2008. The decrease in 2009 was due

    Interest expense was zero in 2009 as compared to

    outstanding balance under these credit lines.

    Revenues increased significantly for the year ended
    December&#160;31, 2008 as compared to the year ended
    December&#160;31, 2007 primarily as a result of our August 2007
    alliance with Roche, as well as our May 2008 alliance with
    Takeda. Under the Roche alliance, $278.2&#160;million was being
    recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over five years,
    which equates to approximately $14.0&#160;million per quarter.
    In connection with the Roche alliance, Roche Kulmbach employees
    performed certain transition services for us at various levels
    through August 2008. We reimbursed Roche for these services at
    an
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">agreed-upon</FONT>
    rate. We recorded as contra revenue (a reduction of revenues)
    $1.0&#160;million and $4.2&#160;million for these services
    during the years ended December&#160;31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. Under the Takeda alliance, the $150.0&#160;million
    in upfront and technology transfer milestone payments made or
    due to us are being recognized as revenue on a straight-line
    basis over seven years, which equates to approximately
    $5.0&#160;million per quarter.

    For the year ended December&#160;31, 2008 as compared to the

    The increase in InterfeRx program, research reagent license and

    The decrease in Novartis revenues during the year ended
    December&#160;31, 2008 as compared to the year ended
    December&#160;31, 2007 was due in part to the wind down of the

    Other research collaborator revenues decreased in the year ended
    December&#160;31, 2008 as compared to the year ended
    December&#160;31, 2007 due primarily to our termination of the
    Merck collaboration agreement in September 2007. We were
    recognizing the remaining deferred revenue under the Merck
    agreement on a straight-line basis over the remaining period of
    expected performance of four years. As a result of the
    termination, we recognized an aggregate of $3.5&#160;million
    during the third quarter of 2007, which represented all of the
    remaining deferred revenue under the Merck agreement. In
    addition, during 2008, we reduced the number of resources
    allocated to, and received lower external expense reimbursement
    under, our collaboration with Biogen Idec. The pace and scope of
    future development under this collaboration is the
    responsibility of Biogen Idec.

    Research and development expenses decreased during the year
    ended December&#160;31, 2008 as compared to the year ended
    December&#160;31, 2007 due primarily to higher license fees
    during the prior period consisting of $27.5&#160;million in
    payments to certain entities, primarily Isis, as a result of our
    alliance with Roche, a non-cash license fee of $7.9&#160;million
    and a cash license fee of $0.4&#160;million related to the
    issuance of our stock to Tekmira during 2007 in connection with
    our original license agreement with Tekmira, and
    $6.0&#160;million in payments for drug delivery-related
    activities. Partially offsetting this decrease was
    $5.0&#160;million in payments made in 2008 to certain entities,
    primarily Isis, as a result of the Takeda alliance, as well as a
    charge of $2.1&#160;million in connection with our Tekmira
    license agreement and $3.2&#160;million associated with various
    intellectual property assets.

    higher expenses related to our government programs, our RSV
    program and our pre-clinical programs for the treatment of liver
    cancer and HD, as well as higher expenses associated with our
    drug delivery-related collaborations. In addition, compensation
    and related, lab supplies and materials, and facilities-related
    expenses increased during the year ended December&#160;31, 2008
    as compared to the prior year due to additional research and
    development headcount to support our alliances and expanding

    Equity in loss of joint venture (Regulus Therapeutics Inc.) was
    $9.3&#160;million and $1.1&#160;million during the years ended
    December&#160;31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, related to our
    share of the net losses incurred by Regulus, which was formed in
    September 2007. The increase was a result of Regulus ramping up
    its operations throughout 2008. Separate financial information

    Interest income was $14.4&#160;million in 2008 as compared to
    $15.4&#160;million in 2007. The decrease was due to lower
    average interest rates during the year ended December&#160;31,
    2008, partially offset by higher average cash, cash equivalent
    and marketable securities balances.

    Interest expense was $0.9&#160;million in 2008 as compared to
    $1.1&#160;million in 2007. Interest expense in each period was
    related to borrowings under our lines of credit used to finance
    capital equipment purchases. In December 2008, we repaid the
    aggregate outstanding balance under these credit lines.

    Included in other expense during the year ended
    December&#160;31, 2008 was an impairment charge of
    $1.6&#160;million related to our May 2008 investment in Tekmira,

    Our provision for income taxes was $0.7&#160;million for year
    ended December&#160;31, 2008 primarily as a result of our 2007
    alliance with Roche. Income tax expense was $5.2&#160;million
    for the prior year primarily as a result of the sale of our
    German operations to Roche in August 2007 for $15.0&#160;million.

    Since we commenced operations in 2002, we have generated
    significant losses. As of December&#160;31, 2009, we had an
    accumulated deficit of $299.8&#160;million. As of
    December&#160;31, 2009, we had cash, cash equivalents and
    marketable securities of $435.3&#160;million, compared to cash,
    cash equivalents and marketable securities of
    $512.7&#160;million as of December&#160;31, 2008. We invest
    primarily in cash equivalents, U.S.&#160;government and
    municipal obligations, high-grade corporate notes and commercial
    paper. Our investment objectives are, primarily, to assure
    liquidity and preservation of capital and, secondarily, to
    obtain investment income. All of our investments in debt
    securities are recorded at fair value and are
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">available-for-sale.</FONT>
    Fair value is determined based on quoted market prices and

    We have required significant amounts of cash to fund our
    operating activities as a result of net losses since our
    inception. The decrease in net cash provided by operating
    activities for the year ended December&#160;31, 2009 compared to
    the year ended December&#160;31, 2008 was due primarily to our
    net loss and other changes in our working capital. We had a
    decrease in deferred revenue of $58.2&#160;million for year
    ended December&#160;31, 2009, partially offset by an increase in
    accounts payable of $9.9&#160;million. We had an increase in
    deferred revenue of $66.7&#160;million for the year ended
    December&#160;31, 2008 due primarily to the proceeds received
    from our Takeda and Kyowa Hakko Kirin alliances. Cash used in
    operating activities is adjusted for non-cash items to reconcile
    net loss to net cash provided by or used in operating
    activities. These non-cash adjustments consist primarily of
    stock-based compensation, equity in loss of joint venture
    (Regulus Therapeutics Inc.) and depreciation and amortization.

    We expect that we will require significant amounts of cash to
    fund our operating activities for the foreseeable future as we
    continue to develop and advance our research and development

    the timing and terms of collaboration agreements or other
    strategic transactions, if any, and the timing and progress of
    our research and development efforts.

    in May 2009, as well as proceeds of $2.4&#160;million from the
    issuance of common stock in connection with stock option
    exercises. For the year ended December&#160;31, 2008, net cash
    provided by financing activities was $3.2&#160;million due to
    proceeds of $5.4&#160;million from our issuance of common stock
    to Novartis in May 2008, as well as proceeds of
    $4.5&#160;million from the issuance of common stock in

    $6.8&#160;million for repayments of notes payable.

    In March 2006, we entered into an agreement with Oxford Finance
    Corp., or Oxford, to establish an equipment line of credit for
    up to $7.0&#160;million to help support capital expansion of our
    facility in Cambridge, Massachusetts and capital equipment
    purchases. During 2006, we borrowed an aggregate of
    $4.2&#160;million from Oxford pursuant to the agreement. In May
    2007, we borrowed an aggregate of $1.0&#160;million from Oxford
    pursuant to the agreement. In March 2004, we entered into an
    equipment line of credit with Lighthouse Capital
    Partners&#160;V, L.P., or Lighthouse, to finance leasehold
    improvements and equipment purchases of up to
    $10.0&#160;million. On the maturity of each equipment advance
    under the Lighthouse line of credit, we were required to pay, in
    addition to the principal and interest due, an additional amount
    of 11.5% of the original principal. This amount was being
    accrued over the applicable borrowing period as additional
    interest expense. In December 2008, we repaid the aggregate
    outstanding balance under the Oxford and Lighthouse credit lines.

    During the current downturn in global financial markets, some
    companies have experienced difficulties accessing their cash
    equivalents, investment securities and raising capital
    generally, which have had a material adverse impact on their
    liquidity. In addition, the current economic downturn has
    severely diminished the availability of capital and may limit
    our ability to access these markets to obtain financing in the
    future. Based on our current operating plan, we believe that our
    existing cash, cash equivalents and fixed income marketable
    securities, for which we have not recognized any impairment
    charges, together with the cash we expect to generate under our
    current alliances, including our Novartis, Roche, Takeda and
    Cubist alliances, will be sufficient to fund our planned
    operations for at least the next several years, during which
    time we expect to further the development of our product
    candidates, conduct clinical trials, extend the capabilities of
    our technology platform and continue to prosecute patent
    applications and otherwise build and maintain our patent
    portfolio. However, we may require significant additional funds
    earlier than we currently expect in order to develop, conduct
    clinical trials for and commercialize any product candidates.

    In the longer term, we may seek additional funding through
    additional collaborative arrangements and public or private
    financings. Additional funding may not be available to us on
    acceptable terms or at all. In addition, the terms of any
    financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our
    stockholders. For example, if we raise additional funds by
    issuing equity securities, further dilution to our existing
    stockholders may result. If we are unable to obtain funding on a
    timely basis, we may be required to significantly curtail one or
    more of our research or development programs. We also could be
    required to seek funds through arrangements with collaborators
    or others that may require us to relinquish rights to some of
    our technologies or product candidates that we would otherwise
    pursue.

    indemnify the other parties to such agreements upon the
    occurrence of certain events. These indemnification obligations

    In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB,
    issued the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC.
    Effective in the third quarter of 2009, the ASC became the
    single source for all authoritative GAAP recognized by the FASB,
    and is required to be applied to financial statements issued for
    interim and annual periods ending after September&#160;15, 2009.
    The ASC does not change GAAP and did not impact our consolidated
    financial statements.

    In October 2009, the FASB issued a new accounting standard,
    which amends existing revenue recognition accounting
    pronouncements and provides accounting principles and
    application guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist, how
    the arrangement should be separated and the consideration
    allocated. This standard eliminates the requirement to establish
    the fair value of undelivered products and services and instead
    provides for separate revenue recognition based upon
    management&#146;s estimate of the selling price for an
    undelivered item when there is no other means to determine the
    fair value of that undelivered item. Previously, accounting
    principles required that the fair value of the undelivered item
    be the price of the item either sold in a separate transaction
    between unrelated third parties or the price charged for each
    item when the item is sold separately by the vendor. This was
    difficult to determine when the product was not individually
    sold because of its unique features. If the fair value of all of
    the elements in the arrangement was not determinable, then
    revenue was deferred until all of the items were delivered or
    fair value was determined. This new approach is effective
    prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or
    materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after
    June&#160;15, 2010. We are currently evaluating the potential
    impact of this accounting standard on our consolidated financial
    statements.

    In June 2009, the FASB issued a new accounting standard, which
    has not yet been integrated into the ASC. Accordingly, it will
    remain authoritative until integrated. Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards, or SFAS, No.&#160;167, &#147;Amendments to
    FASB Interpretation No.&#160;46(R),&#148; or SFAS&#160;167,
    amends previously issued accounting guidance for the
    consolidation of a VIE to require an enterprise to determine
    whether its variable interest or interests give it a controlling
    financial interest in a VIE. This amended consolidation guidance
    for VIEs also replaces the existing quantitative approach for
    identifying which enterprise should consolidate a VIE, which was
    based on which enterprise was exposed to a majority of the risks
    and rewards, with a qualitative approach, based on which
    enterprise has both (1)&#160;the power to direct the
    economically significant activities of the entity and
    (2)&#160;the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that
    could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to
    receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be
    significant to the VIE. This new accounting standard has broad
    implications and may affect how we account for the consolidation
    of common structures, such as joint ventures, equity method
    investments, collaboration and other agreements, and purchase
    arrangements. Under this revised consolidation guidance, more
    entities may meet the definition of a VIE, and the determination
    about who should consolidate a VIE is required to be evaluated
    continuously. We have completed our evaluation of the impact of
    adopting this standard and determined that the adoption will not
    have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.

    As part of our investment portfolio, we own financial
    instruments that are sensitive to market risks. The investment
    portfolio is used to preserve our capital until it is required
    to fund operations, including our research and development
    activities. Our marketable securities consist of
    U.S.&#160;government and municipal obligations, high-grade
    corporate notes and commercial paper. All of our investments in
    debt securities are classified as
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">&#147;available-for-sale&#148;</FONT>
    and are recorded at fair value. Our
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">available-for-sale</FONT>
    investments in debt securities are sensitive to changes in
    interest rates and changes in the credit ratings of the issuers.
    Interest rate changes would result in a change in the net fair
    value of these financial instruments due to the difference
    between the market interest rate and the market interest rate at
    the date of purchase of the financial instrument. If market
    interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by
    50&#160;basis points, or one-half of a percentage point, from
    levels at December&#160;31, 2009, the net fair value of our
    interest-sensitive financial instruments would have resulted in
    a hypothetical decline of $1.6&#160;million. A downgrade in the
    credit rating of an issuer of a debt security or further
    deterioration of the credit markets could result in a decline in
    the fair value of the debt instruments. Our investment
    guidelines prohibit investment in auction rate securities and we
    do not believe we have any direct exposure to losses relating
    from mortgage-based securities or derivatives related thereto
    such as credit-default swaps. We have not recorded any
    impairment charges to our fixed income marketable securities as
    of December&#160;31, 2009.

    In our opinion, based on our audits and the report of other
    auditors, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the
    related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive
    loss, stockholders&#146; equity and cash flows present fairly,
    in all material respects, the financial position of Alnylam
    Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December&#160;31,
    2009 and 2008, and the results of their operations and their
    cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December&#160;31, 2009 in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America.  Also in our
    opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
    effective internal control over financial reporting as of
    December&#160;31, 2009, based on criteria established in
    Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
    of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
    The Company&#146;s management is responsible for these financial
    statements, for maintaining effective internal control over
    financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
    of internal control over financial reporting, included in
    Management&#146;s Annual Report on Internal Control over
    Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions
    on these financial statements and on the Company&#146;s internal
    control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
    We did not audit the financial statements of Regulus
    Therapeutics Inc., an approximate 49 percent-owned equity
    investment, which were audited by other auditors whose report
    thereon has been furnished to us. Our opinion expressed herein,
    insofar as it relates to the Company&#146;s net investment in
    (approximately $6.4&#160;million and $1.6&#160;million at
    December&#160;31, 2009 and 2008, respectively) and equity in the
    net loss (approximately $4.9&#160;million, $9.3&#160;million and
    $1.1&#160;million for the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008
    and for the period from September 6, 2007 (inception) to
    December 31, 2007, respectively) of Regulus Therapeutics Inc.,
    is based solely on the report of the other auditors. We
    conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement and whether effective internal
    control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audits of the financial statements included
    examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
    disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
    presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial
    reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal
    control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
    material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
    assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audits and the report of other auditors provide
    a reasonable basis for our opinions.

    A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a

    Effective January&#160;1, 2008, the Company adopted a newly
    issued accounting standard which addresses how companies should
    measure fair value when they are required to do so for
    recognition or disclosure purposes. The standard provides a
    common definition of fair value and is intended to make the
    measurement of fair value more consistent and comparable as well
    as to improve disclosures about those measures. This standard
    formalizes the measurement principles to be utilized in
    determining fair value for purposes such as derivative valuation
    and impairment analysis. For recognition purposes, on a
    recurring basis, the Company is required to measure certain cash
    equivalents and
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">available-for-sale</FONT>
    investments at fair value. Changes in the fair value of these
    investments historically have been insignificant. The
    Company&#146;s adoption of this standard has had no impact on
    its operating results or financial position.

    Effective January&#160;1, 2009, the Company adopted a newly
    issued accounting standard for fair value measurements of all
    nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities not recognized
    or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a
    recurring basis. The Company&#146;s adoption of this accounting
    standard for these nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial
    liabilities did not impact its consolidated financial
    statements, and the Company did not have any nonfinancial assets
    or nonfinancial liabilities that would be recognized or

    indicate the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques
    the Company utilized to determine such fair value. In general,
    fair values determined by Level&#160;1 inputs utilize quoted
    prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or
    liabilities. Fair values determined by Level&#160;2 inputs
    utilize data points that are observable, such as quoted prices
    (adjusted), interest rates and yield curves. Fair values
    determined by Level&#160;3 inputs utilize unobservable data
    points for the asset or liability, and include situations

    The Company recognizes upfront license payments as revenue upon

    value and the fair value of the undelivered performance
    obligations, typically including research

    value of the undelivered performance obligations can be
    determined, such obligations are accounted for separately as
    such obligations are fulfilled. If the license is considered to
    either not have stand-alone value or have stand-alone value but
    the fair value of any of the undelivered performance obligations
    cannot be determined, the arrangement would then be accounted
    for as a single unit of accounting and the license payments and

    Whenever the Company determines that an arrangement should be
    accounted for as a single unit of accounting, the Company
    determines the period over which the performance obligations
    will be performed and revenue will be recognized. Revenue will
    be recognized using either a proportional performance or
    straight-line method. The Company recognizes revenue using the
    proportional performance method when the level of effort
    required to complete its performance obligations under an
    arrangement can be reasonably estimated and such performance
    obligations are provided on a best-efforts basis. Direct labor
    hours or full-time equivalents are typically used as the measure
    of performance. Revenue recognized under the proportional
    performance method would be determined by multiplying the total
    payments under the contract, excluding royalties and payments
    contingent upon achievement of substantive milestones, by the
    ratio of level of effort incurred to date to estimated total
    level of effort required to complete the Company&#146;s

    Many of the Company&#146;s collaboration agreements entitle it
    to additional payments upon the achievement of performance-based
    milestones. If the achievement of a milestone is considered
    probable at the inception of the collaboration, the related
    milestone payment is included with other collaboration
    consideration, such as upfront fees and research funding, in the
    Company&#146;s revenue model. Milestones that involve
    substantial effort on the Company&#146;s part and the
    achievement of which are not considered probable at the
    inception of the collaboration are considered &#147;substantive
    milestones.&#148; Substantive milestones are included in the
    Company&#146;s revenue model when achievement of the milestone
    is considered probable. As future substantive milestones are
    achieved, a portion of the milestone payment, equal to the
    percentage of the performance period completed when the
    milestone is achieved, multiplied by the amount of the milestone
    payment, will be recognized as revenue upon achievement of such
    milestone. The remaining portion of the milestone will be
    recognized over the remaining performance period using the
    proportional performance or straight-line method. Milestones
    that are tied to regulatory approval are not considered probable

    option plans and an employee stock purchase plan under which it
    grants equity instruments that are required to be evaluated

    compensation expense is generally recognized over the vesting
    period of the award, which is generally the period during which
    services are rendered by such non-employees. At the end of each
    financial reporting period prior to vesting, the value of these

    In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (&#147;FASB&#148;) issued the FASB Accounting Standards
    Codification (&#147;ASC&#148;). Effective in the third quarter
    of 2009, the ASC became the single source for all authoritative
    GAAP recognized by the FASB, and is required to be applied to
    financial statements issued for interim and annual periods
    ending after September&#160;15, 2009. The ASC does not change
    GAAP and did not impact the Company&#146;s consolidated

    In October 2009, the FASB issued a new accounting standard,
    which amends existing revenue recognition accounting
    pronouncements and provides accounting principles and
    application guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist, how
    the arrangement should be separated, and the consideration
    allocated. This standard eliminates the requirement to establish
    the fair value of undelivered products and services and instead
    provides for separate revenue recognition based upon
    management&#146;s estimate of the selling price for an
    undelivered item when there is no other means to determine the
    fair value of that undelivered item. Previously, accounting
    principles required that the fair value of the undelivered item
    be the price of the item either sold in a separate transaction
    between unrelated third parties or the price charged for each
    item when the item is sold separately by the vendor. This was
    difficult to determine when the product was not individually
    sold because of its unique features. If the fair value of all of
    the elements in the arrangement was not determinable, then
    revenue was deferred until all of the items were delivered or
    fair value was determined. This new approach is effective
    prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or
    materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after
    June&#160;15, 2010. The Company is currently evaluating the
    potential impact of this accounting standard on its consolidated
    financial statements.

    No.&#160;167, &#147;Amendments to FASB Interpretation
    No.&#160;46(R)&#148; (&#147;SFAS&#160;167&#148;) amends
    previously issued accounting guidance for the consolidation of a
    VIE to require an enterprise to determine whether its variable
    interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest
    in a VIE. This amended consolidation guidance for VIEs also
    replaces the existing quantitative approach for identifying
    which enterprise should consolidate a VIE, which was based on
    which enterprise was exposed to a majority of the risks and
    rewards, with a qualitative approach, based on which enterprise
    has both (1)&#160;the power to direct the economically
    significant activities of the entity and (2)&#160;the obligation
    to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be
    significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the
    entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE. This
    new accounting standard has broad implications and may affect
    how the Company accounts for the consolidation of common
    structures, such as joint ventures, equity method investments,
    collaboration and other agreements, and purchase arrangements.
    Under this revised consolidation guidance, more entities may
    meet the definition of a VIE, and the determination about which
    entity should consolidate a VIE is required to be evaluated
    continuously. The Company has completed an evaluation of the
    impact of adopting this standard and determined that the
    adoption will not have an impact on its consolidated financial
    statements.

    In July 2007, the Company and, for limited purposes, Alnylam
    Europe, entered into a License and Collaboration Agreement (the
    &#147;LCA&#148;) with Roche. Under the LCA, which became

    non-exclusive license to the Company&#146;s intellectual
    property to develop and commercialize therapeutic products that
    function through RNAi, subject to the Company&#146;s existing
    contractual obligations to third parties. The license is
    initially limited to the therapeutic areas of oncology,
    respiratory diseases, metabolic diseases and certain liver
    diseases, and may be expanded to include up to 18 additional
    therapeutic areas, comprising substantially all other fields of
    human disease, as identified and agreed upon by the parties,
    upon payment to the Company by Roche of an additional
    $50.0&#160;million for each additional therapeutic area, if any.

    Under the LCA, the Company and Roche also agreed to collaborate
    on the discovery of RNAi therapeutic products directed to one or
    more disease targets (&#147;Discovery Collaboration&#148;),
    subject to the Company&#146;s existing contractual obligations

    advanced their alliance to initiate this therapeutic

    Company and Roche are collaborating on the discovery and
    development of specific RNAi therapeutic products and each party
    contributes key delivery technologies in the effort, which is
    focused on specific disease targets. The Company and Roche
    intend to co-develop and co-commercialize RNAi therapeutic
    products in the U.S.&#160;market and the Company is eligible to
    receive additional milestone and royalty payments for products
    developed in the rest of the world, if any. After a

    Agreement (the &#147;Common Stock Purchase Agreement&#148;) with

    closing price of the Company&#146;s common stock on

    Based on the closing price of $25.98, the fair value of the

    $8.8&#160;million in excess of the proceeds received from Roche
    for the issuance of the Company&#146;s common stock. As a

    alliance include the license, the Alnylam Europe assets and
    employees, the steering committees (joint steering committee and
    future technology committee) and the services that the Company
    is obligated to perform under the Discovery Collaboration. The
    Company has determined that, pursuant to the accounting guidance
    governing revenue recognition on multiple element arrangements,
    the license and assets of Alnylam Europe are not separable from
    the undelivered services (i.e., the steering committees and
    Discovery Collaboration) and, accordingly the license and the
    services are being treated as a single unit of accounting. When
    multiple deliverables are accounted for as a single unit of
    accounting, the Company bases its revenue recognition pattern on
    the final deliverable. Under the Roche alliance, the steering
    committee services and the Discovery Collaboration services are
    the final deliverables and all such services will end,
    contractually, five years from the effective date of the LCA.

    Beginning in September 2005, the Company entered into a series
    of transactions with Novartis. In September 2005, the Company
    and Novartis executed a stock purchase agreement (the
    &#147;Stock Purchase Agreement&#148;) and an investor rights
    agreement (the &#147;Investor Rights Agreement&#148;). In
    October 2005, in connection with the closing of the transactions
    contemplated by the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Investor
    Rights Agreement became effective and the Company and Novartis
    executed a research collaboration and license agreement (the
    &#147;Collaboration and License Agreement&#148;) (collectively
    the &#147;Novartis Agreements&#148;). The Collaboration and
    License Agreement had an initial term of three years, with an
    option for two additional one-year extensions at the election of
    Novartis. In July 2009, Novartis elected to further extend the
    term for the fifth and final planned year, through October 2010.

    Under the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, in October
    2005, Novartis purchased 5,267,865&#160;shares of the
    Company&#146;s common stock at a purchase price of $11.11 per
    share for an aggregate purchase price of $58.5&#160;million,
    which, after such issuance, represented 19.9% of the
    Company&#146;s outstanding common stock as of the date of
    issuance. In addition, under the Investor Rights Agreement, the
    Company granted Novartis rights to acquire additional equity
    securities in the event that the Company proposes to sell or
    issue any equity securities, subject to specified exceptions, as
    described in the Investor Rights Agreement, such that Novartis
    would be able to maintain its then-current ownership percentage
    in the Company&#146;s outstanding common stock. Pursuant to
    terms of the Investor Rights Agreement, in May 2008, Novartis
    purchased 213,888&#160;shares of the Company&#146;s common stock
    at a purchase price of $25.29 per share resulting in a payment
    to the Company of $5.4&#160;million. In May 2009, Novartis
    purchased 65,922&#160;shares of the Company&#146;s common stock
    at a purchase price of $17.50 per share, resulting in an
    aggregate payment to the Company of $1.2&#160;million. This
    purchase allowed Novartis to maintain its ownership position of
    13.4% of the Company&#146;s outstanding common stock. The
    exercises of this right did not result in any changes to
    existing rights or any additional rights to Novartis. Further,
    during the term described in the Investor Rights Agreement,
    Novartis is permitted to own no more than 19.9% of the
    Company&#146;s outstanding shares. At December&#160;31, 2009,
    Novartis owned 13.3% of the Company&#146;s outstanding common
    stock.

    License Agreement also includes terms under which Novartis is
    providing the Company with research funding and development
    milestone payments, and may provide the Company in the future
    with sales milestone payments as well as royalties on annual net
    sales of products resulting from the Collaboration and License

    reimburses the Company at an agreed upon rate. Under the terms

    nucleic acid based molecules (the &#147;Integration

    any point during the research term, which term is currently
    expected to expire in the fourth quarter of 2010. In connection
    with the exercise of the Integration Option, Novartis would be
    required to make additional payments to the Company totaling

    Cubist will focus their collaboration and joint development

    Tekmira, the Company issued to Tekmira 361,990&#160;shares of
    common stock. These shares had a value of $7.9&#160;million at
    the time of issuance, which amount was expensed during the first
    quarter of 2007. In May 2008, Tekmira acquired Protiva
    Biotherapeutics Inc. (&#147;Protiva&#148;). In connection with
    this acquisition, the Company entered into new agreements with
    Tekmira and Protiva which provide the Company with access to key
    existing and future technology and intellectual property for the
    systemic delivery of RNAi therapeutics with liposomal delivery
    technologies. In addition, the Company made an equity investment
    of $5.0&#160;million in Tekmira, purchasing
    2,083,333&#160;shares of Tekmira common stock at a price of
    $2.40 per share, which represented a premium of $1.00 per share,
    or an aggregate of $2.1&#160;million. This premium was
    calculated as the difference between the purchase price and the
    closing price of Tekmira&#146;s common stock on the effective
    date of the acquisition. The Company allocated this
    $2.1&#160;million premium to the expansion of the Company&#146;s
    access to key technology and intellectual property rights and,
    accordingly, recorded a charge to research and development
    expense during the second quarter of 2008. The Company recorded
    this investment as an
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">available-for-sale</FONT>
    security in marketable securities on its consolidated balance
    sheets. During the year ended December&#160;31, 2008, the
    Company recorded an impairment charge of $1.6&#160;million
    related to its investment in Tekmira, as the decrease in the
    fair value of this investment was deemed to be other than
    temporary.

    During the years ended December&#160;31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    the Company recorded $0.2&#160;million, $0.2&#160;million and
    $0.3&#160;million, respectively, of amortization expense related
    to core technology and workforce intangibles acquired from its
    acquisition of Ribopharma AG in 2003, of which the entire amount
    is included in research and development expenses. Workforce
    intangibles were fully amortized during 2007. Core technology is
    being amortized over its estimated useful life of ten years
    through 2013. The Company expects annual amortization expense
    related to the core technology intangible asset to be
    $0.2&#160;million through 2012 and $0.1&#160;million in 2013.

    Company amended its lease agreement to rent additional space at

    In June 2009, the Company entered into an agreement with its

    Sublease. Following execution of the Amendment, the Company
    leases and occupies approximately 95,000&#160;square feet of
    office and laboratory space at the Premises under the lease, as
    amended. The term of the lease was extended an additional five
    years and now expires in September 2016. The Company has the

    Trustees of the University of Massachusetts (&#147;UMass&#148;).
    The complaint, initially filed in Suffolk County Superior Court
    in Boston, Massachusetts and subsequently removed to the
    U.S.&#160;District Court for the District of Massachusetts,
    alleges, among other things, that the defendants have improperly
    prosecuted the Tuschl&#160;I patent applications and wrongfully
    incorporated inventions covered by the Tuschl&#160;II patent
    applications into the Tuschl&#160;I patent applications, thereby
    potentially damaging the value of inventions reflected in the
    Tuschl&#160;I and Tuschl&#160;II patent applications. In the
    field of RNAi therapeutics, the Company is the exclusive
    licensee of the Tuschl&#160;I patent applications from Max
    Planck, MIT and Whitehead, and of the Tuschl&#160;II patent
    applications from Max Planck.

    The complaint seeks to enjoin the defendants from taking any
    further action in connection with the prosecution of any Tuschl
    I application, a declaratory judgment and unspecified monetary
    damages. In August 2009, the court denied the Company&#146;s
    motion for a preliminary injunction. In addition, in August
    2009, Whitehead and UMass filed counterclaims against the
    Company and Max Planck, including for breach of contract. A
    trial on the merits was originally scheduled to begin in
    February 2010. In January 2010, the Company and Max Planck filed
    a motion for leave to file an amended complaint expanding upon
    the allegations in the original complaint. In January 2010, the
    court granted this motion allowing the amended complaint and
    postponed the start of the trial. The Company currently expects
    the trial to start in June 2010.

    In addition, in September 2009, the U.S.&#160;Patent and
    Trademark Office (&#147;USPTO&#148;), granted Max Planck&#146;s
    petition to revoke power of attorney in connection with the
    prosecution of the Tuschl I patent application. This action
    prevents the defendants from filing any papers with the USPTO in
    connection with further prosecution of the Tuschl I patent
    application without the agreement of Max Planck.
    Whitehead&#146;s petition to overturn the ruling on Max
    Planck&#146;s petition was denied.

    Although the Company, along with Max Planck, are vigorously
    asserting their rights in this case, litigation is subject to
    inherent uncertainty and a court could ultimately rule against
    the Company and Max Planck. In addition, litigation is costly
    and may divert the attention of the Company&#146;s management
    and other resources that would otherwise be engaged in running
    the Company&#146;s business. The Company has not recorded an
    estimated liability associated with the legal proceedings
    described above due to the uncertainties related to both the
    likelihood and the amount of any potential loss.

    the Company&#146;s license agreements with Max Planck relating
    to the Tuschl I and Tuschl&#160;II patent applications, the
    Company is required to indemnify Max Planck for certain damages
    arising in connection with the intellectual property rights
    licensed under the agreements. Under the Max Planck
    indemnification agreement, the Company is responsible for paying
    the costs of any litigation relating to the license agreements
    or the underlying intellectual property rights, including the
    costs associated with the litigation described above. These
    costs are charged to general and administrative expense. The
    Company believes that the probability of receiving a claim for
    damages is remote and, as such, no amounts have been accrued
    related to this indemnification at December&#160;31, 2009 and
    2008.

    The Company is also a party to a number of agreements entered
    into in the ordinary course of business, which contain typical
    provisions that obligate the Company to indemnify the other
    parties to such agreements upon the occurrence of certain
    events. Such indemnification obligations are usually in effect

    period equal to the applicable statute of limitations.

    The maximum potential future liability of the Company under any
    such indemnification provisions is uncertain. The Company has
    determined that the estimated aggregate fair value of its
    potential liabilities under all such indemnification provisions
    is minimal and has not recorded any liability related to such
    indemnification provisions at December&#160;31, 2009 or 2008.

    Company has actual knowledge that an Acquiring Person has become
    such or (2)&#160;ten business days following the commencement of
    a tender offer or exchange offer that would result in a person
    or group beneficially owning more than 20&#160;percent of the
    outstanding shares of common stock of the Company. Each Right
    entitles the holder to purchase one one-thousandth of a share of
    Series&#160;A Junior Preferred Stock at an initial purchase
    price of $80.00 in cash, subject to adjustment. In the event
    that any person or group becomes an Acquiring Person, unless the
    event causing the 20% threshold to be crossed is a Permitted
    Offer (as defined in the Rights Agreement), each Right not owned
    by the Acquiring Person will entitle its holder to receive, upon
    exercise, that number of shares of common stock of the Company
    (or in certain circumstances, cash, property or other securities
    of the Company) which equals the exercise price of the Right
    divided by 50% of the current market price (as defined in the
    Rights Agreement) per share of such common stock at the date of
    the occurrence of the event. In the event that, at any time
    after any person or group becomes an Acquiring Person,
    (i)&#160;the Company is consolidated with, or merged with and
    into, another entity and the Company is not the surviving entity
    of such consolidation or merger (other than a consolidation or
    merger which follows a Permitted Offer) or if the Company is the
    surviving entity, but shares of its outstanding common stock are
    changed or exchanged for stock or securities (of any other
    person) or cash or any other property, or (ii)&#160;more than
    50% of the Company&#146;s assets or earning power is sold or
    transferred, each holder of a Right (except Rights which
    previously have been voided as set forth in the Rights
    Agreement) shall thereafter have the right to receive, upon
    exercise, that number of shares of common stock of the acquiring
    company which equals the exercise price of the Right divided by
    50% of the current market price of such common stock at the date
    of the occurrence of the event.

    Company&#146;s 2009 Stock Incentive Plan (the &#147;2009

    options, restricted stock awards and units, stock appreciation
    rights and other stock-based awards to purchase up to
    2,200,000&#160;shares of common stock. The 2009 Plan has a
    fungible share pool. Any award that is not a full value award
    shall be counted against the authorized share limits specified
    in the 2009 Plan as one share for each share of common stock

    Plan as restricted stock awards or other stock-based awards,

    common stock subject to such full value award. In addition, the
    2009 Plan includes a non-employee director stock option program
    under which each eligible non-employee director is entitled to
    (1)&#160;a grant of an option to purchase 30,000&#160;shares of
    common stock upon his or her initial appointment to the Board of
    Directors, or such other amount as the Board of Directors deems
    appropriate, and (2)&#160;a subsequent annual grant of an option
    to purchase 15,000&#160;shares of common stock based on
    continued service, made on the date of each annual meeting of
    stockholders, provided the non-employee director has served as a
    director for at least six months and is serving as a director
    immediately prior to and following such annual meeting. The
    chairman of the audit committee will receive an additional
    annual grant of an option to purchase 10,000&#160;shares of
    common stock based on continued service. Stock options granted
    by the Company to non-employee directors upon their appointment

    The fair value of stock options at date of grant, based on the
    following assumptions, was estimated using the Black-Scholes
    option-pricing model. The Company&#146;s expected stock-price
    volatility assumption for 2009, 2008 and the three months ended
    December&#160;31, 2007 is based on a combination of implied
    volatilities of its publicly traded stock option prices as well
    as the historical volatility of the Company&#146;s publicly
    traded stock. During the nine months ended September&#160;30,
    2007, the Company&#146;s expected stock-price volatility
    assumption was based on a combination of implied volatilities of
    similar entities whose share or option prices are publicly
    available as well as the historical volatility of the
    Company&#146;s publicly traded stock. The expected life
    assumption for 2009, 2008 and for the three months ended
    December&#160;31, 2007 is based on the equal weighting of the
    Company&#146;s historical data and the historical data of the
    Company&#146;s pharmaceutical and biotechnology peers. During
    the nine months ended September&#160;30, 2007, the expected life
    assumption was based on the simplified method, which averages
    the contractual term of the Company&#146;s options (ten years)
    with the ordinary vesting term (2.2&#160;years). The dividend
    yield assumption is based on the fact that the Company has never
    paid cash dividends and has no present intention to pay cash
    dividends. The risk-free interest rate used for each grant is
    equal to the zero coupon rate for instruments with a similar
    expected life. The Company currently expects, based on an
    analysis of its historical forfeitures, that approximately 83%
    of its options will actually vest, and therefore have applied an
    annual forfeiture rate of 4.5% to all unvested options as of
    December&#160;31, 2009. The Company will record additional
    expense if the actual forfeitures are lower than estimated and
    will record a recovery of prior expense if the actual
    forfeitures are higher than estimated.

    In 2004, the Company adopted the 2004 Employee Stock Purchase
    Plan (the &#147;2004 Purchase Plan&#148;) with
    315,789&#160;shares authorized for issuance. Under the 2004
    Purchase Plan as adopted, the Company made one offering each
    year, at the end of which employees could purchase shares of
    common stock through payroll deductions made over the term of
    the offering. Initially, the annual offering period began on the
    1st&#160;day of November each year and ended on the
    31st&#160;day of October the following year. In June 2007, the
    compensation committee of the Board of Directors amended the
    offering period of the 2004 Purchase Plan to provide that each
    offering period will be for a period of six months, beginning
    with the offering period commencing on November&#160;1, 2007.
    The per-share purchase price at the end of the offering is equal
    to the lesser of 85% of the closing price of the common stock at
    the beginning or end of the offering period. The Company issued
    59,267, 35,065 and 29,723&#160;shares during the years ended
    December&#160;31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and as of
    December&#160;31, 2009, 99,412&#160;shares were available for
    issuance under the 2004 Purchase Plan.

    The weighted average fair value of stock purchase rights granted
    as part of the 2004 Purchase Plan was $7.20, $9.51 and $10.61
    per share for the years ended December&#160;31, 2009, 2008 and
    2007, respectively. The fair value was estimated using the
    Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Company used a
    weighted-average stock-price volatility of 66%, expected option
    life assumption of six months and a risk-free interest rate of
    0.7%. The Company recorded $0.4&#160;million, $0.3&#160;million
    and $0.2&#160;million of stock-based compensation expense for
    the years ended December&#160;31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively, related to the 2004 Purchase Plan.

    The Company has evaluated the positive and negative evidence

    Company has concluded, in accordance with the applicable
    accounting standards, that it is more likely than not that the
    Company may not realize the benefit of all its deferred tax
    assets. Accordingly, a valuation allowance has been recorded
    against the deferred tax assets that management believes will
    not be realized. The Company reevaluates the positive and
    negative evidence on a quarterly basis. The valuation allowance
    increased by $21.2&#160;million, $14.5&#160;million and
    $29.6&#160;million for the years ended December&#160;31, 2009,

    During 2009 and 2008, the Company utilized certain tax

    Company also generated a deferred tax asset related to the
    recognition of this revenue for tax purposes. As a result, the
    Company has recorded a net deferred tax asset to the extent it
    is more likely than not that the asset will be realized. The
    remaining deferred tax assets are subject to a valuation

    continues to operate as an independent company with a separate
    board of directors, scientific advisory board and management
    team, some of whom have options to purchase common stock of
    Regulus. Members of the board of directors of Regulus who are

    The Company, Isis and Regulus also entered into a license and
    collaboration agreement (the &#147;Regulus Collaboration
    Agreement&#148;) to pursue the discovery, development and
    commercialization of therapeutic products directed to microRNAs.
    Under the terms of the Regulus Collaboration Agreement, the
    Company and Isis each assigned to Regulus specified patents and
    contracts covering microRNA-specific technology. In addition,
    each of the Company and Isis granted to Regulus an exclusive,
    worldwide license under its rights to other microRNA-related
    patents and know-how to develop and commercialize therapeutic
    products containing compounds that are designed to interfere
    with or inhibit a particular microRNA, subject to the
    Company&#146;s and Isis&#146; existing contractual obligations
    to third parties. Regulus was also granted the right to request
    a license from the Company and Isis to develop and commercialize
    therapeutic products directed to other microRNA compounds, which
    license is subject to the Company&#146;s and Isis&#146; approval
    and to each such party&#146;s existing contractual obligations
    to third parties. Regulus also granted to the Company and Isis
    an exclusive license to technology developed or acquired by
    Regulus for use solely within the Company&#146;s and Isis&#146;
    respective fields (as defined in the Regulus Collaboration
    Agreement), but specifically excluding the right to develop,
    manufacture or commercialize the therapeutic products for which
    the Company and Isis granted rights to Regulus.

    The Regulus Collaboration Agreement ends if, prior to first
    commercial sale of any product, all development activities cease

    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">country-by-country</FONT>
    basis, upon the later of expiration of marketing exclusivity for
    such product or a specified number of years from first
    commercial sale. If Regulus, the Company or Isis commits an
    uncured material breach of the Regulus Collaboration Agreement,
    the Regulus Collaboration Agreement may be terminated with
    respect to the breaching party or a buy-out may be initiated,
    depending on the nature of the breach.

    In April 2008, Regulus entered into a worldwide strategic
    alliance with GlaxoSmithKline (&#147;GSK&#148;) to discover,
    develop and commercialize up to four novel microRNA-targeted
    therapeutics to treat inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid
    arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. In connection with
    this alliance, Regulus received $20.0&#160;million in upfront
    payments from GSK, including a $15.0&#160;million option fee and
    a loan of $5.0&#160;million evidenced by a promissory note
    (guaranteed by Isis and the Company) that will convert into
    Regulus common stock under certain specified circumstances.
    Regulus could be eligible to receive development, regulatory and
    sales milestone payments for each of the microRNA-targeted
    therapeutics discovered and developed as part of the alliance.
    Regulus would also receive royalty payments on worldwide sales
    of products resulting from the alliance, if any.

    The Company has reviewed the consolidation guidance that defines
    a VIE and concluded that Regulus currently qualifies as a VIE.
    The Investor Rights Agreement contains transfer restrictions on
    each of Isis&#146; and the Company&#146;s interests and, as a
    result, Isis and the Company are considered related parties
    under the consolidation guidance. The Company has assessed which
    entity would be considered the primary beneficiary under the
    consolidation guidance and has concluded that Isis is the
    primary beneficiary and, accordingly, the Company has not
    consolidated Regulus.

    The Company accounts for its investment in Regulus using the
    equity method of accounting. Through December&#160;31, 2008, the
    Company was recognizing the first $10.0&#160;million of losses
    of Regulus as equity in loss of joint venture (Regulus
    Therapeutics Inc.) in its consolidated statements of operations

    in connection with the conversion of Regulus to a C corporation,
    the Company is recognizing approximately 49% of the income and
    losses of Regulus. The carrying value of the Company&#146;s
    investment in joint venture (Regulus Therapeutics Inc.)
    immediately prior to the conversion to a C corporation exceeded
    49% of the net assets of Regulus by approximately
    $0.8&#160;million. Upon conversion, this amount was allocated to
    the intellectual property of Regulus and, because the
    intellectual property was determined to be in-process research
    and development, the $0.8&#160;million was recorded as a charge
    to expense. This charge is included in equity in loss of joint
    venture (Regulus Therapeutics Inc.) in the consolidated
    statements of operations for the year ended December&#160;31,
    2009. Under the equity method, the reimbursement of expenses to
    the Company is recorded as a reduction to research and
    development expenses. At December&#160;31, 2009, the
    Company&#146;s investment in the joint venture was
    $6.4&#160;million, which is recorded as an investment in joint
    venture (Regulus Therapeutics Inc.) in the consolidated balance
    sheets under the equity method. Summary results of Regulus&#146;
    operations for the years ended December&#160;31, 2009, 2008 and
    2007 and balance sheets as of December&#160;31, 2009 and 2008

    Our management, with the participation of our chief executive
    officer and vice president of finance and treasurer, evaluated
    the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as
    of December&#160;31, 2009. The term &#147;disclosure controls
    and procedures,&#148; as defined in
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">Rules&#160;13a-15(e)</FONT>
    and
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">15d-15(e)</FONT>
    under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a
    company that are designed to ensure that information required to
    be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or
    submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
    summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in
    the SEC&#146;s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and
    procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures
    designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by
    a company in the reports that it files or submits under the
    Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the
    company&#146;s management, including its principal executive and
    principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely
    decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes
    that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed
    and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving
    their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment
    in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls
    and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure
    controls and procedures as of December&#160;31, 2009, the
    Company&#146;s chief executive officer and vice president of
    finance and treasurer concluded that, as of such date, our
    disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the
    reasonable assurance level.
