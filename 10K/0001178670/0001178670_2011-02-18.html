    We are a biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics
    based on RNA interference, or RNAi. RNAi is a naturally
    occurring biological pathway within cells for selectively
    silencing and regulating the expression of specific genes. Since
    many diseases are caused by the inappropriate activity of
    specific genes, the ability to silence genes selectively through
    RNAi could provide a new way to treat a wide range of human
    diseases. We believe that drugs that work through RNAi have the
    potential to become a broad new class of drugs, like small
    molecule, protein and antibody drugs. Using our intellectual
    property and the expertise we have built in RNAi, we are
    developing a set of biological and chemical methods and know-how
    that we apply in a systematic way to develop RNAi therapeutics
    for a variety of diseases.

    Our core product strategy, which we refer to as &#147;Alnylam
    5x15,&#148; is focused on the development and commercialization
    of innovative RNAi therapeutics for the treatment of genetically
    defined diseases. Under our core product strategy, we expect to
    progress five RNAi therapeutic programs into advanced stages of
    clinical development by the end of 2015. As part of this
    strategy, our goal is to develop product candidates with the
    following shared characteristics: a genetically defined target
    and disease; the potential to have a significant impact in high

    the treatment of transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis, or ATTR;
    ALN-PCS for the treatment of severe hypercholesterolemia; and
    ALN-HPN for the treatment of refractory anemia. As part of our
    core product strategy, we also expect to designate and start
    pre-clinical development of two additional RNAi therapeutic
    candidates targeting genetically defined diseases by the end of
    2011.

    clinical trial for ALN-TTR01 is being conducted in Portugal,
    Sweden, the United Kingdom and France, and is a randomized,
    blinded, placebo-controlled dose escalation study designed to
    enroll approximately 28 ATTR patients. The primary objective is
    to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single dose of
    intravenous ALN-TTR01. Secondary objectives include
    characterization of plasma and urine pharmacokinetics of
    ALN-TTR01 and assessment of pharmacodynamic activity based on

    Beginning in 1999, our scientific founders described and
    provided evidence that the RNAi mechanism occurs in mammalian
    cells and that its immediate trigger is a type of molecule known
    as an siRNA. They showed that laboratory-synthesized siRNAs
    could be introduced into the cell and suppress production of
    specific target proteins by cleaving and degrading the messenger
    RNA, or mRNA, of the specific gene that encodes that specific
    protein. Because it is possible to design and synthesize siRNAs
    specific to any gene of interest, the entire human genome is
    accessible to RNAi, and we therefore believe that RNAi
    therapeutics have the potential to become a broad new class of
    drugs.

    mammalian cells, can silence the activity of a specific gene.
    Since the Tuschl publication and the seminal Tuschl&#160;II
    patent, which is licensed exclusively to us for therapeutic
    applications, the use of siRNAs has been broadly adopted by
    academic and industrial researchers for the fundamental study of
    the function of genes. This has resulted in a significant number
    of publications focused on the use of RNAi and has made the

    Our product platform provides a capability for a systematic
    approach to identifying RNAi therapeutic product candidates
    through sequence selection, potency selection, stabilization by
    chemical modification, improvement of biodistribution and
    cellular uptake by various chemical conjugates and formulations.
    Key to the therapeutic application of siRNAs is the ability to
    successfully deliver siRNAs to target tissues and achieve
    cellular uptake of the siRNA into the inside of the cell where
    the RNAi machinery, called RNA-induced silencing complex, or
    RISC, is active. In some tissues, including the respiratory
    tract and central nervous system, the direct RNAi delivery
    approach, which employs the direct or local application of
    siRNAs, achieves cellular uptake and gene knockdown. For other
    tissues, such as the liver, systemic RNAi delivery has been
    employed, where tissue access comes via intravenous or
    subcutaneous injection of the siRNA into the bloodstream and
    where cellular uptake can be achieved by formulation with other
    biomaterials, such as LNPs, or the conjugation of the siRNA with
    other molecules, such as small chemical groups. siRNA delivery
    is a key focus for our internal research team and is also the
    focus of numerous current academic and corporate collaborations.
    We have demonstrated RNAi therapeutic activity towards multiple
    genes, in multiple organs and in multiple species, including
    humans, as recently demonstrated by biopsy results from our
    Phase I clinical trial for ALN-VSP, as well as in the GEMINI
    trial for ALN-RSV01.

    We believe that we have continued to make considerable progress
    in developing our product platform. As part of these efforts and
    as documented in several key 2010 publications, during 2010, we
    continued to make further advances relating to the delivery of
    RNAi therapeutics, both internally and together with our

    Our progress has enabled us to advance a number of development
    programs for RNAi therapeutics that are administered directly to
    diseased tissues, including ALN-RSV01 and ALN-HTT. Our progress
    in achieving delivery of RNAi therapeutics through systemic RNAi
    has been demonstrated by Phase I data on our first systemically
    delivered RNAi therapeutic, ALN-VSP, for the treatment of liver
    cancers, and the initiation in 2010 of a Phase I clinical trial
    for ALN-TTR01, our second systemically delivered RNAi
    therapeutic, for the treatment of ATTR. ALN-VSP and ALN-TTR01
    both utilize a first-generation delivery technology developed by
    Tekmira Pharmaceuticals Corporation, or Tekmira. In parallel
    with ALN-TTR01, we are advancing ALN-TTR02 utilizing a
    second-generation LNP formulation, as well as ALN-PCS, for the
    treatment of severe hypercholesterolemia, and ALN-HPN, for the
    treatment of refractory anemia. We recognize, however, that
    challenges remain with respect to the development of RNAi-based
    therapeutics, including achieving effective delivery of siRNAs
    to target cells and tissues, and we therefore regard further
    development of our product platform as an ongoing priority.

    Our core product strategy is focused on the development and
    commercialization of innovative RNAi therapeutics for the
    treatment of genetically defined diseases. Under our core
    product strategy, we expect to progress five RNAi therapeutic
    programs into advanced stages of clinical development by the end
    of 2015. As part of this strategy, our goal is to develop
    product candidates with the following shared characteristics: a
    genetically defined target and disease; the potential to have a
    significant impact in high unmet need patient populations; the
    ability to leverage our existing RNAi delivery platform; the
    opportunity to monitor an early biomarker in Phase I clinical
    trials for human proof of concept; and the existence of
    clinically relevant endpoints for the filing of an NDA, with a
    focused patient database and possible accelerated paths for
    commercialization. We intend to commercialize products arising
    from this core product strategy on our own in the United States
    and potentially certain other countries, and we intend to enter
    into alliances to develop and commercialize any such products in
    other global territories. We are currently advancing three core
    programs in clinical or pre-clinical development: ALN-TTR for
    the treatment of ATTR; ALN-PCS for the treatment of severe
    hypercholesterolemia; and ALN-HPN for the treatment of
    refractory anemia. As part of our core product strategy, we also
    expect to designate and start pre-clinical development of two
    additional RNAi therapeutic candidates targeting genetically
    defined diseases by the end of 2011.

    ATTR occurs between the fourth and sixth decades of life, and
    the disease is often fatal within five to 15&#160;years of
    onset. In its severest form, ATTR represents a significant unmet

    However, less than 3,000 FAP patients qualify for this costly

    transplantation, the disease continues to progress for many of
    these patients, presumably due to normal TTR being deposited
    into preexisting fibrils. Moreover, there is a shortage of
    donors to provide healthy livers for transplantation. The only
    currently available treatments for FAC are aimed at relief of

    or CAD, is the leading cause of mortality in the United States,
    responsible for 40% of all deaths annually.
    Hypercholesterolemia, defined as a high level of LDL-c, or bad
    cholesterol, in the blood, is one of the major risk factors for
    CAD. This condition occurs when excess LDL-c in the bloodstream
    is deposited in the walls of blood vessels. The abnormal buildup
    of LDL-c forms clumps, or plaque, that narrow and harden artery
    walls. As the clumps grow, they can clog the arteries and
    restrict the flow of blood to the heart. The buildup of plaque
    in coronary arteries increases a person&#146;s risk of having a
    heart attack. Although current therapies are effective in many
    patients, studies have shown that as many as 45% of high-risk
    patients with elevated LDL-c do not achieve adequate control of
    their high cholesterol level with existing treatments, which
    include drugs known as statins. Currently, in the United States,
    there are more than 500,000&#160;patients with high cholesterol
    levels not controlled by the use of existing lipid lowering

    <B>Alnylam Program.</B>&#160;&#160;ALN-PCS is a systemically
    delivered RNAi therapeutic targeting PCSK9 for the treatment of
    severe hypercholesterolemia. We are advancing ALN-PCS using a
    second-generation LNP formulation for systemic delivery. ALN-PCS
    targets PCSK9, which is involved in the regulation of LDLR
    levels on hepatocytes and the metabolism of LDL-c. PCSK9 is a
    widely acknowledged target for the treatment of
    hypercholesterolemia. PCSK9 is a protein that is produced by the
    liver and circulates in the bloodstream. The liver determines
    cholesterol levels, in part by taking up or absorbing LDL-c from
    the bloodstream. PCSK9 reduces the liver&#146;s capacity to
    absorb LDL-c. Published studies indicate that, if PCSK9 activity
    could be reduced, the liver&#146;s uptake of LDL-c should
    increase and blood cholesterol levels should decrease. In fact,
    published case reports have shown individuals with a genetic
    mutation in PCSK9 that lowers its activity and results in
    increased liver LDL-c uptake and decreased blood cholesterol
    levels. In turn, these individuals have been shown to have a
    dramatically reduced risk of CAD, including myocardial
    infarction or heart attack. In addition, studies have shown that
    PCSK9 levels are increased by statin therapy while LDL-c levels
    are decreased, suggesting that the introduction of a PCSK9
    inhibitor to statin therapy may result in even further
    reductions in LDL-c levels.

    <B>Market Opportunity.</B>&#160;&#160;Anemia is the clinical
    manifestation of a decrease in circulating red blood cell mass
    and is usually detected by low blood hemoglobin concentrations.
    Symptoms include fatigue and dizziness, and generally have a
    significant impact on the patient&#146;s quality of life. Anemia
    of chronic disease, or ACD, occurs in patients with end-stage
    renal disease, or ESRD, cancer and chronic inflammatory
    disorders. There are also additional genetic causes, such as
    iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia. ACD patients who are
    refractory to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, or ESAs, which
    stimulate red blood cell production, and intravenous iron,
    define a condition of refractory anemia for which there is a
    substantial unmet need. Currently in the United States, there

    In July 2009, we and Cubist reported results from a Phase IIa
    clinical trial assessing the safety and tolerability of
    aerosolized ALN-RSV01 versus placebo in a randomized,
    double-blind trial of 24 adult lung transplant patients
    naturally infected with RSV. This clinical trial achieved its
    primary objective of demonstrating the safety and tolerability
    of ALN-RSV01. In particular, there were no drug-related serious
    adverse events or discontinuations. Baseline imbalances in day 0
    viral load and the time to symptom onset between the treatment
    groups made it difficult to interpret the trends favoring
    ALN-RSV01 observed in certain antiviral measures. The
    patient-reported symptom scores showed a trend towards reduced
    scores favoring ALN-RSV01. At the
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">90-day</FONT>
    endpoint, all patients survived and the incidence of intubation,
    new respiratory infection or acute rejection was comparable
    across ALN-RSV01 and placebo groups. The trial was not powered
    to demonstrate clinical outcomes due to the small sample size
    and, accordingly, such data were considered exploratory.
    Prospectively defined clinical secondary endpoints at
    90&#160;days included recovery of lung function (forced
    expiratory volume in the first second, or
    FEV<SUB style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-bottom">1</SUB>)
    as measured by spirometry and clinical determination of new or
    progressive BOS, a potentially life-threatening complication in
    lung transplant patients. Based on the data from this small
    trial, ALN-RSV01 treatment was associated with a statistically
    significant decrease in the total incidence of new or
    progressive BOS at 90&#160;days compared to placebo (p=0.02),
    with 50% of placebo patients showing new or progressive BOS as
    compared with only 7.1% of ALN-RSV01-treated patients. Despite
    the small patient numbers, we believe that these data may be
    important since the incidence of BOS following RSV infection in
    lung transplant patients can be a predictor of graft failure and
    overall survival. The incidence of BOS in lung transplant
    patients infected with RSV results in approximately 50%

    RNAi is an endogenous cellular enzymatic process whereby siRNAs
    mediate sequence-dependent cleavage of target mRNAs; cleavage of
    the target mRNA is highly precise, occurring exactly ten
    nucleotide positions from the 5&#146;-end of the siRNA antisense
    strand. 5&#146; RACE is a non-quantitative method that has been
    established to identify the specific cleavage product that would
    be indicative of the RNAi mechanism. As reported in a January
    2011 presentation, three patients in the Phase I clinical trial
    have had biopsies that were of sufficient quality to permit
    blinded 5&#146; RACE analysis for the VEGF target mRNA. All
    three biopsy samples were from the 0.4&#160;mg/kg dose group,
    and post-treatment biopsy samples were comprised of 80% to 100%
    normal liver. In two patients whose post-treatment biopsies were
    performed two days after dosing, the 5&#146; RACE assay combined
    with deep sequencing showed that approximately 27% and 29% of
    all VEGF-derived mRNA fragments corresponded exactly to the
    predicted RNAi-mediated cleavage product. By contrast, a
    pre-dose biopsy available for one of those patients contained
    only approximately one percent predicted VEGF cleavage product,
    and analysis of banked normal liver and tumor samples from
    untreated patients showed a background level of only 0.1% to
    0.7%. Compared to these low background levels, the amount of
    predicted VEGF cleavage product in the two post-treatment
    biopsies was highly statistically significant (p&#060;0.0001).
    In the third patient at 0.4&#160;mg/kg whose post-treatment
    biopsy was obtained seven days post-dose, there was no
    detectable increase in the predicted VEGF cleavage product
    compared to the pre-dose biopsy. We believe the 5&#146; RACE
    data from these two human biopsies provide clear evidence of
    RNAi in humans following systemic administration of
    LNP-formulated siRNA.

    progressive brain disease that results in uncontrolled
    movements, loss of intellectual faculties, emotional disturbance
    and premature death. HD patients typically first start to
    develop the disease in their third or fourth decade of life and
    have an average survival of ten to 20&#160;years after initial
    diagnosis. The disease is associated with the production of an
    altered form of a protein known as huntingtin, the presence of
    which is believed to trigger the death of important cells in the
    brain. This autosomal dominant, neurodegenerative disease
    afflicts approximately 30,000&#160;patients in the United
    States. An estimated 150,000 additional people in the United
    States carry the mutant huntingtin gene and have an approximate
    50% risk of developing the disease in their lifetimes.

    example, during 2009, we established Alnylam Biotherapeutics, an
    internal effort regarding the application of RNAi technologies
    to improve the manufacturing processes for biologics, an
    approach that has the potential to create new business
    opportunities. This effort is focused on applying RNAi
    technologies to the biologics marketplace, which includes
    recombinant proteins and monoclonal antibodies. In addition,
    during 2007, we and Isis formed Regulus to capitalize on our
    technology and intellectual property in the field of microRNA

    Regulus is exploring therapeutic opportunities that arise from
    microRNA dysregulation. Since microRNAs are believed to regulate
    broad networks of genes and biological pathways, microRNA
    therapeutics define a new and potentially high-impact strategy
    to target multiple nodes on disease pathways. microRNAs are
    small non-coding RNAs that regulate the expression of other
    genes. There are approximately 700 microRNAs that have been
    identified in the human genome, and these are believed to
    regulate the expression of up to 30% of all human genes. Since
    microRNAs may act as master regulators of the genome and are
    often found to be dysregulated in disease, microRNAs potentially
    represent an exciting new platform for drug discovery and
    development.

    Regulus is advancing microRNA therapeutics in several areas
    including fibrosis, hepatitis&#160;C virus, or HCV, infection,
    immuno-inflammatory diseases, metabolic and cardiovascular
    diseases, and oncology. Regulus&#146; lead program in fibrosis
    targets microRNA-21, or miR-21. Pre-clinical studies by Regulus
    scientists and collaborators have shown that anti-miR-21 can
    reverse fibrosis and significantly improve cardiac function in
    mice with failing hearts, and more recent studies have
    demonstrated similar therapeutic results in other models of
    fibrosis. Regulus is advancing anti-miR-21 to clinical studies
    for the treatment of fibrotic diseases. Regulus&#146; lead
    program for HCV infection is focused on microRNA-122, or
    miR-122. Regulus scientists and collaborators performed
    important studies demonstrating that anti-miR-122 can reduce
    cholesterol levels in blood and reverse hepatic steatosis, or
    fatty liver, in obese mice. More recent pre-clinical studies
    have shown that miR-122 is essential for replication of HCV.
    Together, these findings suggest that anti-miR-122 may both
    reduce HCV infection and improve HCV-associated pathologies like
    steatosis. Regulus is advancing anti-miR-122 to clinical studies
    for HCV. Regulus is also advancing additional programs towards
    clinical development, including programs targeting microRNA-155,
    or miR-155, for inflammatory diseases, microRNA-33, or miR-33,
    for cardiovascular disease, and microRNA-21, or miR-21, and
    microRNA-34, or miR-34, for the treatment of cancers.

    During 2009 and 2010, we presented data and advanced our efforts
    regarding the application of RNAi technologies to improve the
    manufacturing processes for biologics, including recombinant
    proteins and monoclonal antibodies. These applications of RNAi
    technology, which we are advancing in an internal effort
    referred to as Alnylam Biotherapeutics, have the potential to
    create new business opportunities. In particular, we are
    advancing RNAi technologies to improve the quantity and quality
    of biologics manufacturing processes using mammalian cell
    culture, such as Chinese hamster ovary, or CHO, cells. This RNAi
    technology potentially could be applied to the improvement of
    manufacturing processes for existing marketed drugs, new drugs
    in development and for the emerging biosimilars market. We have
    developed proprietary delivery lipids that enable the efficient
    delivery of siRNAs into CHO cells when grown in suspension
    culture, as well as other cell systems that are used for the
    manufacture of biologics. Studies have demonstrated that
    silencing certain target genes involved in certain CHO cell
    apoptotic and metabolic pathways resulted in improved cell
    viability as compared with untreated cells. Additional studies
    demonstrated the ability to target a viral infection of CHO
    cells and alter glycosylation pathways. During 2010, Alnylam
    Biotherapeutics formed two collaborations with leading
    biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. As Alnylam
    Biotherapeutics advances the technology, it plans to seek
    additional collaborations with established biologic
    manufacturers, selling licenses, products and services.

    We believe that no other company possesses a portfolio of such
    broad and exclusive rights to the patents and patent
    applications required for the commercialization of RNAi
    therapeutics. Our intellectual property estate for RNAi
    therapeutics includes over 1,800 active cases and over 700
    granted or issued patents, of which over 300 are issued or
    granted in the United States, the EU and Japan. Given the
    importance of our intellectual property portfolio to our
    business operations, we intend to vigorously enforce our rights
    and defend against challenges that have arisen or may arise in
    this area.

    In this category, we include United States and foreign patents
    and patent applications that claim key aspects of siRNA
    architecture and RNAi-related mechanisms. Specifically included
    are patents and patent applications covering targeted cleavage
    of mRNA directed by RNA-like oligonucleotides, dsRNAs of
    particular lengths and particular structural features, such as
    blunt <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">and/or</FONT>
    overhanging ends. Our strategy has been to secure exclusive
    rights where possible and appropriate to key patents and patent
    applications that we believe cover fundamental aspects of RNAi.
    The following table lists patents
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">and/or</FONT>

    regard as being fundamental for the use of siRNAs as
    therapeutics.

    Through our acquisition of Ribopharma AG, now known as Alnylam
    Europe, we own the entire Kreutzer-Limmer patent portfolio,
    which includes pending applications in the United States and
    many countries worldwide. The first patent to issue in the
    Kreutzer-Limmer series (EP 1144623)&#160;was granted in Europe
    in 2002, and specifically covered the use of small dsRNAs as
    therapeutics. This patent was revoked on appeal. The second
    European Kreutzer-Limmer patent (EP 1214945)&#160;to issue in
    the series was granted in Europe in 2005. This patent covers
    dsRNA structures of 15 to 49 successive nucleotide pairs in
    length. In January 2009, the Opposition Division of the European
    Patent Office, or EPO, ruled in favor of the opposing parties in
    an opposition proceeding related to the second Kreutzer-Limmer
    patent. We appealed this decision, and in May 2010, the Board of
    Appeals of the EPO ruled in our favor, rejecting the Opposition
    Division&#146;s ruling that the second Kreutzer-Limmer patent
    was invalid. The patent was sent back to the Opposition Division
    to address the remaining grounds asserted by the opponents. In
    December 2008, the EPO granted a third patent in the
    Kreutzer-Limmer series (EP 1550719). This patent covers
    therapeutic dsRNAs which are 15 to 21 consecutive nucleotide
    pairs in length. The third Kreutzer-Limmer patent has been
    opposed. In March 2010, the EPO issued a fourth patent in the
    Kreutzer-Limmer series (EP 1349927). This patent covers methods
    and medicaments having dsRNAs that are less than 25 nucleotides
    in length having a 3&#146; nucleotide overhang on the antisense
    strand which inhibit anti-apoptotic genes in tumor cells. This
    fourth Kreutzer-Limmer patent has also been opposed. We have
    also received grants for patents in the Kreutzer-Limmer series
    in several other countries, as reflected in the table above. The
    decision with respect to EP 1144623 will only affect the granted
    or pending claims of other members of the Kreutzer-Limmer patent
    series to the extent the same issue arises in the formal
    examination or post-grant review proceedings of the other
    members of the series. In the event this happens, we believe
    that the ruling in the EP 1144623 proceeding would be
    controlling.

    The Glover patent series has resulted in several patent grants,
    including in Europe (EP 1230375). The European Glover patent was
    revoked in June 2008 during opposition proceedings and our
    appeal of this decision is pending. Broad claims from this
    patent cover dsRNAs of any length or structure as mediators of
    RNAi in mammalian systems. We have an exclusive license to the

    We have filed a number of patent applications claiming specific
    siRNAs directed to various gene targets that correlate to
    specific diseases. While there may be a significant number of
    competing applications filed by other organizations claiming
    siRNAs to treat the same gene target, we were among the first
    companies to focus and file on RNAi therapeutics, and thus, we
    believe that a number of our patent applications may predate
    competing applications that others may have filed. Reflecting
    this, in August 2005, the EPO granted a broad patent, which we
    call the Kreutzer-Limmer&#160;II patent, with 103 allowed claims
    on therapeutic compositions, methods and uses comprising siRNAs
    that are complementary to mRNA sequences in over 125 disease
    target genes. In July 2009, the EPO ruled in our favor in an
    opposition proceeding related to the Kreutzer-Limmer&#160;II
    patent. The decision has been appealed by the opponents. The
    Kreutzer-Limmer&#160;II patent will expire on January&#160;9,
    2022, subject to any potential patent term extensions
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">and/or</FONT>

    extensions in countries where such extensions may become

    by our development and pre-clinical programs, such as those
    expressed by viral pathogens including RSV and influenza virus.
    In addition, the claimed targets include oncogenes, cytokines,
    cell adhesion receptors, angiogenesis targets, apoptosis and
    cell cycle targets, and additional viral disease targets, such
    as hepatitis&#160;C virus and HIV. The Kreutzer-Limmer&#160;II
    patent series is pending in the United States and many foreign
    countries. Moreover, a patent in the Tuschl&#160;II patent
    series, U.S.&#160;Patent No.&#160;7,078,196, claims methods of
    preparing siRNAs that mediate cleavage of an mRNA in mammalian
    cells and, therefore, covers methods of making siRNAs directed
    toward any and all target genes. We hold exclusive worldwide
    rights to these claims for RNAi therapeutics.

    As the field of RNAi therapeutics is maturing, patent
    applications are being fully processed by national patent
    offices around the world. There is uncertainty about which
    patents will issue, and, if they do, as to when, to whom, and
    with what claims. It is likely that there will be significant
    litigation and other proceedings, such as interference,
    reexamination and opposition proceedings, in various patent
    offices relating to patent rights in the RNAi field. For
    example, as noted above, various third parties have initiated
    oppositions to patents in our Kreutzer-Limmer and Tuschl&#160;II
    series in the EPO, as well as in other jurisdictions. We expect
    that additional oppositions will be filed in the EPO and
    elsewhere, and other challenges will be raised relating to other
    patents and patent applications in our portfolio. In many cases,
    the possibility of appeal exists for either us or our opponents,
    and it may be years before final, unappealable rulings are made
    with respect to these patents in certain jurisdictions. Given
    the importance of our intellectual property portfolio to our
    business operations, we intend to vigorously enforce our rights
    and defend against challenges that have arisen or may arise in

    The complaint seeks, among other things, a declaratory judgment
    regarding the prosecution of the Tuschl I patent family and
    unspecified monetary damages. In August 2009, Whitehead and
    UMass filed counterclaims against us and Max Planck, including
    for breach of contract. In January 2010, we and Max Planck filed
    an amended complaint expanding upon the allegations in the

    In addition, in September 2009, the USPTO granted Max
    Planck&#146;s petition to revoke power of attorney in connection
    with the prosecution of the Tuschl I patent application. This
    action prevents the defendants from filing any papers with the
    USPTO in connection with further prosecution of the Tuschl I
    patent application without the agreement of Max Planck.
    Whitehead&#146;s petition to overturn this ruling was denied.
    Prosecution before the USPTO for both the Tuschl I and&#160;II
    pending patent applications was suspended pursuant to a
    standstill agreement. This agreement expired on
    September&#160;15, 2010, and Max Planck, MIT, Whitehead and

    institution to contribute intellectual property to the pool. In
    addition, in 2010, South Africa&#146;s Technology Innovation
    Agency, or TIA, became the first government agency to join in

    Antisense technology uses short, single-stranded, DNA-like
    molecules to block mRNAs encoding specific proteins. An
    antisense oligonucleotide, or ASO, contains a sequence of bases
    complementary to a sequence within its target mRNA, enabling it
    to attach to the mRNA by base-pairing. The attachment of the ASO
    may lead to breakdown of the mRNA, or may physically block the
    mRNA from associating with the protein synthesis machinery of
    the cell. In either case, production of the protein encoded by
    the mRNA may be reduced. Typically, the backbone of an ASO, the
    linkages that hold its constituent bases together, will carry a
    number of chemical modifications that do not exist in naturally
    occurring DNA. These modifications are intended to improve the
    stability and pharmaceutical properties of the ASO.

    While we believe that RNAi drugs may potentially have
    significant advantages over ASOs, including greater potency and
    specificity, others are developing ASO drugs that are currently
    at a more advanced stage of development than RNAi drugs. For
    example, Isis has developed an ASO drug,
    Vitravene<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP>,

    which is currently on the market, and has several ASO product
    candidates in clinical trials, including mipomersen, which is a
    lipid-lowering drug being developed by Isis in collaboration
    with Genzyme Corporation, or Genzyme. In addition, a number of
    other companies have product candidates in various stages of
    pre-clinical and clinical development. Included in these
    companies are Santaris, Genta Incorporated and AVI BioPharma,
    Inc. Because of their later stage of development, ASOs, rather
    than siRNAs, may become the preferred technology for drugs that
    target mRNAs in order to turn off the activity of specific genes.

    Currently, liver transplantation is the only available treatment
    option for FAP. However, only a subset of FAP patients qualify
    for this costly and invasive procedure and, even following liver
    transplantation, the disease continues to progress for many
    patients, presumably due to normal TTR being deposited into
    preexisting fibrils. Moreover, there is a shortage of donors to
    provide healthy livers for transplantation. The only currently
    available treatments for FAC are aimed at relief of symptoms,
    such as diuretics, or water pills, to treat the swelling of the
    ankles, one of the symptoms of FAC. There are no existing
    disease-modifying treatments to address ATTR.

    There are a few drugs in clinical development for the treatment
    of ATTR. In 2010, FoldRx, a wholly owned subsidiary of Pfizer,
    filed a MAA with the EMA for tafamidis, an oral small molecule
    stabilizer of TTR. Tafamidis has orphan drug status in the EU
    for the treatment of FAP associated with ATTR. Tafamidis is
    intended to stabilize wild-type and variant TTR, prevent
    misfolding and inhibit the formation of TTR amyloid fibrils. In
    clinical trials in patients suffering from FAP, tafamidis was
    found to delay disease progression, reduce the burden of disease
    after 18&#160;months compared to placebo, and appeared to be
    safe and well tolerated. Researchers at Boston University, in
    collaboration with the National Institute of Neurological
    Disorders and Stroke, are currently conducting a Phase II/III
    clinical trial of diflunisal for the treatment of FAP.

    subpopulation for which the drug is shown to be safe and
    effective. In some circumstances, the FDA may grant deferrals
    for the submission of some or all pediatric data, or full or
    partial waivers. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is
    substantial. Under federal law, NDAs are subject to substantial
    application user fees and the sponsor of an approved NDA is also
    subject to annual product and establishment user fees.

    The FDA has 60&#160;days from its receipt of an NDA to determine
    whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the
    agency&#146;s threshold determination that the NDA is
    sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the
    submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth
    review of the NDA. The review process is often significantly
    extended by FDA requests for additional information or
    clarification regarding information already provided in the
    submission. The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug
    products or drug products that present difficult questions of
    safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel
    that includes clinicians and other experts, for review,
    evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application
    should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation
    of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such
    recommendations. The FDA normally also will conduct a
    pre-approval inspection to ensure the manufacturing facility,
    methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug&#146;s
    identity, strength, quality, purity and stability, and are in
    compliance with regulations governing cGMPs. In addition, the
    FDA often will conduct a bioresearch monitoring inspection of
    the clinical trial sites involved in conducting pivotal studies
    to ensure data integrity and compliance with applicable GCP
    requirements.

    If the FDA evaluation of the NDA and the inspection of
    manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA may issue an
    approval letter, which authorizes commercial marketing of the
    drug with specific prescribing information for a specific
    indication. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require
    post-approval testing, including Phase&#160;IV trials, and
    surveillance to monitor the drug&#146;s safety or efficacy and
    may impose other conditions, including labeling restrictions,
    which can materially impact the potential market and

    distribution and use restrictions and other limitations on

    While we believe that any RNAi therapeutic we develop will be
    regulated as a new drug under the Federal Food, Drug, and
    Cosmetic Act, the FDA could decide to regulate certain RNAi
    therapeutic products as biologics under the Public Health
    Service Act. Biologics must have a biologics license
    application, or BLA, approved prior to commercialization. Like
    NDAs, BLAs are subject to user fees. To obtain BLA approval, an
    applicant must provide non-clinical and clinical evidence and
    other information to demonstrate that the biologic product is
    safe, pure and potent, and like NDAs, must complete clinical
    trials that are typically conducted in three sequential phases
    (Phase&#160;I,&#160;II and III). Additionally, the applicant
    must demonstrate that the facilities in which the product is
    manufactured, processed, packaged or held meet standards,
    including cGMPs and any additional standards in the license
    designed to ensure its continued safety, purity and potency.
    Biologics establishments are subject to pre-approval
    inspections. The review process for BLAs is also time consuming
    and uncertain, and BLA approval may be conditioned on
    post-approval testing and surveillance and subject to
    distribution and use restrictions, or other limitations, through
    a REMS plan. Once granted, BLA approvals may be suspended or
    revoked under certain circumstances, such as if the product

    be made about prescription drug products and biologics. In
    particular, a drug or biologic may not be promoted for uses that
    are not approved by the FDA as reflected in the product&#146;s
    approved labeling. In addition, the FDA requires substantiation

    Once an NDA is approved, the product covered thereby becomes a
    listed drug that can, in turn, be relied upon by potential
    competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug
    application, or ANDA, or 505(b)(2) application upon expiration
    of relevant patents and non-patent exclusivity periods, if any.
    An approved ANDA generally provides for marketing of a drug
    product that has the same active ingredients in the same
    strength, dosage form and route of administration as the listed
    drug and has been shown through appropriate testing (unless
    waived) to be bioequivalent to the listed drug. There is no
    requirement, other than the requirement for bioequivalence
    testing (which may be waived by the FDA), for an ANDA applicant
    to conduct or submit results of non-clinical or clinical tests
    to prove the safety or effectiveness of its drug product. Drugs
    approved in this way are commonly referred to as generic
    equivalents to the listed drug, are listed as such by the FDA
    and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions
    written for the original listed drug. A 505(b)(2) application is
    a type of NDA that relies, in part, upon data the applicant does
    not own and to which it does not have a right of reference. Such
    applications typically are submitted for changes to previously
    approved drug products.

    Federal law provides for a period of three years of exclusivity
    following approval of a listed drug that contains previously
    approved active ingredients but is approved in, among other
    things, a new dosage, dosage form, route of administration or
    combination, or for a new use, if the FDA determines that new
    clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies,
    that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are essential
    to the approval of the application. This three-year exclusivity
    covers only the conditions of use associated with the new
    clinical investigations and, as a general matter, does not
    prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) applications
    for generic versions of the original, unmodified drug product.
    Federal law also provides a period of up to five years
    exclusivity following approval of a drug containing no
    previously approved active moiety, which is the molecule or ion
    responsible for the action of the drug substance, during which
    ANDAs and 505(b)(2) applications referencing the protected
    listed drug cannot be submitted unless the submission
    accompanies a challenge to a listed patent, in which case the
    submission may be made four years following the original product
    approval. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay
    the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant
    submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a

    Additionally, in the event that the sponsor of the listed drug
    has properly informed the FDA of patents covering its listed
    drug, applicants submitting an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application
    referencing the listed drug are required to make one of four
    patent certifications, including certifying the applicant&#146;s
    belief that one or more listed patents are invalid,
    unenforceable, or not infringed. If an applicant certifies
    invalidity, unenforceability, or non-infringement, it is
    required to provide notice of its filing to the NDA sponsor and
    the patent holder within certain time limits. If the patent
    holder then initiates a suit for patent infringement against the
    ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant within 45&#160;days of receipt of
    the notice, the FDA cannot grant effective approval of the ANDA
    or 505(b)(2) application until either 30&#160;months have passed
    or there has been a court decision or settlement order holding
    or stating that the patents in question are invalid,
    unenforceable or not infringed. If the patent holder does not
    initiate a suit for patent infringement within the 45&#160;days,
    the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application may be approved immediately
    upon successful completion of FDA review, unless blocked by a
    regulatory exclusivity period. If the ANDA or 505(b)(2)
    applicant certifies that it does not intend to market its
    generic product before some or all listed patents on the listed
    drug expire, then the FDA cannot grant effective approval of the
    ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until those patents expire. The
    first of the ANDA applicants submitting substantially complete
    applications certifying that one or more listed patents for a
    particular product are invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed
    may qualify for an exclusivity period of 180&#160;days running
    from when the generic product is first marketed, during which
    subsequently submitted ANDAs containing similar certifications
    cannot be granted effective approval. The
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">180-day</FONT>
    generic exclusivity can be forfeited in various ways, including
    if the first applicant does not market its product within
    specified statutory timelines. If more than one applicant files
    a substantially complete ANDA on the same day, each such first
    applicant will be entitled to share the
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">180-day</FONT>

    Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug
    designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or

    affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or
    more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which
    there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing
    and making available in the United States a drug for this type
    of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the
    United States for that drug. Orphan drug designation must be
    requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan
    drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its
    potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA.

    If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently

    exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other
    applications, including a full BLA, to market the same drug for
    the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for
    seven years. For purposes of small molecule drugs, the FDA
    defines &#147;same drug&#148; as a drug that contains the same
    active moiety and is intended for the same use as the previously
    approved orphan drug. For purposes of large molecule drugs, the
    FDA defines &#147;same drug&#148; as a drug that contains the
    same principal molecular structural features, but not
    necessarily all of the same structural features, and is intended
    for the same use as the drug in question. Notwithstanding the
    above definitions, a drug that is clinically superior to an
    orphan drug will not be considered the &#147;same drug&#148; and
    thus will not be blocked by orphan drug exclusivity.

    Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and
    reimbursement status of any drug products for which we obtain
    regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other
    countries, sales of any products for which we may receive
    regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on
    the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors.
    Third-party payors include government health administrative
    authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and
    other organizations. The process for determining whether a payor
    will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from
    the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the
    payor will pay for the drug product. Third-party payors may
    limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or
    formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs
    for a particular indication. These third-party payors are
    increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical
    necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and
    services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In addition,
    significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of
    newly approved healthcare product candidates. We may need to

    does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be

    Federal, state and local governments in the United States
    continue to consider legislation to limit the growth of
    healthcare costs, including the cost of prescription drugs.
    Future legislation could limit payments for pharmaceuticals such
    as the drug candidates that we are developing.

    Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other
    countries. In the EU, governments influence the price of
    pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement
    rules and control of national health care systems that fund a
    large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some
    jurisdictions operate systems under which products may be
    marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. To
    obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these
    countries may require the completion of clinical trials that
    compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate
    to currently available therapies. Other member states allow
    companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and
    control company profits. The downward pressure on health care
    costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become
    very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being
    erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some
    countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert
    competitive pressure that may reduce pricing within a country.

    The marketability of any products for which we receive
    regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the
    government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate
    coverage and reimbursement. In addition, an increasing emphasis
    on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect
    will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical
    pricing. Coverage policies, third-party reimbursement rates and
    pharmaceutical pricing regulations may change at any time. In
    particular, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or
    PPACA, and a related reconciliation bill were enacted in the
    United States in March 2010, and contain provisions that may
    reduce the profitability of pharmaceutical products, including,
    for example, increased rebates for drugs sold to Medicaid
    programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care
    plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part&#160;D
    beneficiaries, and annual fees based on pharmaceutical
    companies&#146; share of sales to federal health care programs.
    Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained
    for one or more products for which we receive regulatory
    approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement
    rates may be implemented in the future.

    We have concentrated our efforts and therapeutic product
    research on RNAi technology, and our future success depends on
    the successful development of this technology and products based
    on it. Neither we nor any other company has received regulatory
    approval to market therapeutics utilizing siRNAs, the class of
    molecule we are trying to develop into drugs. The scientific
    discoveries that form the basis for our efforts to discover and
    develop new drugs are relatively new. The scientific evidence to
    support the feasibility of developing drugs based on these
    discoveries is both preliminary and limited. Skepticism as to
    the feasibility of developing RNAi therapeutics has been
    expressed in scientific literature. For example, there are
    potential challenges to achieving safe RNAi therapeutics based
    on the so-called off-target effects and activation of the
    interferon response. In addition,

    Relatively few product candidates based on these discoveries
    have ever been tested in animals or humans. siRNAs may not
    naturally possess the inherent properties typically required of
    drugs, such as the ability to be stable in the body long enough
    to reach the tissues in which their effects are required, nor
    the ability to enter cells within these tissues in order to
    exert their effects. We currently have only limited data, and no
    conclusive evidence, to suggest that we can introduce these
    drug-like properties into siRNAs. We may spend large amounts of
    money trying to introduce these properties, and may never
    succeed in doing so. In addition, these compounds may not
    demonstrate in patients the chemical and pharmacological
    properties ascribed to them in laboratory studies, and they may
    interact with human biological systems in unforeseen,
    ineffective or harmful ways. As a result, we may never succeed
    in developing a marketable product, we may not become profitable
    and the value of our common stock will decline.

    Further, our focus solely on RNAi technology for developing
    drugs, as opposed to multiple, more proven technologies for drug
    development, increases the risks associated with the ownership
    of our common stock. If we are not successful in developing a
    product candidate using RNAi technology, we may be required to
    change the scope and direction of our product development

    Even if our estimates are correct, we will be required to seek
    additional funding in the future and intend to do so through
    either collaborative arrangements, public or private equity
    offerings or debt financings, or a combination of one or more of
    these funding sources. Additional funds may not be available to
    us on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, the terms of any
    financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our
    stockholders. For example, if we raise additional funds by
    issuing equity securities, further dilution to our stockholders
    will result. In addition, as a condition to providing additional
    funds to us, future investors may demand, and may be granted,
    rights superior to those of existing stockholders. In addition,
    our investor rights agreement with Novartis provides Novartis
    with the right generally to maintain its ownership percentage in
    us and our common stock purchase agreement with Roche contains a
    similar provision, subject to certain exceptions. These rights
    continue until the earlier of any sale by Novartis or Roche of
    shares of our common stock and the expiration or termination of
    our license agreements with each of them, subject to certain
    exceptions. Pursuant to the terms of its investor rights
    agreement with us, Novartis purchased an aggregate of
    335,033&#160;shares of our common stock, resulting in aggregate
    payments to us of $7.6&#160;million. These purchases allowed
    Novartis to maintain its ownership position of approximately
    13.4% of our outstanding common stock. While the exercise of
    these rights by Novartis has provided us with an aggregate of
    $7.6&#160;million in cash, and the exercise in the future by
    Novartis or Roche may provide us with additional funding under
    some circumstances, these exercises have caused, and any future
    exercise of these rights by Novartis or Roche will also cause
    further, dilution to our stockholders. Debt financing, if
    available, may involve restrictive covenants that could limit
    our flexibility in conducting future business activities and, in
    the event of insolvency, would be paid before holders of equity
    securities received any distribution of corporate assets. If we
    are unable to obtain funding on a timely basis, we may be
    required to significantly curtail one or more of our research or
    development programs or undergo additional reductions in our
    workforce or other corporate restructuring activities. We also
    could be required to seek funds through arrangements with
    collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish rights
    to some of our technologies, product candidates or products that
    we would otherwise pursue on our own.

    In addition, we believe that other companies are expending
    substantial resources in developing safe and effective means of
    delivering siRNAs to relevant cell and tissue types.
    Accordingly, we have entered into alliances with other companies
    and collaborators that we believe can provide such capabilities,
    and we intend to enter into additional alliances in the future.
    For example, we intend to enter into (1)&#160;non-exclusive
    platform
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">and/or</FONT>
    multi-target discovery alliances which will enable our

    marketing, sales and distribution. For example, under our
    collaboration with Medtronic, we are jointly developing ALN-HTT,
    an RNAi therapeutic for HD, which would be delivered using an
    implanted infusion device developed by Medtronic. The success of
    this collaboration will depend, in part, on Medtronic&#146;s
    expertise in the area of delivery of drugs by infusion device,
    something that they have never done before with our product
    candidates. In other alliances, we may expect our collaborators
    to develop, market and sell certain of our product candidates.
    We may have limited or no control over the development, sales,
    marketing and distribution activities of these third parties.
    Our future revenues may depend heavily on the success of the
    efforts of these third parties. For example, we will rely
    entirely on Kyowa Hakko Kirin for development and
    commercialization of any RNAi products for the treatment of RSV
    in Asia. If Kyowa Hakko Kirin is not successful in its

    Before obtaining regulatory approval for the commercial
    distribution of our product candidates, we must conduct, at our
    own expense, extensive pre-clinical tests and clinical trials to
    demonstrate the safety and efficacy in humans of our product
    candidates. Pre-clinical and clinical testing is expensive,
    difficult to design and implement, can take many years to
    complete and is uncertain as to outcome, and the historical
    failure rate for product candidates is high. We currently have
    several programs in clinical development. We are developing
    ALN-RSV01 for the treatment of RSV infection. In January 2008,
    we completed our GEMINI study, a Phase&#160;II clinical trial
    designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and anti-viral
    activity of ALN-RSV01 in adult subjects experimentally infected
    with RSV. During 2009, we completed a Phase IIa clinical trial
    assessing the safety and tolerability of ALN-RSV01 in adult lung
    transplant patients naturally infected with RSV. In February
    2010, we initiated a Phase IIb clinical trial to evaluate the
    clinical efficacy endpoints as well as safety of aerosolized
    ALN-RSV01 in adult lung transplant patients naturally infected
    with RSV. The objective of this Phase IIb clinical trial is to
    repeat and extend the clinical results observed in the Phase IIa
    clinical trial. In addition, in March 2009, we initiated a Phase
    I clinical trial of ALN-VSP, our first systemically delivered
    RNAi therapeutic. We are developing ALN-VSP for the treatment of
    primary and secondary liver cancer. In July 2010, we also
    initiated a Phase I clinical trial for ALN-TTR01, our second
    systemically delivered RNAi therapeutic, which targets the TTR
    gene for the treatment of ATTR. However, we may not be able to
    further advance these or any other product candidate through
    clinical trials.

    If we enter into clinical trials, the results from pre-clinical
    testing or early clinical trials of a product candidate may not
    predict the results that will be obtained in subsequent human
    clinical trials of that product candidate or any other product
    candidate. For example, ALN-RSV01 may not demonstrate the same
    results in the Phase IIb clinical trial as it did in our Phase
    IIa clinical trial. In addition, ALN-VSP, ALN-TTR01, and our
    other systemically delivered therapeutics, such as ALN-PCS,
    employ novel delivery formulations that have yet to be
    extensively evaluated in human clinical trials and proven safe
    and effective. We, the FDA or other applicable regulatory
    authorities, or an institutional review board, or IRB, or
    similar foreign review board or committee, may suspend clinical
    trials of a product candidate at any time for various reasons,
    including if we or they believe the subjects or patients
    participating in such trials are being exposed to unacceptable
    health risks. Among other reasons, adverse side effects of a
    product candidate on subjects or patients in a clinical trial
    could result in the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities
    suspending or terminating the trial and refusing to approve a
    particular product candidate for any or all indications of use.

    Clinical trials of a new product candidate require the
    enrollment of a sufficient number of patients, including
    patients who are suffering from the disease the product
    candidate is intended to treat and who meet other eligibility
    criteria. Rates of patient enrollment are affected by many
    factors, including the size of the patient population, the age
    and condition of the patients, the stage and severity of
    disease, the nature of the protocol, the proximity of patients
    to clinical sites, the availability of effective treatments for
    the relevant disease, the seasonality of infections and the
    eligibility criteria for the clinical trial. In our ALN-VSP
    clinical trial, one patient with advanced pancreatic
    neuroendocrine cancer with extensive involvement of the liver
    developed hepatic failure five days following the second dose of
    ALN-VSP and subsequently died; this was deemed possibly related
    to the study drug. Six additional patients treated at the same
    dose did not exhibit any evidence of hepatotoxicity. The trial
    has not yet reached a maximum tolerated dose and is continuing
    patient enrollment with dose escalation. Delays in patient
    enrollment or difficulties retaining trial participants can
    result in increased costs, longer development times or
    termination of a clinical trial.

    Some product candidates that we develop may need to be
    administered using specialized drug delivery devices that
    deliver RNAi therapeutics directly to diseased parts of the
    body. For example, we believe that product candidates we develop
    for HD, Parkinson&#146;s disease or other central nervous system
    diseases may need to be administered using such a device. For
    neurodegenerative diseases, we have entered into a collaboration
    agreement with Medtronic to pursue potential development of
    drug-device combinations incorporating RNAi therapeutics. We may
    not achieve successful development results under this
    collaboration and may need to seek other collaborations to
    develop alternative drug delivery systems, or utilize existing
    drug delivery systems, for the direct delivery of RNAi
    therapeutics for these diseases. While we expect to rely on drug
    delivery systems that have been approved by the FDA or other
    regulatory agencies to deliver drugs like ours to diseased parts
    of the body, we, or our collaborator, may need to modify the
    design or labeling of such delivery device for some products we
    may develop. In such an event, the FDA may regulate the product
    as a combination product or require additional approvals or
    clearances for the modified delivery device. Further, to the
    extent the specialized delivery device is owned by another
    company, we would need that company&#146;s cooperation to
    implement the necessary changes to the device, or its labeling,
    and to obtain any additional approvals or clearances. In cases
    where we do not have an ongoing collaboration with the company
    that makes the device, obtaining such additional approvals or
    clearances and the cooperation of such other company could
    significantly delay and increase the cost of obtaining marketing
    approval, which could reduce the commercial viability of our
    product candidate. In addition, the use of a specialized
    delivery system, even if previously approved, could complicate
    the design or analysis of clinical trials for our RNAi
    therapeutics. In summary, we may be unable to find, or
    experience delays in finding, suitable drug delivery systems to
    administer RNAi therapeutics directly to diseased parts of the

    commercialize these RNAi therapeutics.

    We have very limited experience in conducting and managing the

    including approval by the FDA. The time required to obtain FDA

    years following the commencement of clinical trials, depending

    The regulations that govern marketing approvals, pricing and
    reimbursement for new drugs vary widely from country to country.
    Some countries require approval of the sale price of a drug
    before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review
    period begins after marketing or product licensing approval is
    granted. In some foreign markets, prescription pharmaceutical
    pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even
    after initial approval is granted. Although we intend to monitor
    these regulations, our programs are currently in the early
    stages of development and we will not be able to assess the
    impact of price regulations for a number of years. As a result,
    we might obtain regulatory approval for a product in a
    particular country, but then be subject to price regulations
    that delay our commercial launch of the product and negatively
    impact the revenues we are able to generate from the sale of the
    product in that country.

    reimburse patients, such as government and private insurance
    plans, are requiring that drug companies provide them with
    predetermined discounts from list prices, and are seeking to

    There may be significant delays in obtaining coverage for
    newly-approved drugs, and coverage may be more limited than the
    purposes for which the drug is approved by the FDA. Moreover,
    eligibility for coverage does not imply that any drug will be
    reimbursed in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs,
    including research, development, manufacture, sale and
    distribution. Interim payments for new drugs, if applicable, may
    also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may not be made
    permanent. Reimbursement may be based on payments allowed for
    lower-cost drugs that are already reimbursed, may be
    incorporated into existing payments for other services and may
    reflect budgetary constraints or imperfections in Medicare data.
    Net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or
    rebates required by government healthcare programs or private
    payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently
    restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold
    at lower prices than in the United States. Third-party payors
    often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations
    in setting their own reimbursement rates. Our inability to
    promptly obtain coverage and profitable reimbursement rates from
    both government-funded and private payors for new drugs that we
    develop and for which we obtain regulatory approval could have a
    material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to
    raise capital needed to commercialize products, and our overall

    condition of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies. A
    number of legislative and regulatory changes in the healthcare
    system in the United States and other major healthcare markets
    have been proposed in recent years, and such efforts have
    expanded substantially in recent years. These developments have
    included prescription drug benefit legislation that was enacted
    and took effect in January 2006, healthcare reform legislation
    recently enacted by certain states, and major healthcare reform
    legislation that was passed by Congress and enacted into law in
    the United States in 2010. These developments could, directly or
    indirectly, affect our ability to sell our products, if
    approved, at a favorable price.

    In particular, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and
    Affordable Care Act, or PPACA, and a related reconciliation bill
    were signed into law. This new legislation changes the current
    system of healthcare insurance and benefits intended to broaden
    coverage and control costs. The new law also contains provisions
    that will affect companies in the pharmaceutical industry and
    other healthcare related industries by imposing additional costs

    and other countries, so that we can prevent others from

    However, we may not hold proprietary rights to some patents

    over those applications. For this and other reasons, we may be

    under third-party patents to market our proposed products or
    conduct our research and development or other activities. If

    Our strategy depends on our ability to rapidly identify and seek
    patent protection for our discoveries. In addition, we may rely
    on third-party collaborators to file patent applications
    relating to proprietary technology that we develop jointly

    protection is expensive and time-consuming. If our present or

    patent will survive a validity challenge or be held enforceable.
    Any patents we have obtained, or obtain in the future, may be
    challenged, invalidated, adjudged unenforceable or circumvented

    In June 2009, we joined with Max Planck in taking legal action
    against Whitehead, MIT and UMass. The complaint, initially filed
    in the Suffolk County Superior Court in Boston, Massachusetts

    the Tuschl&#160;II patent applications into the Tuschl I patent
    applications, thereby potentially damaging the value of

    The complaint seeks, among other things, a declaratory judgment

    unspecified monetary damages. In August 2009, Whitehead and
    UMass filed counterclaims against us and Max Planck, including
    for breach of contract. In January 2010, we and Max Planck filed
    an amended complaint expanding upon the allegations in the
    original complaint. We currently expect a jury trial to start in
    March 2011. In February 2010, we and Max Planck released MIT

    In addition, in September 2009, the USPTO granted Max

    USPTO in connection with further prosecution of the Tuschl I

    Whitehead&#146;s petition to overturn this ruling was denied.
    Prosecution before the USPTO for both the Tuschl I and&#160;II

    RNAi is a relatively new scientific field, the commercial
    exploitation of which has resulted in many different patents and
    patent applications from organizations and individuals seeking
    to obtain patent protection in the field. We have obtained
    grants and issuances of RNAi patents and have licensed many of
    these patents from third parties on an exclusive basis. The
    issued patents and pending patent applications in the United
    States and in key markets around the world that we own or
    license claim many different methods, compositions and processes
    relating to the discovery, development, manufacture and
    commercialization of RNAi therapeutics.

    Specifically, we have a portfolio of patents, patent
    applications and other intellectual property covering:
    fundamental aspects of the structure and uses of siRNAs,
    including their manufacture and use as therapeutics, and
    RNAi-related mechanisms; chemical modifications to siRNAs that
    improve their suitability for therapeutic uses; siRNAs directed
    to specific targets as treatments for particular diseases; and
    delivery technologies, such as in the field of cationic
    liposomes.

    As the field of RNAi therapeutics is maturing, patent
    applications are being fully processed by national patent
    offices around the world. There is uncertainty about which
    patents will issue, and, if they do, as to when, to whom, and
    with what claims. It is likely that there will be significant
    litigation and other proceedings, such as interference,
    reexamination and opposition proceedings, in various patent
    offices relating to patent rights in the RNAi field. For
    example, various third parties have initiated oppositions to
    patents in our Kreutzer-Limmer and Tuschl&#160;II series in the
    EPO and in other jurisdictions. We expect that additional
    oppositions will be filed in the EPO and elsewhere, and other
    challenges will be raised relating to other patents and patent
    applications in our portfolio. In many cases, the possibility of
    appeal exists for either us or our opponents, and it may be
    years before final, unappealable rulings are made with respect
    to these patents in certain jurisdictions. The timing and
    outcome of these and other proceedings is uncertain and may
    adversely affect our business if we are not successful in
    defending the patentability and scope of our pending and issued
    patent claims. In addition, third parties may attempt to
    invalidate our intellectual property rights. Even if our rights
    are not directly challenged, disputes could lead to the
    weakening of our intellectual property rights. Our defense
    against any attempt by third parties to circumvent or invalidate
    our intellectual property rights could be costly to us, could
    require significant time and attention of our management and
    could have a material adverse effect on our business and our
    ability to successfully compete in the field of RNAi.

    There are many issued and pending patents that claim aspects of
    oligonucleotide chemistry that we may need to apply to our siRNA
    therapeutic candidates. There are also many issued patents that
    claim targeting genes or portions of genes that may be relevant
    for siRNA drugs we wish to develop. Thus, it is possible that
    one or more organizations will hold patent rights to which we
    will need a license. If those organizations refuse to grant us a

    able to market products or perform research and development or

    any damages we might have to pay, a court could require us to
    stop the infringing activity or obtain a license. Any license
    required under any patent may not be made available on
    commercially acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, such
    licenses are likely to be non-exclusive and, therefore, our
    competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to

    licenses to Isis, GeneCare, Benitec, Calando, Tekmira, Quark and
    others under which these companies may independently develop
    RNAi therapeutics against a limited number of targets. Any of
    these companies may develop its RNAi technology more rapidly and
    more effectively than us. Merck, was one of our collaborators
    and a licensee under our intellectual property for specified
    disease targets until September 2007, at which time we and Merck
    agreed to terminate our collaboration. As a result of its
    acquisition of Sirna in December 2006, and in light of the
    mutual termination of our collaboration, Merck, which has
    substantially more resources and experience in developing drugs
    than we do, may become a direct competitor.

    In addition, as a result of agreements that we have entered
    into, Roche and Takeda have obtained non-exclusive licenses, and
    Novartis has obtained specific exclusive licenses for 31 gene
    targets, to certain aspects of our technology that give them the
    right to compete with us in certain circumstances.

    We also compete with companies working to develop
    antisense-based drugs. Like RNAi therapeutics, antisense drugs
    target messenger RNAs, or mRNAs, in order to suppress the
    activity of specific genes. Isis is currently marketing an
    antisense drug and has several antisense product candidates in
    clinical trials. The development of antisense drugs is more
    advanced than that of RNAi therapeutics, and antisense
    technology may become the preferred technology for drugs that
    target mRNAs to silence specific genes.

    In addition to competition with respect to RNAi and with respect

    to deliver siRNAs to the relevant cell and tissue types may be
    developed by our competitors, and our ability to successfully
    commercialize a competitive product would be adversely affected.
    In addition, substantial resources are being expended by third
    parties in the effort to discover and develop a safe and
    effective means of delivering siRNAs into the relevant cell and
    tissue types, both in academic laboratories and in the corporate
    sector. Some of our competitors have substantially greater
    resources than we do, and if our competitors are able to
    negotiate exclusive access to those delivery solutions developed
    by third parties, we may be unable to successfully commercialize

    In June 2009, we joined with Max Planck in taking legal action
    against Whitehead, MIT and UMass. The complaint, initially filed
    in the Suffolk County Superior Court in Boston, Massachusetts
    and subsequently removed to the U.S.&#160;District Court for the
    District of Massachusetts, alleges, among other things, that the
    defendants have improperly prosecuted the Tuschl I patent
    applications and wrongfully incorporated inventions covered by
    the Tuschl&#160;II patent applications into the Tuschl I patent
    applications, thereby potentially damaging the value of
    inventions reflected in the Tuschl I and Tuschl&#160;II patent
    applications. In the field of RNAi therapeutics, we are the
    exclusive licensee of the Tuschl I patent applications from Max
    Planck, MIT and Whitehead, and of the Tuschl&#160;II patent
    applications from Max Planck.

    The complaint seeks, among other things, a declaratory judgment
    regarding the prosecution of the Tuschl I patent family and
    unspecified monetary damages. In August 2009, Whitehead and
    UMass filed counterclaims against us and Max Planck, including
    for breach of contract. In January 2010, we and Max Planck filed
    an amended complaint expanding upon the allegations in the
    original complaint. We currently expect a jury trial to start in
    March 2011. In February 2010, we and Max Planck released MIT
    from any claims seeking monetary damages, and MIT has stipulated
    that it will be bound by any declaratory, injunctive, or
    equitable relief granted by the court.

    In addition, in September 2009, the USPTO granted Max
    Planck&#146;s petition to revoke power of attorney in connection
    with the prosecution of the Tuschl I patent application. This
    action prevents the defendants from filing any papers with the
    USPTO in connection with further prosecution of the Tuschl I
    patent application without the agreement of Max Planck.
    Whitehead&#146;s petition to overturn this ruling was denied.
    Prosecution before the USPTO for both the Tuschl I and&#160;II
    pending patent applications was suspended pursuant to a
    standstill agreement. This agreement expired on
    September&#160;15, 2010, and Max Planck, MIT, Whitehead and
    UMass filed several continuation applications in the Tuschl I
    patent family to preserve their rights and maintain the status
    quo for these applications pending the outcome of the
    litigation. Max Planck also filed a continuation application in
    the Tuschl&#160;II patent family.

    Although we, along with Max Planck, are vigorously asserting our
    rights in this case, litigation is subject to inherent
    uncertainty and a court could ultimately rule against us and Max
    Planck. In addition, litigation is costly and may divert the
    attention of our management and other resources that would
    otherwise be engaged in running our business.

    We are a biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics
    based on RNAi. RNAi is a naturally occurring biological pathway
    within cells for selectively silencing and regulating the
    expression of specific genes. Since many diseases are caused by
    the inappropriate activity of specific genes, the ability to
    silence genes selectively through RNAi could provide a new way
    to treat a wide range of human diseases. We believe that drugs
    that work through RNAi have the potential to become a broad new
    class of drugs, like small molecule, protein and antibody drugs.
    Using our intellectual property and the expertise we have built
    in RNAi, we are developing a set of biological and chemical
    methods and know-how that we apply in a systematic way to
    develop RNAi therapeutics for a variety of diseases.

    Our core product strategy, which we refer to as &#147;Alnylam
    5x15,&#148; is focused on the development and commercialization
    of innovative RNAi therapeutics for the treatment of genetically
    defined diseases. Under our core product strategy, we expect to
    progress five RNAi therapeutic programs into advanced stages of
    clinical development by the end of 2015. As part of this
    strategy, our goal is to develop product candidates with the
    following shared characteristics: a genetically defined target
    and disease; the potential to have a significant impact in high
    unmet need patient populations; the ability to leverage our
    existing RNAi delivery platform; the opportunity to monitor an
    early biomarker in Phase I clinical trials for human proof of
    concept; and the existence of clinically relevant endpoints for
    the filing of an NDA, with a focused patient database and
    possible accelerated paths for commercialization. We intend to
    commercialize products arising from this core product strategy
    on our own in the United States and potentially certain other
    countries, and we intend to enter into alliances to develop and
    commercialize any such products in other global territories. We
    are currently advancing three core programs in clinical or
    pre-clinical development: ALN-TTR for the treatment of ATTR;
    ALN-PCS for the treatment of severe hypercholesterolemia; and
    ALN-HPN for the treatment of refractory anemia. As part of our
    core product strategy, we also expect to designate and start
    pre-clinical development of two additional RNAi therapeutic
    candidates targeting genetically defined diseases by the end of
    2011.

    While focusing our efforts on our core product strategy, we also
    intend to continue to advance additional development programs
    through existing or future alliances. We have three
    partner-based programs in clinical or pre-clinical development,
    including ALN-RSV01 for the treatment of RSV, ALN-VSP for the
    treatment of liver cancers and ALN-HTT for the treatment of HD.

    We also continue to work internally and with third-party
    collaborators to develop new technologies to deliver our RNAi
    therapeutics both directly to specific sites of disease, and
    systemically by intravenous or subcutaneous administration. We

    intend to continue to collaborate with government, academic and
    corporate third parties to evaluate different delivery options.

    In addition, our expertise in RNAi therapeutics and broad
    intellectual property estate have allowed us to form alliances
    with leading companies, including Isis, Medtronic, Novartis,
    Biogen Idec, Roche, Takeda, Kyowa Hakko Kirin and Cubist. We
    have also entered into contracts with government agencies,
    including the NIAID, a component of the NIH. We have established
    collaborations with and, in some instances, received funding
    from major medical and disease associations, including CHDI.
    Finally, to further enable the field and monetize our
    intellectual property rights, we also grant licenses to
    biotechnology companies for the development and
    commercialization of RNAi therapeutics for specified targets in
    which we have no direct strategic interest under our InterfeRx
    program, and to research companies that commercialize RNAi
    reagents or services under our research product licenses.

    In September 2010, as a result of the planned completion of the
    fifth and final year of the research program under our
    collaboration and license agreement with Novartis and our
    reduced need for service-based collaboration resources, we
    undertook a corporate restructuring to focus our resources on
    our most promising programs and significantly reduce our cost
    structure. The corporate restructuring included a reduction of
    our overall workforce by approximately 25%. We expect this
    reduction in personnel costs, along with other external costs,
    could result in a savings of approximately $25.0&#160;million in
    previously planned 2011 operating expenses. During the year
    ended December&#160;31, 2010, we recorded $2.2&#160;million in
    operating expenses under the restructuring, including employee

    Alnylam commenced operations in June 2002. We have focused our
    efforts since inception primarily on business planning, research
    and development, acquiring, filing and expanding intellectual
    property rights, recruiting management and technical staff, and
    raising capital. Since our inception, we have generated
    significant losses. At December&#160;31, 2010, we had an
    accumulated deficit of $343.3&#160;million. Through
    December&#160;31, 2010, we have funded our operations primarily

    A significant component of our business plan is to enter into
    strategic alliances and collaborations with pharmaceutical and
    biotechnology companies, academic institutions, research
    foundations and others, as appropriate, to gain access to
    funding, capabilities, technical resources and intellectual
    property to further our development efforts and to generate
    revenues. Our collaboration strategy is to form
    (1)&#160;non-exclusive platform
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">and/or</FONT>
    multi-target discovery alliances where our collaborators obtain
    access to our capabilities and intellectual property to develop
    their own RNAi therapeutic products; and (2)&#160;worldwide or
    specific geographic partnerships on select RNAi therapeutic
    programs. For example, we have entered into a broad,
    non-exclusive platform license agreement with Takeda, under
    which we are also collaborating with Takeda on RNAi drug
    discovery for one or more disease targets. We have also
    established product alliances with Cubist and Medtronic for the
    development and commercialization of ALN-RSV and ALN-HTT,
    respectively. In addition, we have entered into a product
    alliance with Kyowa Hakko Kirin for the development and
    commercialization of ALN-RSV in territories not covered by the
    Cubist agreement, which include Japan and other markets in Asia.
    We also have discovery and development alliances with Isis and
    Biogen Idec.

    We also seek to form or advance new ventures and opportunities
    in areas outside our primary focus on RNAi therapeutics. For
    example, during 2009, we established Alnylam Biotherapeutics, an
    internal effort regarding the application of RNAi technologies
    to improve the manufacturing processes for biologics, an
    approach that has the potential to create new business
    opportunities. This effort is focused on applying RNAi
    technologies to the biologics marketplace, which includes
    recombinant proteins and monoclonal antibodies. In addition,
    during 2007, we and Isis formed Regulus to capitalize on our
    technology and intellectual property in the field of microRNA
    therapeutics. Regulus has formed collaborations with GSK and
    sanofi-aventis to advance its efforts. Given the broad
    applications for RNAi technology, in addition to our efforts on
    Alnylam Biotherapeutics and Regulus, we believe new ventures and
    opportunities will be available to us.

    To generate revenues from our intellectual property rights, we
    also grant licenses to biotechnology companies under our
    InterfeRx program for the development and commercialization of
    RNAi therapeutics for specified targets in which we have no
    direct strategic interest. We also license key aspects of our
    intellectual property to companies active in the research
    products and services market, which includes the manufacture and
    sale of reagents. Our InterfeRx and research product licenses
    aim to generate modest near-term revenues that we can re-invest
    in the development of our proprietary RNAi therapeutics
    pipeline. As of January&#160;31, 2011, we had granted such
    licenses, on both an exclusive and non-exclusive basis, to

    Since delivery of RNAi therapeutics remains a major objective of
    our research activities, we also look to form collaboration and
    licensing arrangements with other companies and academic
    institutions to gain access to delivery technologies. For
    example, we have entered into agreements with Tekmira, MIT, UBC
    and AlCana, among others, to focus on various delivery
    strategies. We have also entered into license agreements with
    Isis, Max Planck Innovation, Tekmira, MIT, CRT, Whitehead,
    Stanford and UTSW, as well as a number of other entities, to
    obtain rights to intellectual property in the field of RNAi.

    Our business strategy includes entering into collaborative
    license and development agreements with biotechnology and
    pharmaceutical companies for the development and
    commercialization of our product candidates. The terms of the

    Non-refundable license fees are recognized as revenue upon
    delivery of the license only if we have a contractual right to
    receive such payment, the contract price is fixed or
    determinable, the collection of the resulting receivable is
    reasonably assured and we have no further performance
    obligations under the license agreement. Multiple element
    arrangements, such as license and development arrangements, are
    analyzed to determine whether the deliverables, which often
    include a license and performance obligations such as research
    and steering committee services, can be separated or whether
    they must be accounted for as a single unit of accounting. We
    recognize upfront license payments as revenue upon delivery of
    the license only if the license has stand-alone value and the
    fair value of the undelivered performance obligations, typically
    including research
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">and/or</FONT>
    steering committee services, can be determined. If the fair
    value of the undelivered performance obligations can be
    determined, such obligations would then be accounted for
    separately as performed. If the license is considered to either
    not have stand-alone value or have stand-alone value but the
    fair value of any of the undelivered performance obligations
    cannot be determined, the arrangement would then be accounted
    for as a single unit of accounting and the license payments and
    payments for performance obligations are recognized as revenue

    are performed.

    Whenever we determine that an arrangement should be accounted
    for as a single unit of accounting, we must determine the period
    over which the performance obligations will be performed and

    revenue using the proportional performance method when we can
    reasonably estimate the level of effort required to complete our
    performance obligations under an arrangement and such
    performance obligations are provided on a best-efforts basis.
    Direct labor hours or full-time equivalents are typically used
    as the measure of performance. The amount of revenue recognized
    under the proportional performance method is determined by
    multiplying the total payments under the contract, excluding
    royalties and payments contingent upon achievement of
    substantive milestones, by the ratio of level of effort incurred
    to date to estimated total level of effort required to complete
    our performance obligations under the arrangement. Revenue is

    Many of our collaboration agreements entitle us to additional
    payments upon the achievement of performance-based milestones.
    If the achievement of a milestone is considered probable at the
    inception of the collaboration, the related milestone payment is
    included with other collaboration consideration, such as upfront
    fees and research funding, in our revenue model. Milestones that
    involve substantial effort on our part and the achievement of
    which are not considered probable at the inception of the
    collaboration are considered &#147;substantive milestones.&#148;
    Substantive milestones are included in our revenue model when
    achievement of the milestone is considered probable. As future
    substantive milestones are achieved, a portion of the milestone
    payment, equal to the percentage of the performance period
    completed when the milestone is achieved, multiplied by the

    For revenue generating arrangements where we, as a vendor,
    provide consideration to a licensor or collaborator, as a

    arrangements where both the vendor and the customer make cash
    payments to each other for services

    products. A payment to a customer is presumed to be a reduction
    of the selling price unless we receive an identifiable benefit
    for the payment and we can reasonably estimate the fair value of
    the benefit received. Payments to a customer that are deemed a
    reduction of selling price are recorded first as a reduction of
    revenue, to the extent of both cumulative revenue recorded to
    date and probable future revenues, which include any unamortized
    deferred revenue balances, under all arrangements with such

    Amounts received prior to satisfying the above revenue
    recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue in the
    accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Although we follow
    detailed guidelines in measuring revenue, certain judgments
    affect the application of our revenue policy. For example, in
    connection with our existing collaboration agreements, we have
    recorded on our balance sheet short-term and long-term deferred
    revenue based on our best estimate of when such revenue will be
    recognized. Short-term deferred revenue consists of amounts that
    are expected to be recognized as revenue in the next
    12&#160;months. Amounts that we expect will not be recognized

    We account for all stock-based awards granted to non-employees
    at their fair value and generally recognize compensation expense
    over the vesting period of the award. Determining the amount of
    stock-based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop
    estimates of fair values of stock options as of the grant date.
    We calculate the grant date fair values using the Black-Scholes
    valuation model. Our expected stock price volatility assumption
    is based on a combination of the historical and implied
    volatility of our publicly traded stock. For stock option awards
    granted during the year ended December&#160;31, 2010, we used a
    weighted-average expected stock-price volatility assumption of
    55%. Our expected life assumption is based on the equal
    weighting of our historical data and the historical data of our
    pharmaceutical and biotechnology peers. Our weighted average
    expected term was 6.0&#160;years for the year ended
    December&#160;31, 2010. We utilize a dividend yield of zero
    based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and
    currently have no intention to pay cash dividends. The risk-free
    interest rate used for each grant is based on the
    U.S.&#160;Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant
    for instruments with a similar expected life.

    At December&#160;31, 2010, the estimated fair value of unvested
    employee awards was $30.6&#160;million, net of estimated
    forfeitures. We will recognize this amount over the weighted
    average remaining vesting period of approximately 2.8&#160;years
    for these awards. Stock-based employee compensation expense was
    $18.7&#160;million for the year ended December&#160;31, 2010.
    However, we cannot currently predict the total amount of
    stock-based compensation expense to be recognized in any future
    period because such amounts will depend on levels of stock-based
    payments granted in the future as well as the portion of the
    awards that actually vest. The stock compensation accounting
    standard requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of
    grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual
    forfeitures differ from those estimates. The term
    &#147;forfeitures&#148; is distinct from
    &#147;cancellations&#148; or &#147;expirations&#148; and
    represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered stock
    option. We currently expect, based on an analysis of our
    historical forfeitures, excluding the impact of our corporate
    restructuring, that approximately 76% of our stock options will
    actually vest, and therefore have applied an annual forfeiture
    rate of 6.5% to all unvested stock options at December&#160;31,
    2010. Ultimately, the actual expense recognized over the vesting
    period will only be for those shares that vest.

    Revenues remained relatively consistent for the year ended
    December&#160;31, 2010 as compared to the year ended
    December&#160;31, 2009. Under the Roche alliance, we are
    recognizing revenue on a straight-line basis over five years,
    which equates to approximately $14.0&#160;million per quarter.
    Revenues under the Roche alliance in 2009 also included the
    achievement of a development milestone. Under the Takeda
    alliance, we are recognizing revenue on a straight-line basis
    over seven years, which equates to approximately
    $5.4&#160;million per quarter.

    In September 2010, Novartis exercised its right under the
    collaboration and license agreement to select 31 designated gene
    targets, for which Novartis has exclusive rights to discover,
    develop and commercialize RNAi therapeutic products using our
    intellectual property and technology. Novartis declined to
    exercise its non-exclusive option to integrate into its
    operations our fundamental and chemistry intellectual property
    under the terms of the collaboration and license agreement,
    known as the integration option. If Novartis had elected to
    exercise the integration option, Novartis would have been
    required to make additional payments to us totaling
    $100.0&#160;million. In October 2010, the fifth and final year
    of the research program was substantially completed under the
    Novartis collaboration and license agreement, and consequently,
    we currently do not expect to have any significant revenues from
    Novartis in 2011. At December&#160;31, 2010, deferred revenue
    under the Novartis collaboration and license agreement was
    $0.4&#160;million.

    For the year ended December&#160;31, 2010 as compared to the
    year ended December&#160;31, 2009, government contract revenues
    decreased primarily as a result of a decrease in the research
    and development activities related to our contract with the
    NIAID. This contract was originally expected to be completed in
    September 2010. We and the NIAID agreed to a no-cost extension
    of the contract through December 2010 during which time we
    utilized the funds remaining under the contract. We currently do
    not expect to have any significant government contract revenues
    in 2011.

    Research and development expenses decreased slightly during the
    year ended December&#160;31, 2010 as compared to the year ended
    December&#160;31, 2009 due primarily to license fees paid to
    Isis in April 2009 in connection with the ssRNAi collaborative
    effort with Isis, which we terminated in November 2010. This
    decrease was partially offset by restructuring expenses related
    to employee severance, benefits and related costs incurred in
    connection with our corporate restructuring, which was
    implemented at the end of September 2010 and included an
    approximate 25% workforce reduction. In addition, prior to our
    corporate restructuring, there were higher compensation and
    related expenses during 2010 as compared to 2009 due to higher
    average research and development headcount to support our
    technology platform and expanding product pipeline.

    We expect to continue to devote a substantial portion of our
    resources to research and development expenses as we continue
    development of our and our collaborators&#146; product
    candidates and focus on continuing to develop drug
    delivery-related technologies, however we expect that research
    and development expenses will decrease in 2011 primarily as a
    result of our corporate restructuring.

    A significant portion of our research and development costs are
    not tracked by project as they benefit multiple projects or our
    technology platform and because our most-advanced programs are
    in the early stages of clinical development. However, our
    collaboration agreements contain cost-sharing arrangements
    pursuant to which certain costs incurred under the project are
    reimbursed. Costs reimbursed under the agreements typically
    include certain direct external costs and a negotiated full-time
    equivalent labor rate for the actual time worked on the project.
    In addition, we are reimbursed under our government contracts
    for certain allowable costs including direct internal and
    external costs. As a result, although a significant portion of
    our research and development expenses are not tracked on a
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">project-by-project</FONT>
    basis, we do track direct external costs attributable to, and
    the actual time our employees worked on, our collaborations and
    government contracts.

    The decrease in general and administrative expenses during the

    in connection with the strategic alliance formed by Regulus and
    sanofi-aventis in June 2010. Beginning in January 2009, in
    connection with the conversion of Regulus to a C corporation, we
    were recognizing approximately 49% of the income and losses of
    Regulus. The carrying value of our investment in joint venture
    (Regulus Therapeutics Inc.) immediately prior to the conversion
    to a C corporation exceeded 49% of the net assets of Regulus by
    approximately $0.8&#160;million. Upon conversion, this amount
    was allocated to the intellectual property of Regulus and,
    because the intellectual property was determined to be
    in-process research and development, the $0.8&#160;million was
    recorded as a charge to expense. This charge is included in
    equity in loss of joint venture (Regulus Therapeutics Inc.) in
    the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended
    December&#160;31, 2009. In October 2010, in connection with its
    strategic alliance with Regulus, sanofi-aventis made a
    $10.0&#160;million equity investment in Regulus, resulting in
    sanofi-aventis owning approximately 9% of Regulus. Following
    this investment, we and Isis own approximately 45% and 46%,
    respectively, of Regulus. Separate financial information for
    Regulus is included in Exhibit&#160;99.1 to this annual report

    Interest income was $2.3&#160;million in 2010 as compared to
    $5.4&#160;million in 2009. The decrease in 2010 was due

    Other income was $6.4&#160;million in 2010 as compared to

    equity-method investee, due to the increase in valuation of
    Regulus as a result of the $10.0 million equity investment
    sanofi-aventis made in Regulus. In addition, in 2010, we
    received $2.0&#160;million in connection with awards under the
    federal government&#146;s Qualifying Therapeutic Discovery

    Revenues increased for the year ended December&#160;31, 2009 as
    compared to the year ended December&#160;31, 2008 primarily as a
    result of a full year of revenues from our May 2008 alliance
    with Takeda. We are recognizing as revenue the
    $150.0&#160;million in upfront and technology transfer milestone
    payments made or due to us under the Takeda alliance on a
    straight-line basis over seven years, which equates to
    approximately $5.4&#160;million per quarter. Also contributing
    to the increase in 2009 were higher revenues under the Roche
    alliance related primarily to a development milestone achieved
    in 2009. Under the Roche alliance, we are recognizing revenue on
    a straight-line basis over five years, which equates to
    approximately $14.0&#160;million per quarter.

    The decrease in Novartis revenues during the year ended
    December&#160;31, 2009 as compared to the year ended
    December&#160;31, 2008 was due in part to a reduction in the
    number of resources allocated to the broad Novartis alliance.

    For the year ended December&#160;31, 2009 as compared to the
    year ended December&#160;31, 2008, government contract revenues
    decreased primarily as a result of the wind down of our
    collaboration with DTRA. Following a program review, in February
    2009, we and DTRA determined not to continue this program and,
    accordingly, the remaining funds were not accessed.

    Other research collaborator revenues increased in the year ended
    December&#160;31, 2009 as compared to the year ended
    December&#160;31, 2008 due primarily to our alliance with
    Cubist. In consideration for the rights granted to Cubist under
    the agreement, in January 2009, Cubist paid us an upfront cash
    payment of $20.0&#160;million. We are recognizing this
    $20.0&#160;million payment as revenue on a straight-line basis
    over approximately eight years.

    Research and development expenses increased during the year
    ended December&#160;31, 2009 as compared to the year ended
    December&#160;31, 2008 due primarily to increased clinical
    program and manufacturing expenses associated with our ALN-TTR
    pre-clinical program and our ALN-VSP clinical trial. Also
    contributing to the increase in research and development
    expenses for the year ended December&#160;31, 2009 was an
    increase in compensation and related, non-cash stock-based
    compensation and facilities-related expenses due primarily to
    additional research and development headcount to support our
    alliances and expanding product pipeline. Partially offsetting
    these increases, external services expenses decreased during the
    year ended December&#160;31, 2009 as a result of lower
    pre-clinical activities due primarily to the wind down of our
    collaboration with DTRA. In addition, under the terms

    The increase in general and administrative expenses during the
    year ended December&#160;31, 2009 as compared to the year ended
    December&#160;31, 2008 was due primarily to higher consulting
    and professional services expenses related to business
    activities, primarily legal activities, a description of which
    is set forth in Part&#160;I, Item&#160;3 of this annual report
    on
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">Form&#160;10-K.</FONT>
    Also contributing to the increase were higher non-cash
    stock-based compensation and compensation and related expenses
    due to a modest increase in general and administrative headcount
    in 2009 to support our growth.

    We incurred $4.9&#160;million equity in loss of joint venture
    (Regulus Therapeutics Inc.) for the year ended December&#160;31,
    2009 as compared to $9.3&#160;million for the year ended
    December&#160;31, 2008 related to our share of the net losses
    incurred by Regulus. Through December&#160;31, 2008, we were
    recognizing the first $10.0&#160;million of losses of Regulus as
    equity in loss of joint venture (Regulus Therapeutics Inc.) in
    our consolidated statements of operations because we were
    responsible for funding those losses through our initial
    $10.0&#160;million cash contribution. Beginning in January 2009,
    in connection with the conversion of Regulus to a C corporation,
    we were recognizing approximately 49% of the income and losses
    of Regulus. The carrying value of our investment in joint
    venture (Regulus Therapeutics Inc.) immediately prior to the
    conversion to a C corporation exceeded 49% of the net assets of
    Regulus by approximately $0.8&#160;million. Upon conversion,
    this amount was allocated to the intellectual property of
    Regulus and, because the intellectual property was determined to
    be in-process research and development, the $0.8&#160;million
    was recorded as a charge to expense. This charge is included in
    equity in loss of joint venture (Regulus Therapeutics Inc.) in
    the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended
    December&#160;31, 2009.

    Interest income was $5.4&#160;million in 2009 as compared to
    $14.4&#160;million in 2008. The decrease in 2009 was due
    primarily to significantly lower average interest rates.

    Interest expense was zero in 2009 as compared to
    $0.9&#160;million in 2008. Interest expense in 2008 was related
    to borrowings under our lines of credit used to finance capital
    equipment purchases. In December 2008, we repaid the aggregate
    outstanding balance under these credit lines.

    Other income was $0.6&#160;million in 2009 as compared to other
    expense of $1.9&#160;million in 2008. Other income in 2009
    consisted primarily of realized gains on sales of marketable
    securities. Included in other expense in 2008 was an impairment
    charge of $1.6&#160;million related to our May 2008 investment
    in Tekmira, as the decrease in the fair value of this investment
    was deemed to be other than temporary.

    Since we commenced operations in 2002, we have generated
    significant losses. As of December&#160;31, 2010, we had an
    accumulated deficit of $343.3&#160;million. At December&#160;31,
    2010, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of
    $349.9&#160;million, compared to cash, cash equivalents and
    marketable securities of $435.3&#160;million at
    December&#160;31, 2009. We invest primarily in cash equivalents,
    U.S.&#160;government and municipal obligations, high-grade
    corporate notes and commercial paper. Our investment objectives
    are, primarily, to assure liquidity and preservation of capital
    and, secondarily, to obtain investment income. All of our
    investments in debt securities are recorded at fair value and
    are
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">available-for-sale.</FONT>
    Fair value is determined based on quoted market prices and
    models using observable data inputs. We have not recorded any
    impairment charges to our fixed income marketable securities at
    December&#160;31, 2010.

    We have required significant amounts of cash to fund our
    operating activities as a result of net losses since our
    inception. The decrease in net cash provided by operating
    activities for the year ended December&#160;31, 2010 compared to
    the year ended December&#160;31, 2009 was due primarily to our
    net loss and other changes in our working capital, as well as a
    decrease in deferred revenue of $60.7&#160;million. We had a
    decrease in deferred revenue of $58.2&#160;million for year
    ended December&#160;31, 2009, partially offset by an increase in
    accounts payable of $9.9&#160;million. We had an increase in
    deferred revenue of $66.7&#160;million for the year ended
    December&#160;31, 2008 due primarily to the proceeds received
    from our Takeda and Kyowa Hakko Kirin alliances. Cash used in
    operating activities is adjusted for non-cash items to reconcile
    net loss to net cash provided by or used in operating
    activities. These non-cash adjustments consist primarily of
    stock-based compensation, equity in loss of joint venture
    (Regulus Therapeutics Inc.) and depreciation and amortization.

    We expect that we will require significant amounts of cash to

    the timing and terms of collaboration agreements or other
    strategic transactions, if any, and the timing and progress of
    our research and development efforts.

    During the current downturn in global financial markets, some
    companies have experienced difficulties accessing their cash
    equivalents and investment securities and raising capital
    generally, which have had a material adverse impact on their
    liquidity. In addition, the current economic downturn has
    diminished the availability of capital and may limit our ability
    to access these markets to obtain financing in the future. Based
    on our current operating plan, we believe that our existing
    cash, cash equivalents and fixed income marketable securities,
    for which we have not recognized any impairment charges,
    together with the cash we expect to generate under our current
    alliances, will be sufficient to fund our planned operations for
    at least the next several years, during which time we expect to
    further the development of our product candidates, conduct
    clinical trials, extend the capabilities of our technology
    platform, including through new business initiatives, and
    continue to prosecute patent applications and otherwise build
    and maintain our patent portfolio. However, we may require
    significant additional funds earlier than we currently expect in
    order to develop, conduct clinical trials for and commercialize
    any product candidates.

    In the longer term, we may seek additional funding through
    additional collaborative arrangements and public or private
    financings. Additional funding may not be available to us on
    acceptable terms or at all. In addition, the terms of any
    financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our
    stockholders. For example, if we raise additional funds by
    issuing equity securities, further dilution to our existing
    stockholders may result. In addition, as a condition to
    providing additional funds to us, future investors may demand,
    and may be granted, rights superior to those of existing
    stockholders. If we are unable to obtain funding on a timely
    basis, we may be required to significantly curtail one or more
    of our research or development programs. We also could be
    required to seek funds through arrangements with collaborators
    or others that may require us to relinquish rights to some of
    our technologies or product candidates that we would otherwise
    pursue.

    In connection with our license agreements with Max Planck
    Gesellschaft Zur Forderung Der Wissenschaften E.V. and Max
    Planck Innovation, collectively, Max Planck, relating to the
    Tuschl I and&#160;II patent applications, we are required to
    indemnify Max Planck for certain damages arising in connection
    with the intellectual property rights licensed under the
    agreements. Under this indemnification agreement with Max
    Planck, we are responsible for paying the costs of any
    litigation relating to the license agreements or the underlying
    intellectual property rights. These amounts are charged to
    general and administrative expense. In addition, we are a party
    to a number of agreements entered into in the ordinary course of
    business, which contain typical provisions that obligate us to
    indemnify the other parties to such agreements upon the
    occurrence of certain events. These indemnification obligations
    are considered off-balance sheet arrangements in accordance with
    GAAP. To date, other than the costs associated with the
    litigation described in Part&#160;I, Item&#160;3 of this annual
    report on
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">Form&#160;10-K,</FONT>
    which we are responsible for under our indemnification agreement
    with Max Planck, we have not encountered material costs as a
    result of such obligations and have not accrued any liabilities
    related to such obligations in our consolidated financial
    statements. See Note&#160;7 to our consolidated financial
    statements included in this annual report on
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">Form&#160;10-K</FONT>

    In the table below, we set forth our enforceable and legally
    binding obligations and future commitments at December&#160;31,
    2010, as well as obligations related to contracts that we are
    likely to continue, regardless of the fact that they were
    cancelable at December&#160;31, 2010. Some of the figures that
    we include in this table are based on management&#146;s
    estimates and assumptions about these obligations, including
    their duration, the possibility of renewal, anticipated actions
    by third parties, and other factors. Because these estimates and
    assumptions are necessarily subjective, the obligations we will
    actually pay in future periods may vary from those reflected in
    the table.

    In April 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or
    FASB, issued a new accounting standard, which provides guidance
    in applying the milestone method of revenue recognition to
    research or development arrangements. Under this guidance
    management may recognize revenue contingent upon the achievement
    of a milestone in the period in which the milestone is achieved
    only if the milestone meets all the criteria within the guidance
    to be considered substantive. This standard is effective on a
    prospective basis for research and development milestones
    achieved in fiscal years beginning on or after June&#160;15,
    2010. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of this
    accounting standard on our consolidated financial statements,
    however we do not believe it will have a significant impact.

    In October 2009, the FASB issued a new accounting standard,
    which amends existing revenue recognition accounting
    pronouncements and provides accounting principles and
    application guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist, how
    the arrangement should be separated and the consideration
    allocated. This standard eliminates the requirement to establish
    the fair value of undelivered products and services and instead
    provides for separate revenue recognition based upon
    management&#146;s estimate of the selling price for an
    undelivered item when there is no other means to determine the
    fair value of that undelivered item. Previously, accounting
    principles required that the fair value of the undelivered item
    be the price of the item either sold in a separate transaction
    between unrelated third parties or the price charged for each
    item when the item is sold separately by the vendor. Determining
    the fair value using these methods was difficult when the
    product was not individually sold because of its unique
    features. If the fair value of all of the elements in the
    arrangement was not determinable, then revenue was deferred
    until all of the items were delivered or fair value was
    determined. This new approach is effective prospectively for
    revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in
    fiscal years beginning on or after June&#160;15, 2010. This new
    accounting standard will not affect our existing collaborations
    but will affect how we recognize revenue for future
    collaborations.

    In June 2009, the FASB issued a new accounting standard, which
    amends previously issued accounting guidance for the
    consolidation of a VIE to require an enterprise to determine
    whether its variable interest or interests give it a controlling
    financial interest in a VIE. This amended consolidation guidance
    for VIEs also replaces the existing quantitative approach for
    identifying which enterprise should consolidate a VIE, which was
    based on which enterprise was exposed to a majority of the risks
    and rewards, with a qualitative approach, based on which
    enterprise has both (1)&#160;the power to direct the
    economically significant activities of the entity and
    (2)&#160;the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that
    could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to
    receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be
    significant to the VIE. This new accounting standard has broad
    implications and may affect how we account for the consolidation
    of common structures, such as joint ventures, equity method
    investments, collaboration and other agreements, and purchase
    arrangements. Under this revised consolidation guidance, more
    entities may meet the definition of a VIE, and the determination
    about who should consolidate a VIE is required to be evaluated
    continuously. We adopted this standard effective January&#160;1,
    2010 and have determined that the adoption did not have an
    impact on our consolidated financial statements.

    As part of our investment portfolio, we own financial
    instruments that are sensitive to market risks. The investment
    portfolio is used to preserve our capital until it is required
    to fund operations, including our research and development
    activities. Our marketable securities consist of
    U.S.&#160;government and municipal obligations, high-grade
    corporate notes and commercial paper. All of our investments in
    debt securities are classified as
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">available-for-sale</FONT>
    and are recorded at fair value. Our
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">available-for-sale</FONT>
    investments in debt securities are sensitive to changes in
    interest rates and changes in the credit ratings of the issuers.
    Interest rate changes would result in a change in the net fair
    value of these financial instruments due to the difference
    between the market interest rate and the market interest rate at
    the date of purchase of the financial instrument. If market
    interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by
    50&#160;basis points, or one-half of a percentage point, from
    levels at December&#160;31, 2010, the net fair value of our
    interest-sensitive financial instruments would have resulted in
    a hypothetical decline of $1.3&#160;million. A downgrade in the
    credit rating of an issuer of a debt security or further
    deterioration of the credit markets could result in a decline in
    the fair value of the debt instruments. Our investment
    guidelines prohibit investment in auction rate securities and we
    do not believe we have any direct exposure to losses relating
    from mortgage-based securities or derivatives related thereto
    such as credit-default swaps. We did not record any impairment
    charges during the year ended December&#160;31, 2010.

    45&#160;percent-owned equity investment, which were audited by
    other auditors whose report thereon has been furnished to us.
    Our opinion expressed herein, insofar as it relates to the
    Company&#146;s net investment in (approximately
    $3.6&#160;million and $6.4&#160;million at December&#160;31,
    2010 and 2009, respectively) and equity in the net loss
    (approximately $7.6&#160;million, $4.9&#160;million and
    $9.3&#160;million for the years ended December&#160;31, 2010,
    2009 and 2008, respectively) of Regulus Therapeutics Inc., is
    based solely on the report of the other auditors. We conducted
    our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
    Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement and whether effective internal
    control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audits of the financial statements included
    examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
    disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
    presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial
    reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal
    control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
    material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
    assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audits and the report of other auditors provide
    a reasonable basis for our opinions.

    A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#146;s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i)&#160;pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii)&#160;provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii)&#160;provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

    Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

    approximately 13.2% of the Company&#146;s outstanding common
    stock at December&#160;31, 2010. The Company has also generated
    revenues from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
    Diseases (&#147;NIAID&#148;), a component of the National
    Institutes of Health (&#147;NIH&#148;), and Cubist
    Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (&#147;Cubist&#148;). In addition, the
    Company and Medtronic, Inc. (&#147;Medtronic&#148;) have formed
    a collaboration with CHDI Foundation, Inc. (&#147;CHDI&#148;) to
    advance ALN-HTT, a novel drug-device combination for the
    treatment of Huntington&#146;s disease. Under this
    collaboration, CHDI has agreed to initially fund approximately
    50% of the costs of this program up to the point at which an
    investigational new drug application can be filed with the
    United States Food and Drug Administration or a comparable
    foreign regulatory filing can be made. The Company is recording
    this funding as a reduction to research and development expense.

    The Company records accrued liabilities related to expenses for
    which service providers have not yet billed the Company with
    respect to products or services that the Company has received,
    specifically related to ongoing pre-clinical studies and
    clinical trials. These costs primarily relate to third-party
    clinical management costs, laboratory and analysis costs,
    toxicology studies and investigator fees. The Company has
    multiple product candidates in concurrent pre-clinical studies
    and clinical trials at multiple clinical sites throughout the
    world. In order to ensure that the Company has adequately
    provided for ongoing pre-clinical and clinical development costs
    during the period in which the Company incurs such costs, the
    Company maintains an accrual to cover these expenses. The
    Company updates the estimate for this accrual on at least a
    quarterly basis. The assessment of these costs is a subjective
    process that requires judgment. Upon settlement, these costs may
    differ materially from the amounts accrued in the Company&#146;s
    consolidated financial statements. The Company&#146;s historical
    accrual estimates have not been materially different from the
    Company&#146;s actual amounts.

    Non-refundable license fees are recognized as revenue upon
    delivery of the license only if the Company has a contractual
    right to receive such payment, the contract price is fixed or
    determinable, the collection of the resulting receivable is
    reasonably assured and the Company has no further performance
    obligations under the license agreement. Multiple element
    arrangements, such as license and development arrangements, are
    analyzed to determine whether the deliverables, which often
    include a license and performance obligations such as research
    and steering committee services, can be separated or whether
    they must be accounted for as a single unit of accounting. The
    Company recognizes upfront license payments as revenue upon
    delivery of the license only if the license has stand-alone
    value and the fair value of the undelivered performance
    obligations, typically including research
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">and/or</FONT>

    value of the undelivered performance obligations can be

    such obligations are fulfilled. If the license is considered to
    either not have stand-alone value or have stand-alone value but
    the fair value of any of the undelivered performance obligations
    cannot be determined, the arrangement would then be accounted
    for as a single unit of accounting and the license payments and

    straight-line method. The Company recognizes revenue using the
    proportional performance method when the level of effort
    required to complete its performance obligations under an
    arrangement can be reasonably estimated and such performance
    obligations are provided on a best-efforts basis. Direct labor
    hours or full-time equivalents are typically used as the measure
    of performance. The amount of revenue recognized under the
    proportional performance method is determined by multiplying the
    total payments under the contract, excluding royalties and
    payments contingent upon achievement of substantive milestones,
    by the ratio of level of effort incurred to date to estimated
    total level of effort required to complete the Company&#146;s
    performance obligations under the arrangement. Revenue is
    limited to the lesser of the cumulative amount of payments

    Milestones that involve substantial effort on the Company&#146;s
    part and the achievement of which are not considered probable at
    the inception of the collaboration are considered
    &#147;substantive milestones.&#148; Substantive milestones are

    milestones are achieved, a portion of the milestone payment,
    equal to the percentage of the performance period completed when
    the milestone is achieved, multiplied by the amount of the
    milestone payment, will be recognized as revenue upon
    achievement of such milestone. The remaining portion of the
    milestone will be recognized over the remaining performance
    period using the proportional performance or straight-line
    method. Milestones that are tied to regulatory approval are not
    considered probable of being achieved until such approval is
    received. Milestones tied to counter-party performance are not

    performance conditions are met.

    For revenue generating arrangements where the Company, as a
    vendor, provides consideration to a licensor or collaborator, as
    a customer, the Company applies the accounting standard that
    governs such transactions. This standard addresses the
    accounting for revenue arrangements where both the vendor and
    the customer make cash payments to each other for services
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">and/or</FONT>
    products. A payment to a customer is presumed to be a reduction
    of the selling price unless the Company receives an identifiable
    benefit for the payment and it can reasonably estimate the fair
    value of the benefit received. Payments to a customer that are
    deemed a reduction of selling price are recorded first as a
    reduction of revenue, to the extent of both cumulative revenue
    recorded to date and probable future revenues, which include any
    unamortized deferred revenue balances, under all arrangements
    with such customer, and then as an expense. Payments that are
    not deemed to be a reduction of selling price are recorded as an
    expense.

    The Company evaluates its collaborative agreements for proper
    classification in its consolidated statements of operations
    based on the nature of the underlying activity. Transactions
    between collaborators recorded in the Company&#146;s
    consolidated statements of operations are recorded on either a
    gross or net basis, depending on the characteristics of the
    collaborative relationship. The Company generally reflects
    amounts due under its collaborative agreements related to
    cost-sharing of development activities as a reduction of
    research and development expense.

    Amounts received prior to satisfying the above revenue
    recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue in the
    accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Although the Company
    follows detailed guidelines in measuring revenue, certain
    judgments affect the application of its revenue policy. For
    example, in connection with the Company&#146;s existing
    collaboration agreements, the Company has recorded on its
    balance sheet short-term and long-term deferred revenue based on
    its best estimate of when such revenue will be recognized.
    Short-term deferred revenue consists of amounts that are
    expected to be recognized as revenue in the next 12&#160;months.
    Amounts that the Company expects will not be recognized prior to
    the next 12&#160;months are classified as long-term deferred
    revenue. However, this estimate is based on the Company&#146;s
    current operating plan and, if its operating plan should change
    in the future, the Company may recognize a different amount of
    deferred revenue over the next
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">12-month</FONT>
    period.

    The estimate of deferred revenue also reflects management&#146;s
    estimate of the periods of the Company&#146;s involvement in
    certain of its collaborations. The Company&#146;s performance
    obligations under these collaborations consist of participation
    on steering committees and the performance of other research and
    development services. In certain instances, the timing of
    satisfying these obligations can be difficult to estimate.
    Accordingly, the Company&#146;s estimates may change in the
    future. Such changes to estimates would result in a change in
    revenue recognition amounts. If these estimates and judgments
    change over the course of these agreements, it may affect the
    timing and amount of revenue that the Company recognizes and
    records in future periods. At December&#160;31, 2010, the
    Company had short-term and long-term deferred revenue of
    $81.1&#160;million and $130.0&#160;million, respectively,
    related to its collaborations.

    Effective January&#160;1, 2006, the Company adopted an
    accounting standard addressing recognition and disclosure of
    stock compensation. The Company adopted the fair value
    recognition provisions of this standard using the
    modified-prospective-transition method. The Company has stock
    incentive plans and an employee stock purchase plan under which
    it grants equity instruments that are required to be evaluated
    under this standard. For stock options granted to non-employees,
    the Company generally recognizes compensation expense over the
    vesting period of the award, which is generally the period
    during which services are rendered by such non-employees. At the
    end of each financial reporting period prior to vesting, the
    Company re-measures the value of these options (as calculated
    using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model) using the
    then-current fair value of the Company&#146;s common stock.
    Stock options granted by the Company to non-employees, other
    than members of the Company&#146;s Board of Directors and
    Scientific Advisory Board members, generally vest over a
    four-year service period.

    In April 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (&#147;FASB&#148;) issued a new accounting standard, which
    provides guidance in applying the milestone method of revenue
    recognition to research or development arrangements. Under this
    guidance, management may recognize revenue contingent upon the
    achievement of a milestone in the period in which the milestone
    is achieved only if the milestone meets all the criteria within
    the guidance to be considered substantive. This standard is
    effective on a prospective basis for research and development
    milestones achieved in fiscal years beginning on or after
    June&#160;15, 2010. The Company is currently evaluating the
    potential impact of this accounting standard on its consolidated
    financial statements, however the Company does not believe it
    will have a significant impact.

    In October 2009, the FASB issued a new accounting standard,
    which amends existing revenue recognition accounting
    pronouncements and provides accounting principles and
    application guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist, how
    the arrangement should be separated, and the consideration
    allocated. This standard eliminates the requirement to establish
    the fair value of undelivered products and services and instead
    provides for separate revenue recognition based upon
    management&#146;s estimate of the selling price for an
    undelivered item when there is no other means to determine the
    fair value of that undelivered item. Previously, accounting
    principles required that the fair value of the undelivered item
    be the price of the item either sold in a separate transaction
    between unrelated third parties or the price charged for each
    item when the item is sold separately by the vendor. Determining
    the fair value using these methods was difficult when the
    product was not individually sold because of its unique
    features. If the fair value of all of the elements in the
    arrangement was not determinable, then revenue was deferred
    until all of the items were delivered or fair value was
    determined. This new approach is effective prospectively for
    revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in
    fiscal years beginning on or after June&#160;15, 2010. This new
    accounting standard will not affect the Company&#146;s existing
    collaborations but will affect how the Company recognizes
    revenue for future collaborations.

    In June 2009, the FASB issued a new accounting standard, which
    amends previously issued accounting guidance for the
    consolidation of a VIE to require an enterprise to determine
    whether its variable interest or interests give it a controlling
    financial interest in a VIE. This amended consolidation guidance
    for VIEs also replaces the existing quantitative approach for
    identifying which enterprise should consolidate a VIE, which was
    based on which enterprise was exposed to a majority of the risks
    and rewards, with a qualitative approach, based on which
    enterprise has both (1)&#160;the power to direct the
    economically significant activities of the entity and
    (2)&#160;the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that
    could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to
    receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be
    significant to the VIE. This new accounting standard has broad
    implications and may affect how the Company accounts for the
    consolidation of common structures, such as joint ventures,
    equity method investments, collaboration and other agreements,
    and purchase arrangements. Under this revised consolidation
    guidance, more entities may meet the definition of a VIE, and
    the determination about which entity should consolidate a VIE is
    required to be evaluated continuously. The Company adopted this
    standard effective January&#160;1, 2010 and has determined that
    the adoption did not have an impact on its consolidated
    financial statements.

    In July 2007, the Company and, for limited purposes, Alnylam
    Europe, entered into a license and collaboration agreement (the
    &#147;LCA&#148;) with Roche. Under the LCA, which became
    effective in August 2007, the Company granted Roche a
    non-exclusive license to the Company&#146;s intellectual
    property to develop and commercialize therapeutic products that
    function through RNAi, subject to the Company&#146;s existing
    contractual obligations to third parties. The license is
    initially limited to the therapeutic areas of oncology,
    respiratory diseases, metabolic diseases and certain liver
    diseases, and may be expanded to include up to 18 additional
    therapeutic areas, comprising substantially all other fields of
    human disease, as identified and agreed upon by the parties,
    upon payment to the Company by Roche of an additional
    $50.0&#160;million for each additional therapeutic area, if any.

    In consideration for the rights granted to Roche under the LCA,
    Roche paid the Company $273.5&#160;million in upfront cash
    payments. In addition, in exchange for the Company&#146;s
    contributions under the LCA, for each RNAi therapeutic product
    developed by Roche, its affiliates or sublicensees under the
    LCA, the Company is entitled to receive milestone payments upon
    achievement of specified development and sales events, totaling
    up to an aggregate of $100.0&#160;million per therapeutic
    target, together with royalty payments based on worldwide annual
    net sales, if any. Under the LCA, the Company and Roche also
    established a discovery collaboration in October 2009
    (&#147;Discovery Collaboration&#148;), subject to the
    Company&#146;s existing contractual obligations to third parties.

    The term of the LCA generally ends upon the later of ten years
    from the first commercial sale of a licensed product and the
    expiration of the
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">last-to-expire</FONT>
    patent covering a licensed product. Roche may terminate the LCA,

    terminated by either party in the event the other party fails to
    cure a material breach under the LCA.

    In July 2007, the Company executed a common stock purchase
    agreement (the &#147;Common Stock Purchase Agreement&#148;) with
    Roche Finance Ltd, an affiliate of Roche (&#147;Roche
    Finance&#148;). Under the terms of the Common Stock Purchase
    Agreement, on August&#160;9, 2007, Roche Finance purchased
    1,975,000&#160;shares of the Company&#146;s common stock at
    $21.50 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of
    $42.5&#160;million. Based on the closing price of the
    Company&#146;s common stock on the date of issuance, the fair
    value of the shares issued was $51.3&#160;million, which was
    $8.8&#160;million in excess of the proceeds received from Roche
    for the issuance of the Company&#146;s common stock. As a
    result, the Company allocated $8.8&#160;million of the upfront
    payment from the LCA to the common stock issuance.

    Under the terms of the Common Stock Purchase Agreement, in the

    additional securities, such that Roche Finance would be able to
    maintain its ownership percentage in the Company. This right
    continues until the earlier of any sale by Roche Finance of

    Roche (&#147;Roche Germany&#148;). Under the terms of the
    Alnylam Europe Purchase Agreement, which became effective in
    August 2007, the Company created a new, wholly-owned German
    limited liability company (&#147;Roche Kulmbach&#148;) into
    which substantially all of the non-intellectual property assets
    of Alnylam Europe were transferred, and Roche Germany purchased

    recognition on multiple element arrangements, the license and
    assets of Alnylam Europe are not separable from the undelivered

    the Company bases its revenue recognition pattern on the final
    deliverable. Under the Roche alliance, the steering committee
    services and the Discovery Collaboration services are the final
    deliverables and all such services will end, contractually, five
    years from the effective date of the LCA.

    The Company is recognizing the Roche-related revenue on a

    reasonably estimate the total level of effort required to

    substantive milestones are achieved, the Company will recognize
    as revenue a portion of the milestone payment, equal to the
    percentage of the performance period completed when the
    milestone is achieved, multiplied by the amount of the milestone
    payment. The Company will recognize the remaining portion of the

    program under the collaboration and license agreement was
    substantially completed in accordance with the terms of the
    collaboration and license agreement, subject to certain
    surviving rights and obligations of the parties.

    Under the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, in October
    2005, Novartis purchased 5,267,865&#160;shares of the
    Company&#146;s common stock at a purchase price of $11.11 per
    share for an aggregate purchase price of $58.5&#160;million,
    which, after such issuance, represented 19.9% of the
    Company&#146;s outstanding common stock as of the date of
    issuance. In addition, under the Investor Rights Agreement, the
    Company granted Novartis the right to acquire additional equity
    securities in the event that the Company proposes to sell or
    issue any equity securities, subject to specified exceptions,
    such that Novartis would be able to maintain its then-current
    ownership percentage in the Company&#146;s outstanding common
    stock. This right continues until the earlier of any sale by
    Novartis of shares of the Company&#146;s common stock and the
    expiration or termination of the Collaboration and License
    Agreement, subject to certain exceptions. Pursuant to the terms
    of the Investor Rights Agreement, Novartis purchased an
    aggregate of 335,033&#160;shares of the Company&#146;s common
    stock, resulting in aggregate payments to the Company of
    $7.6&#160;million. These purchases allowed Novartis to maintain
    its ownership position of approximately 13.4% of the
    Company&#146;s outstanding common stock. The exercises of this
    right did not result in any changes to existing rights or any
    additional rights to Novartis. At December&#160;31, 2010,
    Novartis owned 13.2% of the Company&#146;s outstanding common
    stock.

    In consideration for the rights granted to Cubist under the
    Cubist Agreement, in January 2009, Cubist paid the Company an
    upfront cash payment of $20.0&#160;million. Cubist is also
    obligated under the Cubist Agreement to pay the Company
    milestone payments, totaling up to an aggregate of
    $82.5&#160;million, upon the achievement of specified
    development and sales events in the Royalty Territory. In
    addition, if Licensed Products are successfully developed,
    Cubist will be required to pay to the Company royalties on net
    sales of Licensed Products in the Royalty Territory, if any,
    subject to offsets under certain circumstances. Upon achievement
    of certain development milestones, the Company will have the
    right to convert the North American co-development and profit
    sharing arrangement into a royalty-bearing license and, in
    addition to royalties on net sales in North America, will be
    entitled to receive additional milestone payments totaling up to

    Tekmira for the discovery, development and commercialization of
    lipid nanoparticle formulations for the delivery of RNAi
    therapeutics. In connection with its original agreement with

    Massachusetts for its corporate headquarters under a
    non-cancelable operating lease agreement. In 2003, the Company
    entered into an operating lease with ARE-MA Region No.&#160;28
    LLC (the &#147;Landlord&#148;), to rent laboratory and office
    space located at 300 Third Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts (the
    &#147;Premises&#148;) through September 2011 (the &#147;Original
    Lease&#148;). In March 2006, the Company amended the Original
    Lease to rent additional space at the Premises (the &#147;First
    Amendment&#148;). In June 2009, the Company entered into an
    agreement with the Landlord further amending provisions of the
    Original Lease (the &#147;Second Amendment&#148;). The Second
    Amendment provided for the lease of the entire second floor of

    Amendments (as so amended, the &#147;Amended Lease&#148;), the
    Company leases a total of approximately 129,000&#160;square feet
    of office and laboratory space at the Premises. The term of the
    Amended Lease expires in September 2016. The Company has the
    option to extend the Amended Lease for two successive five-year
    extensions. The Company has separately agreed to sublease the
    first floor of the Premises through the end of 2011. As a result

    In June 2009, the Company joined with Max Planck Gesellschaft
    Zur Forderung Der Wissenschaften E.V. and Max Planck Innovation
    GmbH (collectively, &#147;Max Planck&#148;) in taking legal
    action against the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research
    (&#147;Whitehead&#148;), the Massachusetts Institute of
    Technology (&#147;MIT&#148;) and the Board of Trustees of the
    University of Massachusetts (&#147;UMass&#148;). The complaint,
    initially filed in the Suffolk County Superior Court in Boston,
    Massachusetts and subsequently removed to the U.S.&#160;District
    Court for the District of Massachusetts, alleges, among other
    things, that the defendants have improperly prosecuted the
    Tuschl I patent applications and wrongfully incorporated
    inventions covered by the Tuschl&#160;II patent applications
    into the Tuschl I patent applications, thereby potentially
    damaging the value of inventions reflected in the Tuschl I and
    Tuschl&#160;II patent applications. In the field of RNAi
    therapeutics, the Company is the exclusive licensee of the
    Tuschl I patent applications from Max Planck, MIT and Whitehead,
    and of the Tuschl&#160;II patent applications from Max Planck.

    The complaint seeks, among other things, a declaratory judgment
    regarding the prosecution of the Tuschl I patent family and
    unspecified monetary damages. In August 2009, Whitehead and
    UMass filed counterclaims against the Company and Max Planck,
    including for breach of contract. In January 2010, the Company
    and Max Planck filed an amended complaint expanding upon the
    allegations in the original complaint. The Company currently
    expects a jury trial to start in March 2011. In February 2010,
    the Company and Max Planck released MIT from any claims seeking
    monetary damages, and MIT has stipulated that it will be bound
    by any declaratory, injunctive, or equitable relief granted by
    the court.

    In addition, in September 2009, the U.S.&#160;Patent and
    Trademark Office (&#147;USPTO&#148;) granted Max Planck&#146;s
    petition to revoke power of attorney in connection with the
    prosecution of the Tuschl I patent application. This action
    prevents the defendants from filing any papers with the USPTO in
    connection with further prosecution of the Tuschl I patent
    application without the agreement of Max Planck.
    Whitehead&#146;s petition to overturn this ruling was denied.
    Prosecution before the USPTO for both the Tuschl I and&#160;II
    pending patent applications was suspended pursuant to a
    standstill agreement. This agreement expired on
    September&#160;15, 2010, and Max Planck, MIT, Whitehead and
    UMass filed several continuation applications in the Tuschl I
    patent family to preserve their rights

    Although the Company, along with Max Planck, are vigorously
    asserting their rights in this case, litigation is subject to
    inherent uncertainty and a court could ultimately rule against
    the Company and Max Planck. In addition, litigation is costly
    and may divert the attention of the Company&#146;s management
    and other resources that would otherwise be engaged in running
    the Company&#146;s business. The Company has not recorded an

    the Company&#146;s license agreements with Max Planck relating
    to the Tuschl I and Tuschl&#160;II patent applications, the
    Company is required to indemnify Max Planck for certain damages
    arising in connection with the intellectual property rights
    licensed under the agreements. Under the Max Planck
    indemnification agreement, the Company is responsible for paying
    the costs of any litigation relating to the license agreements
    or the underlying intellectual property rights, including the
    costs associated with the litigation described above. These
    costs are charged to general and administrative expense. The
    Company believes that the probability of receiving a claim for
    damages is remote and, as such, no amounts have been accrued
    related to this indemnification at December&#160;31, 2010 and

    The Company is also a party to a number of agreements entered
    into in the ordinary course of business, which contain typical
    provisions that obligate the Company to indemnify the other

    In June 2009, the Company&#146;s stockholders approved an

    amended (the &#147;2004 Plan&#148;). At December&#160;31, 2010,
    the Amended and Restated 2004 Plan provides for the granting of
    stock options to purchase up to 12,366,485&#160;shares of common

    options, restricted stock awards and units, stock appreciation
    rights and other stock-based awards to purchase up to
    2,200,000&#160;shares of common stock. The 2009 Plan has a

    option-pricing model. The Company&#146;s expected stock-price
    volatility assumption for 2010, 2009 and 2008 is based on a
    combination of implied volatilities of its publicly traded stock
    option prices as well as the historical volatility of the

    historical data of the Company&#146;s pharmaceutical and
    biotechnology peers. The dividend yield assumption is based on
    the fact that the Company has never paid cash dividends and has
    no present intention to pay cash dividends. The risk-free
    interest rate used for each grant is equal to the zero coupon
    rate for instruments with a similar expected life. The Company

    In 2004, the Company adopted the 2004 Employee Stock Purchase
    Plan (the &#147;2004 Purchase Plan&#148;) with
    315,789&#160;shares authorized for issuance. In June 2010, the
    Company&#146;s stockholders approved an amendment to the 2004
    Purchase Plan, which increased the shares authorized for
    issuance from 315,789&#160;shares to 715,789&#160;shares. Under
    the 2004 Purchase Plan, each offering period is six months, at
    the end of which employees may purchase shares of common stock
    through payroll deductions made over the term of the offering.
    The per-share purchase price at the end of each offering period
    is equal to the lesser of 85% of the closing price of the common
    stock at the beginning or end of the offering period. The
    Company issued 72,674, 59,267 and 35,065&#160;shares during the
    years ended December&#160;31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively,
    and at December&#160;31, 2010, 426,738&#160;shares were
    available for issuance under the 2004 Purchase Plan.

    The weighted average fair value of stock purchase rights granted
    as part of the 2004 Purchase Plan was $5.12, $7.20 and $9.51 per
    share for the years ended December&#160;31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. The fair value was estimated using the
    Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Company used a
    weighted-average stock-price volatility of 53%, expected option
    life assumption of six months and a risk-free interest rate of
    0.2%. The Company recorded $0.3&#160;million, $0.4&#160;million
    and $0.3&#160;million of stock-based compensation expense for
    the years ended December&#160;31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively, related to the 2004 Purchase Plan.

    The Company has evaluated the positive and negative evidence
    bearing upon the realizability of its deferred tax assets. The
    Company has concluded, in accordance with the applicable
    accounting standards, that it is more likely than not that the
    Company may not realize the benefit of all of its deferred tax
    assets. Accordingly, the Company has recorded a valuation
    allowance against the deferred tax assets that management
    believes will not be realized. The Company reevaluates the
    positive and negative evidence on a quarterly basis. The
    valuation allowance increased by $15.2&#160;million and
    $21.2&#160;million for the years ended December&#160;31, 2010
    and 2009, respectively, due primarily to an increase in tax
    credit carryforwards and operating losses.

    During 2009 and 2008, the Company utilized certain tax
    attributes, including net operating loss and tax credit
    carryforwards as a result of the recognition of revenue for
    certain proceeds received from strategic alliances. However, the
    Company also generated a deferred tax asset related to the
    recognition of this revenue for tax purposes and recorded a net
    deferred tax asset to the extent it was more likely than not
    that the asset would be realized. During 2010, the Company
    generated sufficient net operating losses to carry back to 2009
    and 2008 to obtain a refund of taxes paid in those years,
    resulting in a realization of its net deferred tax asset. As a
    result, during 2010 the Company reclassified $10.7&#160;million
    of its deferred tax asset to income taxes receivable. The
    Company expects to receive this income tax refund in 2011. At
    December&#160;31, 2010, the Company&#146;s net deferred tax
    assets are subject to a full valuation allowance as it is more
    likely than not that those assets will not be realized.

    The deferred tax assets above exclude $9.2&#160;million of net
    operating losses and $2.4&#160;million of federal and state
    research and development credits related to tax deductions from
    the exercise of stock options subsequent to the adoption of the
    2006 accounting standard on stock-based compensation. This
    amount represents an excess tax benefit and has not been

    At December&#160;31, 2010, the Company had federal and state net
    operating loss carryforwards of $27.5&#160;million and
    $101.6&#160;million, respectively, to reduce future taxable
    income that will expire at various dates through 2030. At
    December&#160;31, 2010, federal and state research and
    development credit carryforwards were $9.0&#160;million and
    $3.4&#160;million, respectively, available to reduce future tax
    liabilities that expire at various dates through 2030. At
    December&#160;31, 2010, foreign tax credit carryforwards were
    $3.1&#160;million available to reduce future tax liabilities
    that expire in 2017. At December&#160;31, 2010, alternative
    minimum tax credits of $0.8&#160;million are available to reduce
    future regular tax liabilities to the extent such regular tax
    less other non-refundable credits exceeds the tentative minimum
    tax. Ownership changes, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code,
    including those resulting from the issuance of common stock in
    connection with the Company&#146;s public offerings, may limit
    the amount of net operating loss that can be utilized to offset
    future taxable income or tax liability. The Company has
    determined that there is no limitation on the utilization of net
    operating loss carryforward in accordance with Section&#160;382
    of the Internal Revenue Code in 2010.

    The tax years 2003 through 2010 remain open to examination by
    major taxing jurisdictions to which the Company is subject,
    which are primarily in the United States, as carryforward
    attributes generated in years past may still be adjusted upon
    examination by the Internal Revenue Service or state tax
    authorities if they have or will be used in a future period. The
    Company is currently under audit by the Internal Revenue Service
    for the 2008 tax year. The Company believes that it has provided
    sufficiently for all significant audit exposures. There is a
    possibility that the Company may not prevail in defending all of
    its assertions with the Internal Revenue Service. If these
    matters are resolved unfavorably in the future, the resolution
    could have a material adverse impact on the Company&#146;s
    future effective tax rate and its results of operations. The
    Company recognizes both accrued interest and penalties related
    to unrecognized benefits in income tax expense. The Company has
    not recorded any interest and penalties on any unrecognized tax
    benefits since its inception.

    contribution to Regulus of $10.0&#160;million, resulting in the
    Company and Isis making approximately equal aggregate initial
    capital contributions to Regulus. In March 2009, the Company and

    In April 2008, Regulus entered into a worldwide strategic
    alliance with GlaxoSmithKline (&#147;GSK&#148;) to discover,
    develop and commercialize up to four novel microRNA-targeted
    therapeutics to treat inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid
    arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. In connection with
    this alliance, Regulus received $20.0&#160;million in upfront
    payments from GSK, including a $15.0&#160;million option fee and
    a loan of $5.0&#160;million (guaranteed by Isis and the Company)
    that will convert into Regulus common stock under certain
    specified circumstances. Regulus is eligible to receive
    development, regulatory and sales milestone payments for each of
    the microRNA-targeted therapeutics discovered and developed as
    part of the alliance. Regulus would also receive royalty
    payments on worldwide sales of products resulting from the
    alliance, if any.

    In February 2010, Regulus and GSK established a new
    collaboration to develop and commercialize microRNA therapeutics
    targeting miR-122 in all fields, with the treatment of
    hepatitis&#160;C virus infection as the lead indication. Under
    the terms of this collaboration, Regulus received
    $8.0&#160;million in upfront payments from GSK, including a
    $3.0&#160;million license fee and a loan of $5.0&#160;million
    (guaranteed by Isis and the Company) that will convert into
    Regulus common stock under certain specified circumstances.
    Consistent with the original GSK alliance, Regulus is eligible
    to receive development, regulatory and sales milestone payments,
    as well as royalty payments on worldwide sales of products
    resulting from the alliance, if any, as Regulus and GSK advance
    microRNA therapeutics targeting miR-122.

    In June 2010, Regulus entered into a global, strategic alliance
    with sanofi-aventis to discover, develop and commercialize
    microRNA therapeutics on up to four microRNA targets. Under the
    terms of this alliance, Regulus received $25.0&#160;million in
    upfront fees and is entitled to annual research support for
    three years with the option to extend research support for two
    additional years. In addition, Regulus is eligible to receive
    royalties on microRNA therapeutic products commercialized by
    sanofi-aventis, if any. The Company and Isis are each eligible
    to receive 7.5% of all potential upfront and milestone payments,
    in addition to single-digit royalties on product sales, if any.
    During the year ended December&#160;31, 2010, the Company
    recognized $1.9&#160;million in related-party revenues in
    connection with this alliance in its consolidated statements of
    operations, representing 7.5% of the $25.0&#160;million upfront

    The Company accounts for its investment in Regulus using the
    equity method of accounting. Through December&#160;31, 2008, the
    Company was recognizing the first $10.0&#160;million of losses
    of Regulus as equity in loss of joint venture (Regulus
    Therapeutics Inc.) in its consolidated statements of operations
    because the Company was responsible for funding those losses
    through its initial $10.0&#160;million cash contribution. As a
    result of the $10.0&#160;million equity investment made by
    sanofi-aventis, the Company recognized a gain of
    $4.4&#160;million due to the increase in valuation of Regulus.
    This amount was recorded as other income in the Company&#146;s
    consolidated statements of operations for the year ended
    December&#160;31, 2010. Beginning in January 2009, in connection
    with the conversion of Regulus to a C corporation, through
    September&#160;30, 2010, the Company was recognizing
    approximately 49% of the losses of Regulus. The carrying value
    of the Company&#146;s investment in joint venture (Regulus
    Therapeutics Inc.) immediately prior to the conversion to a C
    corporation exceeded 49% of the net assets of Regulus by
    approximately $0.8&#160;million. Upon conversion, this amount
    was allocated to the intellectual property of Regulus and,
    because the intellectual property was determined to be
    in-process research and development, the $0.8&#160;million was
    recorded as a charge to expense. This charge is included in
    equity in loss of joint venture (Regulus Therapeutics Inc.) in
    the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended
    December&#160;31, 2009. In October&#160;2010, sanofi-aventis
    made a $10.0&#160;million equity investment in Regulus,
    resulting in sanofi-aventis owning approximately 9% of Regulus.
    Following this investment, the Company and Isis own
    approximately 45% and 46%, respectively, of Regulus. Under the
    equity method, the reimbursement of expenses to the Company is
    recorded as a reduction to research and development expenses.
    Summary results of Regulus&#146; operations for the years ended
    December&#160;31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 and balance sheets at
    December&#160;31, 2010 and 2009 are presented in the tables

    Our management, with the participation of our chief executive
    officer and vice president of finance and treasurer, evaluated
    the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as
    of December&#160;31, 2010. The term &#147;disclosure controls
    and procedures,&#148; as defined in
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">Rules&#160;13a-15(e)</FONT>
    and
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">15d-15(e)</FONT>
    under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a
    company that are designed to ensure that information required to
    be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or
    submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
    summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in
    the SEC&#146;s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and
    procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures
    designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by
    a company in the reports that it files or submits under the
    Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the
    company&#146;s management, including its principal executive and
    principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely
    decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes
    that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed
    and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving
    their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment
    in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls
    and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure
    controls and procedures as of December&#160;31, 2010, the
    Company&#146;s chief executive officer and vice president of
    finance and treasurer concluded that, as of such date, our
    disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the
    reasonable assurance level.
