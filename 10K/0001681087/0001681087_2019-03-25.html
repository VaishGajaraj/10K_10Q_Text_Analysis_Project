stage gene therapy company focused on developing potentially curative <I>ex vivo</I> lentiviral-based gene therapies to treat patients with rare diseases following a single dose treatment regimen. Our gene therapies employ hematopoietic stem cells
that are harvested from the patient and then modified with lentiviral vectors to insert a functional copy of the gene that is defective in the target disease. We believe that our approach, which is designed to transform stem cells from patients into
therapeutic products, has the potential to provide curative benefit for a range of diseases. Our initial focus is on a group of rare genetic diseases referred to as lysosomal storage diseases, some of which today are primarily managed with enzyme
replacement therapies, or ERTs. These lysosomal storage diseases have well-understood biologies, identified patient populations, established standards of care yet with significant unmet needs, and represent large market opportunities with
approximately $4.0&nbsp;billion in worldwide net sales in 2017. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our initial pipeline is comprised of four lentiviral-based gene therapy
programs, including <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">AVR-RD-01</FONT></FONT> for the treatment of Fabry disease, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">AVR-RD-02</FONT></FONT> for the
treatment of Gaucher disease, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">AVR-RD-04</FONT></FONT> for the treatment of cystinosis and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">AVR-RD-03</FONT></FONT> for
the treatment of Pompe disease. <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">AVR-RD-01</FONT></FONT> is currently being evaluated in an investigator-sponsored Phase&nbsp;1 clinical trial and a company-sponsored Phase 2 clinical
trial and a total of seven patients have been dosed across both trials as of March&nbsp;15, 2019. To date, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">AVR-RD-01</FONT></FONT> has demonstrated significant increased enzyme
activity, with plasma &#945;-galactosidase A, or AGA, enzyme activity levels in the first four patients treated in the investigator-sponsored Phase&nbsp;1 clinical trial and the first patient in our company-sponsored Phase 2 clinical trial, for whom
we have provided interim data, increasing above the range for males with classical Fabry disease, defined as less than 1&nbsp;nmol/hr/ml. The fifth patient in the investigator-sponsored Phase 1 clinical trial of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">AVR-RD-01</FONT></FONT> was dosed on February&nbsp;21, 2019, and we do not expect any further enrollment in this investigator-sponsored clinical trial. On December&nbsp;13, 2018, the second patient was dosed in our
company-sponsored Phase&nbsp;2 clinical trial of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">AVR-RD-01.</FONT></FONT> In addition, Phase&nbsp;1/2 clinical trials for both <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">AVR-RD-02</FONT></FONT> and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">AVR-RD-04</FONT></FONT> are being planned and we expect patients will be dosed in the second half of 2019. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Since its first clinical use in 2003, lentiviral-based gene therapy has been observed to be well-tolerated in third parties&#146; clinical
trials for rare diseases such as beta thalassemia, adrenoleukodystrophy, or ALD, metachromatic leukodystrophy, or MLD, and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">ADA-SCID.</FONT> The use of <I>ex vivo</I> lentiviral-based gene therapies was initially
restricted primarily to the most acutely severe diseases where the risks of the typical requirement for ablating the patients&#146; bone marrow, which significantly impairs those patients&#146; immune systems, had a clinically justifiable
risk/benefit profile due to the novelty of the approach and the severity of the diseases. To date, over 200 patients have been treated with lentiviral-based gene therapies in third parties&#146; and our rare disease clinical trials, and we believe
the technology can be developed for other serious conditions based on a rigorous risk/benefit assessment. The ablation procedure, also known as the conditioning regimen, is an inherent part of the <I>ex vivo</I> gene therapy treatment procedure and
is administered prior to the gene therapy. The more intensive the conditioning regimen, the greater the risk of toxicity. However, we believe the risk of toxicity can be managed through utilization of therapeutic drug monitoring, or TDM. We are
refining our approach to conditioning to use a single-agent, myeloablative conditioning regimen administered in conjunction with TDM, which is designed to permit patients to receive appropriate levels of conditioning to promote long-term engraftment
while seeking to lessen toxicity. Such an approach could potentially allow the conditioning regimen to be performed during a limited hospital stay or potentially through an outpatient procedure, on a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">case-by-case</FONT></FONT> basis as may be directed by the patient&#146;s physician. We believe our approach, utilizing a single myeloablative conditioning agent, coupled </P>

with TDM, has the potential to extend the reach of our gene therapies to a broad range of diseases as first-line therapies. Our goal is to broaden the applicability of lentiviral-based gene
therapy by initially targeting diseases with tractable gene mutations, well-understood biology and that benefit from the sustained systemic delivery of an active protein. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are initially targeting rare lysosomal storage diseases in which current standard of care provides the mechanistic proof that the enzymes
or proteins produced endogenously following treatment with our gene therapies can offer benefit to patients. Typically, in lysosomal storage diseases, a gene mutation results in the deficiency or malfunctioning of an enzyme or other protein. This
results in the inability of lysosomes to properly process cellular byproducts. As a result, these byproducts accumulate to toxic levels in the body&#146;s cells and, in turn, disrupt the function of multiple tissues and organs. Fabry disease,
Gaucher disease and Pompe disease are currently primarily managed by <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">bi-weekly,</FONT> multi-hour infusions with ERTs that seek to exogenously replace the missing enzyme. However, most ERTs typically only remain in
the plasma for a short period of time and thus are not ideal because they are only dosed every two weeks. These existing therapies manage, rather than cure, the underlying diseases and, as a result, patients continue to have disease progression.
Further, the frequent, periodic and life-long dosing schedule required for ERTs results in significant costs for the healthcare system and is burdensome for the patient. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe our gene therapies leverage the well-understood mechanism of ERTs by transforming a patient&#146;s own cells into a drug product
that enables the patient to express functional enzyme or other protein and mirror the biology seen in an otherwise healthy individual. We believe that a single dose of our gene therapies may provide meaningful life-long benefit to these patients and
potentially halt the progression of these diseases while also providing significant health economic advantages. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our programs leverage
years of extensive preclinical and early clinical research by leading researchers, as well as our internal research and ongoing clinical efforts. The status of our initial lentiviral-based gene therapy programs is reflected below. </P>

a lentiviral vector. In an ongoing investigator-sponsored Phase&nbsp;1 clinical trial of patients with Fabry disease, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">AVR-RD-01</FONT></FONT> has been observed to be well-tolerated
and has led to the production of active AGA enzyme in the first four patients treated for whom we have provided interim data. In all four patients, the level of AGA enzyme activity began to rise from nearly undetectable levels before treatment to
levels above the range for males with classical Fabry disease. In this clinical trial, the protocol provides that ERT for these patients is suspended one month prior to receiving
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">AVR-RD-01</FONT></FONT> and ERT is then resumed one month after the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">AVR-RD-01</FONT></FONT> treatment and continued

these diseases affects a meaningful number of patients, has a suboptimal standard of care with unmet medical need and, we believe, is appropriate for lentiviral-based gene therapy. We believe our approach addresses the shortcomings of existing

lentiviral-based gene therapy to treat numerous diseases. We believe that we will be able to demonstrate durable effects in our targeted diseases utilizing a single myeloablative agent, busulfan, which we are transitioning to as part of implementing
our plato platform. Busulfan is mildly immunosuppressive and is designed to be personalized to each patient using TDM to achieve the desired level of conditioning to allow for gene therapy administration while limiting complications. We believe our
approach to conditioning has the potential for reduced short- and long-term toxicities and effective long-term engraftment. If realized, we believe these benefits may promote lentiviral-based gene therapy as a therapeutic option for less acutely
severe diseases or diseases with approved therapies in which large unmet medical needs remain. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Prior to the reintroduction of <I>ex vivo
</I>modified stem cells, a conditioning regimen is generally required to remove existing stem cells from the bone marrow in order to create space for the modified stem cells. Creating sufficient space in the bone marrow for the lentivirally-modified
hematopoietic stem cells is required to enable the cells to engraft long-term and produce their progeny cells. Ablation requires the use of cytotoxic drugs that can transiently compromise the patient&#146;s immune system, known as neutropenia, and
ability to form blood clots, known as thrombocytopenia. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Since its first clinical use in 2003, lentiviral-based gene therapy has been
observed to be well-tolerated in third parties&#146; clinical trials for rare diseases such as beta thalassemia, ALD, MLD and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">ADA-SCID.</FONT> The use of <I>ex&nbsp;vivo</I> lentiviral-based gene therapies was
initially restricted primarily to the most acutely severe diseases where the risks of the typical requirement for ablating the patients&#146; bone marrow, which significantly impairs those patients&#146; immune systems, had a clinically justifiable
risk/benefit profile due to the novelty of the approach and the severity of the diseases. To date, over 200 patients have been treated with lentiviral-based gene therapies in third parties&#146; and our rare disease clinical trials, and we believe
the technology can be developed for other serious conditions based on a rigorous risk/benefit assessment. The ablation procedure, also known as the conditioning regimen, is an inherent part of the <I>ex vivo</I> gene therapy treatment procedure, and
is administered prior to the gene therapy. The more intensive the conditioning regimen, the greater the risk of toxicity. However, we believe the risk of toxicity can be managed through utilization of therapeutic drug monitoring, or TDM. We are
refining our approach to conditioning to use a single-agent, myeloablative conditioning regimen administered in conjunction with TDM, which is designed to permit patients to receive appropriate levels of conditioning to promote long-term engraftment
while seeking to lessen toxicity. Such an approach could potentially allow the conditioning regimen to be performed during a limited hospital stay or potentially through an outpatient procedure, on a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">case-by-case</FONT></FONT> basis as may be directed by the patient&#146;s physician. We believe our approach of choosing diseases where a single myeloablative conditioning agent, coupled with TDM, can manage patient
tolerability, which has the potential to extend the reach of our gene therapies to a broad range of diseases as first-line therapies. Our goal is to broaden the applicability of lentiviral-based gene therapy by initially targeting diseases with
tractable gene mutations, well-understood biology and that benefit from the sustained systemic delivery of an active protein. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>plato: Our

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The conditioning regimen that we have historically employed utilizes melphalan, a common chemotherapy drug, to ablate the patient&#146;s bone
marrow. As part of the upgrades to our plato platform, we intend to transition to utilizing busulfan, another chemotherapy drug, that has been in use since the 1950&#146;s. Busulfan is indicated for use in combination with cyclophosphamide as a
conditioning regimen prior to allogeneic stem cell transplantation for chronic myeloid leukemia. Busulfan is routinely used in conditioning regimens before allogeneic stem cell transplantations for both malignant and
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-malignant</FONT> conditions. It has also been used as a single-agent, or in combination with an immunosuppressive agent, such as cyclophosphamide, in conditioning regimens prior to <I>ex vivo</I> gene therapy
transplants. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe that the transition to busulfan for our conditioning regimen may confer several advantages. For example, busulfan
will permit utilization of TDM in our conditioning regimen, thereby enabling physicians to personalize the dosing to each patient by titrating over four days to enhance patient tolerability to the conditioning procedure and promote cell engraftment.
By contrast, melphalan is administered once with no TDM, and may cause concern of conditioning-related toxicity across patients due to individual differences in metabolism of the drug. In addition, we believe that the utilization of busulfan in our
single-agent myeloablative conditioning regimen may have the potential to allow our gene therapies to cross the blood-brain barrier, a feature which may yield therapeutic benefit in diseases that have a central nervous system component, such as
Fabry disease, Gaucher disease, Pompe disease and other rare and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-rare</FONT> diseases. Finally, our busulfan conditioning regimen is designed to create more space in the ablated bone marrow compared to melphalan
and may increase the average VCN of the patient bone marrow following treatment with the drug product, which are features that we believe will promote better cell engraftment and durability of the gene therapy. </P>

contributing factor to this secondary malignancy. However, we have reviewed over 700 published cases of busulfan exposure preceding bone marrow transplant, hematopoietic cell transplant, or ex-vivo gene therapy for non-malignant indications, of
which 648 were from peer-reviewed literature. Of the 648 busulfan exposures reported in peer-reviewed literature, none of the cases reported t-MDS. Of the 67 exposures reported in non-peer-reviewed published abstracts, 66&nbsp;reported no cases of
t-MDS resulting from busulfan exposure, and in one case it was reported that a patient developed t-MDS. In that case, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, busulfan treatment was posited to be a contributing factor. We believe that due to the
presence of other confounding factors in the patient, the cause of that patient&#146;s t-MDS has not been conclusively determined. We also intend to utilize molecular cytogenetic screening to further reduce such risks to patients. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">While the busulfan conditioning regimen is more intensive than the original conditioning regimen that utilizes melphalan, we believe it is
still milder than some of the more aggressive conditioning regimens associated with gene therapies for other diseases, such as when busulfan is used in combination with cyclophosphamide, used at a higher dose, or when TDM is not applied.
Furthermore, we believe our conditioning regimen may produce the desired effect while potentially allowing for a limited hospital stay or potentially for an outpatient procedure, on a

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Fabry disease is a rare lysosomal storage disease associated with significant morbidity and early mortality. It is caused by a gene defect that
causes a deficiency of AGA, which breaks down a particular type of fat in the body&#146;s cells known as globotriaosylceramide, or Gb3. As Gb3 and other related substrates increase in patients with Fabry disease, these become toxic to the
patient&#146;s cells. Gb3 and other glycosphingolipids accumulate and result in damage to the kidneys, heart and brain. Accumulation of Gb3 in tissues such as the heart and the vascular system can lead to life threatening vascular blockages and thus
stroke and heart attacks. In addition, high levels of Gb3 substrate accumulation in the kidney can cause kidney failure. Gb3 can also accumulate in other tissues, such as the nervous system where it leads to debilitating pain. Due to <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">end-stage</FONT> renal disease and other life-threatening complications associated with Fabry disease, the average life expectancy in affected males is approximately 58 years of age. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Most patients with Fabry disease begin experiencing chronic pain in childhood but are often not diagnosed with Fabry disease until their

associated with Fabry disease have been identified. It is estimated that Fabry disease is diagnosed in approximately one in 40,000 males and one in 118,000 females in the United States, but
studies have suggested that a larger number of patients may be undiagnosed. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Fabry disease is an
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">X-linked</FONT> disorder, meaning the gene that is responsible is located on the X chromosome. Because males have only one X chromosome, an abnormal copy of the gene that causes Fabry disease is sufficient to cause
the disease.&nbsp;However, unlike other <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">X-linked</FONT> disorders, where female carriers of an abnormal gene are usually unaffected, Fabry disease also often causes significant morbidity in females who inherit one
abnormal copy and one normal copy of the gene associated with the disease. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Limitations of Current Therapies </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Fabry disease is primarily treated with periodic infusions of ERT consisting of AGA enzyme over the patient&#146;s lifetime. The most commonly
prescribed ERTs for Fabry disease are Fabrazyme, marketed by Sanofi Genzyme, and Replagal, marketed by Shire, which was acquired by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd. In 2018, Fabrazyme and Replagal generated worldwide net sales of over
$855&nbsp;million and $490&nbsp;million, respectively. The annual average cost to the healthcare system per patient prescribed Fabrazyme in the United States is approximately $320,000. In addition, because ERTs are not curative and only slow, but do
not halt, the progression of disease, patients deteriorate and the healthcare system incurs significant costs associated with recurring medical interventions. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Although ERT provides therapeutic benefit and can reduce Gb3 substrate levels and extend a patient&#146;s life expectancy, ERT requires
chronic infusions throughout the patient&#146;s life. Patients prescribed ERT generally receive an infusion every other week. However, because of their suboptimal pharmacokinetics, ERTs only temporarily increase plasma enzyme levels. As a result,
patients with Fabry disease prescribed ERT continue to have disease progression, including ongoing decline in renal function, potentially including renal failure, cardiovascular disease and ongoing debilitating pain including periods of severe pain
crisis. Physicians report that patients have recurrence of symptoms as the therapeutic effect of ERT wanes between <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">bi-weekly</FONT> treatments. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Alternatives to ERT for patients with Fabry disease are limited. Galafold (migalastat), an oral therapy marketed by Amicus, was approved by
the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, in May 2016, and by the FDA in August 2018. Amicus reports that only 35% to 50% of the gene mutations associated with Fabry disease are amenable to migalastat. </P>

conducted by the University Health Network, or UHN, and sponsored by Fabry Disease Clinical Research and Therapeutics, or FACTs, at three centers in Canada, a total of five patients with Fabry disease who have been treated with ERT for at least six
months have been enrolled, and enrollment is complete. In this clinical trial, ERT for these patients is suspended one month prior to receiving <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">AVR-RD-01</FONT></FONT> and ERT is then
resumed one month after the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">AVR-RD-01</FONT></FONT> treatment and continued at <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">bi-weekly</FONT> intervals. The protocol has been amended to allow the
investigator team, at their discretion, to discontinue ERT six months after treatment with <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">AVR-RD-01.</FONT></FONT> The fifth patient is the last to be enrolled and was dosed
February&nbsp;21, 2019. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The primary goal for this clinical trial is to assess the safety and toxicity of
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">AVR-RD-01</FONT></FONT> as measured by the frequency or severity of clinically notable abnormal vital signs and laboratory values and the frequency or severity of treatment-related
adverse events. The safety of our initial, academic-based conditioning regimen is also being assessed in this clinical trial. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A secondary
objective for this clinical trial is to obtain preliminary efficacy signals of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">AVR-RD-01</FONT></FONT> therapy as assessed by AGA enzyme activity. Plasma AGA enzyme activity derived
from administration of ERT decreases rapidly after administration with no residual plasma activity remaining approximately one day after treatment. To evaluate the ability of
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">AVR-RD-01</FONT></FONT> to increase enzyme activity, the level of AGA activity was assessed in a patient immediately prior to the administration of the patient&#146;s next dose of
ERT, when limited or no plasma AGA activity from previously-administered ERT dose would be expected. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">All five patients in this clinical
trial have been dosed. To date, the treatment was generally well-tolerated. In addition, in the first four patients for whom we have provided interim data, all of whom are males with classical Fabry disease, the level of plasma AGA enzyme activity
began to rise after infusion. Plasma AGA enzyme activity was observed to increase from nearly undetectable levels before treatment to a peak within six months after treatment, followed by a decline and trending to stablilize to levels above the
range for males with classical Fabry disease, defined as less than 1 nmol/hr/ml. We believe that the steep initial increase reflects AGA enzyme activity from the early progeny of the transduced stem cells, while the subsequent decline and
stabilization in AGA enzyme levels reflect a shift from short term progenitor cells towards the gradual secretion of AGA enzyme by long-term engraftment cells that become more predominant over time. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of 22 months after receiving <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">AVR-RD-01,</FONT></FONT> the first
patient&#146;s plasma AGA enzyme activity levels continued to be above the range for males with classical Fabry disease. Based on the level of endogenously produced enzyme activity, at the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">18-month</FONT> <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">follow-up</FONT> visit for this patient, the investigator team for the trial made a clinical decision to discontinue the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">bi-weekly</FONT> ERT and the patient remains off ERT as of 22 months
post-treatment with <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">AVR-RD-01.</FONT></FONT> Additionally, the third patient in this clinical trial voluntarily elected not to resume his regular
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">bi-weekly</FONT> treatment with ERT, and the patient remains off ERT as of six months post-treatment with <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">AVR-RD-01.</FONT></FONT> The second and
fourth patients continue to receive concurrent ERT in accordance with the clinical trial protocol. Plasma AGA enzyme activity levels in the first, second, third and fourth patients remained above the range for males with classical Fabry disease,
defined as less than 1 nmol/hr/ml, as of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">twenty-two</FONT> months, twelve months, six months and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">twenty-two</FONT> days after treatment, respectively. We believe these preliminary
results, particularly from the first two patients in the trial with longer-term AGA data points reported, support the potential of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">AVR-RD-01</FONT></FONT> to drive functional enzyme
production for long durations. </P>

for disease activity and treatment response for Fabry disease. In the case of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">ERT-na&iuml;ve</FONT> patients and patients who have discontinued ERT, we believe that reductions in Gb3 levels following treatment with

<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">AVR-RD-01.</FONT></FONT> This study was initiated in June 2018 in Australia and enrollment in this Phase&nbsp;2 clinical trial is ongoing. Eight to 12
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">treatment-na&iuml;ve</FONT> males, 16 years and older, with classical Fabry disease are expected to be enrolled in this trial. Our objectives for this trial are to assess safety and efficacy as measured by multiple
indicators, such as AGA enzyme activity, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">lyso-Gb3</FONT> and Gb3 levels in blood and various tissues, kidney and cardiac function, gastrointestinal symptoms, and pain and quality of life scores. All enrolled patients
will receive a single treatment with <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">AVR-RD-01</FONT></FONT> and will be followed for 48 weeks to measure safety and efficacy. We received approval from both the Australian and
Canadian regulatory authorities to initiate our Phase 2 clinical trial for <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">AVR-RD-01.</FONT></FONT> We also plan to submit applications to allow commencement of clinical trials in the
United States to the FDA and in Japan to the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency, or PMDA, following meetings with each of these respective regulatory authorities. For the United States specifically, in 2018 we held a <FONT

<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">AVR-RD-01</FONT></FONT> in 2019. The second patient in our Phase 2 clinical trial was dosed at an Australian site on December&nbsp;13, 2018 and the data safety monitoring committee

STYLE="white-space:nowrap">AVR-RD-01,</FONT></FONT> AGA enzyme activity was observed to increase in the first patient to levels well above the level associated with classical Fabry disease in males. These enzyme levels were sustained at three months
and six months after treatment. As of six months after receiving <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">AVR-RD-01,</FONT></FONT> the level of AGA enzyme activity for the first patient was 2.9&nbsp;nmol/hr/ml. In addition,
during the first three months after treatment, we observed a rapid decline in <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">lyso-Gb3</FONT> levels, which stabilized at significantly lower levels compared to those prior to treatment. Within six months of
treatment with <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">AVR-RD-01,</FONT></FONT> skin biopsy assessment revealed that the first patient also achieved a substantial reduction in substrate inclusions in capillary endothelium
of the skin. The skin biopsies were evaluated using a standard scoring system for Gb3 accumulation and clearance. The scoring system has a range of zero to 3, with a score of zero representing none or trace accumulation, and a score of 3
representing severe accumulation. This patient scored a 3 at baseline and scored a 2 at six months after treatment with <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">AVR-RD-01,</FONT></FONT> as assessed by two independent blinded
readers. The first patient in this clinical trial, who never received ERT, had a plasma <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">lyso-Gb3</FONT> level of 31 nmol/hr/ml at six months after treatment with <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT

glucocerebroside from the breakdown of old red and white blood cells is inhibited, leading to its accumulation in macrophages. These abnormal macrophages, known as Gaucher cells, accumulate in
multiple organs, particularly the liver, spleen and bone marrow. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Gaucher disease is one of the most common lysosomal storage diseases. It
is diagnosed in approximately one in 44,000&nbsp;births worldwide and is more prevalent in certain ethnic groups, such as people of Ashkenazi Jewish heritage. Approximately 90% of patients suffering from Gaucher disease in western countries have
Type&nbsp;1 Gaucher disease, which manifests as multiple morbidities including enlargement of the spleen and liver, low red blood cells, or anemia, low platelet count, or thrombocytopenia, and bone abnormalities including bone pain, fractures and
arthritis. Bruising, risk of bleeding and fatigue are common due to the thrombocytopenia and anemia. Compared with the general population, patients with Type 1 Gaucher disease have an approximately <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">20-fold</FONT>
increased risk of developing Parkinson&#146;s disease. Type&nbsp;1 Gaucher disease does not have manifestations of central nervous system symptoms. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Limitations of Current Therapies </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Type 1 Gaucher disease is currently treated with <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">bi-weekly</FONT> infusions of ERT consisting of recombinant
GCase over a patient&#146;s lifetime. The most commonly prescribed ERTs for Gaucher disease are Cerezyme, marketed by Sanofi Genzyme, and VPRIV, marketed by Shire. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Although long-term ERT for Gaucher disease results in some therapeutic benefit, ERTs leave patients with significant unmet needs. Twenty-five
percent of patients with Gaucher disease continue to experience physical limitations following two years of ERT, and a clinically significant percentage of patients continue to experience bone pain, thrombocytopenia and enlargement of spleen
following ten years of ERT. In a published study of ERT therapy for Gaucher disease, six target goals were evaluated, including parameters for hemoglobin and platelet levels, spleen and liver volumes, and general bone pain and severe disabling bone
pain known as bone crisis. Following at least four years of ERT in this study, approximately 60% of patients failed to achieve one or more of these six target goals. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition to ERTs, the FDA has approved several oral therapies for the treatment of Gaucher disease, including Zavesca (miglustat) marketed
by Actelion and Cerdelga (eliglustat) marketed by Sanofi Genzyme. We believe these oral therapies also provide suboptimal treatment. Zavesca is approved as a second line therapy and is associated with significant toxicities, including diarrhea,
weight loss and tremors. Cerdelga is not approved for use in children, has highly variable metabolism due to <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">patient-to-patient</FONT></FONT> genetic variations and is highly
susceptible to interactions with other drugs. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Both ERTs and oral therapies for Gaucher impose significant costs on the healthcare system.
In the United States, the annual average cost to the healthcare system per patient prescribed Cerezyme or VPRIV is between approximately $325,000 and $400,000. The annual average cost to the healthcare system per patient prescribed Cerdelga is
approximately $250,000. In 2018, Sanofi Genzyme&#146;s Cerezyme and Cerdelga together generated worldwide net sales of over $1.0&nbsp;billion and Shire&#146;s VPRIV generated worldwide net sales of approximately $362&nbsp;million. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Cystinosis is a rare, genetic, autosomal recessive, lysosomal storage disease caused by the accumulation of the amino acid cystine that is
produced in the lysosomes of cells as the result of protein degradation. Cystine is normally transported through the lysosomal membrane to the cytosol where it is reutilized after its transformation to cysteine. In cystinosis, cystine accumulates
inside the lysosomes because of a defect in the gene that encodes cystinosin, a protein that transports cystine across the lysosomal membrane. Cystine is poorly soluble and forms crystals as its concentration increases. These crystals build up and
cause complications in many organs and tissues. The kidneys and eyes are especially vulnerable to damage, and the muscles, thyroid, pancreas and testes may also be affected. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The most severe form of cystinosis begins in infancy, causing poor growth and a particular type of kidney damage in which certain molecules,
such as glucose, amino acids, phosphate, and bicarbonate, that should be reabsorbed into the bloodstream are instead eliminated in the urine. These renal problems ultimately lead to impaired growth and may result in soft, bowed bones, especially in
the legs. By the time the patient is approximately two years old, cystine crystals may be present in the cornea, and the buildup of these crystals in the eye causes pain and an increased sensitivity to light. Untreated children with cystinosis may
experience complete kidney failure by the age of ten. Other signs and symptoms that may occur in untreated patients, especially after adolescence, include muscle deterioration, blindness, inability to swallow, diabetes, thyroid and nervous system
problems. More than 90% of untreated patients require a kidney transplant before the age of 20. It is estimated that cystinosis disease is diagnosed in approximately one in 170,000 people. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Cystinosis is currently treated with two oral formulations of cysteamine that enter the lysosome and stimulate the breakdown of cystine into
products that do not require the cystinosin protein to be transported. Oral treatment can delay the development of kidney failure by six to ten years if it is started at a very early age, however it cannot prevent kidney failure or the development
of other complications, such as the formation of cystine crystals in the cornea. The approved oral therapies for cystinosis are Procysbi (delayed release cysteamine bitartrate), marketed by Horizon Orphan and Cystagon (cysteamine bitartrate)
marketed by Mylan and Recordati S.p.A. In 2018, Procysbi generated worldwide net sales of $155&nbsp;million. The annual average cost to the healthcare system per patient prescribed Procysbi in the United States is between approximately $625,000 and
$750,000. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Procysbi and Cystagon must be taken orally every 12 or six hours, respectively, leading to significant pill burden and
compliance challenges. Because cysteamine works by directly binding to cystine, rather than through a typical small molecule that inhibits an enzyme or receptor, a substantial quantity is required. For adults, this can mean taking at least 12
capsules twice a day, every day. Oral therapy with cysteamine is associated with a high degree of noncompliance due to the frequency with which it must be dosed and the accompanying nausea, as well as the acrid sulfur smell that it produces in the
breath and body. It has been estimated that only one third of patients are able to adhere to the strict dosing schedule. Studies have shown that adherence diminishes over time in adolescents and adults despite disease impact. Further, oral
cysteamine treatment has no effect on ocular cystine crystals deposits, thus requiring patients to be treated with topical cysteamine eye drops which must be applied each hour the patient is awake. </P>

transplant using normal mouse stem cells led to the reduction of cystine crystals in the cornea, a clinically significant tissue in patients with cystinsosis. In this cystinosis mouse model, affected mice develop eye disease similar to humans,
including crystal deposits in the cornea, central corneal opacification, loss of corneal cellular architecture and eventually a scarred, shrunken eye with no function. Published results from this study demonstrate that abundant hematopoietic stem
cell-derived macrophages migrated into the cornea and provided functional cystinosin-bearing lysosomes to the corneal cells. The images below reflect the elimination of cystine crystals in the cornea of the mice following engraftment of the modified
allogeneic stem cells. As the level of allogeneic stem cell engraftment increased, greater elimination of the cystine crystals was observed. This indicates that stem cells can migrate to the cornea and cross-correct corneal cells. This result
demonstrates that it is possible to correct for the defective cystinosin gene in the eye indirectly through expression of the gene in hematopoietic cells. </P>

for the treatment of Pompe disease. We will manufacture <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">AVR-RD-03</FONT></FONT> from hematopoietic stem cells that are first harvested from the patient, modified to add the gene that
encodes for acid alpha glucosidase A, or GAA, attached to a peptide sequence known as a glycosylation-independent lysosomal targeting, or GILT, tag and then infused into the patient.
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">AVR-RD-03</FONT></FONT> will incorporate a GILT tag because the GILT tag has been found to increase the uptake of GAA into cells, especially in muscle cells by a multiple of 25, which
is a particularly important target tissue for patients with Pompe disease and a target tissue that is considered difficult to access for ERT. <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">AVR-RD-03</FONT></FONT> is designed to
incorporate a proprietary potent promoter to increase volume of system enzyme in circulation. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Disease Overview </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Pompe disease is a rare, autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease caused by a mutation in the gene that encodes for GAA that results in
the buildup of glycogen, a complex sugar, in the body&#146;s cells. The accumulation of glycogen in certain organs and tissues, especially muscles, impairs normal tissue and organ function. Patients with Pompe disease experience serious muscle
related problems, including progressive muscle weakness, especially in the legs and trunk, and the muscles that control breathing. As the disorder progresses, breathing problems can lead to respiratory failure. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The overall diagnosed incidence of Pompe disease is estimated to be approximately one in 58,000 people although frequency and disease
progression varies with age of onset, ethnicity and geography. Overall diagnosed incidence of Pompe disease is projected to increase to one in 22,000 people as it is increasingly included in newborn screening panels. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The severity of Pompe disease symptoms and rate of progression is highly variable and correlated with age of symptom onset and the degree of
enzyme deficiency. Infantile or early onset disease, the most severe form of Pompe disease, accounts for approximately 25% of all affected patients. Those with early-onset disease are usually diagnosed in the first few months of life and is
associated with cardiomyopathy. Left untreated, these patients can die due to heart failure, respiratory distress or malnutrition resulting from feeding difficulties within the first year of life. Patients with late-onset disease typically have
higher enzyme levels and usually have symptoms such as reduced mobility and respiratory problems but are not at increased risk of developing cardiomyopathy. Late-onset patients experience progressive difficulty walking and respiratory decline. While
life expectancy can vary, Pompe disease is a life-limiting disease that can result in death due to complications from respiratory failure. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Limitations of Current Therapies </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Pompe disease is currently treated with ERT delivered by <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">bi-weekly</FONT> intravenous infusion. The only
approved therapy for Pompe disease is Lumizyme (known as Myozyme outside of the United States), marketed by Sanofi Genzyme, which generated worldwide net sales of over $950&nbsp;million in 2018. The annual average cost to the healthcare system per
patient prescribed Lumizyme in the United States is approximately $500,000. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Though patients treated with ERT for Pompe disease have
improved survival and respiratory function, ERT is not curative, and patients in long-term observational studies continue to have increased risk of heart failure and have residual muscle weakness including difficulties swallowing with risk of
aspiration. One challenge with ERT treatment for Pompe disease is that a standard dose requires approximately twenty-fold more enzyme compared to standard doses for Fabry or Gaucher diseases. Large doses of Lumizyme that are delivered systemically
in order to achieve potentially therapeutic levels in the target tissues result in approximately 90% of patients developing antibodies against the therapy. These antibody responses may impact both the efficacy and safety of Lumizyme. The FDA
approval of Lumizyme carries a black box warning related to the risk of severe allergic and immune mediated reactions, including life-threatening anaphylaxis. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Our Solution </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are in early preclinical development of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">AVR-RD-03</FONT></FONT> to
potentially cure patients with late-onset Pompe disease. We are developing <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">AVR-RD-03</FONT></FONT> to be a gene therapy product containing a codon-optimized human gene for GAA
attached to a GILT tag designed to increase uptake of GAA in muscle cells. <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">AVR-RD-03</FONT></FONT> will target patients with late onset Pompe disease, which represent the majority of
patients with this disease. In addition, we believe that the utilization of busulfan in our conditioning regimen may have the potential to allow <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">AVR-RD-03</FONT></FONT> to cross the
blood-brain barrier, a feature which may yield therapeutic benefit. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Preclinical Data </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Published preclinical results from a mouse model of Pompe disease support the potential of lentiviral-based gene expression of GAA to prevent
some of the symptoms of GAA deficiency. These results also demonstrated the need to further increase the uptake of GAA into muscle cells to treat patients, which is a known challenge for ERTs and leads to the use of large quantities of enzyme to
attempt to deliver effective treatment levels. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In these published preclinical results from a mouse model of Pompe disease, treatment
utilizing a lentiviral vector encoding GAA led to increased levels of active enzyme across multiple organs and tissues, including clinically relevant tissues such as heart and diaphragm. This enzyme activity was correlated with reductions in
glycogen storage in these tissues. While reduction in left ventricular mass and normalization of heart rate were observed in the mouse models seven to eight months following treatment with this lentiviral-based gene expression of GAA, only lesser
improvements in other muscles, such as skeletal muscle strength, were observed. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe we can use a GILT tag to address the known
challenges of skeletal muscle uptake in patients with Pompe disease. Attachment of a GILT tag to a particular protein can increase the effective uptake of that protein into target tissues. We are designing <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">AVR-RD-03</FONT></FONT> to use a GILT tag to facilitate GAA uptake into cells and thereby reduce the therapeutically required amount of GAA produced by a patient&#146;s cells following gene therapy treatment. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In mouse models of Pompe, administration of recombinant GAA with the GILT tag demonstrated significant reduction in glycogen in cardiac and
skeletal muscles as compared to the administration of recombinant GAA alone. We licensed GILT tag technology from BioMarin and are incorporating a GILT tag into our lentiviral vector with the goal of the patient producing GILT-tagged GAA following
treatment with <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">AVR-RD-03.</FONT></FONT> </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="center"><B><FONT

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We start the process to produce a patient&#146;s gene therapy with the mobilization of a patient&#146;s stem cells from the bone marrow to the
blood stream and isolate them using a standard procedure used in stem cell transplants. We then treat these cells with a lentiviral vector to insert a functional copy of the gene that is defective in the target disease in a <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">48-hour</FONT> process. We preserve patients&#146; modified cells at a very low temperature, using cryopreservation to maintain the cellular material in optimal condition until it is thawed prior to being infused into the
patient. The cryopreservation allows us to conduct a number of tests to validate the modified cells prior to introducing them into the patient. We believe cryopreservation will also enable us to supply our products globally, as well as significantly
increase the convenience of infusion scheduling for clinicians and patients, compared to fresh <I>ex vivo</I> gene therapy products that may have shelf-lives of only a few hours. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Prior to infusion of the gene therapy-modified cells into the patient, the patients undergo a conditioning regimen to remove some of the
patient&#146;s unmodified cells from the bone marrow to create sufficient space for the modified hematopoietic stem cells to engraft and produce their progeny. The conditioning regimen used in our approach for <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">AVR-RD-01,</FONT></FONT> <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">AVR-RD-02</FONT></FONT> and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">AVR-RD-03</FONT></FONT> may be
administered in either an inpatient or an outpatient treatment setting on a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">case-by-case</FONT></FONT> basis as may be directed by the patient&#146;s physician. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">After the conditioning regimen is complete, the lentivirally-modified stem cells are infused into the patient by intravenous administration in
an outpatient setting. After infusion, these cells engraft into the bone marrow, replicate and differentiate into all the various types of blood cells that will distribute throughout the body. These widely distributed cells lead to sustained
expression of the desired therapeutic enzyme or other protein. The sustained expression of the functional enzyme or protein is a direct substitute for the protein currently delivered by ERTs, which require periodic infusions. </P>

which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, in granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier-filed commonly owned patent. In addition, in
certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of FDA regulatory review period. However, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term including

published guidance documents with respect to the development and submission of gene therapy protocols. The FDA also has published guidance documents related to, among other things, gene therapy products in general, their preclinical assessment,

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Before testing any biological product candidate, including a gene therapy product, in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical
testing stage. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate.
The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Where a gene therapy study is
conducted at, or sponsored by, institutions receiving NIH funding for recombinant DNA research, prior to the submission of an IND to the FDA, a protocol and related documentation is submitted to and the study is registered with the NIH Office of
Science Policy, or OSP, pursuant to the NIH&nbsp;Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules, or NIH Guidelines. Compliance with the NIH Guidelines is mandatory for investigators at institutions receiving NIH
funds for research involving recombinant DNA; however, many companies and other institutions not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines voluntarily follow them. The NIH is responsible for convening the RAC, a federal advisory committee that
discusses protocols that raise novel or particularly important scientific, safety or ethical considerations, at one of its quarterly public meetings. The OSP will notify the FDA of the RAC&#146;s decision regarding the necessity for full public
review of a gene therapy protocol. RAC proceedings and reports are posted to the OSP web site and may be accessed by the public. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The
clinical study sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some
preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to ship an unapproved, investigational product in interstate commerce and to administer it to humans, and must become effective
before clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the clinical study on a clinical hold within that <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">30-day</FONT> time period. In such a
case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical study can begin. With gene therapy protocols, if the FDA allows the IND to proceed, but the RAC decides that full public review of the protocol is warranted,
the FDA will request at the completion of its IND review that sponsors delay initiation of the protocol until after completion of the RAC review process. The FDA also may impose clinical holds on a biological product candidate at any time before or
during clinical studies due to safety concerns or <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-compliance.</FONT> If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, studies may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA.
Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical studies to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such studies. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Clinical studies involve the administration of the biological product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of
qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the study sponsor&#146;s control. Clinical studies are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical study, dosing procedures, subject
selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical study will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol
must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical studies must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA&#146;s regulations comprising the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research subjects provide informed
consent. Further, each clinical study must be reviewed and approved by an IRB at or servicing each institution at which the clinical study will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of study participants and
considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical studies are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be
signed by each clinical study subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical study until completed. Clinical research involving recombinant DNA that is subject to NIH guidelines also must be reviewed by an institutional
biosafety committee, or IBC, a local institutional committee that </P>

phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical study investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical studies must be
submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA, the NIH and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or <I>in vitro</I> testing
that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report
within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the
sponsor&#146;s initial receipt of the information. Phase&nbsp;1, Phase&nbsp;2 and Phase&nbsp;3 clinical studies may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor, acting on its own or based on a
recommendation from the sponsor&#146;s data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly,
an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical study at its institution if the clinical study is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB&#146;s requirements or if the biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm
to patients. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Human gene therapy products are a new category of therapeutics. Because this is a relatively new and expanding area of novel
therapeutic interventions, there can be no assurance as to the length of the study period, the number of patients the FDA will require to be enrolled in the studies in order to establish the safety, efficacy, purity and potency of human gene therapy
products, or that the data generated in these studies will be acceptable to the FDA to support marketing approval. The NIH has a publicly accessible database, the Genetic Modification Clinical Research Information System which includes information

of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">After the completion of clinical studies of a biological product, FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before commercial marketing of the
biological product. The BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal studies, human studies, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. The testing and
approval processes require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the BLA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before
the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional
information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. In most cases, the submission of a BLA is subject to a substantial application user fee, although the fee may be waived under certain
circumstances. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, for original BLAs, the FDA has ten months from the filing date in which to complete its initial review of a standard application and
respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date for an application with priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates, and the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional
information or clarification. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the BLA is submitted to the FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a &#145;&#145;filing&#146;&#146; decision. The review process and the PDUFA
goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the BLA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal
date. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">in-depth</FONT> substantive review
of the BLA. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and potent, or effective, for its intended use, and has an acceptable purity profile, and whether the product is being manufactured in
accordance with CGMP to assure and preserve the product&#146;s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel biological products or biological products that present difficult questions of safety or
efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the
recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the biological product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS,
is necessary to assure the safe use of the biological product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the BLA without a REMS, if required. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Before approving a BLA, the FDA typically will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the
product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with CGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. For a gene therapy product, the FDA
also will not approve the product if the manufacturer is not in compliance with GTPs. These are FDA regulations that govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture of human cells, tissues, and cellular and

that cell and tissue-based products are manufactured in a manner designed to prevent the introduction, transmission and spread of communicable disease. FDA regulations also require tissue establishments to register and list their HCT/Ps with the FDA
and, when applicable, to evaluate donors through screening and testing. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical studies were conducted in compliance with IND study
requirements and GCP requirements. To assure CGMP, GTP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production, and quality control. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, a BLA or supplement to a BLA for a novel product (e.g., new active ingredient, new
indication, etc.) must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for
which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any biological product for an indication for which orphan
designation has been granted. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA
does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval. Data obtained from clinical studies are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. If the agency decides not to approve
the BLA in its present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes,
or major, for example, requiring additional clinical studies. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response
letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for
use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and
conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a REMS, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing clinical studies, sometimes referred to as Phase&nbsp;4 clinical
studies, designed to further assess a biological product&#146;s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition,
which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making
a drug or biological product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan product
designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.

Development and Review Programs </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track designation, breakthrough therapy designation,
accelerated approval and priority review, that are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of drugs and biologics that are intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions.
These programs do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. To be eligible for fast track designation, new drugs and biological products must be intended to treat a serious or life-threatening
condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new drug or
biologic may request the FDA to designate the drug or biologic as a Fast Track product at any time during the clinical development of the product. One benefit of fast track designation, for example, is that the FDA may consider for review sections
of the marketing application for a product that has received Fast Track designation on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the breakthrough therapy program, products intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may be eligible for the
benefits of the Fast Track program when preliminary clinical evidence demonstrates that such product may have substantial improvement on one or more clinically significant endpoints over existing therapies. Additionally, FDA will seek to ensure the
sponsor of a breakthrough therapy product receives timely advice and interactive communications to help the sponsor design and conduct a development program as efficiently as possible. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Any product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative
therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biological
product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. Under priority review, the FDA&#146;s goal is to review an application in six months, compared to ten months for a standard review. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Additionally, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug or biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in
treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical
studies establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. As a condition of
approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biological product receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated
approval <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-approval</FONT> of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. </P>

review or accelerated approval through use of surrogate or intermediate endpoints reasonably likely to predict long-term clinical benefit, or reliance upon data obtained from a meaningful number of sites.&nbsp;Benefits of RMAT designation also
include early interactions with FDA to discuss any potential surrogate or intermediate endpoint to be used to support accelerated approval.&nbsp;A regenerative medicine therapy with RMAT designation that is granted accelerated approval and is
subject to post-approval requirements may fulfill such requirements through the submission of clinical evidence from clinical studies, patient registries, or other sources of real world evidence, such as electronic health records; the collection of
larger confirmatory data sets; or post-approval monitoring of all patients treated with such therapy prior to its approval. Like FDA&#146;s other expedited development programs, RMAT designation does not change the standards for approval but may
expedite the development or approval process. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Post-Approval Requirements </I></B></P>

commercial quantities of any products that we may commercialize. Manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable requirements in the CGMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records
and documentation. Other post-approval requirements applicable to biological products, include reporting of CGMP deviations that may affect the identity, potency, purity and overall safety of a distributed product, record-keeping requirements,
reporting of adverse effects, reporting updated safety and efficacy information, and complying with electronic record and signature requirements. After a BLA is approved, the product also may be subject to official lot release. As part of the
manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of
product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer&#146;s tests performed on the lot. The FDA also may perform certain confirmatory tests on lots
of some products, such as viral vaccines, before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of
biological products. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We also must comply with the FDA&#146;s advertising and promotion requirements, such as those related to <FONT

of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman
Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent
beyond a total of 14 years from the product&#146;s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">one-half</FONT> the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus
the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved biological product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the
expiration of the patent. In addition, a patent can only be extended once and only for a single product. The U.S. PTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we
may intend to apply for restoration of patent term for one of our patents, if and as applicable, to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical studies and other factors involved in the filing
of the relevant BLA. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A biological product can obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if

complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structure of biological products, as well as the process by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation that are still being worked out by the FDA.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A reference biological product is granted four and twelve year exclusivity periods from the time of first licensure of the product. FDA
will not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product, and FDA will not approve an application for a
biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until twelve years after the date of first licensure of the reference product. &#147;First licensure&#148; typically means the initial date the particular product at
issue was licensed in the United States. Date of first licensure does not include the date of licensure of (and a new period of exclusivity is not available for) a biological product if the licensure is for a supplement for the biological product or
for a subsequent application by the same sponsor or manufacturer of the biological product (or licensor, predecessor in interest, or other related entity) for a change (not including a modification to the structure of the biological product) that
results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device or strength, or for a modification to the structure of the biological product that does not result in a change in safety, purity, or
potency. Therefore, one must determine whether a new product includes a modification to the structure of a previously licensed product that results in a change in safety, purity, or potency to assess whether the licensure of the new product is a
first licensure that triggers its own period of exclusivity. Whether a subsequent application, if approved, warrants exclusivity as the &#147;first licensure&#148; of a biological product is determined on a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT

product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical study application much like the IND prior to the
commencement of human clinical studies. In the European Union, for example, a Clinical Trial Application, or CTA, must be submitted for each clinical trial to each country&#146;s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much
like the FDA and an IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country&#146;s requirements, the corresponding clinical study may proceed. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational product under European Union regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization
application. The application used to file the BLA in the United States is similar to that required in the European Union, with the exception of, among other things, region-specific document requirements. The European Union also provides
opportunities for market exclusivity. For example, in the European Union, upon receiving marketing authorization, innovative medicinal products generally receive eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. If
granted, data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator&#146;s data to assess a generic or biosimilar application. During the additional <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">two-year</FONT> period
of market exclusivity, a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator&#146;s data may be referenced, but no generic or biosimilar product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity. However,
there is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the European Union&#146;s regulatory authorities to be an innovative medicinal product, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity. Products receiving orphan designation in the
European Union can receive ten years of market exclusivity, during which time no similar medicinal product for the same indication may be placed on the market. An orphan product can also obtain an additional two years of market exclusivity in the
European Union for pediatric studies. No extension to any supplementary protection certificate can be granted on the basis of pediatric studies for orphan indications. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The criteria for designating an &#147;orphan medicinal product&#148; in the European Union are similar in principle to those in the United
States. Under Article 3 of Regulation (EC) 141/2000, a medicinal product may be designated as orphan if (1)&nbsp;it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (2)&nbsp;either
(a)&nbsp;such condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union when the application is made, or (b)&nbsp;the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would not generate sufficient return in the European
Union to justify investment; and (3)&nbsp;there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the European Union, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant
benefit to those affected by the condition, as defined in Regulation (EC) 847/2000. Orphan medicinal products are eligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and are, upon grant of a marketing authorization, entitled
to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved therapeutic indication. The application for orphan drug designation must be submitted before the application for marketing authorization. The applicant will receive a fee reduction for the
marketing authorization application if the orphan drug designation has been granted, but not if the designation is still pending at the time the marketing authorization is submitted. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or
shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">10-year</FONT> market
exclusivity may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of
market exclusivity. Additionally, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar product for the same indication at any time if: </P> <P STYLE="font-size:6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

enactment, there have been a number of significant changes to the Affordable Care Act. As a result, there have been delays in the implementation of, and action taken to repeal or replace, certain aspects of the ACA. On January&nbsp;20, 2017,
President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal
burden on states or a cost, fee, tax, penalty or regulatory burden on individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. On October&nbsp;13, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order
terminating the cost-sharing subsidies that reimburse insurers under the Affordable Care Act. Several state Attorneys General filed suit to stop the administration from terminating the subsidies, but their request for a restraining order was denied
by a federal judge in California on October&nbsp;25, 2017.&nbsp;Further, on June&nbsp;14, 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that the federal government was not required to pay more than $12&nbsp;billion in ACA risk
corridor payments asserted to be owed to third-party payors. In addition, CMS finalized regulations that would give states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the
effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the Affordable Care Act for plans sold through such marketplaces. On November&nbsp;30, 2018, CMS announced a proposed rule that would amend the Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D
prescription drug benefit regulations to reduce out of pocket costs for plan enrollees and allow Medicare plans to negotiate lower rates for certain drugs. Among other things, the proposed rule changes would allow Medicare Advantage plans to use <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-authorization</FONT> (PA) and step therapy (ST) for six protected classes of drugs, with certain exceptions, permit plans to implement PA and ST in Medicare Part B drugs, and change the definition of &#147;negotiated
prices&#148; and add a definition of &#147;price concession&#148; to the regulations. It is unclear whether these proposed changes will be accepted, and if so, what effect such changes will have on our business. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or TCJA, includes a provision repealing, effective January&nbsp;1, 2019, the
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">tax-based</FONT> shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the &#147;individual
mandate.&#148; On December&nbsp;14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas, or the Texas District Court Judge, ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the Affordable Care Act, and
therefore, because it was repealed as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the remaining provisions of the Affordable Care Act are invalid as well. While the Trump Administration and CMS have both stated that the ruling will have no immediate
effect, and on December&nbsp;30, 2018 the Texas District Court Judge issued an order staying the judgment pending appeal, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals and other efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act will impact
the Affordable Care Act and our business. Additionally, on January&nbsp;22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">ACA-mandated</FONT> fees, including the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">so-called</FONT> &#147;Cadillac&#148; tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plan, the annual fee imposed on certain health
insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device exercise tax on <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-exempt</FONT> medical devices. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amends the ACA,
effective January&nbsp;1, 2019, to reduce the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the &#147;donut hole.&#148; Congress will likely consider other legislation to replace or modify elements of the Affordable Care Act. We

effect that the Affordable Care Act and its possible repeal, replacement or further modification could have on our business. It is uncertain the extent to which any such changes may impact our
business or financial condition. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, the Budget Control Act of 2011 and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 led to aggregate
reductions of Medicare payments to providers of up to 2%&nbsp;per fiscal year that will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Further, on January&nbsp;2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act was signed into
law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to
providers from three to five years. More recently, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which have resulted in several recent Congressional inquiries and
proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical
products. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in proposing and passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement
constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Finally, on May&nbsp;30, 2018, the Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for
certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase I clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA -approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without
enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a drug manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act, but
the manufacturer must develop an internal policy and respond to patient requests according to that policy. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We expect that additional
foreign, federal and state healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that foreign federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in limited
coverage and reimbursement and reduced demand for our products, if approved, or additional pricing pressures. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Coverage and Reimbursement </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any gene therapies for which we obtain regulatory approval. In
the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any gene therapies for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers. Third-party
payers include government authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payer will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the
reimbursement rate that the payer will pay for the product. Third-party payers may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">FDA-approved</FONT>
products for a particular indication. A decision by a third-party payer not to cover our gene therapies could reduce physician utilization of our products once approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and
financial condition. Moreover, a payer&#146;s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price
levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, coverage and reimbursement for
products can differ significantly from payer to payer. One third-party payer&#146;s decision to cover a particular medical product or service does not ensure that other payers will also provide coverage for the medical product or service, or will
provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As a result, the coverage determination process will require us to provide scientific and
clinical support for the use of our products to each payer separately and will be a time-consuming process. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Third-party payers are
increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In order to obtain and maintain coverage and reimbursement for any product, we
may need to conduct expensive clinical trials in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of such product, in addition to the costs required to obtain regulatory approvals. If third-party payers do not consider a product to
be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the product as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its products at a profit. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Outside of the United States, the pricing of pharmaceutical products is subject to governmental control in many countries. For example, in the
European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional
studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular therapy to currently available therapies or <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">so-called</FONT> health technology assessments, in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. Other
countries may allow companies to fix their own prices for products, but monitor and control product volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Efforts to control prices and utilization of pharmaceutical products and medical
devices will likely continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Employees </B></P>

operations to date have been limited to corporate organization, recruiting key personnel, business planning, raising capital, acquiring rights to our technology, identifying potential product candidates, undertaking preclinical studies and planning
and supporting clinical trials of our product candidates and establishing research and development and manufacturing capabilities. Although we initiated our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial for <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">AVR-RD-01</FONT></FONT> in June 2018, we have not yet demonstrated the ability to complete clinical trials of our product candidates, obtain marketing approvals, manufacture products on a clinical or commercial scale or
conduct sales and marketing activities necessary for successful commercialization. Consequently, any predictions you make about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history. In
addition, as a new business, we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other known and unknown factors. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Risks

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have concentrated our research and development efforts on our lentiviral-based gene therapy approach, and our future success depends on our
successful development of viable gene therapy product candidates. There can be no assurance that we will not experience problems or delays in developing new product candidates and that such problems or delays will not cause unanticipated costs, or
that any such development problems can be solved. For example, the implementation of our plato platform with our planned upgrades, including our transition to TDM conditioning using busulfan for our single-agent conditioning regimen, may result in
delays or setbacks in our research and development activities, and we may not realize the intended benefits of these efforts. In addition, we may also experience delays in developing a sustainable, reproducible and scalable manufacturing process or
transferring that process to commercial partners, which may prevent us from completing our clinical studies or commercializing our products on a timely or profitable basis, if at all. For example, we have not yet dosed any patients using our plato
platform, which we plan to utilize for the majority our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial for <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">AVR-RD-01.</FONT></FONT> The transition to LV2 or of our cell processing to an
industrialized, automated closed system using disposable supplies may not be successful or may experience unforeseen delays, which may cause shortages or delays in the supply of our products available for clinical trials and future commercial sales,
if any, or impair our research and development efforts, including those in our ongoing and future clinical trials. In addition, there is no assurance that products using our proprietary LV2 or manufactured using this automated system will achieve
the same favorable preliminary results observed to date in the Phase&nbsp;1 clinical trial of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">AVR-RD-01.</FONT></FONT> </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, the clinical trial requirements of the FDA and other foreign regulatory authorities and the criteria these regulators use to
determine the safety and efficacy of a product candidate vary substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use and market of such product candidates. The regulatory approval process for novel product candidates such as ours
can be more expensive and take longer than for other, better known or more extensively studied product candidates. To date, only a limited number of gene therapies have received marketing authorization from the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities.
It is difficult to determine how long it will take or how much it will cost to obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates in either the United States, Canada or other major markets or how long it will take to commercialize our product
candidates, if any are approved. Approvals by foreign regulatory authorities may not be indicative of what the FDA may require for approval, and vice versa. </P>

products, and has established the Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee to advise the CBER in its review. Gene therapy clinical trials conducted at institutions that receive
funding for recombinant DNA research from the United States National Institutes of Health, or NIH, also are potentially subject to review by the NIH Office of Science Policy&#146;s Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, or the RAC, in limited
circumstances. Although the FDA decides whether individual gene therapy protocols may proceed, the RAC public review process, if undertaken, can delay the initiation of a clinical trial, even if the FDA has reviewed the trial design and details and
authorized its initiation. Conversely, the FDA can put an investigational new drug application, or IND, on clinical hold even if the RAC has provided a favorable review or an exemption from <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">in-depth,</FONT> public
review. If we were to engage an <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">NIH-funded</FONT> institution to conduct a clinical trial, that institution&#146;s institutional biosafety committee, or IBC, as well as its institutional review board, or IRB, would
need to review the proposed clinical trial to assess the safety of the trial and may determine that RAC review is needed. In addition, adverse developments in clinical trials of gene therapy products conducted by others may cause the FDA or other
oversight bodies to change the requirements for approval of any of our product candidates. Similarly, foreign regulatory authorities may issue new guidelines concerning the development and marketing authorization for gene therapy medicinal products
and require that we comply with these new guidelines. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The FDA, NIH and the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, have each expressed
interest in further regulating biotechnology, including gene therapy and genetic testing. For example, the EMA advocates a risk-based approach to the development of a gene therapy product. Agencies at both the federal and state level in the United
States, as well as the U.S. congressional committees and other governments or governing agencies, have also expressed interest in further regulating the biotechnology industry. Such action may delay or prevent commercialization of some or all of our
product candidates. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">These regulatory review committees and advisory groups and any new guidelines they promulgate may lengthen the
regulatory review process, require us to perform additional studies, increase our development costs, lead to changes in regulatory positions and interpretations, delay or prevent approval and commercialization of these product candidates or lead to
significant post-approval limitations or restrictions. As we advance our product candidates, we will be required to consult with these regulatory and advisory groups, and comply with applicable guidelines. If we fail to do so, we may be required to
delay or discontinue development of certain of our product candidates. These additional processes may result in a review and approval process that is longer than we otherwise would have expected. Delay or failure to obtain, or unexpected costs in
obtaining, the regulatory approval necessary to bring a potential product to market could decrease our ability to generate sufficient product revenue, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects would be materially and
adversely affected. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The FDA continues to develop its approach to assessing gene and cell therapy products. For example, the agency has
released a series of draft guidance documents relating to, among other topics, various aspects of gene therapy product development, review, and approval, including aspects relating to clinical and manufacturing issues related to gene therapy
products. We cannot be certain whether such guidance will be relevant to or have an impact on our gene therapy candidates or the duration or expense of any applicable regulatory development and review processes. </P>

trials, will be reported by subjects. Gene therapies are also subject to the potential risk that occurrence of adverse events will be delayed following administration of the gene therapy due to
persistent biological activity of the genetic material or other components of the vectors used to carry the genetic material. Many times, side effects are only detectable after investigational products are tested in larger scale, pivotal clinical
trials or, in some cases, after they are made available to patients on a commercial scale after approval. If additional clinical experience indicates that <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">AVR-RD-01</FONT></FONT> or
any other product candidate has side effects or causes serious or life-threatening side effects, the development of the product candidate may fail or be delayed, or, if the product candidate has received regulatory approval, such approval may be
revoked or limited. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There have been several significant adverse side effects in gene therapy treatments in the past, including multiple
reported cases of leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome and death seen in other clinical trials. Gene therapy is still a relatively new approach to disease treatment and additional adverse side effects could develop. Possible adverse side effects that
may occur with treatment with gene therapy products include an immunologic reaction early after administration that could substantially limit the effectiveness of the treatment or represent safety risks for patients. Another traditional safety
concern for gene therapies using viral vectors has been the possibility of insertional mutagenesis by the vectors, leading to malignant transformation of transduced cells. While our lentiviral gene therapy approach is designed to avoid
immunogenicity against the vector after administration, there can be no assurance that patients would not create antibodies that may impair treatment. If any of our gene therapy product candidates demonstrates adverse side effects at unacceptable
rates or degrees of severity, we may decide or be required to halt or delay clinical development of such product candidates. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition
to side effects caused by our product candidates, the conditioning, administration process or related procedures, which we evaluate from time to time as part of our process improvement and optimization efforts, also can cause adverse side effects. A
gene therapy patient is generally administered one or more myeloablative drugs to remove stem cells from the bone marrow to create sufficient space in the bone marrow for the modified gene-corrected stem cells to engraft and produce their progeny.
This procedure transiently compromises the patient&#146;s immune system, known as neutropenia, and ability to form blood clots, known as thrombocytopenia. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are planning to implement a transition, beginning in 2019 in connection with our company-sponsored clinical trials, towards a new
conditioning regimen for our product candidates utilizing busulfan as the myeloablative conditioning agent instead of the melphalan that is currently used. The use of this conditioning regimen is designed to utilize therapeutic drug monitoring, or
TDM, to achieve a balance between the removal of a sufficient amount of bone marrow cells from a patient against potential risks such as toxicity or graft failure. While we anticipate that the conditioning regimen may be performed during a limited
hospital stay or potentially through an outpatient procedure, on a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">case-by-case</FONT></FONT> basis as directed by a patient&#146;s physician, we cannot guarantee that the
conditioning will not require a lengthier hospitalization. Our conditioning regimens may not be successful or may nevertheless result in adverse side effects. For example, in the ongoing investigator-sponsored Phase&nbsp;1 clinical trial and our
ongoing company-sponsored Phase 2 clinical trial of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">AVR-RD-01,</FONT></FONT> several adverse events, including suppression of neutrophils and platelet counts following the
conditioning process, were observed. While such adverse events in connection with conditioning is expected, if in the future any such adverse events caused by the conditioning process or related procedures continue at unacceptable rates or degrees
of severity, the FDA or other foreign regulatory authorities could order us to cease development of, or deny approval of, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">AVR-RD-01</FONT></FONT> or our other product candidates for
any or all targeted indications. We are aware that there have been cases of therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome, or t-MDS, a type of blood disorder that is a potential precursor to acute myeloid leukemia, in patients with pre-existing cancer
where busulfan treatment was posited to be a contributing factor to this secondary malignancy. However, we have reviewed over 700 published cases of busulfan exposure preceding bone marrow transplant, hematopoietic cell transplant, or ex-vivo gene
therapy for non-malignant indications, of which 648 were from peer-reviewed literature. Of the 648 busulfan exposures reported in peer-reviewed literature, none of the cases reported t-MDS. Of the 67 exposures reported in non-peer-reviewed published
abstracts, 66 reported no cases of t-MDS resulting from busulfan exposure, and in one case it was reported that a patient developed t-MDS and that busulfan treatment was posited to be a contributing factor. That case has not yet been peer-reviewed,

confounding factors in that patient, it has not been conclusively determined that busulfan exposure was the cause of that patient&#146;s t-MDS. However, there can be no guarantees that our plan
to utilize busulfan in our conditioning regimen will not result in similar adverse events. In addition, although we intend as a precautionary measure to implement new procedures to screen for certain
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-cancerous</FONT> genetic mutations prior to commencement of the conditioning regimen as an additional risk reduction measure, there can be no guarantees that these procedures will be successful. Even if we are

<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">AVR-RD-01</FONT></FONT> will be maintained over time. In addition, while the first and third patients from the ongoing investigator-sponsored Phase 1 clinical trial of <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">AVR-RD-01</FONT></FONT> discontinued ERT, there can be no assurance that these patients, or others who in the future may discontinue ERT, will remain off ERT. There is a high failure rate
for gene therapy and biologic product candidates proceeding through clinical trials. Many companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in late-stage clinical trials even after achieving promising
results in preclinical testing and earlier-stage clinical trials. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities are subject to varying interpretations, which may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. In addition, the design of a
pivotal clinical trial can determine whether its results will support approval of a product and flaws in the design of a clinical trial may not become apparent until the clinical trial is well advanced. Our company has limited experience in
designing and conducting clinical trials and we may be unable to design and execute a clinical trial to support regulatory approval. To date, we have not received definitive guidance from the FDA or other foreign regulatory bodies regarding the
necessary endpoints for approval of any of our product candidates, including <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">AVR-RD-01.</FONT></FONT> There are no assurances that the FDA or other foreign regulatory bodies will find
the efficacy endpoints we propose in future pivotal trials to be sufficiently validated and clinically meaningful, or that our product candidates will achieve the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-specified</FONT> endpoints in future pivotal
trials to a degree of statistical significance. We also may experience regulatory delays or rejections as a result of many factors, including due to changes in regulatory policy during the period of our

sponsor of the trial can help to identify the most efficient path for clinical development while minimizing the number of patients placed in ineffective control regimens. Therapies designated as
breakthrough therapies by the FDA are also eligible for accelerated approval. Designation as a breakthrough therapy is within the discretion of the FDA. Accordingly, even if we believe one of our product candidates meets the criteria for designation
as a breakthrough therapy, the FDA may disagree and instead determine not to make such designation. In any event, the receipt of a Breakthrough Therapy Designation for a product candidate may not result in a faster development process, review or
approval compared to therapies considered for approval under conventional FDA procedures and does not assure ultimate approval by the FDA. In addition, even if one or more of our product candidates qualify as breakthrough therapies, the FDA may

to grant it. Even if we do receive Fast Track Designation, we may not experience a faster development process, review or approval compared to conventional FDA procedures, and receiving a Fast Track Designation does not provide assurance of ultimate
FDA approval. In addition, the FDA may withdraw Fast Track Designation if it believes that the designation is no longer supported by data from our clinical development program. </P>

as cell therapies, therapeutic tissue engineering products, human cell and tissue products, and combination products using any such therapies or products. Gene therapies, including genetically modified cells that lead to a durable modification of
cells or tissues may meet the definition of a regenerative medicine therapy. The RMAT program is intended to facilitate efficient development and expedite review of RMATs, which are intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or
life-threatening disease or condition. A new drug application or a BLA for an RMAT may be eligible for priority review or accelerated approval through (1)&nbsp;surrogate or intermediate endpoints reasonably likely to predict long-term clinical
benefit or (2)&nbsp;reliance upon data obtained from a meaningful number of sites. Benefits of such designation also include early interactions with FDA to discuss any potential surrogate or intermediate endpoint to be used to support accelerated
approval. A regenerative medicine therapy that is granted accelerated approval and is subject to post-approval requirements may fulfill such requirements through the submission of clinical evidence, clinical studies, patient registries, or other
sources of real-world evidence, such as electronic health records; the collection of larger confirmatory data sets; or post-approval monitoring of all patients treated with such therapy prior to its approval. RMAT designation is within the
discretion of the FDA. Accordingly, even if we believe one of our product candidates meets the criteria for designation as a regenerative medicine advanced therapy, the FDA may disagree and instead determine not to make such designation. In any
event, the receipt of RMAT designation for a product candidate may not result in a faster development process, review or approval compared to drugs considered for approval under conventional FDA procedures and does not assure ultimate approval by

even if we obtain such designation, we may not be able to realize the benefits of such designation, including potential marketing exclusivity of our product candidates, if approved. </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Regulatory authorities in some jurisdictions, including the United States and other major markets, may designate drugs intended to treat
conditions or diseases affecting relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. Under the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, the FDA may designate a product candidate as an orphan drug if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is
generally defined as having a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or a patient population greater than 200,000 in the United States where there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing the drug
will be recovered from sales in the United States. In the European Union, EMA&#146;s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or
treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the European Union. Additionally, orphan designation is granted for products intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of
a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition and when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the European Union would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the drug or
biologic product. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If we request orphan drug designation (or the foreign equivalent) for <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">AVR-RD-01</FONT></FONT> or any of our other product candidates, there can be no assurances that the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities will grant any of our product candidates such designation. In December 2018, the FDA
granted our request for orphan drug designation for <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">AVR-RD-01</FONT></FONT> for the treatment of Fabry disease. To date, we have not requested orphan drug designation (or the foreign
equivalent) for any other product candidates. Additionally, the designation of any of our product candidates as an orphan product does not mean that any regulatory agency will accelerate regulatory review of, or ultimately approve, that product
candidate, nor does it limit the ability of any regulatory agency to grant orphan drug designation to product candidates of other companies that treat the same indications as our product candidates prior to our product candidates receiving exclusive
marketing approval. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Generally, if a product candidate with an orphan drug designation receives the first marketing approval for the
indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to a period of marketing exclusivity, which precludes the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities from approving another marketing application for a product that constitutes the
same drug treating the same indication for that marketing exclusivity period, except in limited circumstances. If another sponsor receives such approval before we do (regardless of our orphan drug designation), we will be precluded from receiving
marketing approval for our product for the applicable exclusivity period. The applicable period is seven years in the United States and 10 years in the European Union. The exclusivity period in the European Union can be reduced to six years if a
product no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation or if the product is sufficiently profitable so that market exclusivity is no longer justified. Orphan drug exclusivity may be revoked if any regulatory agency determines that the
request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a product candidate, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product candidate from

may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future
legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory
compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We face significant competition in our industry and there can be no assurance that our product candidates, if approved, will achieve

product candidates. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We operate in a highly competitive segment of the biopharmaceutical market. We face competition from many
different sources, including larger pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as from academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions. Our product candidates, if
successfully developed and approved, will compete with established therapies, some of which are being marketed by large and international companies. In addition, we expect to compete with new treatments that are under development or may be advanced
into the clinic by our competitors. There are a variety of product candidates, including gene therapies, in development for the indications that we are targeting. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We anticipate competing with the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world. For example, Sanofi Genzyme and Shire, acquired by Takeda
Pharmaceutical Company Ltd., market the enzyme replacement therapies, or ERTs, that represent the standard of care for Fabry patients. Recently, Amicus has secured regulatory approval in the United States and Europe for its oral therapy for Fabry
disease. For Gaucher disease, we expect to compete with existing enzyme replacement therapies marketed by Sanofi Genzyme, Shire, Protalix and Pfizer, as well as oral therapies marketed by Actelion and Sanofi. Sanofi also markets an enzyme
replacement therapy for Pompe disease. Cystinosis is currently treated by therapies marketed by Horizon Orphan, Mylan and Sigma Tau Pharmaceuticals. In addition, we may compete with other gene therapy companies in our industry such as bluebird bio
and Spark Therapeutics (which on February&nbsp;25, 2019 announced that it had entered into an agreement to be acquired by Roche in a transaction expected to close in the second quarter of 2019). In particular, a number of gene therapy companies have
announced preclinical or clinical adeno-associated virus, or AAV, based gene therapy programs that, if such programs are successful in obtaining regulatory approval, could compete with our gene therapies. These include companies such as Abeona,
Amicus, Freeline, Sangamo and uniQure which have announced gene therapy programs for Fabry disease; Freeline and Prevail which have announced gene therapy programs for Gaucher disease; and Abeona, Actus, Amicus, Audentes, Sarepta and Spark
Therapeutics which have announced gene therapy programs for Pompe disease. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial,
product candidate development, manufacturing and marketing resources than we do. Large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have extensive experience in clinical testing and obtaining regulatory approval for their products, and mergers and
acquisitions within these industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of larger competitors. Established pharmaceutical companies may also invest heavily to accelerate discovery and development of novel
therapeutics or to <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">in-license</FONT> novel therapeutics that could make the product candidates that we develop obsolete. Competition may increase further as a result of advances in the commercial applicability of
technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these industries. Our business would be materially and adversely affected if competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe
side effects, have broader market acceptance, are more convenient or are less expensive than any product candidate that we may develop. </P>

identify, develop and market additional product candidates beyond our existing product candidates for Fabry disease, Gaucher disease, cystinosis and Pompe disease. We may spend several years completing our development of any particular current or
future product candidates, and failure can occur at any stage. The product candidates to which we allocate our resources may not end up being successful. Because we have limited resources, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with certain
programs or product candidates or for indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential than <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">AVR-RD-01</FONT></FONT> or our other product candidates. Our spending on
current and future research and development programs may not yield any commercially viable product candidates. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that
product candidate through strategic collaborations, licensing or other arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate. If any of these
events occur, we may be forced to abandon our development efforts with respect to a particular product candidate or fail to develop a potentially successful product candidate. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Because our internal research capabilities are limited, we may be dependent upon biotechnology companies, academic scientists and other
researchers to sell or license product candidates, approved products or the underlying technology to us. The success of this strategy depends partly upon our ability to identify, select, discover and acquire promising product candidates and
products. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, certain of our current or future product candidates may not demonstrate in patients any or all of the
pharmacological benefits we believe they may possess or compare favorably to existing, approved therapies, such as ERT. We have not yet succeeded and may never succeed in demonstrating efficacy and safety of our product candidates or any future
product candidates in clinical trials or in obtaining marketing approval thereafter. For example, although we have evaluated <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">AVR-RD-02,</FONT></FONT> <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If we are unsuccessful in our development efforts, we may not be able to advance the development of our product candidates, commercialize

these suppliers will remain in business, or that they will not be purchased by one of our competitors or another company that is not interested in continuing to produce these materials for our intended purpose. Our use of a limited number of
suppliers of raw materials, components and finished goods exposes us to several risks, including disruptions in supply, price increases, late deliveries and an inability to meet customer demand. There are, in general, relatively few alternative
sources of supply for these components. These vendors may be unable or unwilling to meet our future demands for our clinical trials or commercial sale. Establishing additional or replacement suppliers for these components could take a substantial
amount of time and it may be difficult to establish replacement suppliers who meet regulatory requirements. Any disruption in supply from any supplier or manufacturing location could lead to supply delays or interruptions which would damage our

manufacture and delivery of our product candidates could be interrupted for an extended period, adversely affecting our business. Establishing additional or replacement suppliers may not be accomplished quickly. If we are able to find a replacement
supplier, the replacement supplier would need to be qualified and may require additional regulatory authority approval, which could result in further delay.&nbsp;For example, the FDA could require additional supplemental data and clinical trial data
if we rely upon a new supplier. While we seek to maintain adequate inventory of the components and materials used in our product candidates, any interruption or delay in the supply of components or materials, or our inability to obtain components or
materials from alternate sources at acceptable prices in a timely manner, could impair our ability to conduct our clinical trials and, if our product candidates are approved, to meet the demand of our customers and cause them to cancel orders. </P>

the United States, recently enacted legislation may significantly change the approval requirements in ways that could involve additional costs and cause delays in obtaining approvals. Some countries require approval of the sale price of a drug
before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing or product licensing approval is granted. In some foreign markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control
even after initial approval is granted. As a result, we might obtain marketing approval for a product in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay our or their commercial launch of the product, possibly for lengthy
time periods, and negatively impact the revenue we are able to generate from the sale of the product in that country. Adverse pricing limitations may hinder our ability to recoup our investment in one or more product candidates, even if any product
candidates we may develop obtain marketing approval. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates or any other
products that we or they may develop also will depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers, and other
organizations. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which medications they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. The availability and extent of
reimbursement by governmental and private payors is essential for most patients to be able to afford treatments. Sales of our product candidates will depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of our product
candidates will be paid by health maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management organizations, or reimbursed by government health administration authorities, private health coverage insurers and other third-party
payors. We may not be able to provide data sufficient to gain acceptance with respect to coverage and reimbursement. If reimbursement is not available, or is available only at limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our
product candidates, if approved. Even if coverage is provided, the approved reimbursement amount may not be high enough to allow us to establish or maintain pricing sufficient to realize a sufficient return on our investment. </P>

extent a new medicine will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare. Private payors tend to follow CMS to a substantial degree. It is difficult to predict what CMS will decide with respect to reimbursement for fundamentally novel products such as

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and third-party payors have
attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. Outside the United States, international operations are generally subject to extensive governmental price controls and other market
regulations, and we believe the increasing emphasis on cost-containment initiatives in Europe and certain other major markets where we plan to commercialize may put pressure on the pricing and usage of our product candidates. In many countries, the
prices of medical products are subject to varying price control mechanisms as part of national health systems, and pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product.
To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost effectiveness of our product candidates to other available therapies. In general, the prices of medicines under such
systems are substantially lower than in the United States. Other countries allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. Additional foreign price controls or other changes in pricing regulation could
restrict the amount that we are able to charge for our product candidates. Accordingly, in markets outside the United States, the reimbursement for our products may be reduced compared with the United States and may be insufficient to generate
commercially reasonable revenues and profits. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Moreover, efforts by governmental and third-party payors, in the United States and abroad,
to cap or reduce healthcare costs may cause such organizations to limit both coverage and level of reimbursement for new products approved and, as a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for our product candidates. We expect to
experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of any of our product candidates, due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative changes. The downward
pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs and surgical procedures and other treatments, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Due to the novel nature of our technology and the potential for our product candidates to offer therapeutic benefit in a single

populations are relatively small, as a result of which the pricing and reimbursement of our product candidates, if approved, must be adequate to support commercial infrastructure. If we are unable to obtain adequate levels of reimbursement, our
ability to successfully market and sell our product candidates will be adversely affected. The manner and level at which reimbursement is provided for services related to our product candidates (e.g., for administration of our product to patients)
is also important. Inadequate reimbursement for such services may lead to physician resistance and adversely affect our ability to market or sell our product candidates, if approved. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The manufacturing process we use to produce our product candidates is complex, novel and has not been validated for commercial use. Several

Moreover, unlike chemical pharmaceuticals, the physical and chemical properties of a biologic such as ours generally cannot be fully characterized. As a result, assays of the finished product may not be sufficient to ensure that the product will
perform in the intended manner. Accordingly, we and our manufacturing suppliers employ multiple steps to control the manufacturing process with the goal of ensuring that the product candidate is made strictly and consistently in compliance with the
process. Problems with the manufacturing process, including even minor deviations from the intended process, could result in product defects or manufacturing failures that result in lot failures, product recalls, product liability claims or
insufficient inventory. We may encounter problems achieving adequate quantities and quality of clinical-grade materials that meet FDA or other applicable regulatory standards or specifications with consistent and acceptable production yields and
costs. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, the FDA and other foreign regulatory authorities may require us to submit samples of any lot of any approved product
together with the protocols showing the results of applicable tests at any time. Under some circumstances, the FDA or other foreign regulatory authorities may require that we not distribute a lot until the agency authorizes its release. Even slight
deviations in the manufacturing process, including those affecting quality attributes and stability, may result in unacceptable changes in the product that could result in lot failures or product recalls. There is no assurance we will not experience

substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The ACA, among other things, subjects biologic products to potential competition by
lower-cost biosimilars, addresses a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, increases the minimum Medicaid

of the ACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the ACA. On January&nbsp;20, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA
to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal burden on states or a cost, fee, tax, penalty or regulatory burden on individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or
manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. On October&nbsp;13, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order terminating the cost-sharing subsidies that reimburse insurers under the ACA. Several state Attorneys General filed suit to stop
the administration from terminating the subsidies, but their request for a restraining order was denied by a federal judge in California on October&nbsp;25, 2017. Further, on June&nbsp;14, 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
ruled that the federal government was not required to pay more than $12&nbsp;billion in ACA risk corridor payments asserted to be owed to third-party payors. The effects of this gap in reimbursement on third-party payors, providers, the viability of
the ACA marketplace and potentially our business, are not yet known. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Since its enactment, some of the provisions of the ACA have yet to
be fully implemented, while certain provisions have been subject to judicial, congressional, or executive challenges. As a result, there have been delays in the implementation of, and action taken to repeal or replace, certain aspects of the ACA.
The U.S. Supreme Court has upheld certain key aspects of the legislation, including a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">tax-based</FONT> shared responsibility payment imposed on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for
all or part of a year or pay a penalty, which is commonly known as the &#147;individual mandate.&#148; However, as a result of tax reform legislation passed in December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or TCJA, the individual mandate has
been eliminated effective January&nbsp;1, 2019. On December&nbsp;14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas, or the Texas District Court Judge, ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of
the Affordable Care Act, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the remaining provisions of the Affordable Care Act are invalid as well. While the Trump Administration and CMS have both stated that the
ruling will have no immediate effect, and on December&nbsp;30, 2018 the Texas District Court Judge issued an order staying the judgment pending appeal, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals and other efforts to repeal and replace the
Affordable Care Act will impact the Affordable Care Act and our business. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In July 2018, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services,
or CMS, published a final rule permitting further collections and payments to and from certain Affordable Care Act qualified health plans and health insurance issuers under the Affordable Care Act risk adjustment program in response to the outcome
of federal district court litigation regarding the method CMS uses to determine this risk adjustment. In addition, CMS has recently published a final rule that would give states greater flexibility, starting in 2020, in setting benchmarks for
insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Congress also could consider subsequent legislation to replace elements of the ACA that are repealed. Thus, the full impact of the ACA, any
law replacing elements of it, and the political uncertainty surrounding any repeal or replacement legislation on our business remains unclear. In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA
was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least

2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation&#146;s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare
payments to providers of 2%&nbsp;per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013, and will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, was signed
into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers
from three to five years. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty
drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription
drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. At the federal level, the Trump administration&#146;s budget proposal for fiscal
year 2019 contains further drug price control measures that could be enacted during the 2019 budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs
under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid, and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">low-income</FONT> patients. The current presidential administration&#146;s
Blueprint contains certain measures that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, is already working to implement. Additionally, the Trump administration released a &#147;Blueprint&#148; to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket
costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products and reduce the out of
pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. HHS has already started the process of soliciting feedback on some of these measures and, at the same time, is immediately implementing others under its existing authority. For example, in September
2018, CMS announced that it will allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option to use step therapy for Part B drugs beginning January&nbsp;1, 2019, and in October 2018, CMS proposed a new rule that would require <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">direct-to-consumer</FONT></FONT> television advertisements of prescription drugs and biological products, for which payment is available through or under Medicare or Medicaid, to include in the advertisement the Wholesale
Acquisition Cost, or list price, of that drug or biological product. Finally, on October&nbsp;25, 2018, CMS issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, or ANPRM, indicating it is considering issuing a proposed rule in the spring of 2019 on a
model called the International Pricing Index, or IPI. This model would utilize a basket of other countries&#146; prices as a reference for the Medicare program to use in reimbursing for drugs covered under Part B. The ANPRM also included an updated
version of the Competitive Acquisition Program, or CAP, as an alternative to current &#147;buy and bill&#148; payment methods for Part B drugs. Although a number of these, and other proposed measures will require authorization through additional
legislation to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed
legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and
transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We expect that the
healthcare reform measures that have been adopted and may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product and could seriously harm our
future revenues. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private third-party payors. </P>

the treatment of those diseases that our product candidates target prescribing treatments that involve the use of our product candidates in lieu of, or in addition to, existing treatments they are already familiar with and for which greater clinical
data may be available. More restrictive government regulations or negative public opinion would have a negative effect on our business or financial condition and may delay or impair the development and commercialization of our product candidates or
demand for any products we may develop. For example, earlier gene therapy trials led to several well-publicized adverse events, including cases of leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes and deaths seen in other trials using other vectors. Adverse
events in our clinical studies, even if not ultimately attributable to our product candidates (such as the many adverse events that typically arise from the conditioning process), or adverse events in other lentiviral gene therapy trials, and the
resulting publicity could result in increased governmental regulation, unfavorable public perception, potential regulatory delays in the testing or approval of our potential product candidates, stricter labeling requirements for those product

economy and in the global financial markets. The recent global financial crisis caused extreme volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets. A severe or prolonged economic downturn, such as the recent global financial crisis, could
result in a variety of risks to our business, including weakened demand for our product candidates and our ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all. A weak or declining economy could also strain our suppliers,
possibly resulting in supply disruption, or cause delays in payments for our services by third-party payors or our collaborators. Any of the foregoing could harm our business and we cannot anticipate all of the ways in which the current economic

all or a significant portion of our headquarters, that damaged critical infrastructure, such as the manufacturing facilities of our third-party contract manufacturers, or that otherwise disrupted operations, it may be difficult or, in certain cases,
impossible for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time. The disaster recovery and business continuity plans we have in place currently are limited and are unlikely to prove adequate in the event of a serious disaster or similar
event. We may incur substantial expenses as a result of the limited nature of our disaster recovery and business continuity plans, which, particularly when taken together with our lack of earthquake insurance, could have a material adverse effect on

consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. For example, in 2017 we were subjected to a cyberattack by a third party, which led to
the theft of a portion of our funds. We implemented remedial measures promptly following this breach and do not believe that this breach had a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, in February 2019, one of our vendors was subject to
a cyberattack by a third party, which resulted in the payment by us of a fraudulent invoice. We are implementing remedial measures following this breach and do not believe that this breach had a material effect on our business.<B> </B>However, if
any cyberattack or data breach were to occur in the future and cause interruptions in our or our collaborators&#146;, contractors&#146; or consultants&#146; operations, it could result in a material disruption of our development programs and our
business operations, whether due to a loss of our trade secrets or other proprietary information or other similar disruptions. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or future clinical trials could result in delays in our
regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure
of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability, our competitive position could be harmed and the further development and commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed. </P>

subsequent shifts in our stock ownership, some of which may be outside of our control. If an ownership change occurred or occurs and our ability to use our historical net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards is materially limited, or if our

STYLE="white-space:nowrap">in-licensed</FONT> U.S. patent rights have certain corresponding foreign patents or patent applications, there can be no assurance that we will obtain or maintain such corresponding patents or patent applications with
respect to any future license agreements. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States even in jurisdictions where we and our licensors
pursue patent protection. Consequently, we and our licensors may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, even in jurisdictions where we and our licensors pursue patent
protection, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we and our licensors have not pursued and obtained patent
protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our
product candidates and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The
legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biotechnology products, which could make
it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights, even if obtained, in foreign jurisdictions could result in
substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties
to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the
world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Issued patents covering our product candidates could be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged in court. We may not be able to
protect our trade secrets in court. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If one of our licensing partners or we initiate legal proceedings against a third-party to
enforce a patent covering one of our product candidates, should such a patent issue, the defendant could counterclaim that the patent covering our product candidate is invalid or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant
counterclaims alleging invalidity or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness, written description or <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-enablement.</FONT> Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld information material to patentability from the USPTO, or made a
misleading statement, during prosecution. Third parties also may raise similar claims before administrative bodies in the United States or abroad, even outside the context of litigation. Such mechanisms include
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">re-examination,</FONT> post grant review, <I>inter partes</I> review and equivalent proceedings in foreign jurisdictions. Such proceedings could result in the revocation or cancellation of or amendment to our patents
in such a way that they no longer cover our product candidates. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no
invalidating prior art, of which the patent examiner and we or our licensing partners were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity or unenforceability, we could lose at least part, and perhaps
all, of the patent protection on one or more of our product candidates. Such a loss of patent protection could have a material adverse impact on our business. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Some of the intellectual property rights we have licensed, including rights licensed to us by GenStem, may have been generated through the use
of U.S. government and California state funding and may therefore be subject to certain federal and state laws and regulations. As a result, the U.S. government may have certain rights to intellectual property embodied in our current or future
product candidates pursuant to the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980, or Bayh-Dole Act. These U.S. government rights in certain inventions developed under a government-funded program include a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-exclusive,</FONT> <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-transferable,</FONT> irrevocable worldwide license to use inventions for any governmental purpose. In addition, the U.S. government has the right to require us to grant exclusive, partially exclusive, or <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-exclusive</FONT> licenses to any of these inventions to a third party if it determines that: (i)&nbsp;adequate steps have not been taken to commercialize the invention; (ii)&nbsp;government action is necessary to meet
public health or safety needs; or (iii)&nbsp;government action is necessary to meet requirements for public use under federal regulations (also referred to as <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">&#147;march-in</FONT> rights&#148;). The U.S. government
also has the right to take title to these inventions if we, or the applicable licensor, fail to disclose the invention to the government and fail to file an application to register the intellectual property within specified time limits. Intellectual
property generated under a government funded program is also subject to certain reporting requirements, compliance with which may require us or the applicable licensor to expend substantial resources. In addition, the U.S. government requires that
any products embodying the subject invention or produced through the use of the subject invention be manufactured substantially in the United States. The manufacturing preference requirement can be waived if the owner of the intellectual property
can show that reasonable but unsuccessful efforts have been made to grant licenses on similar terms to potential licensees that would be likely to manufacture substantially in the United States or that under the circumstances domestic manufacture is
not commercially feasible. This preference for U.S. manufacturers may limit our ability to contract with <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-U.S.</FONT> product manufacturers for products covered by such intellectual property. To the extent any of
our current or future intellectual property is generated through the use of U.S. government funding, the provisions of the Bayh-Dole Act may similarly apply. Any exercise by the government of certain of its rights could harm our competitive
position, business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. With respect to state funding, specifically funding via the California Institute of Regenerative Medicine, or CIRM, the grantee has certain obligations and the state or
CIRM has certain rights. For example, the grantee has an obligation to share intellectual property, including research results, generated by CIRM-funded research, for research use in California. </P>

uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of patent applications and the enforcement or defense of issued patents. On September&nbsp;16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, was signed into law. The
Leahy-Smith Act includes several significant changes to U.S. patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted and also may affect patent litigation. These also include provisions that switched the United
States from a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">&#147;first-to-invent&#148;</FONT></FONT> system to a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">&#147;first-to-file&#148;</FONT></FONT> system,

another inventor had made the invention earlier. The USPTO developed new regulations and procedures to govern administration of the Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act, and in
particular, the first to file provisions, only became effective on March&nbsp;16, 2013. Accordingly, it is not clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business. However, the Leahy-Smith Act and its

particularly uncertain. Two cases involving diagnostic method claims and &#147;gene patents&#148; have recently been decided by the Supreme Court of the United States, or Supreme Court. On March&nbsp;20, 2012, the Supreme Court issued a decision in
Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc., or Prometheus, a case involving patent claims directed to a process of measuring a metabolic product in a patient to optimize a drug dosage for the patient. According to the Supreme
Court, the addition of well-understood, routine or conventional activity such as &#147;administering&#148; or &#147;determining&#148; steps was not enough to transform an otherwise patent-ineligible natural phenomenon into patent-eligible subject
matter. On July&nbsp;3, 2012, the USPTO issued a guidance memo to patent examiners indicating that process claims directed to a law of nature, a natural phenomenon or a naturally occurring relation or correlation that do not include additional
elements or steps that integrate the natural principle into the claimed invention such that the natural principle is practically applied and the claim amounts to significantly more than the natural principle itself should be rejected as directed to
not patent-eligible subject matter. On June&nbsp;13, 2013, the Supreme Court issued its decision in Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc., or Myriad, a case involving patent claims held by Myriad Genetics, Inc. relating to the
breast cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2. Myriad held that an isolated segment of naturally occurring DNA, such as the DNA constituting the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, is not patent-eligible subject matter, but that complementary DNA, which is
an artificial construct that may be created from RNA transcripts of genes, may be patent-eligible. On March&nbsp;4, 2014, the USPTO issued a guidance memorandum to patent examiners entitled 2014 Procedure For Subject Matter Eligibility Analysis Of
Claims Reciting Or Involving Laws Of Nature/Natural Principles, Natural Phenomena, And/Or Natural Products. These guidelines instruct USPTO examiners on the ramifications of the Prometheus and Myriad rulings and apply the Myriad ruling to natural
products and principles including all naturally occurring nucleic acids. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Certain claims of our licensed patents and patent applications
contain, and any future patents we may obtain may contain, claims that relate to specific recombinant DNA sequences that are naturally occurring at least in part and, therefore, could be the subject of future challenges made by third parties. In
addition, the 2014 USPTO guidance could impact our ability to pursue similar patent claims in patent applications we may prosecute in the future. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We cannot assure you that our efforts to seek patent protection for our product candidates will not be negatively impacted by the decisions
described above, rulings in other cases or changes in guidance or procedures issued by the USPTO. We cannot fully predict what impact the Supreme Court&#146;s decisions in Prometheus and Myriad may have on the ability of life science companies to
obtain or enforce patents relating to their products in the future. These decisions, the guidance issued by the USPTO and rulings in other cases or changes in USPTO guidance or procedures could have a material adverse effect on our existing patent
rights and our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property in the future. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Moreover, although the Supreme Court has held in
Myriad that isolated segments of naturally occurring DNA are not patent-eligible subject matter, certain third parties could allege that activities that we may undertake infringe other gene-related patent claims, and we may deem it necessary to
defend ourselves against these claims by asserting <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-infringement</FONT> and/or invalidity positions, or paying to obtain a license to these claims. In any of the foregoing or in other situations involving
third-party intellectual property rights, if we are unsuccessful in defending against claims of patent infringement, we could be forced to pay damages or be subjected to an injunction that would prevent us from utilizing the patented subject matter.
Such outcomes could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. </P>

Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent extension term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a
patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, only one patent may be extended and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. A patent may only be
extended once and only based on a single approved product. However, we may not be granted an extension because of, for example, failing to exercise due diligence during the testing phase or regulatory review process, failing to apply within
applicable deadlines, failing to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise failing to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the applicable time period or the scope of patent protection afforded could be less than we request. If
we are unable to obtain patent term extension or the term of any such extension is less than we request, our competitors may obtain approval of competing products following our patent expiration, and our revenue could be reduced, possibly
materially. In addition, we do not control the efforts of our licensors to obtain a patent term extension, and there can be no assurance that they will pursue or obtain such extensions to the patents that we license from them. </P>

not incur as a private company. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and Nasdaq have imposed various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective
disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations will increase our legal
and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, we expect that these rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain and maintain director and officer
liability insurance. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Pursuant to Section&nbsp;404, we will be required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over
financial reporting, and, once we are no longer an EGC or a &#147;smaller reporting company&#148;, we will be required to furnish an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent registered public
accounting firm. To achieve compliance with Section&nbsp;404 within the prescribed period, we are engaged in a process to document and evaluate our internal control over financial reporting, which is both costly and challenging. In this regard, we
will need to continue to dedicate internal resources, potentially engage outside consultants and adopt a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, continue steps to improve control processes
as appropriate, validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting. Despite our efforts, there is a risk that neither we nor
our independent registered public accounting firm will be able to conclude within the prescribed timeframe that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as required by Section&nbsp;404. This could result in an adverse reaction in

could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. In addition, any testing by us conducted in connection with Section&nbsp;404, or any subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm, may reveal deficiencies in our
internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses or that may require prospective or retroactive changes to our financial statements or identify other areas for further attention or improvement. Inferior internal

connection with the audit of our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2016 and 2017, we and our independent registered public accounting firm identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial
reporting related to deficiencies in our controls over the financial statement close and cash disbursement processes. Specifically, there was a lack of controls over the identification and review of complex accounting issues involving significant
judgment or estimates as well as the cutoff and classification of certain expenses between general and administrative and research and development. In addition, our internal controls related to the cash disbursements process were not adequately
designed to identify unauthorized payment requests. Specifically, in 2017 we were subject to a cyberattack by a third party. This deficiency in our controls resulted in the theft of a portion of our funds. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In 2018, we began implementing measures designed to improve our internal control over financial reporting to remediate these material
weaknesses, including formalizing our processes and internal control documentation and strengthening supervisory reviews by our financial management; hiring additional qualified accounting and finance personnel and engaging financial consultants to
enable the implementation of internal control over financial reporting and segregating duties amongst accounting and finance personnel; and planning to implement certain accounting systems to automate manual processes, such as tracking and
accounting for stock-based awards. Although progress has been made to strengthen our controls, as of December&nbsp;31, 2018, management and our independent registered public accounting firm have concluded that the material weaknesses remain
unremediated. In addition, in February 2019, one of our vendors was subject to a cyberattack by a third party, which resulted in the payment by us of a fraudulent invoice. </P>

acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements or insufficient disclosures due to error or fraud may

outstanding as of December&nbsp;31, 2018 under our equity incentive plans will become eligible for sale in the public market in the future. We have registered all shares of common stock that we may issue under our equity compensation plans, which

federal district court forum selection provisions are currently subject to a suit in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware brought by stockholders who assert that the federal district court forum selection provision is not enforceable. On

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are a Phase 2 clinical stage gene therapy company focused on developing potentially curative <I>ex vivo</I> lentiviral-based gene therapies
to treat rare diseases following a single dose treatment regimen. Our gene therapies employ hematopoietic stem cells that are harvested from the patient and then modified with lentiviral vectors to insert a functional copy of the gene that is
defective in the target disease. We believe that our approach, which is designed to transform stem cells from patients into therapeutic products, has the potential to provide curative benefit for a range of diseases. Our initial focus is on a group
of rare genetic diseases referred to as lysosomal storage diseases, which today are primarily managed with enzyme replacement therapies, or ERTs. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are initially targeting rare diseases in which current standard of care provides the mechanistic proof that the enzymes or proteins
produced endogenously following treatment with our gene therapies can offer benefit to patients. Typically, in lysosomal storage diseases, a gene mutation results in the deficiency or malfunctioning of an enzyme or other protein. This results in the
inability of lysosomes to properly process cellular byproducts. As a result, these byproducts accumulate to toxic levels in the body&#146;s cells and, in turn, disrupt the function of multiple tissues and organs. Fabry disease, Gaucher disease and
Pompe disease are primarily managed by <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">bi-weekly,</FONT> multi-hour infusions with ERTs that seek to exogenously replace the missing enzyme. However, given the characteristics of most ERTs, they typically only remain
in the plasma for a short period of time and thus, are not ideal because they are only dosed every two weeks. These existing therapies manage, rather than cure, the underlying diseases and, as a result, patients continue to have disease progression.
Further, the frequent, periodic and life-long dosing schedule required for ERTs results in significant costs for the healthcare system and is burdensome for the patient. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We seek to develop promising gene therapy programs by applying our expertise in gene and cellular therapies and clinical and regulatory
strategy and execution to efficiently bring these potentially curative therapies to patients. In our initial programs, we leverage years of extensive preclinical and early clinical research by leading international researchers, as well as our
internal research efforts, to advance potential therapies. We plan to identify and develop future product candidates through our own internal research efforts as well as through collaborations with leading academics. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Since our inception in 2015, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to organizing and staffing our company, business planning,
raising capital, acquiring or discovering product candidates and securing related intellectual property rights, conducting discovery, research and development activities for our programs and planning for potential commercialization. We do not have
any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. To date, we have funded our operations with proceeds from the sales of preferred stock and our initial public offering, or IPO. Through December&nbsp;31, 2018, we
had received gross proceeds of $87.5&nbsp;million from the sales of our preferred stock and $114.7&nbsp;million from the sales of common stock through our IPO. Since our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our ability to

sufficient to achieve profitability will depend heavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization of one or more of our current or future product candidates and programs. Our
net losses were $46.4&nbsp;million and $18.6&nbsp;million for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. As of December&nbsp;31, 2018 we had an accumulated deficit of $71.7&nbsp;million. We expect to continue to incur significant
expenses for at least the next several years as we advance our product candidates from discovery through preclinical development and clinical trials and seek regulatory approval of our product candidates. In addition, if we obtain marketing approval
for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution. We may also incur expenses in connection with the
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">in-licensing</FONT> or acquisition of additional product candidates. Furthermore, we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company, including significant legal, accounting, investor
relations and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As a result, we will need substantial additional funding to
support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations with proceeds from outside sources, with a majority of such
proceeds to be derived from sales of equity, including the net proceeds from our IPO. We also plan to pursue additional funding from outside sources, including our expansion of, or our entry into, new borrowing arrangements; research and development
incentive payments from the Australian government; and our entry into potential future collaboration agreements for one or more of our programs. We may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements or arrangements when
needed on favorable terms, or at all. If we fail to raise capital or enter into such agreements as, and when, needed, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development and commercialization of one or more of our product
candidates or delay our pursuit of potential <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">in-licenses</FONT> or acquisitions. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Because of the numerous

candidates. We may obtain unexpected results from our clinical trials. We may elect to discontinue, delay or modify clinical trials of some product candidates or focus on others. Any changes in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to
the development of our product candidates in preclinical and clinical development could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of these product candidates. For example, if the FDA, or another regulatory
authority were to delay our planned start of clinical trials or require us to conduct clinical trials or other testing beyond those that we currently expect, or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our planned clinical trials,
we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development of that product candidate. Identifying potential product candidates and conducting preclinical testing and clinical trials
is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval and achieve product sales. In addition, our product candidates, if
approved, may not achieve commercial success. </P>

as a component of other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Upon the closing of our IPO, the warrant to purchase preferred stock was converted to a warrant to purchase common stock. The carrying

offset by a $0.1&nbsp;million increase in other assets and a $3.0&nbsp;million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets. The increases in accrued expenses and other current liabilities were primarily due to ongoing research,
development, and clinical trial work, and an increase in the incentive bonus accrual as of December&nbsp;31, 2018. The increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets was primarily due to a $0.8&nbsp;million increase in prepaid development

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In June 2017, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement, which we refer to as the Loan Agreement, with Silicon Valley Bank, or SVB,
providing a senior secured <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-revolving</FONT> loan facility of up to an aggregate principal amount of $10.0&nbsp;million, available for us to draw down in three tranches until October&nbsp;31, 2018, subject to the
satisfaction of certain milestones for each tranche.&nbsp;Through the end of the drawdown period on October&nbsp;31, 2018, we had not drawn down from the facility. The Loan Agreement expired on October&nbsp;31, 2018. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The first tranche of $3.5&nbsp;million was made available upon entry into the Loan Agreement as we satisfied the borrowing conditions at such
time.&nbsp;The second tranche of $3.5&nbsp;million would be made available after the funding of the first tranche amounts and upon confirmation by SVB that either we have met certain clinical and developmental milestones, or we have subsequently
obtained at least $7.5&nbsp;million in cash proceeds from the sale of our equity securities from investors reasonably acceptable to SVB.&nbsp;The third tranche of $3.0&nbsp;million would be made available after the funding of the first and second
tranche amounts and upon confirmation by SVB that we have subsequently obtained at least an additional $6.5&nbsp;million in cash proceeds from the sale of our equity securities to investors reasonably acceptable to SVB, and we have received a signed
and enforceable term sheet from investors acceptable to SVB committing to provide financing on or before March&nbsp;31, 2018 in an amount equal to at least 12 months of operating expenses.&nbsp;In January 2018, we received gross cash proceeds of
$60.5&nbsp;million from the sale of our Series B preferred stock. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Any outstanding principal amounts under the Loan Agreement would accrue
interest at a floating per annum rate equal to the greater of 1% and the &#147;prime rate,&#148; as published in the Wall Street Journal, minus 3%. Payments on the Loan Agreement are interest only, payable monthly in arrears, until November&nbsp;1,
2018, which can be extended by six months if the third tranche is drawn. Thereafter, principal and interest amounts are repayable over a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">30-month</FONT> period, unless the third tranche is funded and the initial
interest-only period is extended by six months, in which case principal and interest amounts are repayable over a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">24-month</FONT> period. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Pursuant to the Loan Agreement, we provided a first priority security interest in all existing and after-acquired assets, excluding
intellectual property and certain other assets owned by us. The Loan Agreement contained a negative pledge on our intellectual property. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In connection with the Loan Agreement, we issued a warrant to SVB to purchase shares of our Series&nbsp;A preferred stock at an exercise price
of $0.7949 per share. This warrant was initially exercisable for 28,305&nbsp;shares of Series A preferred stock.&nbsp;Up to an additional 160,397 shares of Series A preferred stock may become subject to this warrant, with the proportion of such
additional shares equal to the percentage of the full $10.0&nbsp;million aggregate principal amount under the Loan Agreement that we draw down thereunder. Following the completion of our IPO, this warrant was initially exercisable for 6,850 shares
of common stock, and up to an additional 38,818 shares of common stock may become subject to this warrant. In July 2018, the initially exercisable warrant of 6,850 shares was net exercised for 6,091 shares of common stock. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Loan Agreement allowed us to voluntarily prepay all but not less than all the outstanding amounts thereunder. A scaling prepayment fee of
1% or 0.5% would be assessed if we prepay the amounts within the first anniversary of funding, or between the first and second anniversary of funding, respectively. No prepayment fee would be assessed if we prepay the amounts after the second
anniversary of funding.&nbsp;A final payment fee of 6.75% multiplied by the original principal amount of each tranche drawn is due upon the earliest to occur of the maturity date of the Loan Agreement, the termination of the Loan Agreement, the
acceleration of the Loan Agreement or repayment or prepayment of such borrowings. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Loan Agreement contained customary indemnification

expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate, we adjust the accrual or the amount of prepaid expenses accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be

because the warrant represented a free-standing financial instrument that may have required us to transfer assets upon exercise. The warrant liability was initially recorded at fair value upon
the date of the warrant issuance and was subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date. Changes in the fair value of the warrant liability were recognized as a component of other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of
operations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We utilized the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which incorporates assumptions and estimates, to value the warrant. We
assessed these assumptions and estimates on a quarterly basis as additional information impacting the assumptions was obtained. Estimates and assumptions impacting the fair value measurement included the fair value per share of the underlying equity
instruments issuable upon exercise of the warrant, the remaining contractual term of the warrant, risk-free interest rate, expected dividend yield and expected volatility of the underlying preferred stock. We have historically been a private company
and lacked company-specific historical and implied volatility information of our stock. Therefore, we estimated expected stock volatility based on the historical volatility of publicly traded peer companies for a term equal to the remaining
contractual term of the warrant. The risk-free interest rate was determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve for time periods approximately equal to the remaining contractual term of the warrant. We estimated a 0% dividend yield based
on the fact that we have never paid or declared dividends. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Upon the closing of our IPO, the preferred stock warrant became exercisable

stock. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Emerging Growth Company Status </B></P>

Section&nbsp;107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period afforded by the JOBS Act for the implementation of new or revised accounting standards. We have elected to use the
extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards and, as a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. We may take advantage
of these exemptions up until the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our IPO or such earlier time that we are no longer an emerging growth company. We would cease to be an emerging growth company if we have more than

December&nbsp;31, 2018 and 2017, we recognized foreign currency transaction losses of $51&nbsp;thousand and $19&nbsp;thousand, respectively. These losses primarily related to unrealized and realized foreign currency gains and losses as a result of
transactions entered into by our Australian and Canadian subsidiaries in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These foreign currency transaction gains and losses were recorded in other expense, net in our consolidated statements of operations. We

assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of
our disclosure controls and procedures as of December&nbsp;31, 2018, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as a result of the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as described below
and in Part&nbsp;II, Item 1A. of this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December&nbsp;31, 2018. Notwithstanding the material weaknesses, our management has concluded that the financial statements included
elsewhere in this report present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows in conformity with GAAP. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In connection with the audit of our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2016 and 2017, we and our
independent registered public accounting firm identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting related to deficiencies in our controls over the financial statement close and cash disbursement processes. Specifically,
there was a lack of controls over the identification and review of complex accounting issues involving significant judgment or estimates as well as the cutoff and classification of certain expenses between general and administrative and research and
development. In addition, our internal controls related to the cash disbursements process were not adequately designed to identify unauthorized payment requests. Specifically, in 2017 we were subject to a cyberattack by a third party. This
deficiency in our controls resulted in the theft of a portion of our funds. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In 2018, we began implementing measures designed to improve
our internal control over financial reporting to remediate these material weaknesses, including formalizing our processes and internal control documentation and strengthening supervisory reviews by our financial management; hiring additional
qualified accounting and finance personnel and engaging financial consultants to enable the implementation of internal control over financial reporting and segregating duties amongst accounting and finance personnel; and planning to implement
certain accounting systems to automate manual processes, such as tracking and accounting for stock-based awards. Although progress has been made to strengthen our controls, as of December&nbsp;31, 2018, management and our independent registered
public accounting firm have concluded that the material weaknesses remain unremediated. In addition, in February 2019, one of our vendors was subject to a cyberattack by a third party, which resulted in the payment by us of a fraudulent invoice.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Additionally, in connection with the audit of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2018, we and our
independent registered public accounting firm identified a further material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to deficiencies in our controls over the financial statement close process. Specifically, there was a lack
of controls over the accounting for accrued research and development expenses. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The measures we are implementing are subject to continued
management review supported by confirmation and testing, as well as audit committee oversight. Management remains committed to the implementation of remediation efforts to address these material weaknesses. We will continue to implement measures to
remedy our internal control deficiencies, though there can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful or avoid potential future material weaknesses. In addition, until remediation steps have been completed and are operated for a sufficient
period of time, and subsequent evaluation of their effectiveness is completed, the material weaknesses previously disclosed, and as described above, will continue to exist. </P>

accompanying consolidated balance sheets of AVROBIO, Inc. (the Company) as of December&nbsp;31, 2018 and 2017, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, redeemable convertible preferred stock and stockholder&#146;s
(deficit) equity and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the &#147;consolidated financial statements&#148;). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of the Company at December&nbsp;31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. </P>

responsibility of the Company&#146;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#146;s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As
part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly, we express no such opinion. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial
statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also
included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. </P>

(the &#147;Company&#148; or &#147;AVROBIO&#148;) is a clinical stage gene therapy company focused on developing potentially curative <I>ex vivo</I> lentiviral gene therapies to treat rare diseases following a single dose. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company is subject to risks and uncertainties common to early-stage companies in the biotechnology industry, including but not limited to,
risks associated with completing preclinical studies and clinical trials, receiving regulatory approvals for product candidates, development by competitors of new biopharmaceutical products, dependence on key personnel, protection of proprietary
technology, compliance with government regulations and the ability to secure additional capital to fund operations. Product candidates currently under development will require significant additional research and development efforts, including
preclinical and clinical testing and regulatory approval, prior to commercialization. These efforts require significant amounts of additional capital, adequate personnel and infrastructure and extensive compliance-reporting capabilities. Even if the
Company&#146;s product development efforts are successful, it is uncertain when, if ever, the Company will realize revenue from product sales. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Through December&nbsp;31, 2018, the Company has funded its operations primarily with proceeds from the sale of series Seed redeemable
convertible preferred stock (the &#147;Series Seed Preferred Stock&#148;), series A redeemable convertible preferred stock (the &#147;Series A Preferred Stock&#148;), series B redeemable convertible preferred stock (the &#147;Series B Preferred
Stock&#148;) (the Series Seed Preferred Stock, the Series A Preferred Stock and the Series B Preferred Stock are collectively referred to as the &#147;Preferred Stock&#148;) and common stock through the Company&#146;s initial public offering
(&#147;IPO&#148;). The Company has incurred recurring losses since its inception, including net losses of $46,361 and $18,648 for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. In addition, as of December&nbsp;31, 2018, the Company
had an accumulated deficit of $71,739. The Company expects to continue to generate operating losses for the near future. The future viability of the Company is dependent on its ability to raise additional capital to finance its operations. The
Company&#146;s inability to raise capital as and when needed could have a negative impact on its financial condition and ability to pursue its business strategies. There can be no assurance that the current operating plan will be achieved or that
additional funding will be available on terms acceptable to the Company, or at all. The Company believes the cash and cash equivalents on hand as of December&nbsp;31, 2018 of $126,302 will be sufficient to fund its operations and capital expenditure
requirements through at least the next twelve months from the filing date of this Annual Report on <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Form&nbsp;10-K</FONT> with the SEC. </P>

the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant
estimates and assumptions reflected in these consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, the accrual for research and development expenses, stock-based compensation expense, the valuation of equity and derivative instruments
and the recoverability of the Company&#146;s net deferred tax assets and related valuation allowance. Estimates are periodically reviewed in light of changes in circumstances, facts and experience. Changes in estimates are recorded in the period in

in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic trends and significant changes or planned changes in the use of the assets. If an impairment review is performed to evaluate a long-lived asset group for recoverability, the
Company compares forecasts of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the long-lived asset group to its carrying value. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows
expected to result from the use of an asset group are less than its carrying amount. The impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying value of the impaired asset group over its fair value, determined based on discounted cash flows.

absence of an active market for the Company&#146;s common stock prior to the IPO, the Company and the Board, the members of which the Company believes have extensive business, finance, and venture capital experience, were required to estimate the
fair value of the Company&#146;s common stock at the time of each grant of a stock-based award. The Company and the Board determined the estimated fair value of the Company&#146;s equity instruments based on a number of factors, including external
market conditions affecting the biotechnology industry sector. The Company and the Board utilized various valuation methodologies in accordance with the framework of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants&#146; Technical Practice
Aid, <I>Valuation of Privately-Held Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation</I>, to estimate the fair value of its common stock. Each valuation methodology includes estimates and assumptions that require the Company&#146;s judgment. These
estimates and assumptions include a number of objective and subjective factors in determining the value of the Company&#146;s common stock at each grant date, including: (1)&nbsp;prices paid for the Company&#146;s redeemable convertible preferred
stock, which the Company had sold to outside investors in <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">arm&#146;s-length</FONT> transactions, and the rights, preferences, and privileges of the Company&#146;s redeemable convertible preferred stock and common

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The fair value of each stock option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. As there was no

awards granted based on an analysis of reported data for a group of guideline companies that issued options with substantially similar terms. The expected volatility has been determined using a weighted-average of the historical volatility measures
of this group of guideline companies. The Company expects to continue to do so until such time as it has adequate historical data regarding the volatility of its own traded stock price. The expected term of the Company&#146;s stock options has been
determined utilizing the &#147;simplified&#148; method for awards that qualify as &#147;plain-vanilla&#148; options. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award
for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. The Company has not paid, and does not anticipate paying, cash dividends on its common stock; therefore, the expected dividend yield is assumed to be zero. </P>

goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The standard defines a five-step process to achieve this principle and will require
companies to use more judgment and make more estimates than under the current guidance. The Company expects that these judgments and estimates will include identifying performance obligations in the customer contract, estimating the amount of
variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. ASU <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">2014-09</FONT> also requires additional disclosure about the nature,
amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts. The Company early adopted ASU <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">2014-09</FONT> at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2018. The adoption of ASU <FONT

classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. A lessee is also required to record <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT

initial consideration for the license, the Company issued 1,161,665 shares of common stock to UHN pursuant to a stock purchase agreement (the &#147;Stock Purchase Agreement&#148;). The Stock Purchase Agreement contained a provision requiring the
Company to make a cash payment to UHN of up to $2,000 if UHN&#146;s fully diluted ownership is reduced within specified percentages as part of an IPO by the Company. The Company concluded the anti-dilution feature represented a derivative instrument
and should be measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized as a gain or loss to other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The initial fair value of the derivative of
$49&nbsp;was recorded as research and development expense in January 2016. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On December&nbsp;31, 2016 and 2017, the Company remeasured the
fair value of the derivative, using current assumptions, resulting in an increase in fair value of $39 and $283, respectively, which was recorded in other expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the years
ended December&nbsp;31, 2016 and 2017, respectively. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On June&nbsp;21, 2018, in connection with the Company&#146;s IPO, the Company
remeasured the fair value of the derivative to $2,000 as the Company was required to pay the dilution payment as mentioned above, which the Company paid in July 2018. An increase in fair value of $1,629 was recorded in other expense in the
accompanying consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2018. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On June&nbsp;23, 2017, the Company entered into the Loan Agreement with a lender, which provided for the issuance of term loans of up to
$10,000, subject to the achievement of various development and corporate milestones. Any outstanding principal amounts under the Loan Agreement accrued interest at a floating per annum rate equal to the greater of 1% and the &#147;prime rate,&#148;
as defined in the Loan Agreement, minus 3%. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Loan Agreement contained customary indemnification obligations and customary events of
default. In the event of default by the Company under the Loan Agreement, the lender would be entitled to exercise their remedies thereunder, including the right to accelerate the debt, upon which the Company may be required to repay all amounts
then outstanding under the Loan Agreement or the lender may take possession of the collateral securing the Loan Agreement. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Loan
Agreement also includes certain restrictions on, among other things, the Company&#146;s ability to incur additional indebtedness, change the name or location of its business, merge with or acquire other entities, pay dividends or make other
distributions to holders of the Company&#146;s capital stock, make certain investments, engage in transactions with affiliates, create liens, open new deposit accounts, sell assets or pay subordinated debt. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of October&nbsp;31, 2018, the Company had not drawn down from the facility and the Loan Agreement expired on October&nbsp;31, 2018. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In connection with the Loan Agreement, the Company agreed to issue a warrant to the lender for the purchase of up to 188,702 shares of the
Company&#146;s Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock with an exercise price of $0.7949 per share. The warrant expires on June&nbsp;22, 2027. The warrant was initially exercisable for the purchase of up to 28,305 shares of Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock and
could become exercisable for up to an additional 160,397 shares of Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock based on the amounts drawn under the Loan Agreement. On the issuance date of the warrant, the Company recorded a deferred financing cost and a liability
for the warrant to purchase preferred stock in the Company&#146;s consolidated balance sheet equal to the issuance-date fair value of the warrant.&nbsp;Upon closing of the IPO, the carrying amount of the warrant to purchase preferred stock as of the
date of IPO was transferred to the account of additional paid in capital (Note 3). </P>

recognized a loss of $162 and $17 in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, related to the change in fair value of the warrant. On July&nbsp;13, 2018, the
lender of the Loan Agreement exercised its common stock warrants to purchase 6,850 shares of common stock on a net basis, resulting in the issuance of 6,091 shares of common stock. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of December&nbsp;31, 2016, the authorized capital stock of the Company included 22,380,952 shares of $0.0001 par value preferred stock, of
which&nbsp;3,333,333 shares were designated as Series Seed Preferred Stock and 19,047,619 shares were designated as Series A Preferred Stock. As of December&nbsp;31, 2017, the authorized capital stock of the Company included 34,972,535 shares of
$0.0001 par value preferred stock, of which&nbsp;3,333,333 shares were designated as Series&nbsp;Seed Preferred Stock and&nbsp;31,639,202 shares were designated as Series A Preferred Stock. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In January 2016, the Company issued and sold 3,333,333 shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock at a price of $0.45 per share, for total proceeds
of $1,398, net of issuance costs of $102. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In July 2016, the Company issued and sold 5,714,286 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, at a
price of $1.3125 per share, for total proceeds of $7,297, net of issuance costs of $203. The terms of the Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement included the obligation of the investors to purchase, and the Company to sell, up to
13,333,333 additional shares of Series A Preferred Stock at $1.3125 per share contingent upon the achievement of certain specified milestones or at the election of a required vote by the investors and the Board. The Company concluded that the right
to participate in the future issuance of Series A Preferred Stock did not meet the definition of a freestanding financial instrument, as the rights were not legally detachable from the Series A Preferred Stock. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In March 2017, the Company amended certain provisions of the Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock. The changes included issuing additional
instruments through a preferred stock dividend in the amount of 3,720,864 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, which effectively repriced the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, changing the purchase price for future shares, and
decreasing the redemption price per share such that total redemption value was not affected. Concurrent with the amendment, the Company issued 4,403,070 additional shares of Series A Preferred Stock at a purchase price of $0.7949 per share, for
total proceeds of $3,452, net of issuance costs of $48. Additionally, the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock which could be issued in the future was changed to 17,612,279 shares. The Company assessed the changes to the terms and concluded
that it represented a material change to substantive terms of the instrument, and therefore represented, for accounting purposes, an extinguishment and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">re-issuance</FONT> of the Series A Preferred Stock outstanding
at the time. As the carrying value of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock prior to the extinguishment was deemed to equal the aggregate fair value of the reissued shares and the shares issued as a dividend, no gain or loss was
recognized on extinguishment of the Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In October 2017, the Company issued and sold an additional 17,612,279

Company has concluded that it is not more likely than not that the benefit of its deferred tax assets will be realized. Accordingly, the Company has provided a full valuation allowance for
deferred tax assets as of December&nbsp;31, 2018 and 2017. The valuation allowance increased $11,991 and $4,568 during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, due primarily to net operating losses generated. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of December&nbsp;31, 2018 and 2017, the Company had U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of $57,279 and $19,007, respectively,
that may be available to offset future income tax liabilities. U.S. federal tax operating loss carryforwards of approximately $17,504 will expire at various dates through 2037. Approximately $39,774 of the U.S. federal tax operating losses can be
carried forward indefinitely. As of December&nbsp;31, 2018 and 2017, the Company also had U.S. state net operating loss carryforwards of $54,212 and $18,866, respectively, which may be available to offset future taxable income. These losses expire
at various dates through 2038. As of December&nbsp;31, 2018 and 2017, the Company had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $1,201 and $296, respectively. The foreign net operating losses can be carried forward indefinitely. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of December&nbsp;31, 2018 and 2017, the Company has federal research and development tax credit carryforwards of $339 and $34 respectively.
The Company qualifies for, and has elected to, apply part of its federal research credits against its payroll tax liability in accordance with certain provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. The amount applied towards the Company&#146;s payroll tax
liability is capped at $250 per year. The federal research credits generated in excess of the $250 cap are able to be carried forward for 20 years. As of December&nbsp;31, 2018 and 2017, the Company had state research and development tax credit
carryforwards of approximately $146 and $119, respectively, available to reduce future tax liabilities which expire at various dates through 2033. For all years through December&nbsp;31, 2018, the Company generated research credits but has not
conducted a study to document the qualified activities. This study may result in an adjustment to the Company&#146;s research and development credit carryforwards. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As the Company carries out extensive research and development activities, it seeks to benefit from the Australian research and development tax
credit cash rebate regime. Under this regime, the Company&#146;s Australian subsidiary, AVROBIO Australia, may be eligible to surrender the trading losses that arise from its research and development activities for a payable tax credit of up to
approximately 43.5% of eligible research and development expenditures. Qualifying expenditures largely comprise employment costs for research staff, consumables, certain internal overhead costs and subcontracted expenditures as part of research
projects for which the Company does not receive income. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2018, the Company recorded $1.3&nbsp;million in research and development tax credits as an offset to research and development expenses. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are subject to review and possible
adjustment by the Internal Revenue Service and state tax authorities. Net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may become subject to an annual limitation in the event of certain cumulative changes in the ownership interest of significant
shareholders over a three-year period in excess of 50&nbsp;percent, as defined under Sections&nbsp;382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code, respectively, as well as similar state provisions. This could limit the amount of tax attributes that can be
utilized annually to offset future tax liabilities. The amount of the annual limitation is determined based on the value of the Company immediately prior to the ownership change. Subsequent ownership changes may further affect the limitation in
future years. The Company has completed numerous financings since its inception, which may have resulted in a change in control as defined by Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code, or could result in a change in control in the future.

states. The foreign, federal and state income tax returns are generally subject to tax examinations for the tax years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 through December&nbsp;31, 2017. To the extent the Company has tax attribute carryforwards, the tax
years in which the attribute was generated may still be adjusted upon examination by foreign tax authorities, the Internal Revenue Service, or state tax authorities to the extent utilized in a future period. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On December&nbsp;22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the &#147;TCJA&#148;). This
legislation reduced the U.S. corporate tax rate from the existing rate of 34% to 21% for tax years beginning after December&nbsp;31, 2017. As a result of the enacted law, the Company was required to revalue deferred tax assets and liabilities
existing at December&nbsp;31, 2017 from the 34% federal rate in effect through the end of 2017, to the new 21% rate. This revaluation resulted in a reduction to the Company&#146;s net deferred tax asset of $2,779. This amount was offset by a
corresponding reduction to the Company&#146;s deferred tax asset valuation allowance. The other provisions of the TCJA did not have a material impact on the December&nbsp;31, 2017 financial statements. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In December 2017, the SEC staff issued SAB 118 to address the application of GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary
information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of H.R.1. The Company did not record any adjustments in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2018 to
provisional amounts that were material to its financial statements. As of December&nbsp;31, 2018, the Company&#146;s accounting treatment is complete. </P>
