Item 1. Business.

General

     Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as
"Gallagher" unless the context otherwise requires) are engaged in providing
insurance brokerage, risk management and related services to clients in the
United States and abroad. Gallagher's principal activity is the negotiation and
placement of insurance for its clients. Gallagher also specializes in furnishing
risk management services. Risk management involves assisting clients in
analyzing risks and determining whether proper protection is best obtained
through the purchase of insurance or through retention of all or a portion of
those risks and the adoption of corporate risk management policies and
cost-effective loss control and prevention programs. Risk management services
also include claims management, loss control consulting and property appraisals.
Gallagher believes that its ability to deliver comprehensively structured risk
management and brokerage services is one of its major strengths. In addition,
Gallagher has a financial services operation that manages Gallagher's investment
portfolio.

     Gallagher operates through a network of more than 250 sales and service
offices located throughout the United States and six countries abroad and
through a network of correspondent brokers and consultants in more than 100
countries around the world. Some of these offices are fully staffed with sales,
marketing, claims and other service personnel; others function as servicing
offices for the brokerage and risk management service operations of Gallagher.
Gallagher's international operations include a Lloyd's of London broker and
affiliated companies in England and other facilities in Australia, Bermuda,
Canada, Scotland and Singapore.

     Gallagher was founded in 1927 and was reincorporated as a Delaware
corporation in 1972. Gallagher's executive offices are located at Two Pierce
Place, Itasca, Illinois 60143-3141, and its telephone number is (630) 773-3800.

Information Concerning Forward-Looking Statements

     This annual report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning
of that term in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the "Act")
found at Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). Additional
written or oral forward-looking statements may be made by Gallagher from time to
time in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), press
releases, or otherwise. Statements contained in this report that are not
historical facts are forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor
provisions of the Act. Forward-looking statements may include, but are not
limited to, discussions concerning revenues, expenses, earnings, cash flow,
capital structure, financial losses, as well as market and industry conditions,
premium rates, financial markets, interest rates, foreign exchange rates,
contingencies and matters relating to Gallagher's operations and income taxes.
In addition, when used in this report, the words "anticipates," "believes,"
"should," "estimates," "expects," "intends," "plans" and variations thereof and
similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such
forward-looking statements are based on available current market and industry
material, experts' reports and opinions and long-term trends, as well as
management's expectations concerning future events impacting Gallagher.

     Forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of Gallagher are subject to
risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to the following: Gallagher's
commission revenues are highly dependent on premiums charged by insurers, which
are subject to fluctuation; lower interest rates reduce Gallagher's income
earned on invested funds; the alternative insurance market continues to grow
which could unfavorably impact commission and favorably impact fee revenue;
Gallagher's revenues vary significantly from period to period as a result of the
timing of policy inception dates and the net effect of new and lost business
production; the general level of economic activity can have a substantial impact
on Gallagher's renewal business; Gallagher's operating results, returns on
investments and financial position may be adversely impacted by exposure to
various market risks such as interest rate, equity pricing, foreign exchange
rates and the competitive environment, and changes in income tax laws.
Gallagher's ability to grow has been enhanced through acquisitions, which may or
may not be available on acceptable terms in the future and which, if
consummated, may or may not be advantageous to Gallagher. Accordingly, actual
results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking
statements.

     Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking
statements contained in this report, which speak only as of the date set forth
on the signature page hereto. Gallagher undertakes no obligation to publicly
release the result of any revisions to these forward-looking statements that may
be made to reflect events or circumstances after such date or to reflect the
occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.

Operating Segments


     Gallagher has identified three operating segments in addition to its
corporate operations. Insurance Brokerage Services encompasses operations that,
for commission or fee compensation, place or arrange to place insurance directly
related to the clients' managing of risk. This segment also provides consulting
services, for fee compensation, related to clients' risk financing programs and
includes Gallagher's retail, reinsurance and wholesale insurance brokerage
operations. Risk Management Services includes Gallagher's third party
administration, loss control and risk management consulting and insurance
property appraisal operations. Third party administration is principally the
management and processing of claims for self insurance programs for Gallagher's
clients or clients of other brokers. Financial Services is responsible for the
management of Gallagher's diversified investment portfolio, which includes
fiduciary funds, marketable and other equity securities, and tax advantaged and
other strategic investments. The invested assets of Gallagher are managed in
this segment in order to maximize the long-term after-tax return to Gallagher.
Corporate consists primarily of the operating results of Gallagher's investment
in the limited partnership that owns its corporate headquarters building,
unallocated administrative costs and the provision for income taxes which is not
allocated to Gallagher's operating segments. Only revenues not attributable to
one of the three operating segments are recorded in the Corporate segment.


     The two major sources of operating revenues for Gallagher are commissions
from insurance brokerage operations and service fees primarily from risk
management operations. Information with respect to all sources of revenue, by
operating segment, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2002, is as follows (in thousands):

*  Restated to conform to the current year presentation. See Note 3 to the
   Consolidated Financial Statements of Gallagher's 2002 Annual Report to
   Stockholders on page 39, which is incorporated herein by reference.

     See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of Gallagher's 2002
Annual Report to Stockholders on pages 55 and 56, which is incorporated herein
by reference for additional financial information, including earnings before
income taxes and identifiable assets, by operating segment, for 2002, 2001 and
2000.


     During 2002 and 2001, Gallagher's total revenues and expenses increased
sequentially from quarter-to-quarter within the calendar years, except for the
second quarter of 2001 and the third quarter of 2002, the latter of which was
negatively impacted by $28.9 million of investment write-downs. However,
commission and fee revenues and the related expenses can vary from
quarter-to-quarter as a result of the timing of policy inception dates that
traditionally are heaviest in the third and fourth quarters. On the other hand,
salaries and employee benefits, rent, depreciation and amortization expenses
tend to be more uniform throughout the year. In addition, the timing of
acquisitions accounted for as purchases will also impact the trends in
Gallagher's quarterly operating results. See Note 17 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements of Gallagher's 2002 Annual Report to Stockholders on page
54, which is incorporated herein by reference for unaudited quarterly operating
results for 2002 and 2001.

Insurance Brokerage Services

     The Insurance Brokerage Services segment comprises two divisions, the
Brokerage Services Division (BSD) and Gallagher Benefit Services (GBS).

     BSD places insurance for and services commercial, industrial,
institutional, governmental, religious and personal accounts throughout the
United States and abroad. BSD acts as an agent in soliciting, negotiating and
effecting contracts of insurance through insurance companies worldwide, as a
broker in procuring contracts of insurance on behalf of insureds, and in setting
up and managing self-insured programs. BSD has the capability to handle
insurable risks and related coverages for all forms of property/casualty
products. BSD also places surplus lines coverages, which are coverages for
various specialized risks not available from insurance companies licensed by the
states in which the risks are located. In addition, BSD's reinsurance
intermediary operations place reinsurance coverages for its insurance company
clients.

     GBS specializes in the management of employee benefit programs through
fully insured and self-insured programs. GBS provides services in connection
with the design, financing, implementation, administration and communication of
compensation and employee benefit programs (including pension and profit-sharing
plans, group life, health, accident and disability insurance programs and tax
deferral plans), and provides other professional services in connection
therewith.

     The primary source of Gallagher's compensation for its Insurance Brokerage
Services segment is commissions paid by insurance companies which are usually
based upon a percentage of the premium paid by insureds. Commission rates are
dependent on a number of factors including the type of insurance, the particular
insurance company and the capacity in which Gallagher acts. In some cases,
Gallagher is compensated for brokerage or advisory services directly by fees
from clients. Gallagher may also receive contingent commissions which are based
on the estimated profit the underwriting insurance company earns and/or the
overall volume of business placed by Gallagher in a given period of time.
Occasionally, Gallagher shares commissions with other brokers who have
participated with Gallagher in placing insurance or servicing insureds. GBS
receives a fee for acting in the capacity of advisor and administrator with
respect to employee benefit programs and receives commissions in connection with
the placement of insurance under such programs.

Risk Management Services

     The Risk Management Services segment comprises two wholly-owned
subsidiaries, Gallagher Bassett Services, Inc. (GB) and Gallagher Benefit
Administrators, Inc. (GBA).

     GB provides a full range of risk management services including claims
management, risk control consulting services, information management, property
appraisals on a totally integrated or select, stand-alone basis. GB provides
these services for Gallagher's clients through a network of service offices
located throughout the United States, Canada, England, Scotland and Australia.

     GB primarily markets its risk management services directly to clients on an
unbundled basis independent of Gallagher. GB also markets these services to
BSD's clients who are interested in P/C risk management related services.

     In connection with its risk management services, GB provides
"self-insurance" programs for large institutions, risk sharing pools and
associations, and large commercial and industrial customers. Self-insurance, as
administered by GB, is a program in which the client assumes a manageable
portion of its insurance risks, usually (although not always) placing the less
predictable and larger loss exposures with an insurance carrier that specializes
in these less predictable exposures.

     GBA is a third-party administrator that serves the self-funded employee
health benefit marketplace by integrating effective managed care and quality
assurance programs with claims administration services. The employee health
benefit services provided by GBA are, in many instances, directly supported by
GBS.

     GB's and GBA's revenues for risk management services are substantially in
the form of fees. These fees are typically negotiated in advance on an annual
basis based upon the estimated volume of the services to be performed.

Financial Services


     Financial Services is primarily responsible for Gallagher's diversified
investment portfolio which includes investment strategies--trading, marketable
securities--trading, tax advantaged investments, real estate partnerships, an
investment in Allied World Assurance Holdings, Ltd., venture capital equity
investments, a minority investment in an alternative fund manager, notes
receivable from investees, and an investment in an airplane leasing company that
leases two cargo airplanes to the French postal service. Financial Services
manages the invested assets of Gallagher in order to maximize the long-term
after-tax return to Gallagher. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements of Gallagher's 2002 Annual Report to Stockholders on pages 40 to 43,
which is incorporated herein by reference for a summary of Gallagher's
investments and notes receivable and for a summary of the assets and liabilities
related to Gallagher's unconsolidated investment portfolio, accounted for using
the equity method.

     Gallagher's equity investment philosophy generally consists of investing in
tax advantaged investments and venture capital equity projects which take a
long-term view toward private sale or public offering. Gallagher uses the
limited partnership or limited liability company forms of legal ownership to
fund many of its investments in order to obtain favorable tax treatment with
respect to gains, losses and distributions, while limiting its liability. Based
on the ownership structure of these investments, management believes that
Gallagher's exposure to losses related to these investments is limited to the
combination of its net carrying value, funding commitments, letters of credit
and financial guarantees. In the event that certain of these limited
partnerships or limited liability companies were to default on their debt
obligations and Gallagher's net carrying value became impaired, the amount to be
written-off could have a material effect on Gallagher's consolidated financial
position or operating results. See Note 4 (pages 40 to 43) and Note 15 (pages 51
and 52) to the Consolidated Financial Statements of Gallagher's 2002 Annual
Report to Stockholders, which is incorporated herein by reference for a summary
of outstanding letters of credit, financial guarantees and funding commitments
and Note 7 on page 45 for a summary of outstanding debt and contingent
commitments.

* Restated to conform to the current year presentation. See Note 3 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements of Gallagher's 2002 Annual Report to
Stockholders on page 39, which is incorporated herein by reference.

     The Insurance Brokerage Services segment's international operations
comprise the following: a Lloyd's of London broker and an insurance brokerage
and risk management joint-venture in the United Kingdom; an insurance brokerage
operation and a "rent-a-captive" insurance company facility in Bermuda;
reinsurance intermediary operations in Australia and Singapore; and a network of
correspondent brokers and consultants in more than 100 countries around the
world.

     Arthur J. Gallagher (UK) Limited (AJG UK) is a wholly-owned London based
subsidiary of Gallagher. It provides brokerage and other services to clients
primarily located outside the United Kingdom. The principal activity of AJG UK
is to negotiate and place insurance and reinsurance with Lloyd's of London
underwriters and insurance companies worldwide. AJG UK's brokerage services
encompass most classes of business within the general categories of aviation,
marine, reinsurance (treaty and facultative) and property/casualty. The thrust
of AJG UK's business development has been with non-United Kingdom brokers,
agents and insurers rather than domestic United Kingdom retail business. Its
clients are primarily insurance and reinsurance companies, underwriters at
Lloyd's of London, Gallagher's non-United Kingdom subsidiaries, other
independent agents and brokers and major business corporations requiring direct
insurance and reinsurance placements.


                                       5

     Risk Management Partners Ltd. (RMP) is a 50% owned joint-venture between
Gallagher and Munich-American Re Corporation that markets customized insurance
and risk management products and services to United Kingdom public entities
through offices in England and Scotland. RMP was formed in 1994 and Gallagher
believes that RMP is now the third largest provider of insurance brokerage
related services to the public entity market in the United Kingdom.

     Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. (Bermuda) Limited provides clients with direct
access to the risk-taking capacity of foreign insurers for both direct and
reinsurance placements. It also acts as a wholesaler to Gallagher's marketing
efforts by accessing global insurance and reinsurance companies in the placement
of United States and foreign risks. In addition, it provides services relating
to the formation and management of offshore captive insurance companies.

     Gallagher has ownership interests in two Bermuda-based insurance companies
that operate "rent-a-captive" facilities; Artex Insurance Company Ltd., a
partially owned joint-venture, and Protected Insurance Company, a wholly-owned
subsidiary. Rent-a-captives enable clients to receive the benefits of owning a
captive insurance company without certain disadvantages of ownership. Captive
insurance companies are created to insure risk and capture underwriting profit
and investment income, which is then available for use by the insured generally
for reducing future costs of their insurance programs.

     Arthur J. Gallagher Australasia Pty Ltd. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Gallagher that is headquartered in Sydney, Australia. This subsidiary provides
reinsurance placements for international or local Australian companies, and
specialty programs and coverages for Australian and other clients through
underwriting facilities with Lloyd's of London underwriters.

     Arthur J. Gallagher Pte Ltd is a 51% owned joint-venture of AJG UK that is
based in Singapore. It specializes in treaty and facultative reinsurance
placements for insurance companies located throughout Asia. These placements are
made directly with reinsurance companies or through Gallagher's subsidiaries and
encompass several lines of business.

     Insurance Brokerage Services also has strategic alliances with a variety of
international brokers in countries where Gallagher does not have a physical
presence. Through a network of correspondent brokers and consultants in more
than 100 countries around the world, Gallagher is able to fully serve its
clients' coverage and service needs wherever their operations are located.

     The Risk Management Services segment's international operations are
principally comprised of risk management companies in the United Kingdom and
Australia.

     Gallagher Bassett International Ltd. (UK) (GB UK), a wholly-owned
subsidiary of GB, provides risk management services for foreign operations, as
well as United States operations that are foreign controlled. Headquartered in
London with offices throughout England and Scotland, GB UK works with insurance
companies, reinsurance companies, overseas brokers, and risk managers of
overseas organizations. Services include consulting, claims management,
information management, loss control and property valuations.

     Wyatt Gallagher Bassett Pty Ltd is a 50% owned joint-venture of GB that is
headquartered in Brisbane, Australia with facilities located throughout
Australia. Wyatt Gallagher Bassett is principally engaged in providing claims
adjusting and risk management services in Australasia.

     Gallagher also has risk management service facilities in Canada that are
not material to Gallagher's Risk Management Services segment.

     See Note 16 (pages 53 and 54) and Note 18 (pages 55 and 56) to the
Consolidated Financial Statements of Gallagher's 2002 Annual Report to
Stockholders which is incorporated herein by reference for additional financial
information related to Gallagher's foreign operations, including earnings before
income taxes and identifiable assets, by operating segment, for 2002, 2001 and
2000.

Markets and Marketing

     A large portion of the commission and fee business of Gallagher is derived
from all types of business institutions, not-for-profit organizations,
associations and municipal and other governmental entities. Gallagher's clients
include United States and multi-national corporations engaged in a broad range
of commercial and industrial businesses. Gallagher also places insurance for
individuals, although this portion of the business is not material to
Gallagher's operations. Gallagher services its clients through its network of
more than 250 sales and service offices in the United States and six countries
abroad. No material part of Gallagher's business is dependent upon a single
customer or on a few customers. The loss of any one customer would not have a
materially adverse effect on Gallagher. In 2002, the largest single customer
represented less than 2% of total revenues.


                                       6

<PAGE>

     Gallagher believes that its ability to deliver comprehensively structured
risk management and brokerage services, including the placement of insurance and
reinsurance, is one of its major strengths. Gallagher also believes that its
risk management business enhances and attracts insurance brokerage business due
to the nature and strength of business relationships that it forms with clients
when providing a variety of risk management services on an ongoing basis.


     Gallagher requires its employees serving in a sales or marketing capacity,
including all executive officers of Gallagher, to enter into agreements with
Gallagher restricting disclosure of confidential information and solicitation of
clients and prospects of Gallagher upon their termination of employment. The
confidentiality and non-solicitation provisions of such agreements terminate in
the event of a hostile change in control of Gallagher, as defined therein.

Competition

     Gallagher believes it is the fourth largest insurance broker worldwide
(third largest in the United States) in terms of total revenues. The insurance
brokerage and service business is highly competitive and there are many
insurance brokerage and service organizations as well as individuals throughout
the world who actively compete with Gallagher in every area of its business. Two
competing firms are significantly larger and have several times the commission
and/or fee revenues of Gallagher. There are firms in a particular region or
locality that are as large or larger than the particular local office of
Gallagher. Gallagher believes that the primary factors determining its
competitive position with other organizations in its industry are the quality of
the services rendered and the overall costs to its clients.


     Gallagher is also in competition with certain insurance companies that
write insurance directly for their customers. Government benefits relating to
health, disability, and retirement are also alternatives to private insurance
and hence indirectly compete with the business of Gallagher. To date, such
direct writing and government benefits have had, in the opinion of Gallagher,
relatively little effect on its business and operations, but Gallagher can make
no prediction as to their effect in the future.


Regulation

     In every state and foreign jurisdiction in which Gallagher does business,
Gallagher or an employee is required to be licensed or receive regulatory
approval in order for Gallagher to conduct business. In addition to licensing
requirements applicable to Gallagher, most jurisdictions require that
individuals who engage in brokerage and certain insurance service activities be
personally licensed.


     Gallagher's insurance brokerage and risk management operations depend on
its continued good standing under the licenses and approvals pursuant to which
it operates. Licensing laws and regulations vary from jurisdiction to
jurisdiction. In all jurisdictions, the applicable licensing laws and
regulations are subject to amendment or interpretation by regulatory
authorities. Generally such authorities are vested with relatively broad and
general discretion as to the granting, renewing and revoking of licenses and
approvals.


2002 Acquisitions

     In 2002, Gallagher acquired the net assets of ten insurance brokerage and
risk management firms in exchange for its common stock and/or cash using the
purchase method for recording business combinations. See Note 2 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements of Gallagher's 2002 Annual Report to
Stockholders on pages 38 and 39, which is incorporated herein by reference for a
summary of the entities acquired, the amount and nature of the consideration
paid and the dates of acquisition.


2003 Acquisitions

     The following acquisitions accounted for as purchases have occurred since
December 31, 2002:

     Effective on January 1, 2003, Gallagher acquired substantially all of the
net assets of W. E. Kingsley Company, Inc., a Kentucky corporation engaged in
the wholesale insurance brokerage and services business, in exchange for 101,000
shares of Gallagher's common stock.


     Effective on January 1, 2003, Gallagher acquired substantially all of the
net assets of McRory & Company and Harman & McRory Company, Washington
corporations engaged in the insurance brokerage and services business, in
exchange for 54,000 and 49,000 shares of Gallagher's common stock, respectively.

     Effective on March 1, 2003, Gallagher acquired substantially all of the net
assets of Benefits Planning & Insurance Agency, Inc., a California corporation
engaged in the benefits insurance business, in exchange for 577,000 shares of
Gallagher's common stock and a contingent obligation of $8,500,000 that, if any
is earned, will be paid in additional shares of Gallagher common stock.

                                       7

<PAGE>

     Gallagher believes that the net effect of these acquisitions has been and
will be to expand the volume of general services rendered by Gallagher and the
geographical areas in which Gallagher renders such services and not to change
substantially the nature of the services performed by Gallagher.

     Gallagher is considering and intends to consider from time to time,
additional acquisitions and divestitures on terms that it deems advantageous.
Gallagher at this time is engaged in preliminary discussions with a number of
candidates for possible future acquisitions and has received signed, non-binding
letters of intent from three acquisition candidates. No assurances can be given
that any additional acquisitions or divestitures will be consummated, or, if
consummated, will be advantageous to Gallagher.

Employees

     As of December 31, 2002, Gallagher employed approximately 7,100 employees,
none of whom is represented by a labor union. Gallagher continuously reviews
benefits and other matters of interest to its employees and considers its
relations with its employees to be satisfactory.

     Gallagher makes available free of charge on its website at www.ajg.com its
annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on
Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section
13(a)or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as soon as reasonably practicable after

40 to 43), Note 7 (page 45) and 15 (pages 51 and 52) to the Consolidated

ownership interest. Gallagher generally operates in leased premises. Certain
office space leases have options permitting renewals for additional periods. In
addition to minimum fixed rentals, a number of leases contain annual escalation
clauses generally related to increases in an inflation index. See Note 15 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements of Gallagher's 2002 Annual Report to
Stockholders on pages 51 and 52, which is incorporated herein by reference for
information with respect to Gallagher's lease commitments at December 31, 2002.
