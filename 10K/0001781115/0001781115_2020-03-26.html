<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">After the initial business combination, our management team
intends to apply a rigorous approach to enhancing shareholder value, including evaluating the experience and expertise of incumbent
management and making changes where appropriate, examining opportunities for revenue enhancement, cost savings, operating efficiencies
and strategic acquisitions and divestitures and developing and implementing corporate strategies and initiatives to improve profitability
and long-term value. In doing so, our management team anticipates evaluating corporate governance, opportunistically accessing
capital markets and other opportunities to enhance liquidity, identifying acquisition and divestiture opportunities and properly
aligning management and board incentives with growing shareholder value. Our management team intends to pursue post-merger initiatives
through participation on the Board of Directors, through direct involvement in and operational control of the company and/or calling
upon a stable of former managers and advisors when necessary.</P>

that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria
in our shareholder communications related to our initial business combination, which, as discussed in this report, would be in

relationships with sellers, financing sources and target management teams. Our management team members have significant experience
in executing transactions under varying economic and financial market conditions. We believe that these networks of contacts and

which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will need
to honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such acquisition opportunity to such entity, and only present
it to us if such entity rejects the opportunity. In addition, we may, at our option, pursue an Affiliated Joint Acquisition opportunity

Any such entity may co-invest with us in the target business at the time of our initial business combination, or we could raise

the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with
our initial business combination. If our Board of Directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">We may, at our option, pursue an Affiliated Joint Acquisition
with an entity affiliated with (or funds advised by) Encompass or with an entity to which an officer or director has a fiduciary
or contractual obligation. Any such parties would co-invest only if (i) permitted by applicable regulatory and other legal limitations;
(ii) we and Encompass considered a transaction to be mutually beneficial to us as well as the affiliated entity; and (iii) other
business reasons exist to do so, such as the strategic merits of including such co-investors, the need for additional capital
beyond the amount held in our trust account to fund the initial business combination and/or the desire to obtain committed capital
for closing the initial business combination. We refer to this potential future issuance, or a similar issuance to other specified
purchasers, as a &ldquo;specified future issuance&rdquo; throughout this report. The amount and other terms and conditions of
any such specified future issuance would be determined at the time thereof. We are not obligated to make any specified future
issuance and may determine not to do so. This is not an offer for any specified future issuance. Pursuant to the anti-dilution
provisions of our Class B ordinary shares, any such specified future issuance would result in an adjustment to the conversion
ratio such that our initial stockholders and their permitted transferees, if any, would retain their aggregate percentage ownership
at 20% of the sum of the total number of all ordinary shares outstanding plus all shares issued in the specified future issuance,
unless the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding Class B ordinary shares agreed to waive such adjustment with respect
to the specified future issuance at the time thereof. We cannot determine at this time whether a majority of the holders of our
Class B ordinary shares at the time of any such specified future issuance would agree to waive such adjustment to the conversion
ratio. They may waive such adjustment due to (but not limited to) the following: (i) closing conditions which are part of the
agreement for our initial business combination; (ii) negotiation with Class A shareholders on structuring an initial business
combination; (iii) negotiation with parties providing financing which would trigger the anti-dilution provisions of the Class
B ordinary shares; or (iv) as part of the Affiliated Joint Acquisition. If such adjustment is not waived, the specified future
issuance would not reduce the percentage ownership of holders of our Class B ordinary shares, but would reduce the percentage
ownership of holders of our Class A ordinary shares. If such adjustment is waived, the specified future issuance would reduce
the percentage ownership of holders of both classes of our ordinary shares.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">We anticipate structuring our initial business combination
so that the post-transaction company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests
or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction
company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives
of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, including an Affiliated Joint Acquisition as described above.
However, we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding
voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required
to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Even
if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to
the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed
to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial
number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling
interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately
prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business
combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the
post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes
of the 80% of net assets test. If our initial business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets
test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses. If our securities are not listed on the NYSE, we would
not be required to satisfy the 80% requirement. However, we intend to satisfy the 80% requirement even if our securities are not
listed on the NYSE at the time of our initial business combination.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">We believe our structure makes us an attractive business combination
partner to target businesses. As an existing public company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial
public offering through a merger or other business combination. In this situation, the owners of the target business would exchange
their shares of stock in the target business for our shares or for a combination of our shares and cash, allowing us to tailor
the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. Although there are various costs and obligations associated with being
a public company, we believe target businesses will find this method a more certain and cost effective method to becoming a public
company than the typical initial public offering. In a typical initial public offering, there are additional expenses incurred
in marketing, road show and public reporting efforts that may not be present to the same extent in connection with a business
combination with us.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 7pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Furthermore, once a proposed business combination is completed,
the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters&rsquo;
ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could delay or prevent the offering from occurring.
Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management
incentives consistent with shareholders&rsquo; interests. It can offer further benefits by augmenting a company&rsquo;s profile
among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 7pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">While we believe that our structure and our management team&rsquo;s
backgrounds makes us an attractive business partner, some potential target businesses may have a negative view of us since we
are a blank check company, without an operating history, and there is uncertainty relating to our ability to obtain shareholder
approval of our proposed initial business combination and retain sufficient funds in our trust account in connection therewith.</P>

such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations
or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt ratio. Because we are able to complete our initial business combination
using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient

commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions.
In the event our sponsor, directors, officers or advisors, the Encompass Funds, or their respective affiliates determine to make
any such purchases at the time of a shareholder vote relating to our initial business combination, such purchases could have the
effect of influencing the vote necessary to approve such transaction. None of the funds in the trust account will be used to purchase
shares in such transactions. They will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information
not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Such a purchase may include
a contractual acknowledgement that such shareholder, although still the record holder of our Class A ordinary shares, is no longer
the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights. We have adopted an insider trading policy
which requires insiders to: (i) refrain from purchasing our shares during certain blackout periods and when they are in possession
of any material non-public information and (ii) to clear all trades with our legal counsel prior to execution. We cannot currently
determine whether our insiders will make such purchases pursuant to a Rule&nbsp;10b5-1 plan, as it will be dependent upon several
factors, including but not limited to, the timing and size of such purchases. Depending on such circumstances, our insiders may
either make such purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan or determine that such a plan is not necessary.</P>

a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private
rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject

of our initial business combination. We expect that at the time of any shareholder vote relating to our initial business combination,
our sponsor and its permitted transferees will own at least 20% of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares entitled to vote
thereon. Each public shareholder may elect to redeem their public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed

provides that we will only redeem our public shares so long as (after such redemption) our net tangible assets will be at least
$5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon consummation of our initial business combination and after payment of underwriters&rsquo;
fees and commissions (so that we are not subject to the SEC&rsquo;s &ldquo;penny stock&rdquo; rules). Redemptions of our public
shares may also be subject to a higher net tangible asset test or cash requirement pursuant to an agreement relating to our initial
business combination. For example, the proposed business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target
or its owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the
retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event
the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all Class A ordinary shares that are validly submitted for redemption
plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate
amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, and all Class A ordinary shares

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we seek shareholder approval
of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant
to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that a public shareholder, together
with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a &ldquo;group&rdquo;
(as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than
15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering (the &ldquo;Excess Shares&rdquo;). We believe this restriction will discourage
shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise
their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our sponsor or its affiliates to purchase
their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a
public shareholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering could threaten to exercise
its redemption rights if such holder&rsquo;s shares are not purchased by us or our sponsor or its affiliates at a premium to the
then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our shareholders&rsquo; ability to redeem no more than 15%
of the shares sold in our initial public offering our purchased thereafter through open market purchases, we believe we will limit
the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination,
particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum
net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our shareholders&rsquo; ability to vote all of their
shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination. Our sponsor, officers and directors have, pursuant
to a letter agreement entered into with us, waived their right to have any founder shares or public shares held by them redeemed
in connection with our initial business combination. Unless any of our other affiliates acquires founder shares through a permitted
transfer from an initial shareholder, and thereby becomes subject to the letter agreement, no such affiliate is subject to this
waiver. However, to the extent any such affiliate acquires public shares, it would be a public shareholder and restricted from
seeking redemption rights with respect to any Excess Shares.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">We may require our public shareholders seeking to exercise
their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in &ldquo;street name,&rdquo; to either tender their
certificates (if any) to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the tender offer documents, or up to two business days
prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the business combination in the event we distribute proxy materials, or to deliver
their shares to the transfer agent electronically using The Depository Trust Company&rsquo;s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian)
System, rather than simply voting against the initial business combination. The tender offer or proxy materials, as applicable,
that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate whether
we are requiring public shareholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. Accordingly, a public shareholder would have from
the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two days prior to the vote
on the business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise
its redemption rights. Pursuant to the tender offer rules, the tender offer period will be not less than 20 business days and,
in the case of a shareholder vote, a final proxy statement would be mailed to public shareholders at least 10 days prior to the
shareholder vote. However, we expect that a draft proxy statement would be made available to such shareholders well in advance
of such time, providing additional notice of redemption if we conduct redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation. Given
the relatively short exercise period, it is advisable for shareholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced
tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will
typically charge the tendering broker $80.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming
holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights
to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of
when such delivery must be effectuated.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn
at any time up to the date set forth in the tender offer materials or the date of the shareholder meeting set forth in our proxy
materials, as applicable. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election
of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may
simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds
to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion
of our initial business combination.</P>

well as payments to any creditors, if we do not complete an initial business combination by November 29, 2021, although we cannot

(other than our independent auditors), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements
with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit
of our public shareholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements
that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement,
breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in
each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account.
If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management
will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has
not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party&rsquo;s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to
us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include
the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly
superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service
provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they
may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek
recourse against the trust account for any reason. Upon redemption of our public shares, if we are unable to complete our initial
business combination within the prescribed time frame, or upon the exercise of a redemption right in connection with our initial
business combination, we will be required to provide for payment of claims of creditors that were not waived that may be brought
against us within the 10 years following redemption. Our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent
any claims by a third party (other than our independent auditors) for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective
target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account
to below (i) $10.00 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the
liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which
may be withdrawn to pay taxes. This liability will not apply with respect to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver
of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters
of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Because we are a blank
check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations are limited to searching for prospective target businesses
to acquire, the only third parties we currently expect to engage would be vendors such as lawyers, investment bankers, computer
or information and technical services providers or prospective target businesses. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed
to be unenforceable against a third party, then our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party
claims. We have not independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy their indemnity obligations and
believe that our sponsor&rsquo;s only assets are securities of our company. None of our other officers will indemnify us for claims
by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.</P>

may be withdrawn to pay taxes, and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it
has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal
action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors
would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that
our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. Accordingly,
we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be substantially

$10.00 per share to our public shareholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition
is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by shareholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor
and/or bankruptcy laws as either a &ldquo;preferential transfer&rdquo; or a &ldquo;fraudulent conveyance.&rdquo; As a result,
a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by our shareholders. Furthermore, our Board of Directors may be
viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself

for our initial business combination, we encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar
to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking
strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business
combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and
other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources.
This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation
to pay cash in connection with our public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available
to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may
not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully

the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Because
we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective

purchases, while transactions such as direct mergers with our company or transactions where we issue more than 20% of our outstanding
shares would require shareholder approval. For instance, the NYSE rules currently allow us to engage in a tender offer in lieu
of a shareholder meeting but would still require us to obtain shareholder approval if we were seeking to issue more than 20% of
our outstanding shares to a target business as consideration in any business combination. Therefore, if we were structuring a
business combination that required us to issue more than 20% of our outstanding shares, we would seek shareholder approval of
such business combination. Except as required by law or NYSE rules, the decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval
of a proposed business combination or will allow shareholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us,
solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors, such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms
of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek shareholder approval. Accordingly, we may consummate our initial business

so long as (after such redemption) our net tangible assets will be at least $5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon consummation
of our initial business combination and after payment of underwriters&rsquo; fees and commissions (so that we are not subject
to the SEC&rsquo;s &ldquo;penny stock&rdquo; rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained
in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. Consequently, if accepting all properly submitted redemption requests
would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 or such greater amount necessary to satisfy a closing condition,
each as described above, we would not proceed with such redemption and the related business combination and may instead search

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">At the time we enter into an agreement for our initial business
combination, we will not know how many shareholders may exercise their redemption rights, and therefore we will need to structure
the transaction based on our expectations as to the number of shares that will be submitted for redemption. If our initial business
combination agreement requires us to use a portion of the cash in the trust account to pay the purchase price, or requires us
to have a minimum amount of cash at closing, we will need to reserve a portion of the cash in the trust account to meet such requirements,
or arrange for third party financing. In addition, if a larger number of shares are submitted for redemption than we initially
expected, we may need to restructure the transaction to reserve a greater portion of the cash in the trust account or arrange
for third party financing. Raising additional third party financing may involve dilutive equity issuances or the incurrence of
indebtedness at higher than desirable levels. Furthermore, this dilution would increase to the extent that the anti-dilution provisions
of the Class B ordinary shares result in the issuance of Class A ordinary shares on a greater than one-to-one basis upon conversion
of the Class B shares at the time of the initial business combination. The above considerations may limit our ability to complete
the most desirable business combination available to us or optimize our capital structure.</P>

our ability to compete with respect to the acquisition of certain target businesses that are sizable will be limited by our available

Neither our sponsor, members of our management team nor any of their affiliates is under any obligation to advance funds to us
in such circumstances. Any such advances would be repaid only from funds held outside the trust account or from funds released
to us upon completion of our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination because
we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the trust account. If we

or that factors outside of the target business and outside of our control will not later arise. As a result of these factors,
we may be forced to later write-down or write-off assets, restructure our operations, or incur impairment or other charges that
could result in our reporting losses. Even if our due diligence successfully identifies certain risks, unexpected risks may arise
and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with our preliminary risk analysis. Even though these charges
may be non-cash items and not have an immediate impact on our liquidity, the fact that we report charges of this nature could
contribute to negative market perceptions about us or our securities. In addition, charges of this nature may cause us to violate
net worth or other covenants to which we may be subject as a result of assuming pre-existing debt held by a target business or
by virtue of our obtaining post-combination debt financing. Accordingly, any shareholders who choose to remain shareholders following
the business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their shares. Such shareholders are unlikely to have a remedy
for such reduction in value.</P>

with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit
of our public shareholders, such parties may not execute such agreements, or even if they execute such agreements they may not
be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account, including, but not limited to, fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary
responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order
to gain advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party
refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis
of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if
management believes that such third party&rsquo;s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative.</P>

that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations,
contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. Upon redemption of our public
shares, if we are unable to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed timeframe, or upon the exercise of
a redemption right in connection with our initial business combination, we will be required to provide for payment of claims of
creditors that were not waived that may be brought against us within the 10 years following redemption. Accordingly, the per-share
redemption amount received by public shareholders could be less than the $10.00 per share initially held in the trust account,

the trust account to below (i)&nbsp;$10.00 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account
as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of
the interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all
rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial
public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Moreover, in the event that an executed
waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability
for such third party claims. We have not independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy their indemnity
obligations and believe that our sponsor&rsquo;s only assets are securities of our company. Our sponsor may not have sufficient
funds available to satisfy those obligations. We have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such obligations, and therefore, no
funds are currently set aside to cover any such obligations. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made against the
trust account, the funds available for our initial business combination and redemptions could be reduced to less than $10.00 per
public share. In such event, we may not be able to complete our initial business combination, and you would receive such lesser
amount per share in connection with any redemption of your public shares. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us
for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.</P>

arise which represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement or prospectus, the financial
statements contained or incorporated by reference therein are not current or correct or the SEC issues a stop order. If the shares
issuable upon exercise of the warrants are not registered under the Securities Act, we will be required to permit holders to exercise
their warrants on a cashless basis. However, no warrant will be exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, and we will not be
obligated to issue any shares to holders seeking to exercise their warrants, unless the issuance of the shares upon such exercise
is registered or qualified under the securities laws of the state of the exercising holder, or an exemption is available. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if a registration statement covering the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants is not
effective within a specified period following the consummation of our initial business combination, warrant holders may, until
such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when we shall have failed to maintain an effective
registration statement, exercise warrants on a cashless basis pursuant to the exemption provided by Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities
Act, provided that such exemption is available. If that exemption, or another exemption, is not available, holders will not be
able to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis. We will use our best efforts to register or qualify the shares under applicable
blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available. In no event will we be required to net cash settle any warrant, or
issue securities or other compensation in exchange for the warrants in the event that we are unable to register or qualify the
shares underlying the warrants under applicable state securities laws and no exemption is available. If the issuance of the shares
upon exercise of the warrants is not so registered or qualified or exempt from registration or qualification, the holder of such
warrant shall not be entitled to exercise such warrant and such warrant may have no value and expire worthless. In such event,
holders who acquired their warrants as part of a purchase of units will have paid the full unit purchase price solely for the
Class A ordinary shares included in the units. If and when the warrants become redeemable by us, we may not exercise our redemption
right if the issuance of shares upon exercise of the warrants is not exempt from registration or qualification under applicable
state blue sky laws or we are unable to effect such registration or qualification. We will use our best efforts to register or
qualify such shares under the blue sky laws of the state of residence in those states in which the warrants were offered by us
in our initial public offering.</P>

of warrants that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans, may demand that we register such warrants or the Class

and availability of such a significant number of securities for trading in the public market may have an adverse effect on the
market price of our Class A ordinary shares. In addition, the existence of the registration rights may make our initial business
combination more costly or difficult to conclude. This is because the shareholders of the target business may increase the equity
stake they seek in the combined entity or ask for more cash consideration to offset the negative impact on the market price of
our Class A ordinary shares that is expected when the Class A ordinary shares owned by our sponsor, holders of our private placement

ultimately prove to be more favorable to investors than a direct investment, if such opportunity were available, in a business
combination target. Accordingly, any shareholders who choose to remain shareholders following the business combination could suffer
a reduction in the value of their shares. Such shareholders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value unless they
are able to successfully claim that the reduction was due to the breach by our officers or directors of a duty of care or other
fiduciary duty owed to them, or if they are able to successfully bring a private claim under securities laws that the tender offer

that it will not be a PFIC for either of the two taxable years following the start-up year; and (3) the corporation is not in

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">In general, if we are determined to be a PFIC, a U.S. Holder
may avoid the PFIC tax consequences described above in respect to our Class A ordinary shares (but not our warrants) by making
a timely QEF election (if eligible to do so) to include in income its pro rata share of our net capital gains (as long-term capital
gain) and other earnings and profits (as ordinary income), on a current basis, in each case whether or not distributed, in the
taxable year of the U.S. Holder in which or with which our taxable year ends. A U.S. Holder generally may make a separate election
to defer the payment of taxes on undistributed income inclusions under the QEF rules, but if deferred, any such taxes will be
subject to an interest charge.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">A U.S. Holder may not make a QEF election with respect to its
warrants to acquire our Class A ordinary shares. As a result, if a U.S. Holder sells or otherwise disposes of such warrants (other
than upon exercise of such warrants), any gain recognized generally will be subject to the special tax and interest charge rules
treating the gain as an excess distribution, as described above, if we were a PFIC at any time during the period the U.S. Holder
held the warrants. If a U.S. Holder that exercises such warrants properly makes a QEF election with respect to the newly acquired
Class A ordinary shares (or has previously made a QEF election with respect to our Class A ordinary shares), the QEF election
will apply to the newly acquired Class A ordinary shares, but the adverse tax consequences relating to PFIC shares, adjusted to
take into account the current income inclusions resulting from the QEF election, will continue to apply with respect to such newly
acquired Class A ordinary shares (which generally will be deemed to have a holding period for purposes of the PFIC rules that
includes the period the U.S. Holder held the warrants), unless the U.S. Holder makes a purging election. The purging election
creates a deemed sale of such shares at their fair market value. The gain recognized by the purging election will be subject to
the special tax and interest charge rules treating the gain as an excess distribution, as described above. As a result of the
purging election, the U.S. Holder will have a new basis and holding period in the Class A ordinary shares acquired upon the exercise
of the warrants for purposes of the PFIC rules.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The QEF election is made on a shareholder-by-shareholder basis
and, once made, can be revoked only with the consent of the IRS. A QEF election may not be made with respect to our warrants.
A U.S. Holder generally makes a QEF election by attaching a completed IRS Form 8621 (Return by a Shareholder of a Passive Foreign
Investment Company or Qualified Electing Fund), including the information provided in a PFIC annual information statement, to
a timely filed U.S. federal income tax return for the tax year to which the election relates. Retroactive QEF elections generally
may be made only by filing a protective statement with such return and if certain other conditions are met or with the consent
of the IRS. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the availability and tax consequences of a retroactive
QEF election under their particular circumstances.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 15pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">In order to comply with the requirements of a QEF election,
a U.S. Holder must receive a PFIC annual information statement from us. If we determine we are a PFIC for any taxable year, we
will endeavor to provide to a U.S. Holder such information as the IRS may require, including a PFIC annual information statement,
in order to enable the U.S. Holder to make and maintain a QEF election. However, there is no assurance that we will have timely
knowledge of our status as a PFIC in the future or of the required information to be provided.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">If a U.S. Holder has made a QEF election with respect to our
Class A ordinary shares, and the special tax and interest charge rules do not apply to such shares (because of a timely QEF election
for our first taxable year as a PFIC in which the U.S. Holder holds (or is deemed to hold) such shares or a purge of the PFIC
taint pursuant to a purging election, as described above), any gain recognized on the sale of our Class A ordinary shares generally
will be taxable as capital gain and no interest charge will be imposed under the PFIC rules. As discussed above, U.S. Holders
of a QEF are currently taxed on their pro rata shares of its earnings and profits, whether or not distributed. In such case, a
subsequent distribution of such earnings and profits that were previously included in income generally should not be taxable as
a dividend to such U.S. Holders. The tax basis of a U.S. Holder&rsquo;s shares in a QEF will be increased by amounts that are
included in income, and decreased by amounts distributed but not taxed as dividends, under the above rules.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Although a determination as to our PFIC status will be made
annually, an initial determination that our company is a PFIC will generally apply for subsequent years to a U.S. Holder who held
Class A ordinary shares or warrants while we were a PFIC, whether or not we meet the test for PFIC status in those subsequent
years. A U.S. Holder who makes the QEF election discussed above for our first taxable year as a PFIC in which the U.S. Holder
holds (or is deemed to hold) our Class A ordinary shares, however, will not be subject to the PFIC tax and interest charge rules
discussed above in respect to such shares. In addition, such U.S. Holder will not be subject to the QEF inclusion regime with
respect to such shares for any taxable year of us that ends within or with a taxable year of the U.S. Holder and in which we are
not a PFIC. On the other hand, if the QEF election is not effective for each of our taxable years in which we are a PFIC and the
U.S. Holder holds (or is deemed to hold) our Class A ordinary shares, the PFIC rules discussed above will continue to apply to
such shares unless the holder makes a purging election, as described above, and pays the tax and interest charge with respect
to the gain inherent in such shares attributable to the pre-QEF election period.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Alternatively, if a U.S. Holder, at the close of its taxable
year, owns shares in a PFIC that are treated as marketable stock, the U.S. Holder may make a mark-to-market election with respect
to such shares for such taxable year. If the U.S. Holder makes a valid mark-to-market election for the first taxable year of the
U.S. Holder in which the U.S. Holder holds (or is deemed to hold) Class A ordinary shares in us and for which we are determined
to be a PFIC, such holder generally will not be subject to the PFIC rules described above in respect to its Class A ordinary shares.
Instead, in general, the U.S. Holder will include as ordinary income each year the excess, if any, of the fair market value of
its Class A ordinary shares at the end of its taxable year over the adjusted basis in its Class A ordinary shares. The U.S. Holder
also will be allowed to take an ordinary loss in respect of the excess, if any, of the adjusted basis of its Class A ordinary
shares over the fair market value of its Class A ordinary shares at the end of its taxable year (but only to the extent of the
net amount of previously included income as a result of the mark-to-market election). The U.S. Holder&rsquo;s basis in its Class
A ordinary shares will be adjusted to reflect any such income or loss amounts, and any further gain recognized on a sale or other
taxable disposition of the Class A ordinary shares will be treated as ordinary income. Currently, a mark-to-market election likely
may not be made with respect to our warrants.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">The mark-to-market election is available only for stock that
is regularly traded on a national securities exchange that is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including
the Nasdaq Capital Market, or on a foreign exchange or market that the IRS determines has rules sufficient to ensure that the
market price represents a legitimate and sound fair market value. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding
the availability and tax consequences of a mark-to-market election in respect to our Class A ordinary shares under their particular
circumstances.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">If we are a PFIC and, at any time, have a foreign subsidiary
that is classified as a PFIC, U.S. Holders generally would be deemed to own a portion of the shares of such lower-tier PFIC, and
generally could incur liability for the deferred tax and interest charge described above if we receive a distribution from, or
dispose of all or part of our interest in, the lower-tier PFIC or the U.S. Holders otherwise were deemed to have disposed of an
interest in the lower-tier PFIC. We will endeavor to cause any lower-tier PFIC to provide to a U.S. Holder the information that
may be required to make or maintain a QEF election with respect to the lower-tier PFIC. However, there is no assurance that we
will have timely knowledge of the status of any such lower-tier PFIC. In addition, we may not hold a controlling interest in any
such lower-tier PFIC and thus there can be no assurance we will be able to cause the lower-tier PFIC to provide the required information.
U.S. Holders are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the tax issues raised by lower-tier PFICs.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">When evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business
combination with a prospective target business, our ability to assess the target business&rsquo;s management may be limited due
to a lack of time, resources or information. Our assessment of the capabilities of the target&rsquo;s management, therefore, may
prove to be incorrect and such management may lack the skills, qualifications or abilities we suspected. Should the target&rsquo;s
management not possess the skills, qualifications or abilities necessary to manage a public company, the operations and profitability
of the post-combination business may be negatively impacted. Accordingly, any shareholders who choose to remain shareholders following
the business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their shares. Such shareholders are unlikely to have a remedy
for such reduction in value.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">We may structure a business combination so that the post-transaction
company in which our public shareholders own shares will own less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business,
but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding
voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for us not to be required
to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. We will not consider any transaction that does not meet
such criteria. Even if the post-transaction company owns 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders
prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post business combination company, depending
on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction
in which we issue a substantial number of new Class A ordinary shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of
a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial
number of new Class A ordinary shares, our shareholders immediately prior to such transaction could own less than a majority of
our issued and outstanding Class A ordinary shares subsequent to such transaction. In addition, other minority shareholders may
subsequently combine their holdings resulting in a single person or group obtaining a larger share of the company&rsquo;s stock
than we initially acquired. Accordingly, this may make it more likely that our management will not be able to maintain our control
of the target business. We cannot provide assurance that, upon loss of control of a target business, new management will possess

sales price of our Class A ordinary shares equal or exceed $18.00 per share (as adjusted for share splits, share capitalizations,
rights issuances, subdivisions, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading-day
period ending on the third trading day prior to the date we send the notice of redemption to the warrant holders. If and when
the warrants become redeemable by us, we may not exercise our redemption right if the issuance of shares upon exercise of the
warrants is not exempt from registration or qualification under applicable state blue sky laws or we are unable to effect such
registration or qualification. We will use our best efforts to register or qualify such shares under the blue sky laws of the
state of residence in those states in which the warrants were offered by us in our initial public offering. Redemption of the
outstanding warrants could force you (i) to exercise your warrants and pay the exercise price therefor at a time when it may be
disadvantageous for you to do so, (ii) to sell your warrants at the then-current market price when you might otherwise wish to
hold your warrants or (iii) to accept the nominal redemption price which, at the time the outstanding warrants are called for
redemption, is likely to be substantially less than the market value of your warrants. None of the private placement warrants,
and none of the public warrants purchased by the Encompass Funds, will be redeemable by us so long as they are held by our sponsor
or its permitted transferees, or the Encompass Funds, respectively.</P>

at a price of $11.50 per share (subject to adjustment as provided herein), as part of the units offered in our initial public
offering and, simultaneously with the closing of our initial public offering, we issued 8,750,000 private placement warrants,
each exercisable to purchase one Class A ordinary share at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment. Prior to our initial
public offering, our sponsor purchased an aggregate of 7,187,500 founder shares in a private placement. The founder shares are
convertible into Class A ordinary shares on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment as set forth herein and in our amended
and restated memorandum and articles of association. In addition, if our sponsor makes any working capital loans, up to $1,500,000
of such loans may be converted into warrants, at the price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. Such warrants would
be identical to the private placement warrants. To the extent we issue Class A ordinary shares to effectuate a business transaction,
the potential for the issuance of a substantial number of additional Class A ordinary shares upon exercise of these warrants or
conversion rights could make us a less attractive acquisition vehicle to a target business. Any such issuance will increase the
number of issued and outstanding Class A ordinary shares and reduce the value of the Class A ordinary shares issued to complete
the business transaction. Therefore, our warrants and founder shares may make it more difficult to effectuate a business combination
or increase the cost of acquiring the target business.</P>

not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure
obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements
of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not
previously approved. As a result, our shareholders may not have access to certain information they may deem important. We could
be an emerging growth company for up to five years, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including
if the market value of our Class A ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any June 30 before that time,
in which case we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following December 31. We cannot predict whether investors
will find our securities less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our securities less
attractive as a result of our reliance on these exemptions, the trading prices of our securities may be lower than they otherwise

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging
growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that
is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered
under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that
a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth
companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period
which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies,
we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised
standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth
company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because
of the potential differences in accountant standards used.</P>

common law of the Cayman Islands. The rights of shareholders to take action against the directors, actions by minority shareholders
and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors to us under Cayman Islands law are to a large extent governed by the common
law of the Cayman Islands. The common law of the Cayman Islands is derived in part from comparatively limited judicial precedent
in the Cayman Islands as well as from English common law, the decisions of whose courts are of persuasive authority, but are not
binding on a court in the Cayman Islands. The rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under
Cayman Islands law are different from what they would be under statutes or judicial precedent in some jurisdictions in the United
States. In particular, the Cayman Islands has a different body of securities laws as compared to the United States, and certain

actions brought in the Cayman Islands, to impose liabilities against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the
federal securities laws of the United States or any state, so far as the liabilities imposed by those provisions are penal in
nature. In those circumstances, although there is no statutory enforcement in the Cayman Islands of judgments obtained in the
United States, the courts of the Cayman Islands will recognize and enforce a foreign money judgment of a foreign court of competent
jurisdiction without retrial on the merits based on the principle that a judgment of a competent foreign court imposes upon the
judgment debtor an obligation to pay the sum for which judgment has been given provided certain conditions are met. For a foreign
judgment to be enforced in the Cayman Islands, such judgment must be final and conclusive and for a liquidated sum, and must not
be in respect of taxes or a fine or penalty, inconsistent with a Cayman Islands judgment in respect of the same matter, impeachable
on the grounds of fraud or obtained in a manner, or be of a kind the enforcement of which is, contrary to natural justice or the
public policy of the Cayman Islands (awards of punitive or multiple damages may well be held to be contrary to public policy).

operate could result in our curtailing operations or delays in project completions. In the event that countries in which we may
operate experience civil or political unrest or acts of terrorism, especially in events where such unrest leads to an unseating
of the established government, our operations could be materially impaired. Our potential international operations may also be
adversely affected, directly or indirectly, by laws, policies, and regulations of the United States affecting foreign trade and
taxation, including U.S. trade sanctions. Realization of any of the factors listed above could materially and adversely affect

geographically and among various sectors of the economy and such growth may not be sustained in the future. If in the future such
country&rsquo;s economy experiences a downturn or grows at a slower rate than expected, there may be less demand for spending
in certain industries. A decrease in demand for spending in certain industries could materially and adversely affect our ability
to find an attractive target business with which to consummate our initial business combination and if we effect our initial business
combination, the ability of that target business to become profitable.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">In the event we acquire a non-U.S. target, all revenues and
income would likely be received in a foreign currency, and the dollar equivalent of our net assets and distributions, if any,
could be adversely affected by reductions in the value of the local currency. The value of the currencies in our target regions
fluctuate and are affected by, among other things, changes in political and economic conditions. Any change in the relative value
of such currency against our reporting currency may affect the attractiveness of any target business or, following consummation
of our initial business combination, our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, if a currency appreciates
in value against the dollar prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, the cost of a target business as measured
in dollars will increase, which may make it less likely that we are able to consummate such transaction.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">On January 30, 2020, the International Health Regulations Emergency
Committee of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak a public health emergency
of international concern and on March 12, 2020 the WHO announced the outbreak was a pandemic . On January 31, 2020 the U.S. Health
and Human Services Secretary Mr. Azar II declared a public health emergency for the United States to aid the U.S. healthcare community
in responding to COVID-19. If the COVID-19 outbreak lasts for an extended period of time, it may impact our ability to search
for and acquire a target company. Potential target companies may defer or end discussions for a potential business combination
with us if the COVID-19 virus materially adversely affects their business operations and, therefore, the valuation of their business.
Although this depression in valuation, may assist us in finding attractive transactions, we may be unable to complete a business
combination if continued concerns relating to COVID-19 virus restrict travel or the target company&rsquo;s personnel, vendors
and services providers are unavailable to negotiate and consummate a transaction in a timely manner. If the disruptions posed
by COVID-19 or other matters of global concern continue for an unexpectedly long period of time, our ability to consummate a business
combination may be materially adversely affected.</P>

We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until after completion of our Business Combination. We generate non-operating
income in the form of interest income on marketable securities held in our trust account (the &ldquo;Trust Account&rdquo;). We
are incurring expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance),

(which interest shall be net of taxes payable and excluding deferred underwriting commissions) to complete our Business Combination.
To the extent that our share capital is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete a Business Combination, the remaining
proceeds held in the trust account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses,
make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies.</P>

business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective
target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target
businesses, structure, negotiate and complete a Business Combination.</P>

of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete a Business Combination,
we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working
capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts, but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for
such repayment. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants, at a price of $1.00 per warrant unit at the option
of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the Private Placement Warrants.</P>

additional funds in order to meet the expenditures required for operating our business. However, if our estimate of the costs
of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a Business Combination are less than the
actual amount necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our initial Business
Combination. Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our Business Combination or because we become
obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of our Business Combination, in which case we may
issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such Business Combination.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left">The preparation of condensed financial
statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported.
Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following critical accounting policies:</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left">We account for our ordinary shares subject
to possible conversion in accordance with the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (&ldquo;ASC&rdquo;) Topic 480 &ldquo;Distinguishing
Liabilities from Equity.&rdquo; Ordinary shares subject to mandatory redemption are classified as a liability instrument and are
measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable ordinary shares (including ordinary shares that feature redemption rights that
are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within
our control) are classified as temporary equity. At all other times, ordinary shares are classified as shareholders&rsquo; equity.
Our ordinary shares feature certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of our control and subject to occurrence
of uncertain future events. Accordingly, ordinary shares subject to possible redemption are presented at redemption value as temporary
equity, outside of the shareholders&rsquo; equity section of our balance sheet.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left">We apply the two-class method in calculating
earnings per share. Ordinary shares subject to possible redemption, which are not currently redeemable and are not redeemable
at fair value, have been excluded from the calculation of basic net income (loss) per ordinary share since such shares, if redeemed,
only participate in their pro rata share of the trust account earnings. Our net income is adjusted for the portion of income that
is attributable to ordinary shares subject to redemption, as these shares only participate in the earnings of the trust account
and not our income or losses.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left">Disclosure controls are procedures that
are designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange
Act, such as this Report, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time period specified in the SEC&rsquo;s
rules and forms. Disclosure controls are also designed with the objective of ensuring that such information is accumulated and
communicated to our management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management evaluated, with the participation of our current chief executive officer
and chief financial officer (our &ldquo;Certifying Officers&rdquo;), the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures
as of December 31, 2019, pursuant to Rule&nbsp;13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our Certifying Officers
concluded that, as of December 31, 2019, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left">We do not expect that our disclosure controls
and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived
and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures
are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints,
and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and
procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control
deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain
assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its
stated goals under all potential future conditions.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>James Musselman</B>, a Director and our Chairman since inception,
founded Dallas-based&nbsp;Caelus Energy, LLC in 2011 and brings a track record of leading successful oil and gas ventures to the
company. In 2014, Caelus Energy and its subsidiaries acquired the Oooguruk development located on Alaska&rsquo;s North Slope. Oooguruk
has produced over 27 MMBO since it began production in 2008. Prior to establishing Caelus Energy, in 2003, Mr.&nbsp;Musselman was
one of five founding partners of Kosmos Energy Ltd (NYSE:KOS), and he was Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Kosmos until
2010. Under Mr.&nbsp;Musselman&rsquo;s leadership, Kosmos&rsquo; Mahogany-1&nbsp;exploration well discovered the Jubilee Field
offshore the Republic of Ghana in 2007. The Jubilee Field was regarded as an important oil discovery offshore of West Africa and
was one of the largest finds in the world in 2007. Kosmos and its company partners developed the Jubilee Field and delivered first
oil in late 2010. Before leading Kosmos Energy, Mr.&nbsp;Musselman was President and Chief Executive Officer of Triton Energy Limited
(NYSE:OIL), an independent international oil and gas exploration and production company. Mr.&nbsp;Musselman secured a $350&nbsp;million
private equity infusion for Triton that enabled the company to pursue oil and gas ventures offshore West Africa. The company made
several significant oil discoveries offshore Equatorial Guinea, including the Ceiba oil field, which was quickly developed. The
company also discovered and developed several major natural gas fields in the Malaysia/Thailand Joint Development Area in the Gulf
of Thailand. Triton was sold to Hess Corporation (NYSE:HES) in 2001 for $3.2&nbsp;billion. After the sale, Mr.&nbsp;Musselman served
as a Senior Advisor to Hess Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, John Hess. Previously, Mr.&nbsp;Musselman was Founder and Operator
of JM Petroleum Corp., a crude oil gathering and purchasing company with more than $1&nbsp;billion in annual sales. He later sold
the company to Wesray Capital Corporation. Following the sale of JM Petroleum Corporation, Mr.&nbsp;Musselman assembled an influential
investor coalition that secured the first Class 1 horserace license in the Dallas/Fort Worth area. After the license award, he
led the design, construction and initial operation of the Lone Star Park racetrack facility in Grand Prairie, Texas. Mr.&nbsp;Musselman
began his career practicing law at Strother, Davis, Musselman and Hill, with responsibility for oil and gas financing. He is a
graduate of Duke University and the University of Texas School of Law. Mr.&nbsp;Musselman is well qualified to serve as a Director
due to his extensive operational and investing experience in international energy markets.</P>

we pay our sponsor a total of $35,000 per month for office space, administrative and support services, of which Mr.&nbsp;Barcelo,

is unlikely the amount of such compensation will be known at the time such materials are distributed, because the directors of

0.125 of a share for each ordinary share in issue, and in November 2019, we declared a share dividend satisfied by way of issuance
of 0.111111 of a share for each ordinary share in issue, resulting in our sponsor holding an aggregate of 7,187,500 founder shares.

we will cease paying these monthly fees. Accordingly, in the event the consummation of our initial business combination takes

costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our
officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete an initial business combination,
we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that the initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of
the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be
used for such repayment. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the
option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the placement warrants issued to the initial holder. The terms of such
loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans.
We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties
will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.</P>

of distribution of such tender offer materials or at the time of a shareholder meeting held to consider our initial business combination,
as applicable, as it will be up to the directors of the post-combination&nbsp;business to determine executive and director compensation.</P>

performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud,

significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left">Alussa Energy Acquisition Corp. (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;)
is a newly organized blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company on June 13, 2019. The Company was incorporated
for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination
with one or more businesses (a &ldquo;Business Combination&rdquo;). The Company is an early stage and emerging growth company and,
as such, the Company is subject to all of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth companies.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left">Although the Company is not limited to
a particular industry or sector for purposes of consummating a Business Combination, the Company intends to focus on businesses
that complement its management team&rsquo;s expertise in the production, operation and development of crude oil and natural gas
wells and related infrastructure.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left">All activity for the period from June 13,
2019 (inception) through December 31, 2019 relates to the Company&rsquo;s formation, the initial public offering (the &ldquo;Initial
Public Offering&rdquo;), which is described below, and identifying a target company for a Business Combination. The Company will
not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of a Business Combination, at the earliest. The Company generates
non-operating income in the form of interest income from the proceeds derived from the Initial Public Offering.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left">The registration statements for the Company&rsquo;s
Initial Public Offering were declared effective on November 27, 2019. On November 29, 2019, the Company consummated the Initial
Public Offering of 25,000,000 units (the &ldquo;Units&rdquo;), generating gross proceeds of $250,000,000, which is described in
Note 3. Each Unit consists of one of the Company&rsquo;s Class A ordinary shares, par value $0.0001 per share (the &ldquo;Class
A Shares&rdquo;) and one-half of one warrant (the &ldquo;Warrants&rdquo;). Each whole Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one
Class A Share. The Class A Shares sold as part of the Units in the Initial Public Offering are referred to herein as the &ldquo;public
shares.&rdquo;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left">Simultaneously with the closing of the
Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the sale of 8,000,000 warrants (the &ldquo;Private Placement Warrants&rdquo;)
at a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant in a private placement to the Company&rsquo;s sponsor, Alussa Energy Sponsor
LLC (the &ldquo;Sponsor&rdquo;), generating gross proceeds of $8,000,000, which is described in Note 4.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left">Following the closing of the Initial Public
Offering on November 29, 2019, an amount of $250,000,000 ($10.00 per Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the
Initial Public Offering, and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants was placed in a trust account (the &ldquo;Trust Account&rdquo;)
and invested only in specified U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting
certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, which invest only in direct U.S. government
treasury obligations, until the earlier of (i) the consummation of the Business Combination and (ii) the Company&rsquo;s failure
to consummate a Business Combination within the prescribed time.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left">On December 4, 2019, the underwriters notified
the Company of their intention to fully exercise their over-allotment option on December 5, 2019. As such, on December 5, 2019
the Company consummated the sale of an additional 3,750,000 Units, at $10.00 per Unit, and the sale of an additional 750,000 Private
Placement Warrants, at $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating total gross proceeds of $38,250,000. A total of $37,500,000
of the net proceeds was deposited into the Trust Account, bringing the aggregate proceeds held in the Trust Account to $287,500,000.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left">Transaction costs amounted to $16,326,240,
consisting of $5,750,000 of underwriting fees, $10,062,500 of deferred underwriting fees and $513,740 of other costs. In addition,
at December 31, 2019, cash of $2,282,362 was held outside of the Trust Account and is available for the payment of offering expenses
and for working capital purposes.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left">The Company&rsquo;s management has broad
discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private
Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business
Combination. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully effect a Business Combination. Placing funds in
the Trust Account may not protect those funds from third party claims against the Company. Although the Company will seek to have
all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities it engages execute agreements with the Company
waiving any claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account, there is no guarantee that such persons will execute
such agreements. The Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to the Company under certain circumstances if and to the extent
any claims by such persons reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account below a specified threshold. The Company has not independently
verified whether the Sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believes that the Sponsor&rsquo;s only
assets are securities of the Company. Therefore, the Sponsor may not be able to satisfy those obligations should they arise. The
remaining net proceeds (not held in the Trust Account) may be used to pay for business, legal and accounting due diligence on prospective
acquisitions and continuing general and administrative expenses as well as any taxes.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left">The Company will provide the holders of
the public shares (the &ldquo;Public Shareholders&rdquo;) with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares
upon the completion of the Business Combination, either (i) in connection with a shareholder meeting called to approve the Business
Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer, in either case at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount
then on deposit in the Trust Account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the Business Combination, including interest
(which interest shall be net of taxes payable) divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if the Company seeks shareholder approval of the Business Combination and the Company does not conduct redemptions pursuant to
the tender offer rules, a Public Shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such
shareholder is acting in concert or as a &ldquo;group&rdquo; (as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the &ldquo;Exchange Act&rdquo;), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate
of 15% of the public shares. In connection with any shareholder vote required to approve any Business Combination, the Sponsor
and any other shareholder of the Company prior to the consummation of the Initial Public Offering (collectively with the Sponsor,
the &ldquo;Initial Shareholders&rdquo;) and the Company&rsquo;s directors and officers will agree (i) to vote any of their respective
Ordinary Shares (as defined below) in favor of the initial Business Combination and (ii) not to redeem any of their Ordinary Shares
in connection therewith.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left">The Company will proceed with a Business
Combination only if it has net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon consummation of the Business Combination and, in the
case of a shareholder vote, a majority of the outstanding Ordinary Shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination.
The amount in the Trust Account is initially anticipated to be $10.00 per public share. The per-share amount to be distributed
to shareholders who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions the Company will
pay to the underwriters. There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of a Business Combination with respect to the Company&rsquo;s
warrants.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left">The New York Stock Exchange (the &ldquo;NYSE&rdquo;)
rules require that the Business Combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market
value equal to at least 80% of the balance in the Trust Account (less any Deferred Commissions (as defined below) and taxes payable
on interest earned) at the time of the Company signing a definitive agreement in connection with the Business Combination.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left">If the Company has not completed a Business
Combination by November 29, 2021, the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly
as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable
in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (which interest shall be net of
taxes payable, and less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses) divided by the number of then outstanding public
shares, which redemption will completely extinguish the rights of the Public Shareholders as shareholders (including the right
to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible
following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company&rsquo;s remaining shareholders and its Board of Directors, dissolve
and liquidate, subject in each case to the Company&rsquo;s obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors
and the requirements of other applicable law. In the event of a liquidation, the Public Shareholders will be entitled to receive
a full pro rata interest in the Trust Account (initially anticipated to be approximately $10.00 per share, plus any pro rata interest
earned on the Trust Account not previously released to the Company and less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses).
There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to the Founder Shares (as defined in Note 6) or the
Private Placement Warrants, which will expire worthless if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the 24-month
time period.</P>

Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private
companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of
securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The
JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply
to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such
extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public
or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies
adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company&rsquo;s financial statement with another public company
which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition
period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.</P>

could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly
from those estimates.</P>

subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (&ldquo;ASC&rdquo;) Topic 480
&ldquo;Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity.&rdquo; Ordinary shares subject to mandatory redemption are classified as a liability
instrument and are measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable ordinary shares (including ordinary shares that feature redemption
rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely
within the Company&rsquo;s control) are classified as temporary equity. At all other times, ordinary shares are classified as shareholders&rsquo;
equity. The Company&rsquo;s ordinary shares feature certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of the Company&rsquo;s
control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, ordinary shares subject to possible redemption are presented
at redemption value as temporary equity, outside of the shareholders&rsquo; equity section of the Company&rsquo;s balance sheet.</P>

ASC 740, &ldquo;Income Taxes&rdquo; (&ldquo;ASC 740&rdquo;). ASC 740 requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities
for both the expected impact of differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities and for the
expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax loss and tax credit carry forwards. ASC 740 additionally requires a valuation
allowance to be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left">ASC 740 also clarifies the accounting for
uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise&rsquo;s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and
measurement process for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax
return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing
authorities. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense.
There were no unrecognized tax benefits and no amounts accrued for interest and penalties as of December 31, 2019. The Company
is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviation from
its position. The Company is subject to income tax examinations by major taxing authorities since inception.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left">Net loss per ordinary share is computed
by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the period. The Company applies the two-class
method in calculating earnings per share. Ordinary shares subject to possible redemption at December 31, 2019, which are not currently
redeemable and are not redeemable at fair value, have been excluded from the calculation of basic net loss per ordinary share since
such shares, if redeemed, only participate in their pro rata share of the Trust Account earnings. The Company has not considered
the effect of warrants sold in the Initial Public Offering and the private placement to purchase 23,125,000 ordinary shares in
the calculation of diluted loss per share, since the exercise of the warrants into ordinary shares is contingent upon the occurrence
of future events. As a result, diluted net loss per ordinary share is the same as basic net loss per ordinary share for the period
presented.</P>

the Company sold 28,750,000 Units, which includes the exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option in full of 3,750,000
Units, at a price of $10.00 per Unit. Each Unit consists of one Class A Share and one-half of one Warrant. Each whole Warrant entitles
the holder to purchase one Class A Share at a price of $11.50 per share. The Warrants will become exercisable on the later of 30
days after completion of the Business Combination or November 29, 2020 and will expire five years from the completion of the Business
Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. The Company may redeem the Warrants at a price of $0.01 per Warrant upon
30 days&rsquo; notice, only in the event that the last sale price of the Class A Shares is at least $18.00 per share (as adjusted
for share splits, share dividends, rights issuances, subdivisions, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20
trading days within a 30-trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which notice of redemption is
given. The Company will not redeem the Warrants unless a registration statement under the Securities Act covering the Class A Shares
issuable upon exercise of the Warrants is effective and a current prospectus relating to those shares is available throughout the
30 day redemption period, unless the Warrants may be exercised on a cashless basis and such cashless exercise is exempt from registration
under the Securities Act. If the Company redeems the Warrants as described above, management will have the option to require all
holders that wish to exercise their Warrants to do so on a cashless basis; provided that an exemption from registration is available.
No Warrants will be exercisable for cash unless the Company has an effective registration statement covering the Class A Shares
issuable upon exercise of the Warrants and a current prospectus relating to such shares. If the shares issuable upon exercise of
the Warrants are not registered under the Securities Act, holders will be permitted to exercise their Warrants on a cashless basis.
However, no Warrant will be exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, and the Company will not be obligated to issue any Class
A Shares to holders seeking to exercise their Warrants, unless the issuance of the Class A Shares upon such exercise is registered
or qualified under the securities laws of the state of the exercising holder, or an exemption is available.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left">The Company entered into an agreement,
commencing on November 25, 2019 through the earlier of the consummation of a Business Combination or the Company&rsquo;s liquidation,
to pay an aggregate of $35,000 per month to the Sponsor for office space, administrative and support services, of which Mr. Daniel
Barcelo, the Company&rsquo;s Chief Executive Officer and President, will be paid $20,000 per month and Mr. Nick De&rsquo;Ath, the
Company&rsquo;s Chief Technology Officer, will be paid $5,000 per month. The Company&rsquo;s Sponsor, officers and directors, or
any of their respective affiliates, will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on
their behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. There
is no cap or ceiling on the reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such persons in connection with activities on behalf
of the Company. For the period from June 13, 2019 (inception) through December 31, 2019, the Company incurred and paid $35,000
in fees for these services.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left">In addition, in order to finance transaction
costs in connection with an intended initial Business Combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor or certain of the
Company&rsquo;s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required. If the Company
completes its initial Business Combination, it would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that the initial Business Combination
does not close, the Company may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts
but no proceeds from the Trust Account would be used for such repayment. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into
warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the Private Placement
Warrants issued to the Sponsor.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: left">Simultaneously with the closing of the
Initial Public Offering, the Sponsor purchased an aggregate of 8,750,000 Private Placement Warrants at $1.00 per warrant, for an
aggregate purchase price of $8,750,000 from the Company. A portion of the proceeds from the sale of the Private Placement Warrants
were placed into the Trust Account. Each Private Placement Warrant is exercisable for one Class A Share at a price of $11.50 per
share. The Private Placement Warrants are identical to the Warrants included in the Units sold in the Initial Public Offering except
that the Private Placement Warrants: (i) will not be redeemable by the Company; (ii) may be exercised for cash or on a cashless
basis, as described in the registration statement relating to the Initial Public Offering, so long as they are held by the Sponsor
or any of its permitted transferees and (iii) are (including the ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the Private Placement
Warrants) entitled to registration rights. Additionally, the Sponsor has agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Private
Placement Warrants, including the Class A Shares issuable upon exercise of the Private Placement Warrants (except to certain permitted
transferees), until 30 days after the completion of the Business Combination.</P>

are members of the Sponsor (the &ldquo;Encompass Funds&rdquo;) entered into an agreement in accordance with the guidelines of Rule
10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, to place limit orders, through an independent broker-dealer registered under Section 15 of the Exchange
Act which is not affiliated with the Company nor part of the underwriting or selling group, to purchase an aggregate of up to 4,500,000
Warrants in the open market at market prices, and not to exceed $0.75 per Warrant during the period commencing on the later of
(i) the date separate trading of the Warrants commences or (ii) sixty calendar days after the end of the &ldquo;restricted period&rdquo;
under Regulation M, continuing until the date that is the earlier of (a) twelve (12) months from the date of the Initial Public
Offering and (b) the date that the Company announces that it has entered into a definitive agreement in connection with a Business
Combination, or earlier in certain circumstances as described in the limit order agreement the (&ldquo;Buyback Period&rdquo;).
The limit orders will require the Encompass Funds to purchase any Warrants offered for sale (and not purchased by another investor)
at or below a price of $0.75, until the earlier of (x) the expiration of the Buyback Period or (y) the date such purchases reach
4,500,000 Warrants in total. The Encompass Funds will not have any discretion or influence with respect to such purchases and will
not be able to sell or transfer any Warrants purchased in the open market pursuant to such agreements until following the consummation
of a Business Combination. It is intended that the purchases will satisfy the conditions of Rule 10b-18(b) under the Exchange Act
to the extent possible and the broker&rsquo;s purchase obligation will otherwise be subject to applicable law, including Regulation
M under the Exchange Act, which may prohibit or limit purchases pursuant to the limit order agreement in certain circumstances.
Such Warrants will be non-redeemable as long as they are held by the Encompass Funds.</P>
