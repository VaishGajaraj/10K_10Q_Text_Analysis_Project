</P>
<P>As used in this Form 10-K, references to the "Company", "we", "our", and "us" refer to Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. and its
subsidiaries.</P>


<B><P><A NAME="item1">Item 1. Business</A></P>
<I><P>General</P>
</I></B><P>We are a Maryland corporation formed in October 1994 that has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment
trust ("REIT") for federal income tax purposes. We are engaged principally in the ownership, operation, management, acquisition and
selective redevelopment and development of high quality, strategically located properties containing office/laboratory space designed
and improved for lease primarily to institutional (universities and not-for-profit institutions), pharmaceutical, biotechnology, life science
product, service, biodefense and translational research entities, as well as government agencies (collectively, the "life science
industry"). Our properties leased to tenants in the life science industry typically consist of buildings containing scientific research and
development laboratories and other improvements that are generic to tenants operating in the life science industry. We refer to such
properties as "life science properties". As of December 31, 2005, we owned 134 properties (131 properties located in nine states and
three properties located in Canada) with approximately 8.8 million rentable square feet of office/laboratory space. </P>
<I><B><P>Business and Growth Strategy</P>
</I></B><P>We focus our property operations and investment activities principally in the following life science markets: </P>

<UL>

 <LI>California (in the San Diego, Pasadena and San Francisco Bay areas);</LI>
 <LI>Seattle, Washington; </LI>
 <LI>Suburban Washington D.C. (including Maryland and Virginia);</LI>
 <LI>Eastern Massachusetts;</LI>
 <LI>New Jersey/Suburban Philadelphia;</LI>
 <LI>the Southeast (including North Carolina and Georgia); and </LI>
 <LI>Canada.</LI>


</UL>

<P>Our tenant base is broad and diverse within the life science industry and reflects our focus on regional, national and international
tenants with substantial financial and operational resources. For a more detailed description of our properties and tenants, see "Item 2.
Properties." We have an experienced Board of Directors and are led by a senior management team with extensive experience in both
the real estate and life science industries.</P>

<P>We seek to maximize growth in funds from operations ("FFO") and cash available for distribution to stockholders through the
ownership, operation, management, acquisition and selective redevelopment and development of life science properties, as well as
management of our balance sheet. See "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations-Funds from Operations" for a discussion of how we compute and view FFO, as well as a discussion of other measures of
cash flow. In particular, we seek to increase FFO and cash available for distribution by: </P>

<UL>



 <LI>acquiring high quality life science properties at prices that enable us to realize attractive
returns;</LI>
 <LI>redeveloping existing office, warehouse or vacant space or newly acquired properties into generic laboratory
space that can be leased at higher rental rates in our target life science markets;</LI>
 <LI>selectively developing properties; </LI>
 <LI>retenanting and re-leasing space at higher rental rates and with minimal non-revenue enhancing tenant
improvement costs;</LI>
 <LI>realizing contractual rental rate escalations, which are currently provided for in approximately 90% of our leases
(on a square footage basis);</LI>
 <LI>implementing effective cost control measures, including negotiating pass-through provisions in tenant leases for
operating expenses and certain capital expenditures; and</LI>
 <LI>managing the level of debt on our balance sheet and our exposure to floating rate
debt.</LI>


</UL>

<U>
<P>Internal Growth</U>. We seek to achieve internal growth from several sources. For example, we seek to: </P>



<UL>

 <LI>include rental rate escalation provisions in our leases;</LI>
 <LI>improve investment returns through leasing of vacant space and replacement of existing tenants with new
tenants at higher rental rates;</LI>
 <LI>achieve higher rental rates from existing tenants as existing leases expire;</LI>
 <LI>redevelop existing and/or newly acquired space to higher rent, generic laboratory space;
and</LI>
 <LI>implement effective cost control measures, including negotiating pass-through provisions in tenant leases for
operating expenses and certain capital expenditures.</LI>


</UL>

<P>Our ability to negotiate contractual rent escalations in future leases and to achieve increases in rental rates will depend upon
market conditions and the demand for life science properties at the time the leases are negotiated and the increases are proposed.</P>
<U><P>Acquisitions</U>. We seek to identify and acquire high quality life science properties in our target life science markets. Critical
evaluation of prospective property acquisitions is an essential component of our acquisition strategy. When evaluating acquisition
opportunities, we assess a full range of matters relating to the properties, including: </P>


<UL>

 <LI>location of the property and our strategy in the relevant market;</LI>
 <LI>quality of existing and prospective tenants;</LI>
 <LI>condition and capacity of the building infrastructure;</LI>
 <LI>quality and generic characteristics of laboratory facilities;</LI>
 <LI>physical condition of the structure and common area improvements;</LI>
 <LI>opportunities available for leasing vacant space and for retenanting occupied space; and</LI>
 <LI>opportunities to redevelop existing space into higher rent generic laboratory
space.</LI>


</UL>

<U>
<P>Redevelopment.</U> We seek to enhance our growth by redeveloping existing office, warehouse or vacant space as generic
laboratory space that can be leased at higher rates. As of December 31, 2005, we had 15 properties in our redevelopment program that
contained a total of approximately 1,009,000 square feet. Of this total, approximately 548,000 square feet are under redevelopment and
currently vacant, and the remaining 461,000 square feet are currently leased. In addition to properties under active redevelopment, as
of December 31, 2005, our asset base contained imbedded opportunities for a future permanent change of use to office/laboratory
space through redevelopment aggregating approximately 1.0 million square feet.</P>


<U><P>Development</U>. We seek to acquire strategic land parcels in key life science markets to enhance our growth through
ground-up development projects. Our development strategy is primarily to pursue selective projects where we expect to achieve
investment returns that will equal or exceed our returns on acquisitions. We generally have undertaken ground-up development projects
only if our investment in infrastructure will be substantially made for generic, rather than tenant specific, improvements. As of December
31, 2005, we had six parcels of land under development for approximately 510,000 rentable square feet of office/laboratory space. In
addition, as of December 31, 2005, our asset base contained
strategically located land with ground-up development opportunities for approximately 5.1 million developable square feet of
office/laboratory space.</P>
<U><P>Financing and Working Capital</U>. We believe that cash provided by operations, our unsecured line of credit and our
unsecured term loan will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements. We generally expect to finance future acquisitions and
redevelopment and development projects through our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan and, then, to refinance some or
all of that indebtedness periodically with additional equity or debt capital. We may also issue shares of our common stock, preferred
stock or interests in our subsidiaries to fund future operations. See "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Unsecured Line of Credit and Unsecured Term Loan".</P>
<P>We seek to maintain a balance between the amounts of our fixed and variable rate debt with a view to moderating our exposure to
interest rate risk. We also use financial instruments, such as interest rate swap agreements, to hedge a portion of our exposure to the
variable interest rates associated with our unsecured line of credit and our unsecured term loan. Interest rate swap agreements involve
an exchange of fixed and floating rate interest payments without the exchange of the underlying principal or "notional amount". Interest
received under our current interest rate swap agreements is based on the one-month London interbank offered rate, or LIBOR. See
"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital
Resources-Interest Rate Swaps" for a more complete discussion of our unsecured line of credit, unsecured term loan, interest rate swap
agreements and other outstanding indebtedness. </P>
<U><P>Preferred Securities</U>. We expect to continue to issue additional series of preferred stock that are senior to our common
stock. At December 31, 2005, we had preferred stock with a liquidation preference of approximately $187.1 million. The preferred stock
has general preference rights with respect to liquidation and quarterly distributions. In June 2004, we completed a public offering of
5,185,500 shares of our 8.375% Series C cumulative redeemable preferred stock with aggregate proceeds of approximately $124.0
million. In July 2004, we redeemed all 1,543,500 outstanding shares of our 9.50% Series A cumulative redeemable preferred stock at
an aggregate redemption price of approximately $38.6 million. Future redemptions or repurchases of our preferred securities may occur
after their respective call dates. See "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -
Liquidity and Capital Resources- Other Resources and Liquidity Requirements".</P>
<I><B><P>Business Risks</P>
</I><U><P>We Are Largely Dependent on the Life Science Industry for Revenues from Lease Payments</P>
</U></B><P>In general, our strategy is to invest primarily in properties used by tenants in the life science industry. Our
business could be adversely affected if the life science industry experiences an economic downturn. Because of our industry focus,
events within the life science industry may have a more pronounced effect on our ability to make distributions to our stockholders than if
we had more diversified investments. Also, some of our properties may be better suited for a particular life science industry tenant and
could require modification before we are able to re-lease vacant space to another life science industry tenant. Generally, our properties
may not be suitable for lease to traditional office tenants without significant expenditures on renovations. </P>
<P>Our ability to negotiate contractual rent escalations in future leases and to achieve increases in rental rates will depend upon
market conditions and the demand for life science properties at the time the leases are negotiated and the increases are proposed.</P>
<U><B>
<P>Our Tenants May Not Be Able to Pay Us if They Are Unsuccessful in Discovering, Developing, Making or Selling Their Products
and Technologies</P>
</U></B><P>Our life science industry tenants are subject to a number of risks, including the following, any one or more of
which may adversely affect their ability to make rental payments to us. </P>


<UL>
 <LI>Some of our tenants require significant funding to develop and commercialize their products and technologies,
which funding must be obtained from private investors, the public markets, companies in the life science industry or federal, state and
local governments. Such funding may become unavailable or difficult to obtain, which in turn may adversely affect a tenant's ability to
pay us rent.</LI>
 <LI>Even with sufficient funding, some of our tenants may not be able to discover or identify potential drug targets in
humans, or potential drugs for use in humans, or to create tools or technologies which are commercially useful in the discovery or
identification of potential drug targets or drugs.</LI>
 <LI>Some of our tenants developing potential drugs may find that their drugs are not effective, or may even be
harmful, when tested in humans.</LI>
 <LI>Some of our tenants may not be able to manufacture their drugs economically, even if such drugs are proven
through human clinical trials to be safe and effective in humans.</LI>
 <LI>Drugs that are developed and manufactured by some of our tenants require regulatory approval prior to being
made, marketed, sold and used. The regulatory approval process to manufacture and market drugs is costly, typically takes several
years, requires the expenditure of substantial resources and is often unpredictable. A tenant may fail or experience significant delays in
obtaining these approvals.</LI>
 <LI>Some of our tenants and their licensors require patent, copyright or trade secret protection to develop, make,
market and sell their products and technologies. A tenant may be unable to commercialize its products or technologies if patents
covering such products or technologies do not issue, or are successfully challenged, narrowed, invalidated or circumvented by third
parties, or if a tenant fails to obtain licenses to the discoveries of third parties necessary to commercialize its products or
technologies.</LI>
 <LI>A drug made by a tenant may not be well accepted by doctors and patients, or may be less effective or accepted
than competitor's drugs, or may be subsequently recalled from the market, even if it is successfully developed, proven safe and
effective in human clinical trials, manufactured and the requisite regulatory approvals are obtained.</LI>


</UL>

<P>We cannot assure you that our tenants will be able to develop, make, market or sell their products and technologies due to the risks
inherent in the life science industry. Any tenant that is unable to avoid, or sufficiently mitigate, the risks described above, may have
difficulty making rental payments to us. </P>
<U><B><P>We Could be Held Liable for Damages Resulting from Our Tenants' Use of Hazardous Materials</P>
</U></B><P>Many of our life science industry tenants engage in research and development activities that involve the
controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals and biological and radioactive compounds. In the event of contamination or injury
from the use of these hazardous materials, we could be held liable for damages that result. This liability could exceed our resources
and any recovery available through any applicable environmental remediation insurance coverage, and could adversely affect our
ability to make distributions to our stockholders. </P>
<P>Together with our tenants, we must comply with federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture,
storage, handling and disposal of hazardous materials and waste products. Failure to comply with, or changes in, these laws and
regulations could adversely affect our business or our tenants' business and their ability to make rental payments to us. </P>


<U><B><P>The Inability of A Tenant to Pay Us Rent Could Adversely Affect Our Business</P>
</U></B><P>Our revenues are derived primarily from rental payments and reimbursement of operating expenses under our
leases. If our tenants, especially significant tenants, fail to make rental payments under their leases, our financial condition, cash flow
and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders could be adversely affected. </P>
<P>As of December 31, 2005, we had 283 leases with a total of 237 tenants, and 73 of our 134 properties were single-tenant
properties. Our three largest tenants accounted for approximately 11.6% of our aggregate annualized base rent, or approximately 4.4%,
4.1% and 3.1%, respectively. "Annualized base rent" means the annualized fixed base rental amount in effect as of December 31,
2005, using rental revenues calculated on a straight-line basis in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting
principles ("GAAP"). Annualized base rent does not include reimbursements for real estate taxes and insurance, common area and
other operating expenses, substantially all of which are borne by the tenants in the case of triple net leases. </P>
<P>The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant may also adversely affect the income produced by a property. If any of our tenants
becomes a debtor in a case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, we cannot evict that tenant solely because of its bankruptcy. The
bankruptcy court may authorize the tenant to reject and terminate its lease with us. Our claim against such a tenant for unpaid future
rent would be subject to a statutory limitation that might be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed to us under the
tenant's lease. Any shortfall in rent payments could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to make distributions to our
stockholders. </P>
<U><B><P>Our U.S. Government Tenants May Not Receive Annual Budget Appropriations, Which Could Adversely Affect
Their Ability to Pay Us</P>
</U></B><P>U.S. government tenants may be subject to annual budget appropriations. If one of our U.S. government tenants
fails to receive its annual budget appropriation, it might not be able to make its lease payments to us. In addition, defaults under leases
with federal government tenants are governed by federal statute and not by state eviction or rent deficiency laws. All of our leases with
U.S. government tenants provide that the government tenant may terminate the lease under certain circumstances. As of December 31,
2005, leases with U.S. government tenants at our properties accounted for approximately 3.8% of our aggregate annualized base rent.
</P>
<U><B><P>Loss of a Tenant Could Have a Negative Impact on Our Business</P>
</U></B><P>A tenant may not renew its lease upon the expiration of the initial term. In addition, we may not be able to locate a
qualified replacement tenant upon expiration or termination of a lease. Consequently, we could lose the cash flow from the affected
property, which could negatively impact our business. We may have to divert cash flow generated by other properties to meet our
mortgage payments, if any, or to pay other expenses related to owning the affected property. As of December 31, 2005, leases at our
properties representing approximately 10.5% and 8.9% of the total square footage of our properties were scheduled to expire in 2006
and 2007, respectively. </P>
<U><B><P>Poor Economic Conditions in Our Markets Could Adversely Affect Our Business</P>
</U></B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our properties are located only in the following markets: </P>


<UL>
 <LI>California (in the San Diego, Pasadena and San Francisco Bay areas);</LI>
 <LI>Seattle, Washington;</LI>
 <LI>Suburban Washington D.C. (including Maryland and Virginia);</LI>
 <LI>Eastern Massachusetts;</LI>
 <LI>New Jersey/Suburban Philadelphia; </LI>
 <LI>the Southeast (including North Carolina and Georgia); and</LI>
 <LI>Canada.</LI>


</UL>

<P>As a result of our geographic concentration, we depend upon the local economic conditions in these markets, including local real
estate conditions. We are, therefore, subject to increased exposure (positive or negative) to economic and other competitive factors
specific to markets in confined geographic areas. Our operations may also be affected if too many competing properties are built in any
of these markets. An economic downturn in any of these markets could adversely affect our operations and our ability to make
distributions to stockholders. We cannot assure you that these markets will continue to grow or will remain favorable to the life science
industry. </P>
<U><B><P>We May Have Difficulty Managing Our Growth</P>
</U></B><P>We expect to continue to grow by acquiring, redeveloping and selectively developing additional properties. To
manage our growth effectively, we must successfully integrate new properties into our existing operations. We may not succeed with
the integration. In addition, we may not effectively manage new properties, and new properties may not perform as expected. Our
business could be adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in managing our growth. </P>
<U><B><P>Our Debt Service Obligations May Have Adverse Consequences on Our Business Operations</P>
</U></B><P>We use debt to finance our operations, including acquisitions of properties. Our use of debt may have adverse
consequences, including the following: </P>


<UL>
 <LI>Our cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to meet required payments of principal and
interest.</LI>
 <LI>We may be forced to dispose of one or more of our properties, possibly on disadvantageous terms, to make
payments on our debt.</LI>
 <LI>We may default on our debt obligations, and the lenders or mortgagees may foreclose on our properties that
secure those loans.</LI>
 <LI>A foreclosure on one of our properties could create taxable income without any accompanying cash proceeds to
pay the tax.</LI>
 <LI>A default under a mortgage loan that has cross default provisions may cause us to automatically default on
another loan.</LI>
 <LI>We may not be able to refinance or extend our existing debt.</LI>
 <LI>The terms of any refinancing or extension may not be as favorable as the terms of our existing
debt.</LI>
 <LI>We may be subject to a significant increase in the variable interest rates on our unsecured line of credit or
unsecured term loan, which could adversely impact our operations.</LI>

</UL>

<P>As of December 31, 2005, we had outstanding mortgage indebtedness of approximately $667 million, secured by 67 properties and
three land development parcels, and outstanding debt under our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan of $740 million. </P>
<U><B><P>Our Unsecured Line of Credit and Unsecured Term Loan Restrict Our Ability to Engage in Some Business
Activities</P>
</U></B><P>Our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan facilities contain customary negative covenants and other
financial and operating covenants that, among other things: </P>



<UL>
 <LI>restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness;</LI>
 <LI>restrict our ability to make certain investments;</LI>
 <LI>restrict our ability to merge with another company;</LI>
 <LI>restrict our ability to make distributions to stockholders;</LI>
 <LI>require us to maintain financial coverage ratios; and</LI>
 <LI>require us to maintain a pool of unencumbered assets approved by the lenders. </LI>


</UL>

<P>These restrictions could cause us to default on our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan or negatively affect our
operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. </P>
<U><B><P>We May Not Be Able to Obtain Additional Capital to Further Our Business Objectives</P>
</U></B><P>Our ability to acquire, redevelop or develop properties depends upon our ability to obtain capital. Periodically, the
real estate industry experiences reduced supplies of favorably-priced equity or debt capital, which decreases the level of new
investment activity by publicly-traded real estate companies. A prolonged period in which we cannot effectively access the public equity
or debt markets may result in heavier reliance on alternative financing sources to undertake new investments. An inability to obtain
equity or debt capital on acceptable terms could delay or prevent us from acquiring, structuring and completing desirable investments,
which could adversely affect our business. Also, the issuance of additional shares of capital stock or interests in subsidiaries to fund
future operations could dilute the ownership of then existing stockholders. </P>

<P>We have filed a "shelf" registration statement on Form S-3, under which we may offer from time to time and at our discretion,
common stock, preferred stock, warrants and debt securities in amounts, at prices and on terms to be determined at the time of
offering. As of December 31, 2005 we had approximately $305 million of available capacity for future issuances of securities under the
shelf registration statement. </P>
<U><B><P>If Interest Rates Rise, Our Debt Service Costs Will Increase</P>
</U></B><P>Borrowings outstanding under our unsecured line of credit, unsecured term loan and certain other borrowings
bear interest at a variable rate, and we may incur additional variable rate debt in the future. Increases in market interest rates would
increase our interest expense under these debt instruments and would increase the costs of refinancing existing indebtedness or
obtaining new debt. Accordingly, these increases could adversely affect our financial position and our ability to make distributions to
stockholders. </P>
<U><B><P>We May Not Be Able to Acquire Properties or Operate Them Successfully</P>
</U></B><P>Our success depends in large part upon our ability to acquire additional properties on satisfactory terms and to
operate them successfully. If we are unable to do so, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, the acquisition of life
science properties generally involves a higher per square foot price than the acquisition of traditional suburban office properties. </P>
<P>The acquisition, ownership and operation of real estate is subject to many risks that may adversely affect our business and our
ability to make payments to stockholders, including the risks that: </P>


<UL>
 <LI>Our properties may not perform as we expect.</LI>
 <LI>We may not be able to acquire a desired property because of competition from other real estate investors with
significant capital.</LI>
 <LI>We may lease space at rates below our expectations.</LI>
 <LI>We may not be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms.</LI>
 <LI>We may overpay for new acquisitions.</LI>
 <LI>We may underestimate the cost of improvements required to bring an acquired property up to standards
established for the market position intended for that property. </LI>


</UL>

<P>If we encounter any of these risks, our business and our ability to make payments to stockholders could be adversely
affected. </P>
<U><FONT SIZE=2><B><P>We May Not Be Able to Complete Redevelopment and Development Projects Effectively</P>
</U></B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our redevelopment and development activities subject us to many risks, including those
associated with: </P>


<UL>
 <LI>delays in construction;</LI>
 <LI>budget overruns;</LI>
 <LI>lack of availability and/or increasing costs of materials;</LI>
 <LI>financing availability;</LI>
 <LI>volatility in interest rates;</LI>
 <LI>labor availability;</LI>
 <LI>timing of the commencement of rental payments;</LI>
 <LI>delays or denials of entitlements or permits; and</LI>
 <LI>other property development uncertainties.</LI>


</UL>

<P>In addition, redevelopment and development activities, regardless of whether they are ultimately successful, typically require a
substantial portion of management's time and attention. This may distract management from focusing on other operational activities. If
we are unable to complete redevelopment and development projects successfully, our business may be adversely affected. </P>
<U><B>
<P>If Our Revenues Are Less Than Our Expenses, We May Have to Borrow Additional Funds and We May Not Be Able to Make
Distributions to Our Stockholders</P>
</U></B><P>If our properties do not generate revenues sufficient to meet our operating expenses, including debt service and
other capital expenditures, we may have to borrow additional amounts to cover fixed costs and cash flow needs. This could adversely
affect our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. Factors that could adversely affect the revenues from, and the values of, our
properties include: </P>


<UL>
 <LI>national and local economic conditions;</LI>
 <LI>competition from other life science properties;</LI>
 <LI>changes in the life science industry;</LI>
 <LI>real estate conditions in our target markets;</LI>
 <LI>our ability to collect rent payments;</LI>
 <LI>availability of financing;</LI>
 <LI>changes in interest rate levels;</LI>
 <LI>vacancies at our properties and our ability to re-lease space;</LI>
 <LI>changes in tax or other regulatory laws;</LI>
 <LI>costs of compliance with government regulation;</LI>
 <LI>lack of liquidity of real estate investments; and</LI>
 <LI>increases in operating costs. </LI>


</UL>

<P>In addition, if a lease at a property is not a triple net lease, we will have greater expenses associated with that property and greater
exposure to increases in such expenses. Significant expenditures, such as mortgage payments, real estate taxes, insurance and
maintenance costs, generally are fixed and do not decrease when revenues at the related property decrease. </P>
<U><B><P>Improvements to Life Science Properties Are Significantly More Costly Than Traditional Office Space</P>
</U></B><P>Our properties contain generic infrastructure improvements that are significantly more costly than other property
types. Although we have historically been able to recover the additional investment in generic infrastructure improvements through
higher rental rates, there is the risk that we will not be able to continue to do so in the future. Typical improvements include: </P>


<UL>
 <LI>reinforced concrete floors;</LI>
 <LI>upgraded roof loading capacity;</LI>
 <LI>increased floor to ceiling heights;</LI>
 <LI>heavy-duty HVAC systems;</LI>
 <LI>enhanced environmental control technology;</LI>
 <LI>significantly upgraded electrical, gas and plumbing infrastructure; and</LI>
 <LI>laboratory benches. </LI>


</UL>

<U><B><P>We May Not Be Able to Sell Our Properties Quickly to Raise Money</P>
</U></B><P>Investments in real estate are relatively illiquid. Accordingly, we may not be able to sell our properties when we
desire or at acceptable prices in response to changes in economic or other conditions. In addition, the Internal Revenue Code limits our
ability to sell properties held for fewer than four years. These limitations on our ability to sell our properties may adversely affect our
cash flows and our ability to make distributions to stockholders. </P>
<U><B><P>We Face Substantial Competition in Our Target Markets</P>
</U></B><P>The significant competition for business in our target markets could have an adverse effect on our operations. We
compete for investment opportunities with: </P>


<UL>
 <LI>insurance companies;</LI>
 <LI>pension and investment funds;</LI>
 <LI>partnerships;</LI>
 <LI>developers;</LI>
 <LI>investment companies;</LI>
 <LI>other REITs; and</LI>
 <LI>owner/occupants.</LI>


</UL>


<P>Many of these entities have substantially greater financial resources than we do and may be able to pay more than us or accept
more risk than we are willing to accept. These entities may be less sensitive to risks with respect to the creditworthiness of a tenant or
the geographic concentration of their investments. Competition may also reduce the number of suitable investment opportunities
available to us or may increase the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell. </P>
<U><B><P>Our Properties May Have Defects That Are Unknown to Us</P>
</U></B><P>Although we review the physical condition of our properties before they are acquired, and on a periodic basis
after acquisition, any of our properties may have characteristics or deficiencies unknown to us that could adversely affect the property's
value or revenue potential. </P>
<U><B><P>If We Fail to Qualify as a REIT, We Would Be Taxed at Corporate Rates and Would Not Be Able to Take Certain
Deductions When Computing Our Taxable Income</P>
</U></B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If, in any taxable year, we fail to qualify as a REIT: </P>


<UL>
 <LI>We would be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate
rates.</LI>
 <LI>We would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing taxable
income.</LI>
 <LI>Unless we were entitled to relief under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, we would also be
disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which we lost
qualification.</LI>
 <LI>We would no longer be required by the Internal Revenue Code to make any distributions to our stockholders.
</LI> </UL>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</UL>

<P>As a result of any additional tax liability, we might need to borrow funds or liquidate certain investments in order to pay the
applicable tax. Accordingly, funds available for investment or distribution to our stockholders would be reduced for each of the years
involved. </P>
<P>Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code to our
operations and financial results<B>,</B> and the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our
control. There are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations of these provisions. Although we believe that we have operated,
commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 1996, in a manner so as to qualify as a REIT, we cannot assure you that we
are or will remain so qualified. </P>
<P>In addition, although we are not aware of any pending tax legislation that would adversely affect our ability to operate as a REIT,
new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could change the tax laws or interpretations of the tax laws
regarding qualification as a REIT, or the federal income tax consequences of that qualification, in a manner that is adverse to our
stockholders.</P>
<U><B><P>There Are Limits on the Ownership of Our Capital Stock Under Which A Stockholder May Lose Beneficial
Ownership of Its Shares </P>
</U></B><P>The Internal Revenue Code provides that, in order for us to maintain our qualification as a REIT, not more than
50% of the value of our outstanding capital stock may be owned, directly or constructively, by five or fewer individuals or entities. </P>
<P>In addition, our charter prohibits, with certain limited exceptions, direct or constructive ownership of shares of our capital stock
representing more than 9.8% of the combined total value of the outstanding shares of our capital stock by any person (the "Ownership
Limit"). Our Board of Directors may exempt a stockholder from the Ownership Limit if, prior to the exemption, our Board of Directors
receives all information it deems necessary to determine or ensure our status as a REIT. </P>
<P>The constructive ownership rules are complex and may cause shares of our common stock owned directly or constructively by a
group of related individuals or entities to be constructively owned by one individual or entity. A transfer of shares to a person who, as a
result of the transfer, violates the Ownership Limit, may be void or may be deemed to be made to a trust, for the benefit of one or more
qualified charitable organizations designated by us. In that case, the intended transferee will have only a right to share, to the extent of
the transferee's original purchase price for such shares, in proceeds from the trust's sale of those shares. </P>
<U><B>
<P>In Addition to the Ownership Limit, Certain Provisions of Our Charter and Bylaws and Our Stockholder Rights Plan May Delay or
Prevent Transactions That May Be Deemed to Be Desirable to Our Stockholders</P>
</U></B><P>As authorized by Maryland law, our charter allows our Board of Directors to cause us to issue additional
authorized but unissued shares of our common stock or preferred stock and to classify or reclassify unissued shares of common or
preferred stock without any stockholder approval. Our Board of Directors could establish a series of preferred stock that could delay,
defer or prevent a transaction that might involve a premium price for our common stock or for other reasons be desired by our common
stockholders or that have a dividend preference which may adversely affect our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. </P>
<P>Our charter permits the removal of a director only upon a two-thirds vote of the votes entitled to be cast generally in the election of
directors and our bylaws require advance notice of a stockholder's intention to nominate directors or to present business for
consideration by stockholders at an annual meeting of our stockholders. Our charter and bylaws also contain other provisions that may
delay, defer or prevent a transaction or change in control that involves a premium price for our common stock or that for other reasons
may be desired by our stockholders. &#9;</P>
<P>Under our Stockholder Rights Plan, if a stockholder acquires beneficial ownership of 15% or more of our common stock, other
stockholders would become entitled to purchase our common stock at half the market price, which would likely result in substantial
dilution to the 15% or greater stockholder. This may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control or other
transaction that might involve a premium price for our common stock or for other reasons desired by our common stockholders.</P>
<U><B><P>Our Insurance May Not Adequately Cover All Potential Losses</P>
</U></B><P>If we experience a loss at any of our properties that is not covered by insurance or that exceeds our insurance
policy limits, we could lose the capital invested in the affected property and, possibly, future revenues from that property. In addition, we
could continue to be obligated on any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the affected properties. We carry
comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage and rental loss insurance with respect to our properties. We have obtained earthquake
insurance for all of our properties because many of them are located in the vicinity of active earthquake faults. We also carry
environmental remediation insurance and have title insurance policies on all of our properties. We obtain our title insurance policies
when we acquire the property, with each policy covering an amount equal to the initial purchase price of each property. Accordingly,
any of our title insurance policies may be in an amount less than the current value of the related property. </P>
<P>We believe that our insurance policy specifications, insured limits and deductibles are consistent with or superior to those
customarily carried for similar properties. Our tenants are also required to maintain comprehensive insurance, including liability and
casualty insurance, that is customarily obtained for similar properties. There are, however, certain types of losses that we and our
tenants do not generally insure against because they are uninsurable or because it is not economical to insure against them. In the
current market, there have recently been substantial increases in the premium cost of property and liability insurance. The availability of
coverage against certain types of losses, such as from terrorism or toxic mold, has become more limited and, when available, is at a
significantly higher premium cost. We cannot predict whether insurance coverage against terrorism or toxic mold will remain available
for our properties because insurance companies may no longer offer coverage against such losses or, if offered, such coverage may
become prohibitively expensive. Many, but not all, of our properties are low-rise buildings.</FONT><FONT SIZE=2 COLOR="#0000ff">

</FONT><U><FONT SIZE=2><B><P>We Could Incur Significant Costs Complying With Environmental Laws</P>
</U></B><P>Federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations may require us, as a current or prior owner or
operator of real estate, to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products released at or from any of our
properties. The cost of investigating and cleaning up contamination could be substantial and could exceed the amount of any
environmental remediation insurance coverage available to us. In addition, the presence of contamination, or the failure to properly
clean it up, may adversely affect our ability to lease or sell an affected property, or to borrow funds using that property as collateral.
</P>
<P>Under environmental laws and regulations, we may have to pay governmental entities or third parties for property damage and for
investigation and clean-up costs incurred by those parties relating to contaminated properties regardless of whether we knew of or
caused the contamination. Even if more than one party may have been responsible for the contamination, we may be held responsible
for all of the clean-up costs. In addition, third parties may sue us for damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination or
jointly responsible parties may contest their responsibility or be financially unable to pay their share of such costs.</P>
<P>Environmental laws also govern the presence, maintenance and removal of asbestos-containing materials. These laws may impose
fines and penalties on us for the release of asbestos-containing materials and may allow third parties to seek recovery from us for
personal injury from exposure to asbestos fibers. We have detected asbestos-containing materials at some of our properties, but we do
not expect that it will result in material environmental costs or liabilities to us. </P>
<P>Environmental laws and regulations also require the removal or upgrading of certain underground storage tanks and regulate: </P>


<UL>
 <LI>the discharge of storm water, wastewater and any water pollutants;</LI>
 <LI>the emission of air pollutants;</LI>
 <LI>the generation, management and disposal of hazardous or toxic chemicals, substances or wastes;
and</LI>
 <LI>workplace health and safety. </LI>


</UL>

<P>Many of our tenants routinely handle hazardous substances and wastes as part of their operations at our properties. Environmental
laws and regulations subject our tenants, and potentially us, to liability resulting from these activities. Environmental liabilities could also
affect a tenant's ability to make rental payments to us. We require our tenants to comply with these environmental laws and regulations
and to indemnify us for any related liabilities. </P>
<P>Independent environmental consultants have conducted Phase I or similar environmental assessments at all of our properties. We
intend to use consultants to conduct similar environmental assessments on our future acquisitions. This type of assessment generally
includes a site inspection, interviews and a public records review, but no subsurface sampling. These assessments and certain
additional investigations of our properties have not to date revealed any environmental liability that we believe would have a material
adverse effect on our business or results of operations. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The additional investigations have included, as appropriate: </P>


<UL>
 <LI>asbestos surveys;</LI>
 <LI>radon surveys;</LI>
 <LI>lead surveys;</LI>
 <LI>mold surveys;</LI>
 <LI>additional public records review;</LI>
 <LI>subsurface sampling; and</LI>
 <LI>other testing. </LI>


</UL>

<P>Nevertheless, it is possible that the assessments on our properties have not revealed, or that assessments on future acquisitions,
will not reveal all environmental liabilities. Consequently, there may be material environmental liabilities of which we are unaware that
may result in substantial costs to us or our tenants and that could have a material adverse effect on our business. </P>
<U><B><P>We May Incur Significant Costs Complying With the Americans With Disabilities Act and Similar Laws</P>
</U></B><P>Under the Americans With Disabilities Act, places of public accommodation and/or commercial facilities are
required to meet federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. We may be required to make substantial capital
expenditures at our properties to comply with this law. In addition, our noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines or an award
of damages to private litigants. </P>
<P>A number of additional federal, state and local laws and regulations exist regarding access by disabled persons. These regulations
may require modifications to our properties or may affect future renovations. This may limit the overall returns on our investments. </P>
<P>We believe that our properties are substantially in compliance with the present requirements of the Americans With Disabilities Act
and similar laws. </P>
<U><B>
<P>We May Incur Significant Costs If We Fail to Comply With Laws or If Laws Change</P>
</U></B><P>Our properties are subject to many federal, state and local regulatory requirements and to state and local fire and
life-safety requirements. If we do not comply with all of these requirements, we may have to pay fines to governmental authorities or
damage awards to private litigants. We believe that our properties are currently in compliance with all of these regulatory requirements.
We do not know whether these requirements will change or whether new requirements will be imposed. Changes in these regulatory
requirements could require us to make significant unanticipated expenditures. These expenditures could have an adverse effect on us
and our ability to make distributions to stockholders. </P>
<U><B><P>The Loss of Services of Any of Our Senior Executive Officers Could Adversely Affect Us</P>
</U></B><P>We depend upon the services of relatively few executive officers. The loss of services of any one of them may

policies could adversely affect our business and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. </P>
<U><B><P>We Could Become Highly Leveraged and Our Debt Service Obligations Could Increase</P>
</U></B><P>Our organizational documents do not limit the amount of debt that we may incur. Therefore, we could become
highly leveraged. This would result in an increase in our debt service obligations that could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability
to make distributions to our stockholders. </P>
<P>We have adopted a policy of incurring debt only if, upon such incurrence, our debt to total market capitalization ratio would not
exceed 60.0%. Our total market capitalization is the market value of our capital stock, including interests exchangeable for shares of
capital stock, plus total debt. Our Board of Directors could, however, change or eliminate this policy at any time. Higher leverage could
also increase the risk of default on our debt obligations. </P>
<U><B><P>Our Distributions to Stockholders May Decline at Any Time</P>
</U></B><P>We may not continue our current level of distributions to stockholders. Our Board of Directors will determine
future distributions based on a number of factors, including: </P>


<UL>
 <LI>our amount of cash available for distribution;</LI>
 <LI>our financial condition;</LI>
 <LI>any decision by our Board of Directors to reinvest funds rather than to distribute such
funds;</LI>
 <LI>our capital expenditures;</LI>
 <LI>the annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code;
and</LI>
 <LI>other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant. </LI>


</UL>

<U><B>
<P>Possible Future Sales of Shares of Our Common Stock Could Adversely Affect Its Market Price</P>
</U></B><P>We cannot predict the effect, if any, of future sales of shares of our common stock on the market price of our
common stock from time to time. Sales of substantial amounts of capital stock (including common stock issued upon the exercise of
stock options), or the perception that such sales may occur, could adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock. </P>
<P>We have reserved for issuance to our officers, directors and employees pursuant to our Amended and Restated 1997 Stock Award
and Incentive Plan that number of shares of our common stock that equals 12% of the total number of shares outstanding at any time,
provided that in no event may the number of shares of our common stock available for issuance under the plan exceed 3,000,000
shares at any time.</P>
<P>As of December 31, 2005, options to purchase 492,016 shares of our common stock were outstanding, all of which were
exercisable. We have filed a registration statement with respect to the issuance of shares of our common stock pursuant to grants
under our equity incentive plan. In addition, any shares issued under our equity incentive plan will be available for sale in the public
market from time to time without restriction by persons who are not our "affiliates" (as defined in Rule 144 adopted under the Securities
Act of 1933). Affiliates will be able to sell shares of our common stock pursuant to exemptions from registration requirements or upon
registration. </P>
<U><B><P>External Factors May Adversely Impact the Valuation of Investments</P>
</U></B><P>&#9;We hold equity investments in certain publicly-traded companies and privately held entities primarily involved in the life
science industry. The valuation of these investments is affected by many external factors beyond our control, including, but not limited
to, market prices, market conditions, prospects for favorable or unfavorable clinical trial results, new product initiatives and new
collaborative agreements. Unfavorable developments with respect to any of these factors may have an adverse impact on the valuation
of our investments.</P>
<U><P><B>We Are Subject to Risks from Potential Fluctuations in Exchange Rates Between the U.S. Dollar and Foreign Currencies</P>
</U><P></B>As of December 31, 2005, we had three properties located in Canada. We are pursuing, and intend to continue to pursue,
additional growth opportunities in Canada and other international markets. Investments in countries where the U.S. dollar is not the
national currency are subject to international currency risk from the potential fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and
the local currency. A significant decrease in the value of the Canadian dollar or other foreign currencies where we have a significant
investment could materially affect our results of operations. We may attempt to mitigate such effects by borrowing in the local foreign
currency in which we invest. Any international currency gain recognized with respect to changes in exchange rates may not qualify
under the 75% gross income test or the 95% gross income test that we must satisfy annually in order to qualify and maintain our status
as a REIT.</P>

<I><B><P>Available Information</P></B>

quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, including any amendments to the foregoing reports, as soon as is
reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission. These

<I><B><P>Employees</P>
</I></B><P>As of December 31, 2005, we had 93 full-time employees. We believe that we have good relations with our
employees. We have adopted a Business Integrity Policy that applies to all of our employees.<A NAME="item2"></A> Its receipt and

<B> <P><A NAME="item2">Item 2. Properties</A></P>
<I><P>General.</P>
</I></B><P>As of December 31, 2005, we owned 134 properties comprising of approximately 8.8 million rentable square feet
of office/laboratory space. Excluding properties under redevelopment, our properties were approximately 93.2% leased as of December
31, 2005. Our properties, some of which consist of multiple buildings, range in size up to 284,000 square feet, are built to accommodate
single or multiple tenants and are generally one or two story concrete tilt-up, block and/or steel frame structures. The exteriors typically
resemble traditional suburban office properties, but the interior infrastructures are designed to accommodate the needs of life science
industry tenants. These improvements typically are generic to life science industry tenants rather than being specific to a particular
tenant. As a result, we believe that the improvements have long-term value and utility and are usable by a wide range of life science
industry tenants. Generic infrastructure improvements to our life science properties typically include: </P>


<UL>
 <LI>reinforced concrete floors;</LI>
 <LI>upgraded roof loading capacity;</LI>
 <LI>increased floor to ceiling heights;</LI>
 <LI>heavy-duty HVAC systems;</LI>
 <LI>enhanced environmental control technology;</LI>
 <LI>significantly upgraded electrical, gas and plumbing infrastructure; and</LI>
 <LI>laboratory benches. </LI>


</UL>


<P>We own a fee simple interest in each of our properties, except for the following twelve properties that account for approximately
10% of the total rentable square footage of our properties: </P>


<UL>
 <LI>three properties in the San Francisco Bay area (Harbor Bay Parkway #2, Harbor Bay Parkway #3 and Harbor
Bay Parkway #4), in which we own a commercial condominium interest, together with an undivided interest in the common areas of the
project of which the property is a part; </LI>
 <LI>the properties at Garcia Avenue &amp; Bayshore Parkway, Hanover Street, Alexander Road, Charlestown Navy
Yard, Virginia Manor Road, Porter Drive, and Medical Center Drive #1, in which we own ground leasehold interests;
and,</LI>
 <LI>two properties located in the San Francisco Bay and Eastern Massachusetts markets, in which we have a
controlling interest through a partially owned limited partnership and a limited liability company, respectively. The non-controlling
interest held by certain third parties is reflected as minority interest in our consolidated financial statements. See further discussion in
our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in "Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement
Schedule".</LI>


</UL>

<P>As of December 31, 2005, we had 283 leases with a total of 237 tenants, and 73 of our 134 properties were single-tenant
properties. Leases in our multi-tenant buildings typically have terms of three to seven years, while the single-tenant building leases
typically have initial terms of 10 to 20 years. As of December 31, 2005: </P>



<UL>
 <LI>approximately 85% of our leases (on a square footage basis) were triple net leases, requiring tenants to pay
substantially all real estate taxes and insurance, common area and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to
base rent, and, in addition to our triple net leases, approximately 6% of our leases (on a square footage basis) required the tenants to
pay a majority of operating expenses;</LI>
 <LI>approximately 90% of our leases (on a square footage basis) contained effective annual rent escalations that are
either fixed (generally ranging from 3% to 3.5%) or indexed based on a consumer price index or other index;
and</LI>
 <LI>approximately 89% of our leases (on a square footage basis) provided for the recapture of certain capital
expenditures (such as HVAC systems maintenance and/or replacement, roof replacement and parking lot resurfacing), which we
believe would typically be borne by the landlord in traditional office leases. </LI>


</UL>


<P>Our leases also typically give us the right to review and approve tenant alterations to the property. Generally, tenant-installed
improvements to the properties remain our property after termination of the lease at our election. However, we are permitted under the
terms of most of our leases to require that the tenant, at its expense, remove the improvements and restore the premises to their
original condition. </P>

<P>Future distributions on our common stock will be determined by and at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will be
dependent upon a number of factors, including actual cash available for distribution, our financial condition and capital requirements,
the annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and such other factors as our Board of
Directors deems relevant. To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must make annual distributions to stockholders of at least 90% of
our taxable income for the current taxable year, determined without regard to deductions for dividends paid and excluding any net
capital gains. Under certain circumstances, we may be required to make distributions in excess of cash flow available for distributions to
meet these distribution requirements. In such a case, we may borrow funds or may raise funds through the issuance of additional debt
or equity capital. We cannot assure you that we will make any future distributions. </P>
<P>The tax treatment of distributions on common stock paid in 2005 is as follows: (1) 71.8% ordinary dividend, (2) 24.1% return of
capital, (3) 3.9% capital gain at 15%, and (4) 0.2% Section 1250 capital gain at 25%. The tax treatment of distributions paid in 2004 is
as follows: (1) 76.8% ordinary dividend, (2) 19.8% return of capital, (3) 2.4% capital gain at 15%, and (4) 1.0% Section 1250 capital
gain at 25%.</P>

<P>(1) During the second quarter of 2004, we elected to redeem the 9.50% Series A
cumulative redeemable preferred stock ("Series A preferred stock"). Accordingly, in compliance with Emerging Issues Task Force Topic
D-42, we recorded a charge of $1,876,000, or $0.10 per common share (diluted) in the second quarter of 2004 for costs related to the
redemption of the Series A preferred stock.</P>
<P>(2) Includes depreciation and amortization on assets "held for sale" reflected as discontinued operations (for the
periods prior to when such assets were designated as "held for sale"). </P>
<P>(3) Gain/loss on sales of property relates to the disposition of a property in the Southeast market during the third
quarter of 2005, the disposition of a property in the Suburban Washington D.C. market during the first quarter of 2004, the disposition of
a property in the Suburban Washington D.C. market during the fourth quarter of 2003, the disposition of a property in the Eastern
Massachusetts market during the third quarter of 2003, and the disposition of a property in the San Francisco Bay market during the
first quarter of 2003. Gain/loss on sales of property is included in the income statement in income from discontinued operations,
net.</P>
<P>(4) GAAP basis accounting for real estate assets utilizes historical cost accounting and assumes real estate values
diminish over time. In an effort to overcome the difference between real estate values and historical cost accounting for real estate
assets, the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") established the measurement
tool of Funds From Operations ("FFO"). Since its introduction, FFO has become a widely used non-GAAP financial measure by REITs.
We believe that FFO is helpful to investors as an additional measure of the performance of an equity REIT. We compute FFO in
accordance with standards established by the Board of Governors of NAREIT in its April 2002 White Paper (the "White Paper") and
related implementation guidance, which may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO utilized by other equity REITs, and,
accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs. The White Paper defines FFO as net income (loss) (computed in accordance
with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for
unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. While FFO is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance for REITs,
it should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of financial
performance, or to cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it
indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions. For a more detailed discussion of FFO,
see "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Funds From
Operations".</P>

space. As of that date, our properties were approximately 93% leased, excluding those properties in our redevelopment program.</P>
<P>Our primary sources of revenue are rental income and tenant recoveries from leases of our properties. The comparability of
financial data from period to period is affected by the timing of our property acquisition, development and redevelopment activities. Of
the 134 properties as of December 31, 2005, four were acquired in 1994, nine in 1996, nine in 1997, 27 in 1998, six in 1999, 11 in
2000, five in 2001, four in 2002, four in 2003, 22 in 2004 and 19 in 2005. In addition, we completed the development of one property in
1999, five properties in 2000 (together with the 11 properties acquired in 2000), two properties in 2001 (together with the five properties
acquired in 2001), two properties in 2002 (together with the four properties acquired in 2002), one property in 2004 (together with the 22
properties acquired in 2004, the "2004 Properties") and three properties in 2005 (together with the 19 properties acquired in 2005, the
"2005 Properties"). As a result of these acquisition and development activities, as well as our ongoing leasing and redevelopment
activities, there have been significant increases in total revenues and expenses, including significant increases in total revenues and
expenses for 2005 as compared to 2004, and for 2004 as compared to 2003. </P>
<P>As of December 31, 2005, approximately 85% of our leases (on a square footage basis) were triple net leases, requiring tenants to
pay substantially all real estate taxes and insurance, common area and other operating expenses, including increases thereto. In
addition, as of December 31, 2005, approximately 6% of our leases (on a square footage basis) required the tenants to pay a majority
of operating expenses. Additionally, as of December 31, 2005, approximately 89% of our leases (on a square footage basis) provided
for the recapture of certain capital expenditures and approximately 90% of our leases (on a square footage basis) contained effective
annual rent escalations that are either fixed or indexed based on the consumer price index or another index. </P>
<B><P>Critical Accounting Policies</P>
<P>&#9;</B>Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial
statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Our
significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in "Item 15. Exhibits, Financial
Statement Schedule". The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates, judgments
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We base these estimates, judgments
and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.</P>
<I>
<P>REIT Compliance</P>
</I><P>We have elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") under the Internal Revenue Code. Qualification as a
REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code to our operations and financial
results, and the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. We believe that our current
organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code to enable us
to qualify, and continue to qualify, as a REIT. However, it is possible that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that
would not allow us to qualify as a REIT, or that our future operations could cause us to fail to qualify.</P>
<P>If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, then we will be required to pay federal income tax (including any applicable
alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. If we lose our REIT status, then our net earnings available
for investment or distribution to stockholders would be significantly reduced for each of the years involved and we would no longer be
required to make distributions to our stockholders. </P>
<I><P>Rental Properties, Properties Under Development and Land Held For Development</P>
</I><P>In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, "Business Combinations", we perform the following
procedures when making an allocation of the purchase price of real estate: (1) estimate the value of the real estate as of the acquisition
date on an "as if vacant" basis; (2) allocate the "as if vacant" value among land, land improvements, buildings, building improvements,
tenant improvements and equipment; (3) calculate the value of the intangibles as the difference between the "as if vacant" value and
the purchase price; and (4) allocate the intangible value to above, below and at market leases, origination costs associated with
in-place leases, tenant relationships and other intangible assets.</P>
<P>The values allocated to land improvements, buildings, building improvements, tenant improvements and equipment are depreciated
on a straight-line basis using an estimated life of 20 years for land improvements, 40 years for buildings and building improvements, the
respective lease term for tenant improvements and the estimated useful life for equipment. The values of above and below market
leases are amortized over the life of the related lease and recorded as either an increase (for below market leases) or a decrease (for
above market leases) to rental income. The values of at-market leases and origination costs are classified as leasing costs, included in
other assets on our balance sheets and amortized over the remaining life of the lease. </P>
<P>Rental properties, properties under development and land held for development are individually evaluated for impairment when
conditions exist which may indicate that it is probable that the sum of expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying
amount of the property. Upon determination that an impairment has occurred, a write-down is recorded to reduce the carrying amount
of the property to its estimated fair value. </P>
<I><P>Capitalization of Costs</P>
<P>&#9;</I>In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 34, "Capitalization of Interest Cost" ("SFAS 34") and
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 67, "Accounting for Costs and Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects"
("SFAS 67"), we capitalize direct construction, including predevelopment costs, interest, property taxes, insurance and other costs
directly related and essential to the acquisition, development, redevelopment or construction of a project. Pursuant to SFAS 34 and
SFAS 67, capitalization of construction, development and redevelopment costs is required while activities are ongoing to prepare an
asset for its intended use. Costs incurred after a project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use are expensed as
incurred. Costs previously capitalized related to abandoned acquisition or development opportunities are written off. Should
development, redevelopment or construction activity cease, a portion of interest, property taxes, insurance and certain costs would no
longer be eligible for capitalization, and would be expensed as incurred. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as
incurred.</P>


<P>&#9;We also capitalize costs directly related and essential to our leasing activities. These costs are amortized on a straight-line
basis over the terms of the related leases. Costs that were previously capitalized and which related to unsuccessful leasing
opportunities are written off. </P>
<I><P>Accounting for Investments </P>
</I><P>&#9;We hold equity investments in certain publicly-traded companies and privately held entities primarily involved in the life
science industry. All of our investments in publicly-traded companies are considered "available for sale" in accordance with Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities" ("SFAS 115"), and are
recorded at fair value. Fair value has been determined as the closing trading price at the balance sheet date, with unrealized gains and
losses shown as a separate component of stockholders' equity. The classification of investments under SFAS 115 is determined at the
time each investment is made, and such determination is reevaluated at each balance sheet date. The cost of investments sold is
determined by the specific identification method, with net realized gains included in other income.</P>
<P>Investments in privately held entities are generally accounted for under the cost method because we do not influence any operating
or financial policies of the entities in which we invest. Certain investments are accounted for under the equity method in accordance
with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18, "The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock" and Emerging
Issues Task Force Topic D-46, "Accounting for Limited Partnership Investments". Under the equity method of accounting, we record our
investment initially at cost and adjust the carrying amount of the investment to recognize our share of the earnings or losses of the
investee subsequent to the date of our investment. </P>
<P>For all of our investments, if a decline in the fair value of an investment below its carrying value is determined to be other than
temporary, such investment is written down to its estimated fair value with a non-cash charge to current earnings. The factors that we
consider in making these assessments include, but are not limited to, market prices, market conditions, financial condition, prospects
for favorable or unfavorable clinical trial results, new product initiatives and/or sales, and new collaborative agreements.</P>
<I><P>Interest Rate Swap Agreements</P>
<P>&#9;</I>We utilize interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of our exposure to variable interest rates associated with our
unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan. These agreements involve an exchange of fixed and floating rate interest payments
without the exchange of the underlying principal amount (the "notional amount"). Interest received under all of our swap agreements is
based on the one-month LIBOR rate. The net difference between the interest paid and the interest received is reflected as an
adjustment to interest expense. </P>
<P>&#9;We reflect our interest rate swap agreements on the balance sheet at their estimated fair values with an offsetting adjustment
reflected as unrealized gains/losses in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders' equity. We use a variety of methods
and assumptions based on market conditions and risks existing at each balance sheet date to determine the fair values of our interest
rate swap agreements. These methods of assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value, and such value may never be
realized.</P>

<P>All of our interest rate swap agreements meet the criteria to be deemed "highly effective" under the provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS 133") in reducing our
exposure to variable interest rates. In accordance with SFAS 133, we formally document all relationships between interest rate swap
agreements and hedged items, including the method for evaluating effectiveness and the risk strategy. Accordingly, we have
categorized these instruments as cash flow hedges. We make an assessment at the inception of each interest rate swap agreement
and on an on-going basis to determine whether these instruments are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows associated
with the hedged items. While we intend to continue to meet the conditions for such hedge accounting, if hedges did not qualify as
"highly effective", the changes in the fair values of the derivatives used as hedges would be reflected in earnings.</P>
<P>&#9;We do not believe we are exposed to a significant amount of credit risk in our interest rate swap agreements as our
counterparties are established, well-capitalized financial institutions.</P>
<I><P>Recognition of Rental Income and Tenant Recoveries</P>
</I><P>Rental income from leases with scheduled rent increases, free rent, incentives and other rent adjustments is recognized on a
straight-line basis over the respective lease terms. We include amounts currently recognized as income, and expected to be received in
later years, in deferred rent in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Amounts received currently, but recognized as income
in future years, are included as unearned rent in accounts payable, accrued expenses and tenant security deposits in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets. We commence recognition of rental income at the date the tenant takes possession of or
controls the physical use of the property. </P>
<P>Tenant recoveries related to reimbursement of real estate taxes, insurance, repairs and maintenance, and other operating
expenses are recognized as revenue in the period the applicable expenses are incurred. </P>
<P>We maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our tenants to make payments required under
the terms of the lease. If a tenant fails to make contractual payments beyond any allowance, we may recognize additional bad debt
expense in future periods equal to the amount of unpaid rent and unrealized deferred rent. </P>
<I><P>Discontinued Operations</P>
<P>&#9;</I>We follow the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets" in determining whether a property qualifies as an asset "held for sale" and should be classified as
"discontinued operations". A property is classified as "held for sale" when all of the following criteria for a plan of sale have been met:
(1) management, having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the property; (2) the property is available for
immediate sale in its present condition, subject only to the terms that are usual and customary; (3) an active program to locate a buyer,
and other actions required to complete the plan to sell, have been initiated; (4) the sale of the property is probable and is expected to be
completed within one year; (5) the property is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair
value; and (6) actions necessary to complete the plan of sale indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made
or that the plan will be withdrawn. When all of these criteria have been met, the property is classified as "held for sale" and its
operations are classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of income. When a property is designated as "held
for sale", amounts for all prior periods presented are reclassified from continuing operations to discontinued operations. A loss is
recognized for any initial adjustment of the asset's carrying amount to fair value less costs to sell in the period the asset qualifies as
"held for sale". Depreciation of assets is discontinued commencing on the date they are designated as "held for sale". </P>

<B><P>Results of Operations</P>
<I><P>Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2005 to the Year Ended December 31, 2004</P>
</I></B><P>Rental revenues increased by $45.6 million, or 32%, to $189.3 million for 2005 compared to $143.7 million for
2004. The increase resulted primarily from the 2004 Properties being owned for a full year and the addition of the 2005 Properties. </P>
<P>Tenant recoveries increased by $14.1 million, or 39%, to $50.0 million for 2005 compared to $35.8 million for 2004. The increase
resulted primarily from the 2004 Properties being owned for a full year and the addition of the 2005 Properties. </P>
<P>Other income increased by $1.3 million, or 35%, to $4.8 million for 2005 compared to $3.5 million for 2004, primarily due to an
increase in miscellaneous sources of income.</P>
<P>Rental operating expenses increased by $16.1 million, or 42%, to $54.5 million for 2005 compared to $38.4 million for 2004. The
increase resulted primarily from increases in rental operating expenses (primarily property taxes and utilities) from properties acquired,
placed in service or redeveloped in 2005. The majority of the increase in rental operating expenses is recoverable from our tenants
through tenant recoveries. </P>
<P>General and administrative expenses increased by $6.0 million, or 40%, to $21.1 million for 2005 compared to $15.1 million for
2004, primarily due to the growth in both the depth and breadth of our operations in multiple markets, including internationally, from 113
properties with approximately 7.4 million rentable square feet as of December 31, 2004 to 134 properties with approximately 8.8 million
rentable square feet as of December 31, 2005 and the costs associated with continued compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act. As a percentage of total revenues, general and administrative expenses for 2005 remained relatively consistent with
2004.</P>
<P>Interest expense increased by $20.4 million, or 71%, to $49.1 million for 2005 compared to $28.7 million for 2004. The increase
resulted primarily from increases in indebtedness on our unsecured line of credit, unsecured term loan and secured notes payable, and
increases in the floating interest rates on our unsecured line of credit, unsecured term loan and other floating rate debt. These
borrowings were utilized to finance the acquisition of the 2004 and 2005 Properties, and the development and redevelopment of
properties. The weighted average effective interest rate on our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan (not including the
effect of interest rate swap agreements) increased from 3.72% as of December 31, 2004 to 5.68% as of December 31, 2005. We have
entered into certain swap agreements to hedge a portion of our exposure to variable interest rates with our unsecured line of credit and
unsecured term loan (see "Liquidity and Capital Resources - Interest Rate Swaps").</P>
<P>Depreciation and amortization increased by $12.9 million, or 30%, to $55.4 million for 2005 compared to $42.5 million for 2004. The
increase resulted primarily from depreciation associated with the 2004 Properties being owned for a full year and the addition of the
2005 Properties. </P>
<P>Income from discontinued operations of $132,000 for 2005 reflects the results of operations of one property that was designated as
"held for sale" as of June 30, 2005. In connection with the sale of this property in the third quarter of 2005, we recorded a gain of
approximately $36,000. Income from discontinued operations of $1.8 million for 2004 primarily reflects the results of operations of one
property that was designated as "held for sale" as of December 31, 2003. In connection with the sale of this property in the first quarter
of 2004, we recorded a gain of approximately $1.6 million.</P>

<P>Other income increased by $1.5 million, or 71%, to $3.5 million for 2004 compared to $2.1 million for 2003, primarily due to an
increase in net realized gains on investments and from an increase in miscellaneous sources of income.</P>
<P>Rental operating expenses increased by $5.6 million, or 17%, to $38.4 million for 2004 compared to $32.8 million for 2003. The
increase resulted primarily from the 2003 Properties being owned for a full year and the addition of the 2004 Properties.</P>
<P>General and administrative expenses increased by $894,000, or 6%, to $15.1 million for 2004 compared to $14.2 million for 2003,
mainly due to compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Operation Outreach and general increases in administrative
costs. Our Operation Outreach program provides financial assistance to families of activated and deployed soldiers that face
considerable financial challenges and have significant financial needs. As a percentage of total revenues, general and administrative
expenses for 2004 remained relatively consistent with 2003.</P>
<P>Interest expense increased by $2.3 million, or 9%, to $28.7 million for 2004 compared to $26.4 million for 2003. The increase
resulted primarily from increases in indebtedness on our unsecured line of credit, unsecured term loan and secured notes payable, and
to increases in the floating interest rates on our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan. These borrowings were utilized to
finance the acquisition of the 2003 and 2004 Properties, and the development and redevelopment of properties. The weighted average
effective interest rate on these borrowings (not including the effect of interest rate swap agreements) increased from 2.64% as of
December 31, 2003 to 3.72% as of December 31, 2004. We have entered into certain swap agreements to hedge a portion of our
exposure to variable interest rates with our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan (see "Liquidity and Capital Resources -
Interest Rate Swaps").</P>
<P>Depreciation and amortization increased by $3.9 million, or 10%, to $42.5 million for 2004 compared to $38.6 million for 2003. The
increase resulted primarily from depreciation associated with the 2003 Properties being owned for a full year and the addition of the
2004 Properties. </P>
<P>Income from discontinued operations of $1.8 million for 2004 primarily reflects the results of operations of one property that was
designated as "held for sale" as of December 31, 2003. In connection with this sale, we recorded a gain of approximately $1.6 million
during 2004. Income from discontinued operations of $11.3 million for 2003 primarily reflects the results of operations of three
properties that were designated as "held for sale" as of December 31, 2002. In connection with the sale of these properties, we
recorded a net gain of approximately $8.3 million during 2003.</P>

<I><P>Cash Flows</P>
</I><P>Net cash provided by operating activities for 2005 increased by $55.4 million to $120.7 million compared to $65.3
million for 2004. The increase resulted primarily from increases in cash flows from our operating properties, and increases in accounts
payable, accrued expenses and tenant security deposits.</P>
<P>Net cash used in investing activities for 2005 decreased by $15.4 million to $432.9 million compared to $448.3 million for 2004. This
decrease was primarily due to decreases in additions to properties under development and land held for development, and property
acquisitions, partially offset by an increase in additions to rental properties.</P>
<P>Net cash provided by financing activities for 2005 decreased by $68.1 million to $313.0 million compared to $381.1 million for 2004.
This decrease was primarily due to decreases in the proceeds from secured notes payable and from issuances of preferred stock, an
increase in the principal reductions of secured notes payable, and increases in dividends paid on common stock and preferred stock.
This was partially offset by the net proceeds from issuances of common stock, a decrease in repayments of our unsecured line of credit
and unsecured term loan and the decrease in redemption of preferred stock. </P>

<P>(1) The weighted average interest rate is calculated based on the outstanding debt as of January 1<SUP>st</SUP> of each year.</P>


<I><P>Unsecured Line of Credit and Unsecured Term Loan</P>
</I><P>In November 2005, we entered into an amendment to our amended and restated credit agreement to increase the
maximum permitted borrowings under our unsecured credit facilities from $750 million to $1 billion consisting of a $500 million
unsecured revolving credit facility and a $500 million unsecured term loan. We may in the future elect to increase commitments under
the unsecured credit facilities by up to an additional $200 million.</P>
<P>Borrowings under our unsecured line of credit, as amended, bear interest at a floating rate based on our election of either a LIBOR-
based rate or the higher of the bank's reference rate and the Federal Funds rate, plus 0.5%. For each LIBOR-based advance, we must
elect a LIBOR period of one, two, three or six months. The unsecured line of credit matures in December 2007 and may be extended at
our sole option for an additional one-year period. As of December 31, 2005, we had borrowings of $240 million outstanding on the
unsecured line of credit with a weighted average interest rate of 5.69%. </P>
<P>Our unsecured term loan bears interest at a floating rate based on our election of either a LIBOR-based rate or the higher of the
bank's reference rate and the Federal Funds rate, plus 0.5%. For each LIBOR-based advance, we must elect to fix for a period of one,
two, three or six months. The unsecured term loan matures in December 2009. As of December 31, 2005, we had borrowings of $500
million outstanding on the unsecured term loan with a weighted average interest rate of 5.67%.</P>
<P>Our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan contain financial covenants, including, among other things, maintenance of
minimum net worth, a leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio. In addition, the terms of the unsecured line of credit and
unsecured term loan restrict, among other things, certain investments, indebtedness, distributions and mergers.</P>
<P>Aggregate borrowings under the unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan may be limited to an amount based on the net
operating income derived from a pool of unencumbered properties. Accordingly, as we acquire or complete the development or
redevelopment of additional unencumbered properties, aggregate borrowings available under the unsecured line of credit and
unsecured term loan will increase up to a maximum combined amount of $1 billion. Under these provisions as of December 31, 2005,
aggregate borrowings under our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan were limited to $863 million. </P>
<I>
<P>Interest Rate Swaps</P>
</I><P>We utilize interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of our exposure to variable interest rates associated
with our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan. These agreements involve an exchange of fixed and floating rate interest
payments without the exchange of the underlying principal amount (the "notional amount"). Interest received under all of our swap
agreements is based on the one-month LIBOR rate. The net difference between the interest paid and the interest received is reflected
as an adjustment to interest expense.</P>

<P>We do not believe we are exposed to a significant amount of credit risk in our interest rate swap agreements as our counterparties
are established, well-capitalized financial institutions. In addition, we have entered into master derivative agreements with each
counterparty. These master derivative agreements (all of which are on the standard International Swaps &amp; Derivatives Association,
Inc. form) define certain terms between us and each counterparty to address and minimize certain risks associated with our swap
agreements, including a default by a counterparty.</P>

<P>As of December 31, 2005, our interest rate swap agreements were classified in other assets at their fair values aggregating
approximately $4.9 million, with the offsetting adjustment reflected as unrealized gains in accumulated other comprehensive income in
stockholders' equity. As of December 31, 2004, our interest rate swap agreements were classified in accounts payable, accrued
expenses and tenant security deposits at their fair values aggregating approximately $2.1 million, with the offsetting adjustment
reflected as unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders' equity. Balances in accumulated other
comprehensive income are recognized in earnings as swap payments are made. During the next twelve months, we expect to
reclassify $3.3 million from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest income.</P>
<I><B><P>Other Resources and Liquidity Requirements</I></B> </P>
<P>In March 2005, we sold 1,437,500 shares of our common stock in an underwritten offering (including the shares issued upon
exercise of the underwriter's over-allotment option). The shares were issued at a price of $62.51 per share, resulting in aggregate
proceeds of approximately $89.1 million (after deducting underwriting discounts and other offering costs). </P>
<P>In September 2005, we sold 1,248,000 shares of our common stock in an underwritten offering (including shares issued upon
exercise of the underwriter's over-allotment option). The shares were issued at a price of $81.00 per share, resulting in net proceeds of
approximately $100.3 million (after deducting underwriting discounts and other offering costs). </P>
<P>As of December 31, 2005, we had approximately $305 million of available capacity for future issuances of debt, equity and other
securities under a shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These securities may be issued from
time to time and at our discretion based on our needs and market conditions. </P>
<P>In November 2005, we entered into an amendment to our existing amended and restated credit agreement. The maximum
permitted borrowings under the credit facilities was increased from $750 million to $1 billion consisting of a $500 million unsecured
revolving credit facility and a $500 million unsecured term loan. We may in the future elect to increase commitments under the
unsecured credit facilities by up to an additional $200 million.</P>
<P>We expect to continue meeting our short-term liquidity and capital requirements generally through our working capital and net cash
provided by operating activities. We believe that the net cash provided by operating activities will continue to be sufficient to enable us
to make distributions necessary to continue qualifying as a REIT. We also believe that net cash provided by operating activities will be
sufficient to fund recurring non-revenue enhancing capital expenditures, tenant improvements and leasing commissions. </P>
<P>We expect to meet certain long-term liquidity requirements, such as for property acquisitions, property development and
redevelopment activities, scheduled debt maturities, expansions and other non-recurring capital improvements, through net cash
provided by operating activities, long-term secured and unsecured indebtedness, including borrowings under the unsecured line of
credit and unsecured term loan, and the issuance of additional debt and/or equity securities. </P>
<I><B><P>Exposure to Environmental Liabilities</I></B> </P>
<P>In connection with the acquisition of all of our properties, we have obtained Phase I environmental assessments to ascertain the
existence of any environmental liabilities or other issues. The Phase I environmental assessments of our properties have not revealed
any environmental liabilities that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations
taken as a whole, nor are we aware of any material environmental liabilities that have occurred since the Phase I environmental
assessments were completed. In addition, we carry a policy of pollution legal liability insurance covering exposure to certain
environmental losses at all of our properties</P>

<P>(1) Property-related capital expenditures include all major capital and recurring capital expenditures except capital expenditures that are
recoverable from tenants, revenue-enhancing capital expenditures, or costs related to the redevelopment of a property.  Major capital
expenditures consisted of roof replacements and HVAC systems that are typically identified and considered at the time a property is
acquired.  Major capital expenditures for 2003 also included one-time costs related to the implementation of our national branding and
signage program.  Recurring capital expenditures exclude major capital expenditures.
<P>(2) Major capital expenditures for 2004 included a one-time HVAC system upgrade at one property totaling  $1,551,000 or $0.25 per
square foot.
<P>(3) Major capital expenditures for 2003 included $1,072,000 or $0.19 per square foot in one-time costs related to the implementation of our
national branding and signage program.
<P>(4) Recurring capital expenditures for 2002 included $552,000 or $0.10 per square foot related to a fully leased property in San Diego,
California that underwent substantial renovation in 2002.
<P>(5) Excludes space that has undergone redevelopment before retenanting. </P>

</DIR>

<P>Capital expenditures fluctuate in any given period due to the nature, extent and timing of improvements required and the extent to
which they are recoverable from our tenants. Approximately 89% of our leases provide for the recapture of certain capital expenditures
(such as HVAC systems maintenance and/or replacement, roof replacement and parking lot resurfacing). In addition, we maintain an
active preventative maintenance program at each of our properties to minimize capital expenditures required. </P>
<P>Tenant improvements and leasing costs also fluctuate in any given year depending upon factors such as the timing and extent of
vacancies, property age, location and characteristics, the type of lease (renewal tenant or retenanted space), the involvement of
external leasing agents and overall competitive market conditions. </P>

<B><P>Inflation</P>
</B><P>As of December 31, 2005, approximately 85% of our leases (on a square footage basis) were triple net leases,
requiring tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes and insurance, common area and other operating expenses, including
increases thereto. In addition, as of December 31, 2005, approximately 6% of our leases (on a square footage basis) required the
tenants to pay a majority of operating expenses. Approximately 90% of our leases (on a square footage basis) contained effective
annual rent escalations that are either fixed (generally ranging from 3% to 3.5%) or indexed based on the consumer price index or
another index. Accordingly, we do not believe that our earnings or cash flow from real estate operations are subject to any significant
risk from inflation. An increase in inflation, however, could result in an increase in the cost of our variable rate borrowings, including our
unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan. </P>

<B><P>Funds from Operations</P>
</B><P>GAAP basis accounting for real estate assets utilizes historical cost accounting and assumes real estate values
diminish over time. In an effort to overcome the difference between real estate values and historical cost accounting for real estate
assets, the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") established the measurement
tool of Funds From Operations ("FFO"). Since its introduction, FFO has become a widely used non-GAAP financial measure by REITs.
We believe that FFO is helpful to investors as an additional measure of the performance of an equity REIT. We compute FFO in
accordance with standards established by the Board of Governors of NAREIT in its April 2002 White Paper (the "White Paper") and
related implementation guidance, which may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO utilized by other equity REITs, and,
accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs. The White Paper defines FFO as net income (loss) (computed in accordance
with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for
unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. While FFO is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance for REITs,
it should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of financial
performance, or to cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it
indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions. (See "Liquidity and Capital Resources -
Cash Flows" above for information regarding these measures of cash flow.) </P>

<B><P><A NAME="item7a">Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk</A></P>
</B><P>Market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates,
commodity prices and equity prices. The primary market risk to which we believe we are exposed is interest rate risk, which may result
from many factors, including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations
and other factors that are beyond our control. </P>
<P>In order to modify and manage the interest rate characteristics of our outstanding debt and to limit the effects of interest rate risks
on our operations, we may utilize a variety of financial instruments, including interest rate swaps, caps, floors and other interest rate
exchange contracts. The use of these types of instruments to hedge a portion of our exposure to changes in interest rates carries
additional risks, such as counter-party credit risk and the legal enforceability of hedging contracts. </P>
<P>Our future earnings and fair values relating to financial instruments are primarily dependent upon prevalent market rates of interest,
such as LIBOR. However, our interest rate swap agreements are intended to reduce the effects of interest rate changes. Based on
interest rates at, and our swap agreements in effect on, December 31, 2005 and 2004, we estimate that a 1% increase in interest rates
on our variable debt, including our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan, after considering the effect of our interest rate
swap agreements, would decrease annual future earnings by approximately $2.1 million and $2.0 million, respectively. We further
estimate that a 1% decrease in interest rates on our variable debt, including our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan, after
considering the effect of our interest rate swap agreements in effect on December 31, 2005 and 2004, would increase annual future
earnings by approximately $2.1 million and $2.0 million, respectively. A 1% increase in interest rates on our secured debt and interest
rate swap agreements would decrease their aggregate fair values by approximately $36.8 million and $27.2 million at December 31,
2005 and 2004, respectively. A 1% decrease in interest rates on our secured debt and interest rate swap agreements would increase
their aggregate fair values by approximately $38.4 million and $28.4 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. </P>
<P>These amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost and our interest
rate swap agreements in effect on December 31, 2005 and 2004 . These analyses do not consider the effects of the reduced level of
overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment. Further, in the event of a change of such magnitude, we would
consider taking actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change. However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that
would be taken and their possible effects, the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in our capital structure. </P>
<P>We have exposure to equity price market risk because of our equity investments in certain publicly-traded companies and privately
held entities. We classify investments in publicly-traded companies as available-for-sale and, consequently, record them on our balance
sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of comprehensive income or loss. Investments in privately
held entities are generally accounted for under the cost method because we do not influence any of the operating or financial policies of
the entities in which we invest. For all investments, we recognize other than temporary declines in value against earnings in the same
period the decline in value was deemed to have occurred. There is no assurance that future declines in values will not have a material
adverse impact on our future results of operations. By way of example, a 10% decrease in the fair value of our equity investments as of
December 31, 2005 and 2004 would decrease their fair values by approximately $8.2 million and $6.7 million, respectively.</P>


<P>We have exposure to foreign currency exchange rate market risk related to our wholly-owned subsidiaries
operating in Canada. The functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries operating in Canada is the local currency, the Canadian dollar.
Gains or losses resulting from the translation of our foreign subsidiaries' balance sheets and income statements are included in
accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders' equity. Gains or losses will be reflected in our
income statement when a transaction with a third party, denominated in a currency other than the entity's functional currency, is settled
and the functional currency cash flows realized are more or less than the exchange rate in effect when the transaction was
initiated.</P>

<B><P>Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting</P>
</B><P>The management of Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The Company's internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded
as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with the authorizations of the Company's management and directors; and
(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements. Management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005. In making its assessment, management has utilized the criteria set forth by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission in "Internal Control - Integrated Framework".
Management concluded that based on its assessment, the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of
December 31, 2005. Management's assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2005 has been audited by Ernst &amp; Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their

<P> Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm</P></B>

<P>To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of<BR>
   Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. </P>

<P>We have audited management's assessment, included in the accompanying Annual Management's Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting, that Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") maintained effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the "COSO criteria"). The Company's management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management's assessment and an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. </P>

<P>We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, evaluating management's assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.</P>

<P>A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect
on the financial statements.</P>

<P>Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.</P>

<P>In our opinion, management's assessment that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2005 is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria.  Also, in our opinion, the
Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on the
COSO criteria.

<P>We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated
statements of income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005, and our
report dated March 9, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

<P>To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of<BR>
Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. </P>
<P>We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. and subsidiaries (the
"Company") as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity, and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule
listed in the index at Item 15(a). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits. </P>
<P>We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
</P>
<P>In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. and subsidiaries at December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the consolidated results of their operations
and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial
statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein. </P>
<P>We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in
Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our
report dated March 9, 2006, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.</P>

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements </P>
<P>1. Background</P></B>
</B><P>References to the "Company", "we", "our" and "us" refer to Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. and its
subsidiaries.</P>
<P>Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. is a real estate investment trust ("REIT") formed in 1994. We are engaged principally in the
ownership, operation, management, acquisition, and selective redevelopment and development of properties containing
office/laboratory space. We refer to these properties as "life science properties". Our life science properties are designed and improved
for lease primarily to institutional (universities and not-for-profit institutions), pharmaceutical, biotechnology, life science product,
service, biodefense and translational research entities, as well as government agencies. As of December 31, 2005, we had 134
properties (131 properties located in nine states and three properties located in Canada) with approximately 8.8 million rentable square
feet of office/laboratory space, compared to 113 properties in nine states with approximately 7.4 million rentable square feet of
office/laboratory space as of December 31, 2004.</P>
<P>As of December 31, 2005, approximately 85% of our leases (on a square footage basis) were triple net leases, requiring tenants to
pay substantially all real estate taxes and insurance, common area and other operating expenses, including increases thereto. In
addition, as of December 31, 2005, approximately 6% of our leases (on a square footage basis) required the tenants to pay a majority
of operating expenses. Additionally, as of December 31, 2005, approximately 89% of our leases (on a square footage basis) provided
for the recapture of certain capital expenditures and approximately 90% of our leases (on a square footage basis) contained effective
annual rent escalations that are either fixed or indexed based on the consumer price index or another index. The information provided
in this paragraph is unaudited.</P>
<B><P>2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies</P>
<P>Basis of Presentation</P>
</B><P>The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. and
its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. </P>
<P>The Company holds interests, together with certain third parties, in a limited partnership and in a limited liability company which we
consolidate in our financial statements. Such interests are subject to provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 46R, "Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities", FASB Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 96-16, "Investor's Accounting for an Investee When the
Investor Has a Majority of the Voting Interest but the Minority Shareholder or Shareholders Have Certain Approval or Veto Rights", and
AICPA Statement of Position 78-9, "Accounting for Investments in Real Estate Ventures". Based on the provisions set forth in these
rules, we consolidate the limited partnership and limited liability company because we exercise significant control over major decisions
by these entities, such as investment activity and changes in financing.</P>
<B><P>Use of Estimates</P>
</B><P>The preparation of financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles
requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. </P>
<B><P>Reclassifications</P>
</B><P>Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.</P>
<B><P>Fair Value of Financial Instruments</P>
</B><P>The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, tenant receivables, unsecured line of credit and unsecured term
loan, and accounts payable, accrued expenses and tenant security deposits approximate fair value. </P>
<P>The fair value of our secured notes payable was estimated using discounted cash flows analyses based on borrowing rates we
believe we could obtain with similar terms and maturities. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the fair values of our secured notes
payable were approximately $682,835,000 and $652,100,000, respectively. </P>
<B><P>Operating Segments</P>
</B><P>We view our operations as principally one segment and the financial information disclosed herein represents all of the

</B><P>The functional currency for our subsidiaries operating in the United States is the U.S. dollar. During 2005, we acquired three
operating properties in Canada through wholly-owned Canadian subsidiaries. The functional currency for our foreign subsidiaries
operating in Canada is the local currency, the Canadian dollar. The assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into
U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect as of the financial statement date. Income statement accounts of our foreign subsidiaries are
translated using the average exchange rate for the period presented. Gains resulting from the translation are included in accumulated
other comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders' equity.</P>
<P>The appropriate amounts of exchange gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income are reflected in

<B><P>Rental Properties, Properties Under Development and Land Held For Development</P>
</B><P>In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, "Business Combinations", we perform the
following procedures when making an allocation of the purchase price of real estate: (1) estimate the value of the real estate as of the
acquisition date on an "as if vacant" basis; (2) allocate the "as if vacant" value among land, land improvements, buildings, building
improvements, tenant improvements and equipment; (3) calculate the value of the intangibles as the difference between the "as if
vacant" value and the purchase price; and (4) allocate the intangible value to above, below and at market leases, origination costs
associated with in-place leases, tenant relationships and other intangible assets.</P>
<P>The values allocated to land improvements, buildings, building improvements, tenant improvements and equipment are depreciated
on a straight-line basis using an estimated life of 20 years for land improvements, 40 years for buildings and building improvements, the
respective lease term for tenant improvements and the estimated useful life for equipment. The values of above and below market
leases are amortized over the life of the related lease and recorded as either an increase (for below market leases) or a decrease (for
above market leases) to rental income. The values of at-market leases and origination costs are classified as leasing costs, included in
other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and amortized over the remaining life of the lease. </P>
<P>Rental properties, properties under development and land held for development are individually evaluated for impairment when
conditions exist which may indicate that it is probable that the sum of expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying
amount of the property. Upon determination that an impairment has occurred, a write-down is recorded to reduce the carrying amount
of the property to its estimated fair value. </P>
<P>In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 34, "Capitalization of Interest Cost" ("SFAS 34") and
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 67, "Accounting for Costs and Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects"
("SFAS 67"), we capitalize direct construction and development costs, including predevelopment costs, interest, property taxes,
insurance and other costs directly related and essential to the acquisition, development or construction of a project. Pursuant to SFAS
34 and SFAS 67, capitalization of construction and development costs is required while activities are ongoing to prepare an asset for its
intended use. Costs incurred after a project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use are expensed as incurred. Costs
previously capitalized related to abandoned acquisition or development opportunities are written off. Should development activity cease,
a portion of interest, property taxes, insurance and certain costs would no longer be eligible for capitalization, and would be expensed
as incurred. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.</P>
<P>In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal
of Long-Lived Assets" ("SFAS 144"), we classify a property as "held for sale" when all of the following criteria for a plan of
sale have been met: (1) management, having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the property; (2) the property
is available for immediate sale in its present condition, subject only to the terms that are usual and customary; (3) an active program to
locate a buyer, and other actions required to complete the plan to sell, have been initiated; (4) the sale of the property is probable and is
expected to be completed within one year; (5) the property is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to
its current fair value; and (6) actions necessary to complete the plan of sale indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan
will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. When the property is classified as "held for sale", its operations are classified as
discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of income. When a property is designated as "held for sale", amounts for all
prior periods presented are reclassified from continuing operations to discontinued operations. A loss is recognized for any initial
adjustment of the asset's carrying amount to fair value less costs to sell in the period the asset qualifies as "held for sale".
Depreciation of assets is discontinued commencing on the date they are designated as "held for sale". </P>

<B><P>Investments</P>
</B><P>We hold equity investments in certain publicly-traded companies and privately held entities primarily involved in the life
science industry. All of our investments in publicly-traded companies are considered "available for sale" in accordance with Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities" ("SFAS 115"), and are
recorded at fair value. Fair value has been determined as the closing trading price at the balance sheet date, with unrealized gains and
losses shown as a separate component of stockholders' equity. The classification of investments under SFAS 115 is determined at the
time each investment is made, and such determination is reevaluated at each balance sheet date. The cost of investments sold is
determined by the specific identification method, with realized gains and losses included in other income in the accompanying
consolidated statements of income.</P>
<P>Investments in privately held entities are generally accounted for under the cost method because we do not influence any operating
or financial policies of the entities in which we invest. Certain investments are accounted for under the equity method in accordance
with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18, "The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock" ("APB 18") and
Emerging Issues Task Force Topic D-46, "Accounting for Limited Partnership Investments" ("EITF Topic D-46"). Under the equity
method we record our investment initially at cost and adjust the carrying amount of the investment to recognize our share of the
earnings or losses of the investee subsequent to the date of our investment.</P>
<P>For all of our investments, if a decline in the fair value of an investment below its carrying value is determined to be other than
temporary, such investment is written down to its estimated fair value with a non-cash charge to current earnings. The factors that we
consider in making these assessments include, but are not limited to, market prices, market conditions, prospects for favorable or
unfavorable clinical trial results, new product initiatives and new collaborative agreements. </P>
<B><P>Leasing Costs</P>
</B><P>Costs directly related and essential to our leasing activities are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over
the term of the related lease. Costs that were previously capitalized and which related to unsuccessful leasing opportunities are written
off. Leasing costs, net of related amortization, totaled $32,924,000 and $29,747,000 as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively,
and are included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. </P>
<B><P>Loan Fees and Costs</P>
</B><P>Fees and costs incurred in obtaining long-term financing are amortized over the terms of the related loans and
included in interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. Loan fees and costs, net of related amortization,
totaled $14,789,000 and $14,075,000 as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and are included in other assets in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets. </P>
<B><P>Interest Rate Swaps</P>
</B><P>We utilize interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of our exposure to variable interest rates associated with
our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan. These agreements involve an exchange of fixed and floating rate interest
payments without the exchange of the underlying principal amount (the "notional amount"). Interest received under all of our swap
agreements is based on the one-month LIBOR rate. The net difference between the interest paid and the interest received is reflected
as an adjustment to interest expense.</P>
<P>Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 ("SFAS 133"), "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities", as amended by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 138, "Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and
Certain Hedging Activities" establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative financial instruments such as our interest rate
swap agreements. All of our interest rate swap agreements meet the criteria to be deemed "highly effective" under SFAS 133 in
reducing our exposure to variable interest rates. In accordance with SFAS 133, we formally document all relationships between interest
rate swap agreements and hedged items, including the method for evaluating effectiveness and the risk strategy. Accordingly, we have
categorized these instruments as cash flow hedges. We make an assessment at the inception of each interest rate swap agreement
and on an on-going basis to determine whether these instruments are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows associated
with the hedged items. The ineffective portion of each interest rate swap agreement is immediately recognized in earnings. While we
intend to continue to meet the conditions for such hedge accounting, if hedges did not qualify as "highly effective", the changes in the
fair values of the derivatives used as hedges would be reflected in earnings.</P>
<P>Pursuant to SFAS 133, interest rate swaps are reflected at their estimated fair values in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets. We use a variety of methods and assumptions based on market conditions and risks existing at each balance sheet date to
determine the fair values of our interest rate swap agreements. These methods of assessing fair value result in a general approximation
of value.</P>
<P>We do not believe we are exposed to a significant amount of credit risk in our interest rate swap agreements as our counterparties
are established, well-capitalized financial institutions. </P>

<B><P>Rental Income and Tenant Recoveries</P>
</B><P>Rental income from leases with scheduled rent increases, free rent, incentives and other rent adjustments are
recognized on a straight-line basis over the respective lease terms. We include amounts currently recognized as income, and expected
to be received in later years, in deferred rent in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Amounts received currently, but
recognized as income in future years, are included as unearned rent in accounts payable, accrued expenses and tenant security
deposits in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. We commence recognition of rental income at the date the tenant takes
possession of or controls the physical use of the property.</P>
<P>Tenant recoveries related to reimbursement of real estate taxes, insurance, repairs and maintenance, and other operating
expenses are recognized as revenue in the period the applicable expenses are incurred. </P>
<P>We maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our tenants to make required payments. If a
tenant fails to make contractual payments beyond any allowance, we may recognize additional bad debt expense in future periods
equal to the amount of unpaid rent and unrealized deferred rent. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had no allowance for doubtful
accounts.</P>
<B><P>Interest Income</P>
</B><P>Interest income was $578,000, $181,000 and $108,000 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and is included in other income
in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.</P>
<B><P>Income Taxes</P>
</B><P>As a REIT, we are not subject to federal income taxation as long as we meet a number of organizational and
operational requirements and make distributions greater than or equal to 100% of our taxable income to our stockholders. Since we
believe we have met these requirements and our distributions exceeded taxable income, no federal income tax provision has been
reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. If we fail to
qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our
taxable income at regular corporate tax rates. </P>
<P>During 2005, 2004 and 2003, we declared dividends on our common stock of $2.72, $2.52 and $2.20 per share, respectively.
During 2004 and 2003, we declared dividends on our Series A cumulative redeemable preferred stock of $1.72847 and $2.375 per
share, respectively. During 2005, 2004 and 2003, we declared dividends on our Series B cumulative redeemable preferred stock of
$2.275, $2.275 and $2.275, respectively. During 2005 and 2004, we declared dividends on our Series C cumulative redeemable
preferred stock of $2.09375 and $0.61649 per share, respectively. See Note 11, Preferred Stock and Excess Stock.</P>
<P>The tax treatment of distributions on common stock paid in 2005 is as follows: (1) 71.8% ordinary dividend, (2) 24.1% return of
capital, (3) 3.9% capital gain at 15%, and (4) 0.2% Section 1250 capital gain at 25%. The tax treatment of distributions paid in 2004 is
as follows: (1) 76.8% ordinary dividend, (2) 19.8% return of capital, (3) 2.4% capital gain at 15%, and (4) 1.0% Section 1250 capital
gain at 25%. The information provided in this paragraph is unaudited.</P>

<P>Emerging Issues Task Force Topic D-42, "The Effect on the Calculation of Earnings Per Share for the Redemption or Induced
Conversion of Preferred Stock" ("EITF Topic D-42") provides, among other things, that any excess of (1) the fair value of the
consideration transferred to the holders of preferred stock redeemed over (2) the carrying amount of the preferred stock, should be
subtracted from net earnings to determine net income available to common stockholders in the calculation of earnings per share. The
cost to issue our preferred stock was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital in the years that the preferred stock was
issued. Upon any redemption of our preferred stock, the respective offering costs, representing the excess of the fair value of the
consideration transferred to the holders over the carrying amount of the preferred stock, will be recognized as a dividend to preferred
stockholders. During 2004, we recorded a charge of approximately $1,876,000 to net income available to common stockholders for
costs related to the redemption of our 9.5% Series A cumulative redeemable preferred stock. Dividends on preferred stock are
deducted from net income to arrive at net income allocable to common stockholders.</P>
<B><P>Stock-Based Compensation Expense</P>

options, stock grants and stock appreciation rights. Effective January 1, 2003, the Company adopted the fair value recognition
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" ("SFAS 123"),
prospectively to all employee awards granted, modified or settled after January 1, 2003. We have not granted any stock options since
2002. Under APB 25, because the exercise price of the options we granted equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date
of grant, no compensation expense has been recognized. Although we have elected to follow APB 25 for previously granted options,
pro forma information regarding net income available to common stockholders and earnings per share is required by SFAS 123. This
information has been determined as if we had accounted for our stock options under the fair value method under SFAS 123.</P>

<B><P>Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards</P>
</B><P>In March 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") reached a
consensus on Issue No. 03-1, "The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments" ("EITF
03-1"). EITF 03-1 provides guidance on other-than-temporary impairment of marketable debt and equity securities accounted for under
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities" ("SFAS 115")
and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 124, "Accounting for Certain Investments Held by Not-for-Profit Organizations"
("SFAS 124"), and non-marketable equity securities accounted for under the cost method. EITF 03-1 provides a three-step model to
determine (1) when an investment is considered impaired; (2) whether the impairment is other-than-temporary; and (3) the
measurement of the impairment loss. The guidance also requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been
recognized as other-than-temporary impairments. In addition, EITF 03-1 provides that a company does not have to estimate the fair
value of an investment accounted for under the cost method if there are no identified events or changes in circumstances that may
have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. In September 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position ("FSP")
No. EITF Issue 03-1-1, "Effective Date of Paragraphs 10-20 of EITF Issue No. 03-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary
Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments", which delays the effective date of the recognition and measurement provisions
of EITF 03-1 until certain implementation issues are addressed and a final FSP providing implementation guidance is issued. In
November 2005, the FASB issued FSP 115-1 and FSP 124-1, "The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application
to Certain Investments" ("FSP 115-1 and FSP 124-1") which replaces the guidance set forth in paragraphs 10-18 of EITF 03-1 with
reference to existing guidance including SFAS 115, SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 59, "Accounting for Noncurrent Marketable
Equity Securities" and Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18, "The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common
Stock". FSP 115-1 and FSP 124-1 is effective for other-than-temporary impairment analysis conducted in periods beginning after
December 15, 2005. The Company adopted FSP 115-1 and FSP 124-1 in December 2005. The adoption of FSP 115-1 and FSP 124-1
did not have a material impact on our financial statements.</P>
<P>In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share-Based
Payment" ("SFAS 123R"). SFAS 123R requires measurement of all employee stock-based compensation awards using a fair value
method and the recording of such expense in the financial statements. This eliminates the accounting for such awards using the
intrinsic method pursuant to Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" ("APB 25"). In
April 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission amended the compliance date for SFAS 123R to no later than the beginning of
the registrant's first fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005. Accordingly, we plan to adopt SFAS 123R on January 1, 2006. Upon
adoption of SFAS 123R, we intend to use the modified-prospective transition method whereby compensation expense will be
recognized relating to the remaining unvested portion of outstanding stock options at the time of adoption, and the expense will be
recognized over the remaining service period. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS 123R to have a material impact on our financial
statements since all awards accounted for under APB 25 were fully vested on December 31, 2005. </P>

<P>In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 153, "Exchanges of Nonmonetary
Assets" ("SFAS 153"), which amends Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 29, "Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions" ("APB
29"). SFAS 153 addresses the measurement of exchanges of nonmonetary assets and redefines the scope of transactions that should
be measured based on the fair values of the assets exchanged. SFAS 153 is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges beginning in
our third quarter of 2005. The adoption of SFAS 153 did not have a material impact on our financial statements.</P>
<P>In May 2005, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 154, "Accounting Changes and Error Corrections"
("SFAS 154"), which replaces Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 20, "Accounting Changes" and Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 3, "Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements". SFAS 154 requires retrospective
application to prior periods' financial statements of voluntary changes in accounting principles, unless it is impracticable to determine
either the period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections
of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS 154 to have an impact on
our financial statements.</P>

<B><P>4. Investments</P>
</B><P>We hold equity investments in certain publicly-traded companies and privately held entities primarily involved in the life science
industry. All of our investments in publicly-traded companies are considered "available for sale" in accordance with SFAS 115, and are
recorded at fair value. Investments in privately held entities are generally accounted for under the cost method because we do not
influence any operating or financial policies of the entities in which we invest. Certain investments are accounted for under the equity
method in accordance with APB 18 and EITF Topic D-46. For all of our investments, if a decline in the fair value of an investment below
its carrying value is determined to be other than temporary, such investment is written down to its estimated fair value with a non-cash
charge to current earnings. The factors that we consider in making these assessments include, but are not limited to, market prices,
market conditions, prospects for favorable or unfavorable clinical trial results, new product initiatives and new collaborative agreements.

Significant Accounting Policies.</P>

1<SUP>st</SUP> of each year.</P>

</DIR>

<B><P>6. Unsecured Line of Credit and Unsecured Term Loan</P>
</B><P>In November 2005, we entered into an amendment to our amended and restated credit agreement to increase the
maximum permitted borrowings under our unsecured credit facilities from $750 million to $1 billion consisting of a $500 million
unsecured revolving credit facility and a $500 million unsecured term loan. We may in the future elect to increase commitments under
the unsecured credit facilities by up to an additional $200 million.</P>
<P>Borrowings under our unsecured line of credit, as amended, bear interest at a floating rate based on our election of either a
LIBOR-based rate or the higher of the bank's reference rate and the Federal Funds rate, plus 0.5%. For each LIBOR-based advance, we must
elect a LIBOR period of one, two, three or six months. The unsecured line of credit matures in December 2007 and may be extended at
our sole option for an additional one-year period. As of December 31, 2005, we had borrowings of $240 million outstanding on the
unsecured line of credit with a weighted average interest rate of 5.69%. </P>

<P>Our unsecured term loan bears interest at a floating rate based on our election of either a LIBOR-based rate or the higher of the
bank's reference rate and the Federal Funds rate, plus 0.5%. For each LIBOR-based advance, we must elect to fix for a period of one,
two, three or six months. The unsecured term loan matures in December 2009. As of December 31, 2005, we had borrowings of $500
million outstanding on the unsecured term loan with a weighted average interest rate of 5.67%.</P>
<P>Our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan contain financial covenants, including, among other things, maintenance of
minimum net worth, a leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio. In addition, the terms of the unsecured line of credit and
unsecured term loan restrict, among other things, certain investments, indebtedness, distributions and mergers. </P>
<P>Aggregate borrowings under the unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan may be limited to an amount based on the net
operating income derived from a pool of unencumbered properties. Accordingly, as we acquire or complete the development or
redevelopment of additional unencumbered properties, aggregate borrowings available under the unsecured line of credit and
unsecured term loan will increase up to a maximum combined amount of $1 billion. Under these provisions as of December 31, 2005,
aggregate borrowings under our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan were limited to $863 million. </P>

<B><P>7. Interest Rate Swaps</P>
</B><P>We utilize interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of our exposure to variable interest rates associated with
our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan. These agreements involve an exchange of fixed and floating rate interest
payments without the exchange of the underlying principal amount (the "notional amount"). Interest received under all of our swap
agreements is based on the one-month LIBOR rate. The net difference between the interest paid and the interest received is reflected
as an adjustment to interest expense.</P>
<P>Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 ("SFAS 133"), "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities", as amended by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 138, "Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and
Certain Hedging Activities" establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative financial instruments such as our interest rate
swap agreements. All of our interest rate swap agreements meet the criteria to be deemed "highly effective" under SFAS 133 in
reducing our exposure to variable interest rates. In accordance with SFAS 133, we formally document all relationships between interest
rate swap agreements and hedged items, including the method for evaluating effectiveness and the risk strategy. Accordingly, we have
categorized these instruments as cash flow hedges. We make an assessment at the inception of each interest rate swap agreement
and on an on-going basis to determine whether these instruments are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows associated
with the hedged items. While we intend to continue to meet the conditions for such hedge accounting, if hedges did not qualify as
"highly effective", the changes in the fair values of the derivatives used as hedges would be reflected in earnings.</P>
<P>As of December 31, 2005, our interest rate swap agreements were classified in other assets at their fair values aggregating
approximately $4.9 million, with the offsetting adjustment reflected as unrealized gains in accumulated other comprehensive income in
stockholders' equity. As of December 31, 2004, our interest rate swap agreements were classified in accounts payable, accrued
expenses and tenant security deposits at their fair values aggregating approximately $2.1 million, with the offsetting adjustment
reflected as unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders' equity. Balances in accumulated other
comprehensive income are recognized in earnings as swap payments are made. During the next twelve months, we expect to
reclassify $3.3 million from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest income.</P>

</PRE>

<B><P>8. Commitments and Contingencies</P>
<P>Employee Retirement Savings Plan</P>
</B><P>We have a retirement savings plan pursuant to Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code whereby our employees
may contribute a portion of their compensation to their respective retirement accounts, in an amount not to exceed the maximum
allowed under the Internal Revenue Code. In addition to employee contributions, we have elected to provide discretionary profit sharing
contributions (subject to statutory limitations), which amounted to $552,000, $515,000 and $461,000, respectively, for the years ended
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. Employees who participate in the plan are immediately vested in their contributions and in the
contributions of the company. </P>
<B><P>Concentration of Credit Risk</P>
</B><P>We maintain our cash and cash equivalents at insured financial institutions. The combined account balances at each
institution periodically exceed FDIC insurance coverage, and, as a result, there is a concentration of credit risk related to amounts in
excess of FDIC insurance coverage. We believe that the risk is not significant. </P>
<P>We are dependent on rental income from relatively few tenants in the life science industry. The inability of any single tenant to
make its lease payments could adversely affect our operations. As of December 31, 2005, we held 283 leases with a total of 237
tenants and 73 of our 134 properties were each leased to a single tenant. At December 31, 2005, our three largest tenants accounted
for approximately 11.6% of our aggregate annualized base rent. </P>
<P>We generally do not require collateral or other security from our tenants, other than security deposits. In addition to security
deposits held in cash, we held $35.1 million in irrevocable letters of credit available from certain tenants as security deposits for 86
leases as of December 31, 2005.</P>
<B><P>Commitments</P>
</B><P>As of December 31, 2005, we were committed under the terms of contracts to complete the construction of properties
under development at a remaining aggregate cost of approximately $46.4 million. </P>
<P>As of December 31, 2005, we were also committed to fund approximately $20.1 million for the construction of building infrastructure
improvements under the terms of leases and/or construction contracts and approximately $13.3 million for certain investments. </P>
<P>As of December 31, 2005, we were committed under the terms of eight ground leases. These lease obligations totaling
approximately $62.8 million have remaining lease terms of 27 to 50 years, exclusive of extension options. In addition, as of December
31, 2005, we were committed under the terms of certain operating leases for our headquarters and field offices. These lease obligations
totaling approximately $6.2 million have remaining lease terms of two to seven years, exclusive of extension options.</P>


<B><P>9. Minority Interest</P></B>

<P>Minority interest represents the interests in a limited partnership and in a limited liability company held by certain third parties, which
own two properties and are included in our consolidated financial statements. We recognize minority interest in these entities in which
we have a controlling interest. Minority interest is adjusted for additional contributions, distributions to minority holders and the minority
holders' proportionate share of the net earnings or losses of each respective entity. Distributions, profits and losses related to these
entities are allocated in accordance with the respective operating agreements. As of December 31, 2005 the aggregate minority interest
balance related to these entities was approximately $20.1 million and is classified as minority interest in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheet. </P>

<B><P>10. Issuances of Common Stock</P>
</B><P>In March 2005, we sold 1,437,500 shares of our common stock in an underwritten offering (including the shares issued
upon exercise of the underwriter's over-allotment option). The shares were issued at a price of $62.51 per share, resulting in net
proceeds of approximately $89.1 million (after deducting underwriting discounts and other offering costs).</P>
<P>In September 2005, we sold 1,248,000 shares of our common stock in an underwritten offering (including shares issued upon
exercise of the underwriter's over-allotment option). The shares were issued at a price of $81.00 per share, resulting in net proceeds of
approximately $100.3 million (after deducting underwriting discounts and other offering costs). </P>

<B><P>11. Preferred Stock and Excess Stock</P>
<P>Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock</P>
</B><P>In July 2004, we redeemed all 1,543,500 outstanding shares of our 9.50% Series A cumulative redeemable preferred
stock ("Series A preferred stock") at a redemption price of $25.00 per share plus $0.5409722 per share representing accumulated and
unpaid dividends to the redemption date. In accordance with EITF Topic D-42, we recorded a charge of approximately $1,876,000 to
net income available to common stockholders during the second quarter of 2004 for costs related to the redemption of the Series A
preferred stock. We redeemed our Series A preferred stock with proceeds from the Series C preferred stock offering.</P>

<B><P>Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock</P>
</B><P>In January 2002, we completed a public offering of 2,300,000 shares of our 9.10% Series B cumulative redeemable preferred
stock ("Series B preferred stock") (including the shares issued upon exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option). The shares
were issued at a price of $25.00 per share, resulting in aggregate proceeds of approximately $55.1 million (after deducting underwriters'
discounts and other offering costs). The dividends on our Series B preferred stock are cumulative and accrue from the date of original
issuance. We pay dividends quarterly in arrears at an annual rate of $2.275 per share. Our Series B preferred stock has no stated
maturity, is not subject to any sinking fund or mandatory redemption and is not redeemable prior to January 22, 2007, except in order to
preserve our status as a REIT. Investors in our Series B preferred stock generally have no voting rights. On or after January 22, 2007,
we may, at our option, redeem our Series B preferred stock, in whole or in part, at any time with proceeds from the sale of equity
securities at a redemption price of $25.00 per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends. </P>
<B><P>Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock</P>
</B><P>In June 2004, we completed a public offering of 5,185,500 shares of our 8.375% Series C cumulative redeemable preferred
stock ("Series C preferred stock") (including the shares issued upon exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option). The shares
were issued at a price of $25.00 per share, resulting in aggregate proceeds of approximately $124.0 million (after deducting
underwriters' discounts and other offering costs). The proceeds were used to redeem our Series A preferred stock with the remaining
portion used to pay down our unsecured line of credit. The dividends on our Series C preferred stock are cumulative and accrue from
the date of original issuance. We pay dividends quarterly in arrears at an annual rate of $2.09375 per share. Our Series C preferred
stock has no stated maturity, is not subject to any sinking fund or mandatory redemption and is not redeemable prior to June 29, 2009,
except in order to preserve our status as a REIT. Investors in our Series C preferred stock generally have no voting rights. On or after
June 29, 2009, we may, at our option, redeem our Series C preferred stock, in whole or in part, at any time for cash at a redemption
price of $25.00 per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends.</P>
<B><P>Preferred Stock and Excess Stock Authorizations</P>
</B><P>Our charter authorizes the issuance of up to 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, of which 7,485,500 shares were
issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2005. In addition, 200,000,000 shares of "excess stock" (as defined) are authorized, none
of which were issued and outstanding at December 31, 2005. </P>

<B><P>12. Stock Option Plans and Stock Grants</P>
<P>1997 Stock Plan</P>
</B><P>In 1997, we adopted a stock option and incentive plan (the "Stock Plan") for the purpose of attracting and retaining the
highest quality personnel, providing for additional incentives and promoting the success of the company by providing employees the
opportunity to acquire common stock pursuant to (i) options to purchase common stock; and (ii) share awards. As of December 31,
2005, a total of 413,501 shares were reserved for the granting of future options and share awards under the Stock Plan. </P>
<P>Options under our plan have been granted at prices that are equal to the market value of the stock on the date of grant and expire
ten years after the date of grant. Employee options vest ratably in three annual installments from the date of grant. Non-employee
director options vest immediately on the date of grant. The options outstanding under the Stock Plan expire at various dates through
October 2012. </P>
<P>In addition, the Stock Plan permits us to issue share awards to our employees and non-employee directors. A share award is an
award of common stock, which (i) may be fully vested upon issuance or (ii) may be subject to the risk of forfeiture under Section 83 of
the Internal Revenue Code. Shares issued generally vest over a one to three year period from the date of issuance and the sale of the
shares is restricted prior to the date of vesting. During 2005, we awarded 162,387 shares of common stock. The unearned portion of
these awards is amortized as stock compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. </P>

<P>The fair values of the options issued under the Stock Plan were estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing
model with the following weighted average assumptions for 2005, 2004 and 2003: </P>

<P>Income from discontinued operations, net includes the results of operations of one property we sold during 2005, one property we
sold during 2004 and three properties we sold during 2003 in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 144. See Note 2, Basis of
Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.</P>

<P>As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had no properties designated as "held for sale" in accordance with SFAS 144. During the
third quarter of 2005, we sold one property located in the Southeast market that had been designated as "held for sale" as of June 30,
2005. The total sale price for the property was approximately $1.3 million. In connection with this sale, we recorded a gain on sale of
property of approximately $36,000. During the first quarter of 2004, we sold one property located in the Suburban Washington D.C.
market that had been designated as "held for sale" as of December 31, 2003. The total sale price for the property was approximately
$5.7 million. In connection with the sale, we recorded a gain on sale of property of approximately $1.6 million. During the fourth quarter
of 2003, we sold one property located in the Suburban Washington D.C. market that had been designated as "held for sale" during the
fourth quarter of 2003. The total sale price for the property was approximately $9.0 million. In connection with the sale, we recorded a
loss on sale of property of approximately $36,000. During the third quarter of 2003, we sold one property located in the Eastern
Massachusetts market that had been previously designated as "held for sale" as of December 31, 2002. The total sale price for the
property was approximately $46.5 million. In connection with this sale, we recorded a gain on sale of property of approximately $8.8
million. Interest expense included in discontinued operations represents interest related to a secured note payable, which was assumed
by the buyer in connection with the sale of this property. During the first quarter of 2003, we sold one property located in the San
Francisco Bay market which could not be redeveloped pursuant to our original strategic objectives and that had been designated as
"held for sale" as of December 31, 2002. The total sale price for the property was approximately $6.8 million. In connection
with this sale, we recorded a loss on sale of property of approximately $455,000 in 2003. Gains and losses on sales of these properties
are included in the income statement in income from discontinued operations, net.</P>
