<STRONG><P>Item 1. Business</P>
<I><P>General</P>

</I></STRONG><P>We are a Maryland corporation formed in October 1994 that has
elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, for federal
income tax purposes.  We are engaged primarily in the ownership, operation,
management, acquisition, expansion and selective redevelopment and development
of high quality, strategically located properties containing office and
laboratory space designed and improved for lease principally to pharmaceutical,
biotechnology, life science product and services companies, not-for-profit
scientific research institutions, universities and related government agencies
(collectively, the "life science industry").  Properties leased to tenants in
the life science industry typically consist of suburban office buildings
containing scientific research and development laboratories and other
improvements that are generic to tenants operating in the life science industry.
We refer to such properties as "life science facilities."  As of December 31,
2003, we owned 89 properties (collectively, the "properties"), containing
approximately 5.7 million rentable square feet of office and laboratory space.
</P>
<I><STRONG><P>Business and Growth Strategy</P>
</I></STRONG>

<P>We focus our property operations and investment activities
principally in the following life science markets: </P>


<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>California (in the San Diego, Pasadena and San Francisco Bay
areas).</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>Seattle. </LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>suburban Washington D.C. (including Maryland and

<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>New Jersey and suburban Philadelphia.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>the Southeast (including North Carolina and Georgia).
</LI></BLOCKQUOTE></UL>
</UL>

<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Our tenant base is broad and diverse within the life science industry and
reflects our focus on regional, national and international tenants with
substantial financial and operational resources.  For a detailed description of
our properties and tenants, see "Item 2. Properties."  We have an experienced
Board of Directors and are led by a senior management team with extensive
experience in both the real estate and life science industries. </P>

<P>We seek to maximize growth in funds from operations ("FFO") and cash
available for distribution to stockholders through the ownership, operation,
management, acquisition, expansion and selective redevelopment and development
of life science facilities.  See "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Funds from Operations" for a
discussion of how we compute and view FFO, as well as a discussion of other
measures of cash flow. In particular, we seek to increase FFO and cash available
for distribution by: </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>acquiring high quality life science facilities in our life
science markets at prices that will enable us to realize attractive
returns.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>redeveloping or expanding existing or newly acquired office,
warehouse or vacant space into generic laboratory space that can be leased at
higher rental rates.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>selectively developing properties, primarily on a build-to-suit
basis. </LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>retenanting and releasing space within our portfolio at higher
rental rates and with minimal non-revenue enhancing tenant improvement
costs.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>realizing contractual rental rate escalations, which are
currently provided for in approximately 93% of our leases.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>implementing effective cost control measures, including
negotiating pass-through provisions in tenant leases for operating expenses and
certain capital expenditures.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>managing the level of debt on our balance sheet and our exposure
to floating rate debt.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE></UL>


<U>
<P>Internal Growth</U>. We seek to achieve internal growth from several sources.
For example, we seek to: </P>


<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>include rental rate escalation provisions in our
leases.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>improve investment returns through releasing of vacant space and
replacement of existing tenants with new tenants at higher rental
rates.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>achieve higher rental rates from existing tenants as leases
expire.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>expand existing facilities that are fully leased and/or
redevelop existing and/or newly acquired space to higher rent, generic
laboratory space.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>implement effective cost control measures, including negotiating
pass-through provisions in tenant leases for operating expenses and certain
capital expenditures.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE></UL>



<P>Our ability to negotiate contractual rent escalations in future leases and to
achieve increases in rental rates will depend upon market conditions and the
demand for life science facilities at the time the leases are negotiated and the
increases are proposed.</P>


<U><P>Acquisitions</U>. We seek to identify and acquire high quality life
science facilities in our target markets on a selective basis.  Critical
evaluation of prospective property acquisitions is an essential component of our
acquisition strategy.  When evaluating acquisition opportunities, we assess a
full range of matters relating to the properties, including the: </P>


<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>location of the property and our strategy in the relevant
market.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>quality of existing and prospective tenants.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>condition and capacity of the building
infrastructure.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>quality and generic characteristics of laboratory
facilities.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>physical condition of the structure and common area
improvements.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>opportunities available for leasing vacant space and for
retenanting occupied space.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>opportunities to redevelop existing space into higher rent
generic laboratory space.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>opportunities to expand the existing
facility.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE></UL>


<U>
<P>Redevelopment.</U> We seek to enhance our growth by redeveloping existing
office, warehouse or vacant space as generic laboratory space that can be leased
at higher rates.  As of December 31, 2003, we had 10 properties in our
redevelopment program that contained a total of 770,000 square feet.  Of this
total, 359,000 square feet are under redevelopment and currently vacant, and the
remaining 411,000 square feet are currently leased.  We have also identified
approximately 411,000 square feet of additional space in our existing portfolio
for potential redevelopment.</P>

<P>Due to the fact that space undergoing redevelopment is vacant, our
redevelopment program has the effect of currently reducing rental revenue and
FFO.  Despite our ongoing redevelopment activities, we have achieved consistent
growth in FFO.</P>

<U><P>Development</U>. Our development strategy is primarily to pursue selective
build-to-suit projects where we expect to achieve investment returns that will
equal or exceed our returns on acquisitions.  We generally have undertaken
build-to-suit projects only if our investment in infrastructure will be
substantially made for generic, rather than tenant-specific, improvements.  On
occasion, we also develop properties in certain life science markets before we
have leases in place.  Since our initial public offering in 1997, we have
completed the development of ten properties containing approximately 643,000
rentable square feet of office and warehouse space.  In addition, we currently
own parcels of land and may expand existing properties, representing an
aggregate future development potential of approximately 1,387,000 rentable
square feet, of office/laboratory facilities.</P>

<U><P>Financing/Working Capital</U>. We believe that cash provided by
operations, our unsecured line of credit and our unsecured term loan will be
sufficient to fund our working capital requirements.  We generally expect to
finance future acquisitions and redevelopment and development projects through
our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan and, then, to refinance
some or all of that indebtedness periodically with additional equity or debt
capital.  We may also issue shares of our common stock, preferred stock or
interests in our subsidiaries to fund future operations. </P>

<P>We seek to maintain a balance between the amounts of our fixed and variable
debt with a view to moderating our exposure to interest rate risk.  We also use
financial instruments, such as interest rate swap agreements, to hedge a portion
of our exposure to the variable interest rates associated with our unsecured
line of credit and unsecured term loan.  Interest rate swap agreements involve
an exchange of fixed and floating interest rate payments without the exchange of
the underlying principal or "notional amount."  Interest received under our
current interest rate swap agreements is based on the one-month LIBOR rate.  See
"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources" for a more complete discussion of
our unsecured line of credit, unsecured term loan, interest rate swap agreements
and other outstanding indebtedness. </P>

<I><STRONG><P>Business Risks</P>

</I><U><P>We Are Largely Dependent on the Life Sciences Industry for Revenues
from Lease Payments</P>
</U></STRONG><P>In general, our strategy is to invest primarily in properties
used by tenants in the life science industry.  Our business could be adversely
affected if the life science industry experiences an economic downturn.  Because
of our industry focus, events within the life science industry may have a more
pronounced effect on our ability to make distributions to our stockholders than
if we had diversified investments.  Also, our properties may be better suited
for a particular life science industry tenant and could require modification
before we are able to release vacant space to another life science industry
tenant.  Generally, our properties also may not be suitable for lease to
traditional office tenants without significant expenditures on renovations. </P>

<U><STRONG><P>Our Tenants May Not Be Able to Pay Us if They Are Unsuccessful in
Discovering, Developing, Making or Selling Their Products and Technologies</P>
</U></STRONG><P>Our life science industry tenants are subject to a number of
risks, including the following, any one or more of which may adversely affect
their ability to make rental payments to us: </P>


<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>Some of our tenants require significant funding to develop and
commercialize their products and technologies, which funding must be obtained
from private investors, the public market, companies in the life science

<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>Drugs that are developed and manufactured by some of our tenants
require regulatory approval prior to being made, marketed, sold and used.  The
regulatory approval process to manufacture and market drugs is costly, typically
takes several years, requires the expenditure of substantial resources and is

obtaining these approvals.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>Some of our tenants and their licensors require patent,

<P>We cannot assure you that our tenants will be able to develop, make, market
or sell their products and technologies due to the risks inherent in the life
science industry.  Any tenant that is unable to avoid, or sufficiently mitigate,
the risks described above, may have difficulty making rental payments to us.
</P>

<U><STRONG><P>We Could be Held Liable for Damages Resulting from Our Tenants'
Use of Hazardous Materials</P>
</U></STRONG><P>Many of our life science industry tenants engage in research and
development activities that involve the controlled use of hazardous materials,
chemicals and biological and radioactive compounds.  In the event of
contamination or injury from the use of these hazardous materials, we could be
held liable for damages that result.  This liability could exceed our resources
and any recovery available through any applicable environmental remediation
insurance coverage and could adversely affect our ability to make distributions
to our stockholders. </P>

<P>Together with our tenants, we must comply with federal, state and local laws
and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal
of hazardous materials and waste products.  Failure to comply with, or changes
in, these laws and regulations could adversely affect our business or our
tenants' business and their ability to make rental payments to us. </P>

<U><STRONG><P>The Inability of Any Tenant to Pay Us Rent Could Adversely Affect
Our Business</P>
</U></STRONG>

<P>Our revenues are derived primarily from rental payments and
reimbursement of operating expenses under our leases.  If our tenants,
especially significant tenants, failed to make rental payments under their
leases, our financial condition, cash flow and our ability to make distributions
to our stockholders could be adversely affected. </P>

<P>As of December 31, 2003, we had 208 leases with a total of 179 tenants.  Of
our 89 properties, 50 were occupied by a single tenant.  Three of our tenants
accounted for approximately 12.8% of our aggregate annualized base rent, or
approximately 4.9%, 4.6% and 3.3%, respectively. "Annualized base rent" means
the annualized fixed base rental amount in effect as of December 31, 2003, using
rental revenue calculated on a straight-line basis in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").  Annualized base rent does not include
reimbursements for real estate taxes and insurance, common area and other
operating expenses, substantially all of which are borne by the tenants in the
case of triple net leases. </P>

<P>The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant may also adversely affect the
income produced by a property.  If any of our tenants becomes a debtor in a case
under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, we cannot evict that tenant solely because of
its bankruptcy.  The bankruptcy court may authorize the tenant to reject and
terminate its lease with us.  Our claim against such a tenant for unpaid future
rent would be subject to a statutory limitation that might be substantially less
than the remaining rent actually owed to us under the tenant's lease.  Any
shortfall in rent payments could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability
to make distributions to our stockholders. </P>

<U><STRONG><P>Our U.S. Government Tenants May Not Receive Annual Appropriations,
Which Could Adversely Affect Their Ability to Pay Us</P>
</U></STRONG>

<P>U.S. government tenants may be subject to annual appropriations.
If one of our U.S. government tenants fails to receive its annual appropriation,
it might not be able to make its lease payments to us.  In addition, defaults
under leases with federal government tenants are governed by federal statute and
not by state eviction or rent deficiency laws.  All of our leases with U.S.
government tenants provide that the government tenant may terminate the lease
under certain circumstances.  As of December 31, 2003, leases with U.S.
government tenants at our properties accounted for approximately 3.1% of our
aggregate annualized base rent. </P>

<U><STRONG><P>Loss of a Tenant Could Have a Negative Impact on Our Business</P>
</U></STRONG><P>A tenant may not renew its lease upon the expiration of the
initial term.  In addition, we may not be able to locate a qualified replacement
tenant upon expiration or termination of a lease.  Consequently, we could lose
the cash flow from the affected property, which could negatively impact our
business.  We may have to divert cash flow generated by other properties to meet
our mortgage payments, if any, or to pay other expenses related to owning the
affected property.  As of December 31, 2003, leases at our properties
representing approximately 10.8% and 5.6% of the total square footage of our
properties were scheduled to expire in 2004 and 2005, respectively. </P>

<P>As a result of our geographic concentration, we depend upon the local
economic conditions in these markets, including local real estate conditions.
We are, therefore, subject to increased exposure (positive or negative) to
economic and other competitive factors specific to markets in confined
geographic areas.  Our operations may also be affected if too many competing
properties are built in any of these markets.  An economic downturn in any of
these markets could adversely affect our operations and our ability to make
distributions to stockholders.  We cannot assure you that these markets will
continue to grow or will remain favorable to the life science industry. </P>

<U><STRONG><P>We May Have Difficulty Managing Our Growth</P>
</U></STRONG>

<P>We expect to continue to grow by acquiring, redeveloping and
selectively developing additional properties.  To manage our growth effectively,
we must successfully integrate new properties into our existing operations.  We
may not succeed with the integration.  In addition, we may not effectively
manage new properties, and new properties may not perform as expected.  Our
business could be adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in managing our
growth. </P>

<U><STRONG><P>Our Debt Service Obligations May Have Adverse Consequences on Our
Business Operations</P>
</U></STRONG>

<P>We use debt to finance our operations, including acquisitions of
properties. Our use of debt may have adverse consequences, including the
following: </P>


<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>our cash flow from operations may be not be sufficient to meet
required payments of principal and interest.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>we may be forced to dispose of one or more of our properties,
possibly on disadvantageous terms, to make payments on our
debt.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>we may default on our debt obligations, and the lenders or

<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>a foreclosure on one of our properties could create taxable

<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>we may be subject to a significant increase in the variable

adversely impact our operations.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE></UL>


<P>As of December 31, 2003, we had outstanding mortgage indebtedness of
approximately $320.0 million, secured by 39 properties, and outstanding debt
under our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan of $389.0 million.
</P>

<U><STRONG><P>Our Unsecured Line of Credit and Unsecured Term Loan Restricts Our
Ability to Engage in Some Business Activities</P>
</U></STRONG>

<P>Our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan facilities
contain customary negative covenants and other financial and operating covenants
that, among other things: </P>


<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>restrict our ability to incur additional
indebtedness.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>restrict our ability to make certain
investments.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>restrict our ability to merge with another

<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>require us to maintain financial coverage

<P>These restrictions could cause us to default on our unsecured line of credit
and unsecured term loan or negatively affect our operations and our ability to
make distributions to our stockholders. </P>

<U><STRONG><P>We May Not Be Able to Obtain Additional Capital to Further Our
Business Objectives</P>
</U></STRONG>

<P>Our ability to acquire, redevelop or develop properties depends
upon our ability to obtain capital.  Periodically, the real estate industry
experiences reduced supplies of favorably-priced equity or debt capital, which
decreases the level of new investment activity by publicly-traded real estate
companies.  A prolonged period in which we cannot effectively access public
equity or debt markets may result in heavier reliance on alternative financing
sources to undertake new investments.  An inability to obtain equity or debt
capital on acceptable terms could delay or prevent us from acquiring,
structuring and completing desirable investments, which could adversely affect
our business.  Also, the issuance of additional shares of capital stock or
interests in subsidiaries to fund future operations could dilute the ownership
of then existing stockholders. </P>

<U><STRONG><P>If Interest Rates Rise, Our Debt Service Costs Will Increase</P>
</U></STRONG>

<P>Borrowings outstanding under our unsecured line of credit,
unsecured term loan and certain other borrowings bear interest at a variable
rate, and we may incur additional variable rate debt in the future.  Increases
in market interest rates would increase our interest expenses under these debt
instruments and would increase the costs of refinancing existing indebtedness or
obtaining new debt.  Accordingly, these increases could adversely affect our
financial position and our ability to make distributions to stockholders. </P>

<U><STRONG><P>We May Not Be Able to Acquire Properties or Operate Them
Successfully</P>
</U></STRONG>

<P>Our success depends in large part upon our ability to acquire
additional properties on satisfactory terms and to operate them successfully.
If we are unable to do so, our business could be adversely affected.  In
addition, the acquisition of life science facilities generally involves a higher
per square foot price than the acquisition of traditional suburban office
properties. </P>

<P>The acquisition, ownership and operation of real estate is subject to many
risks that may adversely affect our business and our ability to make payments to
stockholders, including the risks that: </P>


<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>our properties may not perform as we expect.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>we may not be able to acquire a desired property because of
competition from other real estate investors with significant

<U><STRONG><P>If Our Revenues Are Less Than Our Expenses, We May Have to Borrow
Additional Funds and We May Not Be Able to Make Distributions to Our

</U></STRONG>

<P>If our properties do not generate revenues sufficient to meet
our operating expenses, including debt service and other capital expenditures,
we may have to borrow additional amounts to cover fixed costs and cash flow
needs.  This could adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our
stockholders.  Factors that could adversely affect the revenues from and the
value of our properties include: </P>


<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>national and local economic conditions.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>In addition, if a lease at a property is not a triple net lease, we will have
greater expenses associated with that property and greater exposure to increases
in such expenses.  Significant expenditures, such as mortgage payments, real
estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs, generally are fixed and do not
decrease when revenues at the related property decrease. </P>

<U><STRONG><P>Improvements to Life Science Facilities Are More Costly Than
Traditional Office Space</P>
</U></STRONG>

<P>Our properties contain generic infrastructure improvements that
are more costly than other property types.  Although we have historically been
able to recover the additional investment in generic infrastructure improvements
through higher rental rates, there is the risk that we will not be able to
continue to do so in the future. Typical improvements include: </P>

<U><STRONG><P>We May Not Be Able to Sell Our Properties Quickly to Raise
Money</P>
</U></STRONG>
<P>Investments in real estate are relatively illiquid.
Accordingly, we may not be able to sell our properties when we desire or at
acceptable prices in response to changes in economic or other conditions.  In
addition, the Internal Revenue Code limits our ability to sell properties held
for fewer than four years.  These limitations on our ability to sell our
properties may adversely affect our cash flows and our ability to make
distributions to stockholders. </P>

<U><STRONG><P>We Face Substantial Competition in Our Target Markets</P>
</U></STRONG><P>

The significant competition for business in our target markets
could have an adverse effect on our operations.  We compete for investment

<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>owner/occupants.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE></UL>

<P>Many of these entities have substantially greater financial resources than we
do and may be able to accept more risk than we are willing to accept.  These
entities may be less sensitive to risks with respect to the creditworthiness of
a tenant or the geographic concentration of their investments.  Competition may
also reduce the number of suitable investment opportunities available to us or
may increase the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell. </P>

<U><STRONG><P>Our Properties May Have Defects That Are Unknown to Us</P>
</U></STRONG>

<P>Although we review the physical condition of our properties
before they are acquired, and on a periodic basis after acquisition, any of our

adversely affect the property's value or revenue potential. </P>

<U><STRONG><P>If We Fail to Qualify as a REIT, We Would Be Taxed at Corporate

<P>As a result of any additional tax liability, we might need to borrow funds or
liquidate certain investments in order to pay the applicable tax.  Accordingly,
funds available for investment or distribution to our stockholders would be
reduced for each of the years involved. </P>

<P>Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and
complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code to our operations and the
determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within
our control.  There are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations
of these provisions.  Although we believe that we have operated, commencing with
our taxable year ended December 31, 1996, in a manner so as to qualify as a
REIT, we cannot assure you that we are or will remain so qualified. </P>

<P>In addition, although we are not aware of any pending tax legislation that
would adversely affect our ability to operate as a REIT, new legislation,
regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could change the
tax laws or interpretations of the tax laws regarding qualification as a REIT,
or the federal income tax consequences of that qualification, in a manner that
is adverse to our stockholders. </P>

<U><STRONG><P>There Are Limits on the Ownership of Our Capital Stock Under Which
A Stockholder May Lose Beneficial Ownership of Its Shares </P>
</U></STRONG>

<P>The Internal Revenue Code provides that, in order for us to
maintain our qualification as a REIT, not more than 50% of the value of our
outstanding capital stock may be owned, directly or constructively, by five or
fewer individuals or entities. </P>

<P>In addition, our charter prohibits, with certain limited exceptions, direct
or constructive ownership of shares of our capital stock representing more than
9.8% of the combined total value of the outstanding shares of our capital stock
by any person (the "Ownership Limit").  Our Board of Directors may exempt a
stockholder from the Ownership Limit if, prior to the exemption, our Board of
Directors receives all information it deems necessary to determine or ensure our
status as a REIT. </P>

<P>The constructive ownership rules are complex and may cause shares of our
common stock owned directly or constructively by a group of related individuals
or entities to be constructively owned by one individual or entity.  A transfer
of shares to a person who, as a result of the transfer, violates the Ownership
Limit, may be void or may be deemed to be made to a trust, for the benefit of
one or more qualified charitable organizations designated by us.  In that case,
the intended transferee will have only a right to share, to the extent of the
transferee's original purchase price for such shares, in proceeds from the
trust's sale of those shares. </P>

<U><STRONG><P>In Addition to the Ownership Limit, Certain Provisions of Our
Charter and Bylaws and Our Stockholder Rights Plan May Delay or Prevent
Transactions That May Be Deemed to Be Desirable to Our Stockholders</P>
</U></STRONG>

<P>As authorized by Maryland law, our charter allows our Board of
Directors to cause us to issue additional authorized but unissued shares of our
common stock or preferred stock and to classify or reclassify unissued shares of
common or preferred stock without any stockholder approval.  Our Board of
Directors could establish a series of preferred stock that could delay, defer or
prevent a transaction that might involve a premium price for our common stock or
for other reasons be desired by our common stockholders or that have a dividend
preference which may adversely affect our ability to pay dividends on our common
stock.   </P>

<P>Our charter permits the removal of a director only upon a two-thirds vote of
the votes entitled to be cast generally in the election of directors and our
bylaws require advance notice of a stockholder's intention to nominate directors
or to present business for consideration by stockholders at an annual meeting of
our stockholders.  Our charter and bylaws also contain other provisions that may
delay, defer or prevent a transaction or change in control that involves a
premium price for our common stock or that for other reasons may be desired by
our stockholders. </P>
<DL>
<DT>&#9;Under our Stockholder Rights Plan, if a stockholder acquires beneficial
ownership of 15% or more of our common stock, other stockholders would become
entitled to purchase our common stock at half the market price, which would
likely result in substantial dilution to the 15% or greater stockholder.  This
may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control or other
transaction that might involve a premium price for our common stock or for other
reasons desired by our common stockholders.</DT>

<U><STRONG><P>Our Insurance May Not Adequately Cover All Potential Losses</P>
</U></STRONG>

<P>If we experience a loss at any of our properties that is not
covered by insurance or that exceeds our insurance policy limits, we could lose
the capital invested in the affected property and, possibly, future revenues
from that property. In addition, we could continue to be obligated on any
mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the affected properties.
We carry comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage and rental loss
insurance with respect to our properties.  We have obtained earthquake insurance
for all of our properties because many of them are located in the vicinity of
active earthquake faults.  We also carry environmental remediation insurance and
have title insurance policies on all of our properties.  We obtain our title
insurance policies when we acquire the property, with each policy covering an
amount equal to the initial purchase price of each property. Accordingly, any of
our title insurance policies may be in an amount less than the current value of
the related property. </P>

<P>We believe that our insurance policy specifications, insured limits and
deductibles are consistent with or superior to those customarily carried for
similar properties.  Our tenants are also required to maintain comprehensive
insurance, including liability and casualty insurance, that is customarily
obtained for similar properties. There are, however, certain types of losses
that we and our tenants do not generally insure against because they are
uninsurable or because it is not economical to insure against them.  In the
current market, there have recently been substantial increases in the premium
cost of property and liability insurance. The availability of coverage against
certain types of losses, such as from terrorism or toxic mold, has become more
limited and, when available, is at a significantly higher premium cost. We
cannot predict whether insurance coverage against terrorism or toxic mold will
remain available for our properties because insurance companies may no longer
offer coverage against such losses or, if offered, such coverage may become
prohibitively expensive.  Most, but not all, of our properties are low-rise

</U></STRONG>

<P>Federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations may
require us, as a current or prior owner or operator of real estate, to
investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products
released at or from any of our properties.  The cost of investigating and
cleaning up contamination could be substantial and could exceed the amount of
any environmental remediation insurance coverage available to us.  In addition,
the presence of contamination, or the failure to properly clean it up, may
adversely affect our ability to lease or sell an affected property, or to borrow
funds using that property as collateral. </P>

<P>Under environmental laws and regulations, we may have to pay governmental
entities or third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean-up
costs incurred by those parties relating to contaminated properties regardless
of whether we knew of or caused the contamination.  Even if more than one party
may have been responsible for the contamination, we may be held responsible for
all of the clean-up costs.  In addition, third parties may sue us for damages
and costs resulting from environmental contamination or jointly responsible
parties may contest their responsibility or be financially unable to pay their
share of such costs.</P>

<P>Environmental laws also govern the presence, maintenance and removal of
asbestos-containing materials.  These laws may impose fines and penalties on us
for the release of asbestos-containing materials and may allow third parties to
seek recovery from us for personal injury from exposure to asbestos fibers.  We
have detected asbestos-containing materials at some of our properties, but we do
not expect that it will result in material environmental costs or liabilities to
us. </P>

<P>Environmental laws and regulations also require the removal or upgrading of
certain underground storage tanks and regulate: </P>


<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>the discharge of storm water, wastewater and any water
pollutants.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>the emission of air pollutants.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>the generation, management and disposal of hazardous or toxic
chemicals, substances or wastes.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>workplace health and safety. </LI></BLOCKQUOTE></UL>

<P>Many of our tenants routinely handle hazardous substances and wastes as part
of their operations at our properties.  Environmental laws and regulations
subject our tenants, and potentially us, to liability resulting from these
activities.  Environmental liabilities could also affect a tenant's ability to
make rental payments to us.  We require our tenants to comply with these
environmental laws and regulations and to indemnify us for any related
liabilities. </P>

<P>Independent environmental consultants have conducted Phase I or similar
environmental assessments at all of our properties.  We intend to use
consultants to conduct similar environmental assessments on our future
acquisitions.  This type of assessment generally includes a site inspection,
interviews and a public records review, but no subsurface sampling.  These
assessments and certain additional investigations of our properties have not to
date revealed any environmental liability that we believe would have a material
adverse effect on our business or results of operations. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The additional investigations included, as appropriate: </P>

an award of damages to private litigants. </P>

<P>A number of additional federal, state and local laws and regulations exist
regarding access by disabled persons.  These regulations may require
modifications to our properties or may affect future renovations.  This may
limit the overall returns on our investments. </P>

<P>We believe that our properties are substantially in compliance with the
present requirements of the Americans With Disabilities Act and similar laws.
</P>

<U><STRONG><P>We May Incur Significant Costs If We Fail to Comply With Laws or
If Laws Change</P>
</U></STRONG>

<P>Our properties are subject to many federal, state and local
regulatory requirements and to state and local fire and life-safety
requirements.  If we do not comply with all of these requirements, we may have
to pay fines to governmental authorities or damage awards to private litigants.
We believe that our properties are currently in compliance with all of these
regulatory requirements.  We do not know whether these requirements will change
or whether new requirements will be imposed.  Changes in these regulatory
requirements could require us to make significant unanticipated expenditures.
These expenditures could have an adverse effect on us and our ability to make
distributions to stockholders. </P>

<U><STRONG><P>The Loss of Services of Any of Our Executive Officers Could
Adversely Affect Us</P>
</U></STRONG>

<P>We depend upon the services of relatively few executive
officers.  The loss of services of any one of them may adversely affect our
business, financial condition and prospects.  We use the extensive personal and
business relationships that members of our management have developed over time
with owners of life science facilities and with major life science industry
tenants.  We have employment agreements with all of our executive officers, but
cannot assure you that they will remain employed with us. </P>

<U><STRONG>
<P>We May Change Our Business Policies Without Stockholder Approval</P>
</U></STRONG><P>Our Board of Directors determines all of our material business
policies, with management's input, including those related to our: </P>


<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>status as a REIT.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>incurrence of debt and debt management
activities.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>acquisition and selective development
activities.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>stockholder distributions.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>other policies, as appropriate. </LI></BLOCKQUOTE></UL>


<P>Our Board of Directors may amend or revise these policies at any time without
a vote of our stockholders. A change in these policies could adversely affect
our business and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. </P>
<U><STRONG><P>We Could Become Highly Leveraged and Our Debt Service Obligations
Could Increase</P>
</U></STRONG>

<P>Our organizational documents do not limit the amount of debt
that we may incur.  Therefore, we could become highly leveraged.  This would
result in an increase in our debt service obligations that could adversely
affect our cash flow and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.
</P>

<P>We have adopted a policy of incurring debt only if upon such incurrence our
debt to total market capitalization ratio would not exceed 57.5%.  Our total
market capitalization is the market value of our capital stock, including
interests exchangeable for shares of capital stock, plus total debt.  Our Board
of Directors could, however, change or eliminate this policy at any time.
Higher leverage could also increase the risk of default on our debt obligations.
</P>

<U><STRONG><P>Our Distributions to Stockholders May Decline at Any Time</P>
</U></STRONG>

<P>We may not continue our current level of distributions to
stockholders. Our Board of Directors will determine future distributions based
on a number of factors, including: </P>


<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>our amount of cash available for distribution.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>our financial condition.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>any decision by our Board of Directors to reinvest funds rather
than to distribute such funds.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>our capital expenditures.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>the annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions
of the Internal Revenue Code.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant.
</LI></BLOCKQUOTE></UL>


<U><STRONG><P>Possible Future Sales of Shares of Our Common Stock Could
Adversely Affect Its Market Price</P>
</U></STRONG>

<P>We cannot predict the effect, if any, of future sales of shares
of our common stock on the market price of our common stock from time to time.
Sales of substantial amounts of capital stock (including common stock issued
upon the exercise of stock options), or the perception that such sales may
occur, could adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock.
</P>

<P>We have reserved for issuance to our officers, directors and employees
pursuant to our Amended and Restated 1997 Stock Award and Incentive Plan that
number of shares of our common stock that equals 12% of the total number of
shares outstanding at any time, provided that in no event may the number of
shares of our common stock available for issuance under the plan exceed
3,000,000 shares at any time.</P>

<P>As of December 31, 2003, options to purchase 809,583 shares of our common
stock were outstanding, of which options to purchase 533,420 shares of our
common stock were exercisable.  We have filed a registration statement with
respect to the issuance of shares of our common stock pursuant to grants under
our equity incentive plan.  In addition, any shares issued under our equity
incentive plan will be available for sale in the public market from time to time
without restriction by persons who are not our "affiliates" (as defined in Rule
144 adopted under the Securities Act of 1933).  Affiliates will be able to sell
shares of our common stock pursuant to exemptions from registration requirements
or upon registration. </P>

<U><P><b>External Factors May Adversely Impact the Valuation of Investments</P></b>
</U>

<P>&#9;We hold equity investments in certain publicly-traded companies and
privately held entities primarily involved in the life science industry.  The
valuation of these investments is affected by many external factors beyond our
control, including, but not limited to, market prices, market conditions,
prospects for favorable or unfavorable clinical trial results, new product
initiatives and new collaborative agreements.  Unfavorable developments with
respect to any of these factors may have an adverse impact on the valuation of
our investments.</P>

<I><P>General.</P>
</I></STRONG><P>Our properties range in size from approximately 15,000 to
248,000 square feet, are built to accommodate single or multiple tenants and are
generally one or two story concrete tilt-up, block and/or steel frame
structures. The exteriors typically resemble traditional suburban office
properties, but interior infrastructures are designed to accommodate the needs
of life science industry tenants. These improvements typically are generic to
life science industry tenants rather than being specific to a particular tenant.
As a result, we believe that the improvements have long-term value and utility
and are usable by a wide range of life science industry tenants. Generic
infrastructure improvements include: </P>

<P>We own fee simple title in each of our properties, except with respect to:
</P>


<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>three properties in the San Francisco Bay area (Harbor Bay
Parkway #2, Harbor Bay Parkway #3 and Harbor Bay Parkway #4), in which we own a
commercial condominium interest, together with an undivided interest in the
common areas of the project of which the property is a part;
and</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>the properties at Garcia Avenue &amp; Bayshore Parkway, Hanover
Street, Alexander Road, Charlestown Navy Yard, Virginia Manor Road and Porter
Drive, in which we own ground leasehold interests. </LI></BLOCKQUOTE></UL>

<P>As of December 31, 2003, we had 208 leases with a total of 179 tenants, and
50 of our properties were single-tenant properties. Leases in our multi-tenant
buildings typically have terms of three to seven years, while the single-tenant
building leases typically have initial terms of 10 to 20 years. As of December
31, 2003: </P>


<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>approximately 88% of our leases (on a square footage basis) were
triple net leases, requiring tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes
and insurance, common area and other operating expenses (including increases
thereto) in addition to base rent, and, in addition to our triple net leases,
approximately 7% of our leases (on a square footage basis) required the tenants
to pay a majority of operating expenses;</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>approximately 93% of our leases (on a square footage basis)
contained effective annual rent escalations that are either fixed (generally
ranging from 3% to 3.5%) or indexed based on a consumer price index or other
index; and</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>approximately 91% of our leases (on a square footage basis)
provided for the recapture of certain capital expenditures (such as HVAC systems
maintenance and/or replacement, roof replacement and parking lot resurfacing),
which we believe would otherwise typically be borne by the landlord in
traditional office leases. </LI></BLOCKQUOTE></UL>


<P>Our leases also typically give us the right to review and approve tenant
alterations to the property. Generally, tenant-installed improvements to the
facilities remain our property after termination of the lease at our election.
However, we are permitted under the terms of most of our leases to require that
the tenant remove the improvements and restore the premises to their original
condition. </P>

number of factors, including actual cash available for distribution, our
financial condition and capital requirements, the annual distribution
requirements under the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and such
other factors as our Board of Directors deems relevant. To maintain our
qualification as a REIT, we must make annual distributions to stockholders of at
least 90% of our taxable income for the current taxable year, determined without
regard to deductions for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gains.
Under certain circumstances, we may be required to make distributions in excess
of cash flow available for distributions to meet these distribution
requirements. In such a case, we may borrow funds or may raise funds through the
issuance of additional debt or equity capital. We cannot assure you that we will
make any future distributions. </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>GAAP basis accounting for real estate assets utilizes historical
cost accounting and assumes real estate values diminish over time.  In an effort
to overcome the miscorrelation between real estate values and historical cost
accounting for real estate assets, the Board of Governors of the National
Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") established the
measurement tool of funds from operations ("FFO").  Since its introduction, FFO
has become a widely used non-GAAP financial measure by REITs.  We believe that
FFO is helpful to investors as an additional measure of the performance of an
equity REIT.  We compute FFO in accordance with standards established by the
Board of Governors of NAREIT in its April 2002 White Paper (the "White Paper")
and related implementation guidance, which may differ from the methodology for
calculating FFO utilized by other equity REITs, and, accordingly, may not be
comparable to such other REITs.  In 2003, NAREIT issued guidance which modifies
the calculation of FFO for both past and future periods.  In accordance with
NAREIT's revised guidance, we now include losses from early extinguishment of
debt and real estate impairment charges in our calculation of FFO.  As such, the
reported amounts of FFO for the year ended December 31, 2002 have been modified
from those previously reported.  The White Paper defines FFO as net income
(loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from
sales, plus real estate depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for
unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.  While FFO is a relevant and
widely used measure of operating performance for REITs, it should not be
considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP)
as an indication of financial performance, or to cash flows from operating
activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity,
nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our
ability to make distributions.  We believe that net income is the most directly
comparable GAAP financial measure to FFO.  For a more detailed discussion of
FFO, see "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations - Funds from Operations."</LI></BLOCKQUOTE></OL>

Condition and Results of Operations</P>
</STRONG>
<P>The terms "we", "our", "ours" and "us" as used in this Form 10-K
refer to Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. and its subsidiaries.  The
following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated
financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
</P>

<STRONG><P>Overview</P>
</STRONG>

<P>We are a publicly-traded real estate operating company focused
principally on the ownership, operation, management, acquisition, expansion and
selective redevelopment and development of high quality, strategically located
properties containing a combination of office and laboratory space leased
principally to tenants in the life science industry.  We refer to these
properties as "life science facilities".</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 2003, we: </P>


<blockquote><LI>Acquired four properties with an aggregate of
approximately 267,000 rentable square feet.</LI></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>Expanded our unsecured line of credit from $425 million to $440
million and extended its term to November 2006, which may be further extended at
our sole option for an additional one-year period.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>Obtained an unsecured term loan for $150 million that is due
November 2008.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>Sold three properties with an aggregate of approximately 289,000
rentable square feet.  </LI></BLOCKQUOTE></UL>


<P>Our primary source of revenue is rental income and tenant recoveries from
leases at the properties we own.  Of the 89 properties we owned as of December
31, 2003, four were acquired in 1994, nine in 1996, nine in 1997, 27 in 1998,
six in 1999, 11 in 2000, five in 2001, four in 2002 and four in 2003. In
addition, we completed the development of one property in 1999, five properties
in 2000 (together with the 11 properties acquired in 2000, the "2000
Properties"), two properties in 2001 (together with the five properties acquired
in 2001, the "2001 Properties") and two properties in 2002 (together with the
four properties acquired in 2002, the "2002 Properties").  As a result of these
acquisition and development activities, as well as our ongoing leasing and
redevelopment activities, there have been significant increases in total
revenues and expenses, including significant increases in total revenues and
expenses for 2003 as compared to 2002, and for 2002 as compared to 2001. </P>

<B><P>Critical Accounting Policies</P>
<P>&#9;</B>Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of
operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States ("GAAP").  Our significant accounting policies are described in
the notes to our consolidated financial statements.  The preparation of these
financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates,
judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses.  We base these estimates, judgments and
assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we
believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.  Actual results may differ
from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.</P>

<I><P>REIT Compliance</P>
</I>

<P>We have elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ("REIT")
under the Internal Revenue Code.  Qualification as a REIT involves the
application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue
Code to our operations and financial results and the determination of various
factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control.  We believe
that our current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and
regulations promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code to enable us to qualify,
and continue to qualify, as a REIT.  However, it is possible that we have been
organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow us to qualify as a
REIT, or that our future operations could cause us to fail to qualify.</P>
<P>If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, then we will be required
to pay federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on
our taxable income at regular corporate rates.  If we lose our REIT status, then
our net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders would
be significantly reduced for each of the years involved and we would no longer
be required to make distributions to our stockholders. </P>

<I><P>Rental Properties and Properties Under Development</P>
</I>

<P>In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141,
"Business Combinations" ("SFAS 141"), we perform the following procedures when
making an allocation of the purchase price of real estate: 1) estimate the value
of the real estate as of the acquisition date on an "as if vacant" basis, 2)
allocate the "as if vacant" value among land, land improvements, buildings,
building improvements, tenant improvements and equipment, 3) calculate the value
of the intangibles as the difference between the "as if vacant" value and the
purchase price,  and 4) allocate the intangible value to above, below and at
market leases, origination costs associated with in-place leases, tenant
relationships and other intangible assets.</P>

<P>The values allocated to land improvements, buildings, building improvements,
tenant improvements and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis using
an estimated life of 20 years for land improvements, 40 years for buildings and
building improvements, the respective lease term for tenant improvements and the
estimated useful life of equipment.  The values of above and below market leases
are amortized over the life of the related lease and recorded as either an
increase (for below market leases) or a decrease (for above market leases) to
rental income.  The values of at-market leases and origination costs are
classified as leasing costs, included in other assets on our balance sheets and
amortized over the remaining life of the lease.  The values of other intangible
assets are amortized over the estimated useful life.</P>

<P>Rental properties and properties under development are individually evaluated
for impairment when conditions exist which may indicate that it is probable
that the sum of expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than its
carrying amount.  Upon determination that an impairment has occurred, a write-
down is recorded to reduce the carrying amount of the property to its estimated
fair value. </P>

<I><P>Capitalization of Costs</P>
<P>&#9;<A NAME="OLE_LINK4"></I>We capitalize direct construction and development
costs, including predevelopment costs, interest, property taxes, insurance and
indirect project costs, including payroll and other costs directly associated
with the acquisition, development or construction of a project.  Payroll costs
not related to the construction, development or redevelopment of a project, or acquisition of a
property that will be classified as operating at the date of acquisition, are
expensed as incurred.  Costs incurred after a project is substantially complete
and ready for its intended use are expensed as incurred.  Costs previously
capitalized related to abandoned acquisition or development opportunities are
written-off.  Should development activity cease, a portion of interest, property
taxes, insurance and certain costs would no longer be eligible for
capitalization, and would be expensed as incurred.</P>

<P></A>&#9;We also capitalize costs directly related and essential to our
leasing activities, including broker fees and certain costs related to our
leasing personnel.  These costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the
terms of the related leases.  Costs previously capitalized related to
unsuccessful leasing opportunities are written-off. </P>
<I><P>Accounting of Investments</P>
</I>

<P>&#9;We hold equity investments in certain publicly-traded companies and
privately held entities primarily involved in the life science industry.  All of
our investments in publicly-traded companies are considered "available for sale"
under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115,
"Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities" ("SFAS 115"),
and are recorded at fair value.  Fair value has been determined by the closing
trading price at the balance sheet date, with unrealized gains and losses shown
as a separate component of stockholders' equity.  The classification of
investments under SFAS 115 is determined at the time each investment is made,
and such determination is reevaluated at each balance sheet date.  The cost of
investments sold is determined by the specific identification method, with
realized gains and losses included in other income.</P>

<P>Investments in privately held entities are generally accounted for under the
cost method because we do not influence any operating or financial policies of
the entities in which we invest.  Certain investments are accounted for under
the equity method of accounting under the provisions of Accounting Principles
Board Opinion No. 18, "The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common
Stock" ("APB 18") and Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Topic D-46,
"Accounting for Limited Partnership Investments".  Pursuant to APB 18, the
equity method of accounting should be used when an investor has "the ability to
exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of an
investee even though the investor holds 50% or less of the voting stock".  EITF-
D-46 further clarifies the Securities and Exchange Commission's position on the
accounting for limited partnerships and provides that the equity method of
accounting be used unless the investor's interest "is so minor that the limited
partner may have virtually no influence over partnership operating and financial
policies".  Under the equity method of accounting, we record our investment
initially at cost and adjust the carrying amount of the investment to recognize
our share of the earnings or losses of the investee subsequent to the date of
our investment.  </P>

<P>For all of our investments, if a decline in the fair value of an investment
below its carrying value is determined to be other than temporary, such
investment is written down to its estimated fair value with a non-cash charge to
current earnings. </P>

<P>The factors that we consider in making these assessments include,
but are not limited to, market prices, market conditions, prospects for
favorable or unfavorable clinical trial results, new product initiatives and new
collaborative agreements.</P>

<I><P>Interest Rate Swap Agreements</P>

<P>&#9;</I>We utilize interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of our
exposure to variable interest rates associated with our unsecured line of credit
and unsecured term loan.  These agreements involve an exchange of fixed and
floating interest payments without the exchange of the underlying principal
amount.  Interest received under all of our swap agreements is based on the one-
month LIBOR rate.  The net difference between the interest paid and the interest
received is reflected as an adjustment to interest expense. </P>
<P>&#9;We reflect our interest rate swap agreements on the balance sheet at
their estimated fair values.  We use a variety of methods and assumptions based
on market conditions and risks existing at each balance sheet date to determine
the fair values of our interest rate swap agreements.  These methods of
assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value, and such value
may never be realized.</P>

<P>&#9;All of our interest rate swap agreements meet the criteria to be deemed
"highly effective" under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 in
reducing our exposure to variable interest rates.  Accordingly, we have
categorized these instruments as cash flow hedges.  While we intend to continue
to meet the conditions for such hedge accounting, if hedges did not qualify as
"highly effective", the changes in the fair value of the derivatives used as
hedges would be reflected in earnings.</P>

<P>&#9;We do not believe we are exposed to more than a nominal amount of credit
risk in our interest rate swap agreements as our counterparties are established,
well-capitalized financial institutions.</P>

<I><P>Recognition of Rental Income</P>
</I>

<P>Rental income from leases with scheduled rent increases, free rent and
other rent adjustments are recognized on a straight-line basis over the
respective lease terms.  We maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may
result from the inability of our tenants to make required payments.  If a tenant
fails to make contractual payments beyond any allowance, we may recognize
additional bad debt expense in future periods equal to the amount of unpaid rent
and deferred rent.</P>

<I><P>Discontinued Operations</P>

<P>&#9;</I>The determination of whether a property qualifies as an asset "held
for sale" and should be classified as discontinued operations requires an
evaluation of certain criteria, some of which require the use of judgment.  A
property is classified as "held for sale" when all of the following criteria for
a plan of sale have been met: 1) management, having the authority to approve the
action, commits to a plan to sell the property, 2) the property is available for
immediate sale in its present condition, subject only to the terms that are
usual and customary, 3) an active program to locate a buyer, and other actions
required to complete the plan to sell, have been initiated, 4) the sale of the
property is probable and is expected to be completed within one year, 5) the
property is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in
relation to its current fair value, and 6) actions necessary to complete the
plan of sale indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan
will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. When all of these criteria have
been met, the property is classified as "held for sale" and its operations are
classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of income.
When a property is designated as "held for sale", amounts for all prior periods
presented are reclassified from continuing operations to discontinued
operations.  A loss is recognized for any initial adjustment of the asset's
carrying amount to fair value less costs to sell in the period the asset
qualifies as "held for sale".  Depreciation of assets is discontinued commencing
on the date they are designated as "held for sale".  </P>

<STRONG><P>Results of Operations</P>

<I><P>Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2003 to the Year Ended December
31, 2002</P>
</I></STRONG>

<P>Rental revenue increased by $14.7 million, or 13%, to $126.4
million for 2003 compared to $111.7 million for 2002.  The increase resulted
primarily from the 2002 Properties being owned for a full year and the addition
of the 2003 Properties.  Rental revenue from properties operating for a full
year during 2003 and 2002 (the "2003 Same Properties") increased by $1.7
million, or 2.1%, due to increases in rental rates and offset by a slight
decrease in occupancy.  The average occupancy level of the 2003 Same Properties
was 96.7% as of December 31, 2003, compared to 97.2% as of December 31, 2002.
</P>

<P>Tenant recoveries increased by $3.1 million, or 11%, to $32.1 million for
2003 compared to $29.0 million for 2002.  The increase resulted primarily from
the 2002 Properties being owned for a full year and the addition of the 2003
Properties.  Tenant recoveries for the 2003 Same Properties increased by
$659,000, or 2.9%, primarily due to increases in certain recoverable operating
expenses. </P>

<P>Other income increased by $511,000, or 33%, to $2.1 million for 2003 compared
to $1.6 million for 2002, primarily due to an increase in realized gains on
investments and from a general increase in miscellaneous sources of income.</P>

<P>Rental operating expenses increased by $3.7 million, or 13%, to $32.8 million
for 2003 compared to $29.1 million for 2002.  The increase resulted primarily
from the 2002 Properties being owned for a full year and the addition of the
2003 Properties.  Operating expenses for the 2003 Same Properties increased by
$871,000, or 4.1%, primarily due to an increase in property insurance and
property taxes (substantially all of which are recoverable from our tenants
through tenant recoveries).</P>

<P>General and administrative expenses increased by $775,000, or 6%, to $14.2
million for 2003 compared to $13.4 million for 2002, mainly due to general
increases in administrative costs, primarily payroll and related expenses.</P>

<P>Interest expense increased by $1.4 million, or 6%, to $26.4 million for 2003
compared to $25.0 million for 2002.  The increase resulted primarily from an
increase in indebtedness on our unsecured line of credit, unsecured term loan
and secured notes payable.  These borrowings were utilized to finance the
acquisition of the 2002 and 2003 Properties and the development and
redevelopment of properties.  The increase in interest expense was partially
offset by a decrease in the floating interest rate on our unsecured line of
credit and unsecured term loan.  The weighted average effective interest rate on
our borrowings (not including the effect of swap agreements) decreased from
3.07% as of December 31, 2002 to 2.64% as of December 31, 2003.  We have entered
into certain swap agreements to hedge a portion of exposure to variable interest
rates with our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan (see "Liquidity
and Capital Resources - Unsecured Line of Credit and Unsecured Term Loan").</P>

<P>Depreciation and amortization increased by $5.7 million, or 17%, to $38.6
million for 2003 compared to $32.9 million for 2002.  The increase resulted
primarily from depreciation associated with the 2002 Properties being owned for
a full year and the addition of the 2003 Properties. </P>

<P>Income from discontinued operations of $11.1 million for 2003 reflects the
results of operations of one property that was designated as "held for sale" as
of December 31, 2003 and three properties that were sold during 2003.  In the
fourth quarter of 2003, we sold one property in the Suburban Washington D.C.
market.  In the third quarter of 2003, we sold one property in the Eastern
Massachusetts market.  In the first quarter of 2003, we sold one property in the
San Francisco Bay market.  In connection with these sales, we recorded a net
gain of approximately $8.3 million during 2003.</P>

<I><STRONG><P>Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2002 to the Year Ended
December 31, 2001</P>
</I></STRONG>

<P>Rental revenue increased by $18.1 million, or 19%, to $111.7
million for 2002 compared to $93.6 million for 2001.  The increase resulted
primarily from the 2001 Properties being owned for a full year and the addition
of the 2002 Properties.  Rental revenue from properties operating for a full
year during 2002 and 2001 (the "2002 Same Properties") increased by $2.7
million, or 3.7%, due to increases in rental rates and offset by a slight
decrease in occupancy.  The average occupancy level of the 2002 Same Properties
was 97.6% as of December 31, 2002, compared to 98.2% as of December 31, 2001.
</P>

<P>Tenant recoveries increased by $4.9 million, or 20%, to $29.0 million for
2002 compared to $24.1 million for 2001.  The increase resulted primarily from
the 2001 Properties being owned for a full year and the addition of the 2002
Properties.  Tenant recoveries for the 2002 Same Properties increased by
$915,000, or 4.6%, generally due to an increase in certain recoverable operating
expenses. </P>

<P>Other income decreased by $1.6 million, or 50%, to $1.6 million for 2002
compared to $3.1 million for 2001, primarily due to a decrease in interest
income resulting from a decline in interest rates, the repayment of a $6 million
secured note receivable in 2002 and a decrease in realized gains on
investments.</P>

<P>Rental operating expenses increased by $4.5 million, or 18%, to $29.1 million
for 2002 compared to $24.7 million for 2001.  The increase resulted primarily
from the 2001 Properties being owned for a full year and the addition of the
2002 Properties.  Operating expenses for the 2002 Same Properties increased by
$1.2 million, or 6.4%, primarily due to an increase in property insurance and
property taxes (substantially all of which are recoverable from our tenants
through tenant recoveries).</P>

<P>General and administrative expenses increased by $1.7 million, or 15%, to
$13.4 million for 2002 compared to $11.7 million for 2001 due to the continued
increase in the scope of our operations.  From January 1, 2001 to December 31,
2002, we expanded our scope of operations to include an additional 13 properties
containing approximately 880,000 rentable square feet for a total of 89
properties located in nine states with approximately 5.7 million rentable square
feet as of December 31, 2002.  To assist in managing this increase in the size
of the operating portfolio, we added personnel and offices in certain of the
markets where we have properties.</P>

<P>Interest expense decreased by $2.7 million, or 10%, to $25.0 million for 2002
compared to $27.7 million for 2001.  The decrease resulted primarily from a
reduction in the floating interest rate on our unsecured line of credit.  The
weighted average interest rate on our borrowings (not including the effect of
swap agreements) decreased from 3.92% as of December 31, 2001 to 3.07% as of
December 31, 2002.  We have entered into certain swap agreements to hedge a
portion of our borrowings at variable interest rates (see "Liquidity and Capital
Resources - Unsecured Line of Credit and Unsecured Term Loan").  The decrease in
interest expense caused by this factor was partially offset by an increase in
indebtedness incurred to acquire the 2001 and 2002 Properties and indebtedness
incurred to finance the development and redevelopment of properties.</P>

<P>Depreciation and amortization increased by $3.6 million, or 12%, to $32.9
million for 2002 compared to $29.3 million for 2001.  The increase resulted
primarily from depreciation associated with the 2001 Properties being owned for
a full year and the addition of the 2002 Properties. </P>

<P>During 2002, we recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $2.5 million
associated with a decline in the value of certain investments below their
carrying value determined to be other than temporary.  </P>

<P>Loss on early extinguishment of debt of $1.0 million was incurred as the
result of the early retirement of a $7.2 million secured loan in connection with
a refinancing of an asset.  This loss is related to prepayment penalties and the
write-off of loan costs.  In 2002, this loss was classified as an extraordinary
item as previously required under SFAS 4, "Reporting Gains and Losses from
Extinguishment of Debt".  In 2003, pursuant to SFAS 145, "Rescission of FASB
Statement No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical
Corrections", we reclassified the 2002 loss on early extinguishment of debt to
continuing operations.</P>

<P>Income from discontinued operations decreased by $934,000, or 35%, to $1.8
million for 2002 compared to $2.7 million for 2001.  Income from discontinued
operations reflects the results of operations of four properties that have been
designated as "held for sale".  In connection with these prospective sales, we
recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $1,150,000 related to a property in the
San Francisco Bay market which cannot be redeveloped pursuant to its original
strategic objectives.  This charge has been included in income from discontinued
operations for 2002.</P>

<P>Liquidity and Capital Resources</P>

<I><P>Cash Flows</P>
</I></STRONG>

<P>Net cash provided by operating activities for 2003 increased by
$7.8 million to $74.8 million compared to $67.1 million for 2002.  The increase
resulted primarily from increases in cash flows from our portfolio of operating
properties, partially offset by the net gain on sales of property.</P>

<P>Net cash used in investing activities decreased by $88.0 million to $139.8
million for 2003 compared to $227.8 million for 2002.  This decrease was
primarily due to proceeds from the sales of rental properties and a lower level
of property acquisitions in 2003.</P>

<P>Net cash provided by financing activities decreased by $96.0 million to $66.2
million for 2003 compared to $162.2 million for 2002.  Cash provided by
financing activities decreased primarily due to the net proceeds from our common
stock and preferred stock offerings in 2002, partially offset by net proceeds
from our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan and from secured notes
payable. </P>

<I><FONT SIZE=3><STRONG><P>Unsecured Line of Credit and Unsecured Term
Loan</P>
</I></STRONG>

<P>We have an unsecured line of credit that provides for borrowings
of up to $440 million.  Borrowings under our unsecured line of credit, as
amended, bear interest at a floating rate based on our election of either a
LIBOR-based rate or the higher of the bank's reference rate and the Federal
Funds rate, plus 0.5%.  For each LIBOR-based advance, we must elect a LIBOR
period of one, two, three or six months.</P>

<P>Our unsecured line of credit contains financial covenants, including, among
other things, maintenance of minimum net worth, a total liabilities to gross
asset value ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio.  In addition, the terms of
the unsecured line of credit restrict, among other things, certain investments,
indebtedness, distributions and mergers.  The unsecured line of credit expires
November 2006 and may be extended at our sole option for an additional one-year
period.  As of December 31, 2003, borrowings outstanding on the unsecured line
of credit carried a weighted average interest rate of 2.65%.</P>

<P>In November 2003, we obtained a $150 million unsecured term loan which bears
interest at a floating rate based on our election of either a LIBOR based rate
or the higher of the bank's reference rate and the Federal Funds rate, plus
0.5%.  For each LIBOR based advance, we must elect to fix for a period of one,
two, three or six months.  The unsecured term loan contains financial covenants
substantially similar to those in our unsecured line of credit.  The unsecured
term loan expires in November 2008.  As of December 31, 2003, the unsecured term
loan carried a weighted average interest rate of 2.62%.  </P>

<P>Aggregate borrowings under the unsecured line of credit and unsecured term
loan may be limited to an amount based on the net operating income derived from
a pool of unencumbered properties.  Accordingly, as we acquire or complete the
development or redevelopment of additional unencumbered properties, aggregate
borrowings available under the unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan
will increase up to a maximum of $590 million.  Under these provisions, as of
December 31, 2003, aggregate borrowings under our unsecured line of credit and
unsecured term loan were limited to $479 million.</P>

<P>We utilize interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of our exposure
to variable interest rates associated with our unsecured line of credit and
unsecured term loan.  These agreements involve an exchange of fixed and floating
interest payments without the exchange of the underlying principal amount (the
"notional amount").  Interest received under all of our swap agreements is based
on the one-month LIBOR rate.  The net difference between the interest paid and
the interest received is reflected as an adjustment to interest expense.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>We do not believe we are exposed to more than a nominal amount of credit risk
in our interest rate swap agreements as our counterparties are established,
well-capitalized financial institutions.  In addition, we have entered into
master derivative agreements with each counterparty.  These master derivative
agreements (all of which are on the standard International Swaps &amp;
Derivatives Association, Inc. form) define certain terms between us and each
counterparty to address and minimize certain risks associated with our swap
agreements, including a default by a counterparty.</P>

<P>As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, our interest rate swap agreements have been
reported in the accompanying balance sheets at their fair value as other
liabilities of approximately $6.3 million and $9.0 million, respectively.  The
offsetting adjustments were reflected as deferred losses in accumulated other
comprehensive income of $6.3 million and $9.0 million, respectively.  Balances
in accumulated other comprehensive income are recognized in earnings as swap
payments are made.</P>

<STRONG><P>Other Resources and Liquidity Requirements</P>
</STRONG>

<P>In January 2002, we completed a public offering of 2,300,000 shares
of our 9.10% Series B cumulative redeemable preferred stock.  The shares were
issued at a price of $25.00 per share, resulting in aggregate proceeds of
approximately $55.1 million, net of offering costs.  In February 2002, we sold
418,970 shares of our common stock.  The shares were issued at a price of $39.46
per share, resulting in aggregate proceeds of approximately $16.1 million, net
of offering costs.  In July 2002, we sold 2,000,000 shares of our common stock.
The shares were issued at a price of $41.07 per share, resulting in aggregate
proceeds of approximately $81.4 million, net of offering costs.</P>

<P>We expect to continue meeting our short-term liquidity and capital
requirements generally through our working capital and net cash provided by
operating activities.  We believe that the net cash provided by operating
activities will continue to be sufficient to enable us to make distributions
necessary to continue qualifying as a REIT.  We also believe that net cash
provided by operating activities will be sufficient to fund our recurring non-
revenue enhancing capital expenditures, tenant improvements and leasing
commissions. </P>

<P>We expect to meet certain long-term liquidity requirements, such as property
acquisitions, property development and redevelopment activities, scheduled debt
maturities, expansions and other non-recurring capital improvements, through
excess net cash provided by operating activities, long-term secured and
unsecured borrowings, including borrowings under the unsecured line of credit
and unsecured term loan and the issuance of additional debt and/or equity
securities. </P>

<STRONG><P>Exposure to Environmental Liabilities</P>
</STRONG>

<P>In connection with the acquisition of all of our properties, we have
obtained Phase I environmental assessments to ascertain the existence of any
environmental liabilities or other issues.  The Phase I environmental
assessments of our properties have not revealed any environmental liabilities
that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition
or results of operations taken as a whole, nor are we aware of any material
environmental liabilities that have occurred since the Phase I environmental
assessments were completed.  In addition, we carry a policy of pollution legal
liability insurance covering exposure to certain environmental losses at all of
our properties.</P>

</FONT><LI>Major capital expenditures consist of roof replacements and HVAC

<li>Excludes space that has undergone redevelopment before retenanting.
</LI></OL>

<FONT SIZE=3><P>Capital expenditures fluctuate in any given period due to the
nature, extent and timing of improvements required and the extent to which they
are recoverable from our tenants. Approximately 91% of our leases provide for
the recapture of certain capital expenditures (such as HVAC systems maintenance
and/or replacement, roof replacement and parking lot resurfacing).  In addition,
we maintain an active preventative maintenance program at each of our properties
to minimize capital expenditures required. </P>

<P>Tenant improvements and leasing costs also fluctuate in any given year
depending upon factors such as the timing and extent of vacancies, property age,
location and characteristics, the type of lease (renewal tenant or retenanted
space), the involvement of external leasing agents and overall competitive
market conditions. </P>

<STRONG><P>Inflation</P>
</STRONG>

<P>As of December 31, 2003, approximately 88% of our leases (on a
square footage basis) were triple net leases, requiring tenants to pay
substantially all real estate taxes and insurance, common area and other
operating expenses (including increases thereto).  In addition, approximately 7%
of our leases (on a square footage basis) require the tenants to pay a majority
of operating expenses. Approximately 93% of our leases (on a square footage
basis) contain effective annual rent escalations that are either fixed
(generally ranging from 3% to 3.5%) or indexed based on the consumer price index
or another index. Accordingly, we do not believe that our earnings or cash flow
from real estate operations are subject to any significant risk of inflation. An
increase in inflation, however, could result in an increase in the cost of our
variable rate borrowings, including our unsecured line of credit and unsecured
term loan. </P>

<STRONG><P>Funds from Operations</P>
</STRONG>

<P>GAAP basis accounting for real estate assets utilizes historical
cost accounting and assumes real estate values diminish over time.  In an effort
to overcome the miscorrelation between real estate values and historical cost
accounting for real estate assets, the Board of Governors of the National
Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") established the
measurement tool of funds from operations ("FFO").  Since its introduction, FFO
has become a widely used non-GAAP financial measure by REITs.  We believe that
FFO is helpful to investors as an additional measure of the performance of an
equity REIT.  We compute FFO in accordance with standards established by the
Board of Governors of NAREIT in its April 2002 White Paper (the "White Paper")
and related implementation guidance, which may differ from the methodology for
calculating FFO utilized by other equity REITs, and, accordingly, may not be
comparable to such other REITs.  In 2003, NAREIT issued guidance which modifies
the calculation of FFO for both past and future periods.  In accordance with
NAREIT's revised guidance, we now include losses from early extinguishment of
debt and real estate impairment charges in our calculation of FFO.  As such, the
reported amounts of FFO for the year ended December 31, 2002 have been modified
from those previously reported.  The White Paper defines FFO as net income
(loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from
sales, plus real estate depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for
unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.  While FFO is a relevant and
widely used measure of operating performance for REITs, it should not be
considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP)
as an indication of financial performance, or to cash flows from operating
activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity,
nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our
ability to make distributions. (See "Cash Flows" for information regarding these
measures of cash flow.)  We believe that net income is the most directly
comparable GAAP financial measure to FFO.  </P>

</FONT><strong><FONT SIZE=3><P><A NAME="item7a"></A>Item 7a. Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk</P>
</STRONG>

<P>Market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in
interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and equity
prices.  The primary market risk to which we believe we are exposed is interest
rate risk, which may result from many factors, including governmental monetary
and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political
considerations and other factors that are beyond our control. </P>

<P>In order to modify and manage the interest rate characteristics of our
outstanding debt and to limit the effects of interest rate risks on our
operations, we may utilize a variety of financial instruments, including
interest rate swaps, caps, floors and other interest rate exchange contracts.
The use of these types of instruments to hedge our exposure to changes in
interest rates carries additional risks, such as counter-party credit risk and
the legal enforceability of hedging contracts. </P>

<P>Our future earnings, cash flows and fair values relating to financial
instruments are primarily dependent upon prevalent market rates of interest,
such as LIBOR. However, our interest rate swap agreements are intended to reduce
the effects of interest rate changes.  Based on interest rates at, and our swap
agreements in effect on, December 31, 2003, we estimate that a 1% increase in
interest rates on our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan, after
considering the effect of our interest rate swap agreements, would decrease
annual future earnings and cash flows by approximately $1.4 million.  We further
estimate that a 1% decrease in interest rates on our unsecured line of credit
and unsecured term loan, after considering the effect of our interest rate swap
agreements in effect December 31, 2003, would increase annual future earnings
and cash flows by approximately $1.4 million.  A 1% increase in interest rates
on our secured debt and interest rate swap agreements would decrease their
aggregate fair value by approximately $15.3 million.  A 1% decrease in interest
rates on our secured debt and interest rate swap agreements would increase their
aggregate fair value by approximately $16.4 million. </P>

<P>These amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical
interest rates on our borrowing cost and our interest rate swap agreements in
effect on December 31, 2003.  These analyses do not consider the effects of the
reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an
environment.  Further, in the event of a change of such magnitude, we would
consider taking actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change. However,
due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their
possible effects, the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in our capital
structure. </P>

<P>We have exposure to equity price market risk because of our equity
investments in certain publicly-traded companies and privately held entities.
We classify investments in publicly-traded companies as available-for-sale and,
consequently, record them on our balance sheet at fair value with unrealized
gains or losses reported as a component of comprehensive income or loss.
Investments in privately held entities are generally accounted for under the
cost method because we do not influence any of the operating or financial
policies of the entities in which we invest.  For all investments, we recognize
other than temporary declines in value against earnings in the same period the
decline in value was deemed to have occurred.  In 2002, we recorded non-cash
impairment charges of $2,545,000 to write down certain investments for which we
deemed the decline in fair value to be other than temporary.  There is no
assurance that future declines in values will not have a material adverse impact
on our future results of operations.  By way of example, a 10% decrease in the
fair value of our equity investments as of December 31, 2003 would decrease
their fair value by approximately $4.7 million.</P>

Independent Auditors</P>
</FONT></STRONG><FONT SIZE=3><P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of<BR>
Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. </P>

<P>We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Alexandria
Real Estate Equities, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31,
2003 and 2002, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders'
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 2003. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in
the index at item 15(a). These financial statements and schedule are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits. </P>

<P>We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion. </P>

<P>In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Alexandria Real
Estate Equities, Inc. and subsidiaries at December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2003, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States. Also, in our opinion, the
related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects
the information set forth therein. </P>

<FONT SIZE=3><P>1. Background</P>
</STRONG>

<P>Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. is a real estate investment
trust ("REIT") formed in 1994.  We are engaged primarily in the ownership,
operation, management, acquisition, expansion and selective redevelopment and
development of properties containing a combination of office and laboratory
space.  We refer to these properties as "life science facilities."  Our life
science facilities are designed and improved for lease primarily to
pharmaceutical, biotechnology, life science product and service companies, not-
for-profit scientific research institutions, universities and related government
agencies.  As of December 31, 2003, our portfolio consisted of 89 properties in
nine states with approximately 5,669,000 rentable square feet, compared to 89
properties in nine states with approximately 5,740,000 rentable square feet as
of December 31, 2002. </P>

<STRONG><P>2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies</P>

<P>Basis of Presentation</P>
</STRONG>

<P>The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Alexandria and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated. </P>

<STRONG><P>Use of Estimates</P>
</STRONG>

<P>The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date
of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
</P>

<B><P>Reclassifications</P>
</B>
<P>Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the
current year presentation.</P>

<STRONG><P>Cash Equivalents</P>
</STRONG>

<P>We consider all highly liquid investments with original maturities
of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.</P>

<P><b>Investments</P></b>

<P><A NAME="OLE_LINK5">We hold equity investments in certain publicly-
traded companies and privately held entities primarily involved in the life
science industry. All of our investments in publicly-traded companies are
considered "available for sale" under the provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and
Equity Securities" ("SFAS 115"), and are recorded at fair value.</A>  Fair value
has been determined by the closing trading price at the balance sheet date, with
unrealized gains and losses shown as a separate component of stockholders'
equity.  The classification of investments under SFAS 115 is determined at the
time each investment is made, and such determination is reevaluated at each
balance sheet date.  The cost of investments sold is determined by the specific
identification method, with realized gains and losses included in other
income.</P>

<P><A NAME="OLE_LINK6">Investments in privately held entities are generally
accounted for under the cost method because we do not influence any operating or
financial policies of the entities in which we invest.  Certain investments are
accounted for under the equity method of accounting under the provisions of
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18, "The Equity Method of Accounting for
Investments in Common Stock" ("APB 18") and Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF")
Topic D-46, "Accounting for Limited Partnership Investments".  Pursuant to APB
18, the equity method of accounting should be used when an investor has
"the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial
policies of an investee even though the investor holds 50% or less of the voting
stock".  EITF-D-46 further clarifies the Securities and Exchange Commission's
position on the accounting for limited partnerships and provides that the equity
method of accounting be used unless the investor's interest "is so minor that
the limited partner may have virtually no influence over partnership operating
and financial policies".  Under the equity method of accounting, we record our
investment initially at cost and adjust the carrying amount of the investment to
recognize our share of the earnings or losses of the investee subsequent to the
date of our investment.</A></P>

<P><A NAME="OLE_LINK2">For all of our investments, if a decline in the fair
value of an investment below its carrying value is determined to be other than
temporary, such investment is written down to its estimated fair value with a
non-cash charge to current earnings.  </P>

<P>The factors that we consider in making these assessments include,
but are not limited to, market prices, market conditions, prospects for
favorable or unfavorable clinical trial results, new product initiatives and new
collaborative agreements.</A>  As a result of these assessments, during 2002 we
recognized aggregate non-cash impairment charges of $2,545,000 for other than
temporary declines in the fair value of investments.</P>

<STRONG><P>Rental Properties and Properties Under Development</P>
</STRONG>

<P>In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
141, "Business Combinations" ("SFAS 141"), we perform the following procedures
when making an allocation of the purchase price of real estate: 1) estimate the
value of the real estate as of the acquisition date on an "as if vacant" basis,
2) allocate the "as if vacant" value among land, land improvements, buildings,
building improvements, tenant improvements and equipment, 3) calculate the value
of the intangibles as the difference between the "as if vacant" value and the
purchase price,  and 4) allocate the intangible value to above, below and at
market leases, origination costs associated with in-place leases, tenant
relationships and other intangible assets.</P>

<P>The values allocated to land improvements, buildings, building improvements,
tenant improvements and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis using
an estimated life of 20 years for land improvements, 40 years for buildings and
building improvements, the respective lease term for tenant improvements and the
estimated useful life of equipment.  The values of above and below market leases
are amortized over the life of the related lease and recorded as either an
increase (for below market leases) or a decrease (for above market leases) to
rental income.  The values of at-market leases and origination costs are
classified as leasing costs, included in other assets on our balance sheets and
amortized over the remaining life of the lease.  The values of other intangible
assets are amortized over the estimated useful life.</P>

<P>Rental properties and properties under development are individually evaluated
for impairment when conditions exist which may indicate that it is probable
that the sum of expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than its
carrying amount.  Upon determination that an impairment has occurred, a write-
down is recorded to reduce the carrying amount of the property to its estimated
fair value. </P>

<P>We capitalize direct construction and development costs, including
predevelopment costs, interest, property taxes, insurance and indirect project
costs, including payroll and other costs directly associated with the
acquisition, development or construction of a project.  Payroll costs not
related to the construction, development or redevelopment of a project, or acquisition of a
property that will be classified as operating at the date of acquisition, are
expensed as incurred.  Costs incurred after a project is substantially complete
and ready for its intended use are expensed as incurred.  Costs previously
capitalized related to abandoned acquisition or development opportunities are
written-off.  Should development activity cease, a portion of
interest, property taxes, insurance and certain costs would no
longer be eligible for capitalization, and would be expensed as incurred.</P>

<P>As of December 31, 2003, we had one property designated as "held for sale"
under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144,
"Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets" ("SFAS 144").
During the year ended December 31, 2003, we sold three properties, two of which
were designated as "held for sale" as of December 31, 2002.  See Note 13,

<B><P>Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards</P>
</B>

<P>In May 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&quot;FASB&quot;)
issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 150, &quot;Accounting for
Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and
Equity&quot; (&quot;SFAS 150&quot;), which establishes standards for how an
issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with
characteristics of both liabilities and equity.  We adopted SFAS 150 in the
third quarter of 2003.  The adoption of SFAS 150 did not have an impact on the
accompanying financial statements.</P>

<P>In April 2003, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 149, &quot;Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities&quot; (&quot;SFAS 149&quot;), which amends and clarifies financial
accounting and reporting for derivative instruments and hedging activities under
FASB Statement No. 133, &quot;Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities&quot;.  SFAS 149, among other things, clarifies under what
circumstances a contract with an initial net investment meets the characteristic
of a derivative, clarifies when a derivative contains a financing component and
amends the definition of an &quot;underlying&quot; to conform it to language
used in FASB Interpretation No. 45, &quot;Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure
Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of
Others&quot;.  SFAS 149 is effective for contracts entered into or modified
after September 30, 2003 and for hedging relationships designated after
September 30, 2003.  The adoption of SFAS 149 did not have an impact on the
accompanying financial statements.</P>

<P>In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities", an interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin
No. 51 (&quot;FIN 46&quot;), which requires the consolidation of entities with
respect to which an enterprise absorbs a majority of the entity's expected
losses, receives a majority of the entity's expected residual returns, or both,
as a result of ownership, contractual or other financial interests in the
entity.  Currently, an entity is generally consolidated by an enterprise when it
has a controlling financial interest through ownership of a majority voting
interest in the entity. FIN 46 applies immediately to variable interest entities
created after January 31, 2003 and is generally effective December 31, 2003 for
variable interest entities acquired before February 1, 2003.  The adoption of
FIN 46 did not have an impact on the accompanying financial statements.</P>

<P>In December 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and
Disclosure" ("SFAS 148"), which addresses alternative methods of transition for
an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of accounting
for stock-based employee compensation.  Effective January 1, 2003, the Company
adopted the fair value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" ("SFAS
123"), prospectively to all employee awards granted, modified or settled after
January 1, 2003 pursuant to the transition and disclosure guidance under SFAS
148.  The cost related to stock-based employee compensation included in the
determination of net income for 2002 and 2001 is less than that which would have
been recognized if the fair value based method had been applied to all awards
since the original effective dates of SFAS 123.  See Note 11, Stock Option Plans
and Stock Grants.</P>

<P>In April 2002, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
145, "Rescission of FASB Statement No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB
Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections" ("SFAS 145"), which requires any
gain or loss on early extinguishment of debt that was classified as an
extraordinary item that does not meet certain criteria, be reclassified from
extraordinary item to continuing operations.  In accordance with SFAS 145, the
extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt recognized in 2002 was
reclassified to continuing operations in 2003.</P>

bear interest at a floating rate based on our election of either a LIBOR-based
rate or the higher of the bank's reference rate and the Federal Funds rate, plus
0.5%.  For each LIBOR-based advance, we must elect a LIBOR period of one, two,
three or six months.</P>

<P>Our unsecured line of credit contains financial covenants, including, among
other things, maintenance of minimum net worth, a total liabilities to gross
asset value ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio.  In addition, the terms of
the unsecured line of credit restrict, among other things, certain investments,
indebtedness, distributions and mergers.  The unsecured line of credit expires
November 2006 and may be extended at our sole option for an additional one-year
period.  As of December 31, 2003, borrowings outstanding on the unsecured line
of credit carried a weighted average interest rate of 2.65%.</P>

<P>In November 2003, we obtained a $150 million unsecured term loan which bears
interest at a floating rate based on our election of either a LIBOR based rate
or the higher of the bank's reference rate and the Federal Funds rate, plus
0.5%.  For each LIBOR based advance, we must elect to fix for a period of one,
two, three or six months.  The unsecured term loan contains financial covenants
substantially similar to those in our unsecured line of credit.  The unsecured
term loan expires in November 2008.  As of December 31, 2003, the unsecured term
loan carried a weighted average interest rate of 2.62%.  </P>

<P>Aggregate borrowings under the unsecured line of credit and unsecured term
loan may be limited to an amount based on the net operating income derived from
a pool of unencumbered properties.  Accordingly, as we acquire or complete the
development or redevelopment of additional unencumbered properties, aggregate
borrowings available under the unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan
will increase up to a maximum of $590 million.  Under these provisions, as of
December 31, 2003, aggregate borrowings under our unsecured line of credit and
unsecured term loan were limited to $479 million.</P>

<P>We utilize interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of our exposure
to variable interest rates associated with our unsecured line of credit and
unsecured term loan.  These agreements involve an exchange of fixed and floating
interest payments without the exchange of the underlying principal amount (the
"notional amount").  Interest received under all of our swap agreements is based
on the one-month LIBOR rate.  The net difference between the interest paid and
the interest received is reflected as an adjustment to interest expense.</P>

<P>Effective January 1, 2001, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 133 ("SFAS 133"), "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities," as amended by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 138, "Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging
Activities."  SFAS 133, as amended, establishes accounting and reporting
standards for derivative financial instruments such as our interest rate swap
agreements.  Specifically, SFAS 133 requires us to reflect our interest rate
swap agreements on the balance sheet at their estimated fair values.  We use a
variety of methods and assumptions based on market conditions and risks existing
at each balance sheet date to determine the fair values of our interest rate
swap agreements.  These methods of assessing fair value result in a general
approximation of value, and such value may never be realized.</P>

<P>All of our interest rate swap agreements meet the criteria to be deemed
"highly effective" under SFAS 133 in reducing our exposure to variable interest
rates.  Accordingly, we have categorized these instruments as cash flow hedges.
While we intend to continue to meet the conditions for such hedge accounting, if
hedges did not qualify as "highly effective", the changes in the fair value of
the derivatives used as hedges would be reflected in earnings.</P>


<P>We do not believe we are exposed to more than a nominal amount of
credit risk in our interest rate swap agreements as our counterparties are
established, well-capitalized financial institutions. </P>

<P>As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, our interest rate swap agreements have been
reported in the accompanying balance sheets at their fair value as other
liabilities of approximately $6.3 million and $9.0 million, respectively.  The
offsetting adjustments were reflected as deferred losses in accumulated other
comprehensive income of $6.3 million and $9.0 million, respectively.  Balances
in accumulated other comprehensive income are recognized in earnings as swap
payments are made.</P>

<P>9. Preferred Stock and Excess Stock</P>
<H4>Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock</H4>

<P>There are 1,543,500 shares of our 9.50% Series A cumulative
redeemable preferred stock outstanding.  The shares were issued in 1999 at a
price of $25.00 per share.  We pay dividends quarterly in arrears at an annual
rate of $2.375 per share.  Our Series A preferred stock has no stated maturity,
is not subject to any sinking fund or mandatory redemption and is not redeemable
prior to June 11, 2004, except in order to preserve our status as a REIT.
Investors in our Series A preferred stock generally have no voting rights.  On
or after June 11, 2004, we may, at our option, redeem our Series A preferred
stock, in whole or in part, at any time with proceeds from the sale of equity
securities at a redemption price of $25.00 per share, plus accrued and unpaid
dividends. </P>

<B><P>Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock</P>
</B><P>In January 2002, we completed a public offering of 2,300,000 shares of
our 9.10% Series B cumulative redeemable preferred stock (including the shares
issued upon exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option).  The shares
were issued at a price of $25.00 per share, resulting in aggregate proceeds of
approximately $55.1 million, net of underwriters' discounts and other offering
costs.  The dividends on our Series B preferred stock are cumulative and accrue
from the date of original issuance.  We pay dividends quarterly in arrears at an
annual rate of $2.275 per share.  Our Series B preferred stock has no stated
maturity, is not subject to any sinking fund or mandatory redemption and is not
redeemable prior to January 22, 2007, except in order to preserve our status as
a REIT.  Investors in our Series B preferred stock generally have no voting
rights.  On or after January 22, 2007, we may, at our option, redeem our Series
B preferred stock, in whole or in part, at any time with proceeds from the sale
of equity securities at a redemption price of $25.00 per share, plus accrued and
unpaid dividends.</P>

<STRONG><P>Preferred Stock and Excess Stock Authorizations</P>
</STRONG><P>Our charter authorizes the issuance of up to 100,000,000 shares of
preferred stock, of which 3,843,500 shares were issued and outstanding as of
December 31, 2003. In addition, 200,000,000 shares of "excess stock" (as
defined) are authorized, none of which were issued and outstanding at December
31, 2003. </P>

<B><P>Redemption of Preferred Stock</P>
</B>

<P>Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Topic D-42, "The Effect on the
Calculation of Earnings Per Share for the Redemption or Induced Conversion of
Preferred Stock", provides, among other things, that any excess of (1) the fair
value of the consideration transferred to the holders of preferred stock
redeemed over (2) the carrying amount of the preferred stock, should be
subtracted from net earnings to determine net income available to common
stockholders in the calculation of earnings per share.  The cost to issue our
preferred stock totaling $1.7 million and $2.4 million for our Series A and
Series B preferred stock, respectively, was recorded as a reduction to
additional paid-in capital in the years that the preferred stock was issued.
Upon any redemption of our Series A and Series B preferred stock, the respective
offering costs, representing the excess of the fair value of the consideration
transferred to the holders over the carrying amount of the preferred stock, will
be recognized as a dividend to preferred stockholders.  Dividends on preferred
stock are deducted from net income to arrive at net income allocable to common
stockholders.</P>

<STRONG><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>10. Commitments and Contingencies</P>
<P>Employee Retirement Savings Plan</P>
</STRONG><P>We have a retirement savings plan pursuant to Section 401(k) of the
Internal Revenue Code whereby our employees may contribute a portion of their
compensation to their respective retirement accounts, in an amount not to exceed
the maximum allowed under the Internal Revenue Code.  We have elected to provide
discretionary profit sharing contributions (subject to statutory limitations),
which amounted to $461,000, $428,000 and $353,000, respectively, for the years
ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001. Employees who participate in the plan
are immediately vested in their contributions and in the contributions of the
company. </P>

<STRONG><P>Concentration of Credit Risk</P>
</STRONG>

<P>We maintain our cash and cash equivalents at insured financial
institutions.  The combined account balances at each institution periodically
exceed FDIC insurance coverage, and, as a result, there is a concentration of
credit risk related to amounts in excess of FDIC insurance coverage.  We believe
that the risk is not significant. </P>

<P>We are dependent on rental income from relatively few tenants in the life
science industry.  The inability of any single tenant to make its lease payments
could adversely affect our operations.  As of December 31, 2003, we held leases
with a total of 179 tenants and 50 of our 89 properties were each leased to a
single tenant.  At December 31, 2003, our three largest tenants accounted for
approximately 12.8% of our aggregate annualized base rent. </P>

<P>We generally do not require collateral or other security from our tenants,
other than security deposits.  In addition to security deposits held in cash, we
held $24.1 million in irrevocable letters of credit available from certain
tenants as security deposits for 59 leases as of December 31, 2003.</P>

<STRONG><P>Commitments</P>
</STRONG>

<P>In addition to above, as of December 31, 2003, we were committed
under the terms of construction contracts to complete the construction of
properties under development at a remaining aggregate cost of $11.7 million.
</P>

<P>As of December 31, 2003, we were also committed to fund approximately $12.5
million for the construction of building infrastructure improvements under the
terms of leases and/or construction contracts and approximately $19.5 million
for certain investments. </P>

<P>Ground lease obligations as of December 31, 2003 include leases at six of our
properties and one land development parcel.  These lease obligations, of
approximately $65.4 million, have remaining lease terms of 29 to 51 years,
exclusive of extension options.</P>

<P>In 1997, we adopted a stock option and incentive plan (the "Stock
Plan") for the purpose of attracting and retaining the highest quality
personnel, providing for additional incentives and promoting the success of the
company by providing employees the opportunity to acquire common stock pursuant
to (i) options to purchase common stock; and (ii) share awards. As of December
31, 2003, a total of 308,536 shares were reserved for the granting of future
options and share awards under the Stock Plan. </P>
<P>Options under our plan have been granted at prices that are equal to the
market value of the stock on the date of grant and expire ten years after the
date of grant. Employee options vest ratably in three annual installments from
the date of grant. Non-employee director options vest immediately on the date of
grant. The options outstanding under the Stock Plan expire at various dates
through October 2012. </P>

<P>In addition, the Stock Plan permits us to issue share awards to our employees
and non-employee directors.  A share award is an award of common stock which (i)
may be fully vested upon issuance or (ii) may be subject to the risk of
forfeiture under Section 83 of the Internal Revenue Code.  Shares issued
generally vest over a one to three year period from the date of issuance and the
sale of the shares is restricted prior to the date of vesting.   During 2003, we
awarded 92,483 shares of common stock. These shares were recorded at fair value
with a corresponding charge to stockholders' equity.  The unearned portion is
amortized as stock compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the
vesting period. </P>

<P>For 2002 and all prior years, we have elected to follow Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees"
("APB 25") and related Interpretations in accounting for our employee and non-
employee director stock options, stock grants and stock appreciation rights.
Effective January 1, 2003, the Company has adopted the fair value recognition
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 123, "Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation" ("SFAS 123"), prospectively to all employee awards
granted, modified or settled after January 1, 2003.  We granted no new stock
options in 2003.  Under APB 25, because the exercise price of the options we
granted equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant, no
compensation expense has been recognized. Although we have elected to follow APB
25, pro forma information regarding net income and net income per share is
required by SFAS 123.  This information has been determined as if we had
accounted for our stock options under the fair value method under SFAS 123. The
fair value of the options issued under the Stock Plan was estimated at the date
of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted
average assumptions for 2003, 2002 and 2001: </P>

<P><b>13. Discontinued Operations</P></b>

<P>On January 1, 2002, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144,
"Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets" ("SFAS 144")
became effective.  SFAS 144 addresses financial accounting and reporting for the
impairment or disposal of long-lived assets.  Under SFAS 144, a</STRONG>
property is classified as "held for sale" when all of the following criteria for
a plan of sale have been met: 1) management, having the authority to approve the
action, commits to a plan to sell the property, 2) the property is available for
immediate sale in its present condition, subject only to the terms that are
usual and customary, 3) an active program to locate a buyer, and other actions
required to complete the plan to sell, have been initiated, 4) the sale of the
property is probable and is expected to be completed within one year, 5) the
property is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in
relation to its current fair value, and 6) actions necessary to complete the
plan of sale indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan
will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.  When all of these criteria
have been met, the property is classified as "held for sale" and its operations
are classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of
income.  When a property is designated as "held for sale", amounts for all prior
periods presented are reclassified from continuing operations to discontinued
operations.  A loss is recognized for any initial adjustment of the asset's
carrying amount to fair value less costs to sell in the period the asset
qualifies as "held for sale". Depreciation of assets is discontinued
commencing on the date they are designated as "held for sale".  The accompanying
statements have been presented in compliance with SFAS 144.</P>

<P>Income from discontinued operations, net includes the results of three
properties we sold during 2003, and one property that had been designated as
"held for sale" as of December 31, 2003 under the provisions of SFAS 144.  We
sold one property located in the Suburban Washington D.C. market that had been
designated as "held for sale" during the fourth quarter of 2003.  The total sale
price for the property was approximately $9.0 million.  In connection with the
sale, we recorded a loss on sale of property of approximately $36,000.  During
the third quarter of 2003, we sold one property located in the Eastern
Massachusetts market that had been previously designated as "held for sale" as
of December 31, 2002.  The total sale price for the property was approximately
$46.5 million.  In connection with this sale, we recorded a gain on sale of
property of approximately $8.8 million.  Interest expense included in
discontinued operations represents interest related to a secured note payable
which was assumed by the buyer in connection with the sale of this property.
During the first quarter of 2003, we sold one property located in the San
Francisco Bay market which could not be redeveloped pursuant to our original
strategic objectives and that had been designated as "held for sale" as of
December 31, 2002. The total sale price for the property was
approximately $6.8 million.  In connection with this sale, we recorded a loss on
sale of property of approximately $455,000 in 2003.  Gains and losses on sales
of these properties are included on the income statement in income from
discontinued operations in 2003.</P>
