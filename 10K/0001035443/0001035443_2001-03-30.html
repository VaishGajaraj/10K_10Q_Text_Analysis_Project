real estate investment trust ("REIT") for federal income tax purposes.  We are
engaged primarily in the ownership, operation, management, acquisition,
conversion, retrofitting, expansion and selective development and redevelopment
of high quality, strategically located properties containing office and
laboratory space designed and improved for lease principally to pharmaceutical,
biotechnology, diagnostic and personal care products companies, major scientific
research institutions, universities and related government agencies
(collectively, the "Life Science Industry"). Properties leased to tenants in the
Life Science Industry typically consist of suburban office buildings containing
scientific research and development laboratories and other improvements that are
generic to tenants operating in the Life Science Industry.  We call such
properties "Life Science Facilities."  As of December 31, 2000, we owned 75
properties (collectively, the "Properties"), containing approximately 4.9
million rentable square feet of office and laboratory space. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Development</U>. Although we have historically emphasized
acquisitions over development in pursuing our growth objectives, completed
development projects are anticipated to represent a more significant portion of
our growth in the future. Our strategy is to selectively pursue build-to-suit
development projects where we expect to achieve investment returns that will
equal or exceed our returns on acquisitions. We generally have undertaken build-to-suit
projects only if our investment in infrastructure will be substantially
made for generic, rather than tenant specific, improvements. </P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Financing/Working Capital</U>. We believe that cash
provided by operations and our unsecured line of credit will be sufficient to
fund our working capital requirements. We generally expect to finance future
retrofit development projects, acquisitions and development projects through our
unsecured line of credit and, then, to periodically refinance some or all of
that indebtedness with additional equity or debt capital. We may also issue
shares of our common stock, preferred stock or interests in our subsidiaries to
fund future operations. See "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources"

in properties used by tenants in the Life Science Industry.  If the Life Science
Industry experiences an economic downturn, our business could be adversely
affected. Events within the Life Science Industry may have a more pronounced
effect on our ability to make distributions to our stockholders than if we had
diversified investments. Also, our Properties may be better suited for a
particular Life Science Industry tenant and could require modification before we
could release vacant space to another Life Science Industry tenant. Generally,
our Properties also may not be suitable for lease to traditional office tenants
without significant expenditures on renovations. </P>

to successfully discover, develop, make, market or sell its products and

us;</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>

to the risks inherent in the Life Science Industry. Any tenant that is unable to
successfully avoid, or sufficiently mitigate, the risks described above, may
have difficulty making rental payments to us. </P>
<U><STRONG><P>We Could be Held Liable for Damages Resulting from Our Tenants'
Use of Hazardous Materials</P>
</U></STRONG><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some of our Life Science Industry tenants engage
in research and development activities that involve the controlled use of
hazardous materials, chemicals and biological and radioactive compounds. In the
event of contamination or injury from the use of these hazardous materials, we
could be held liable for damages that result. This liability could exceed our
resources and environmental remediation coverage and could adversely affect our
ability to make distributions to our stockholders. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Along with our tenants, we must comply with federal, state
and local laws and regulations that govern the use, manufacture, storage,
handling and disposal of hazardous materials and waste products. Failure to
comply with, or changes in, these laws and regulations could adversely affect
our business or our tenants' business and their ability to make rental payments
to us. </P>
<U><STRONG><P>The Inability of Any Tenant to Make Rental Payments to Us Could
Adversely Affect Our Business</P>
</U></STRONG><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our revenues are derived primarily from rental
payments and reimbursement of operating expenses under our leases. Therefore, if
our tenants, especially significant tenants, failed to make rental payments
under their leases, our financial condition and our ability to make
distributions to our stockholders could be adversely affected. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As of December 31, 2000, we had 173 leases with a total of
155 tenants.  Of our 75 properties, 40 were occupied by a single tenant. Three
of our tenants accounted for approximately 16.6% of our aggregate Annualized
Base Rent, or approximately 7.2%, 4.8% and 4.6%, respectively. "Annualized Base
Rent" means the annualized fixed base rental amount in effect as of December 31,
2000, using rental revenue calculated on a straight-line basis in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Annualized Base Rent
does not include real estate taxes and insurance, common area and other
operating expenses, substantially all of which are borne by the tenants in the
case of triple net leases. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant may also
adversely affect the income produced by a Property. If any of our tenants
becomes a debtor in a case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, we cannot evict that
tenant solely because of its bankruptcy. The bankruptcy court might authorize
the tenant to reject and terminate its lease with us. Our claim against such a
tenant for unpaid, future rent would be subject to a statutory limitation that
might be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed to us under
the tenant's lease. Any shortfall in rent payments could adversely affect our
cash flow and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. </P>
<U><STRONG><P>Our U.S. Government Tenants May Not Receive Annual Appropriations,
Which Could Adversely Affect Their Ability to Pay Us</P>
</U></STRONG><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">U.S. government tenants are subject to annual
appropriations. If one of our U.S. government tenants fails to receive its
annual appropriation, it might not be able to make its lease payments to us. In
addition, defaults under leases with federal government tenants are governed by
federal statute and not by state eviction or rent deficiency laws. All of our
leases with U.S. government tenants provide that the government tenant may
terminate the lease under certain circumstances. As of December 31, 2000, leases
with U.S. government tenants at our Properties accounted for approximately 7.5%
of our aggregate Annualized Base Rent. </P>
<U><STRONG><P>Loss of a Tenant Could Have A Negative Impact on Our Business</P>
</U></STRONG><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A lessee may not renew its lease upon the
expiration of the initial term. In addition, we may not be able to locate a
qualified replacement tenant upon expiration or termination of a lease.
Consequently, we could lose the cash flow from the affected Property, which
could negatively impact our business. We may have to divert cash flow generated
by other Properties to meet our mortgage payments, if any, or to pay other
expenses related to owning the affected Property. As of December 31, 2000,
leases at our Properties representing approximately 14.8% and 9.9% of the square
footage of our Properties were scheduled to expire in 2001 and 2002,

determined by our Board of Directors and will be dependent upon a number of
factors, including actual cash available for distribution, our financial

must make annual distributions to stockholders of at least 90% of our taxable

<BLOCKQUOTE>(2) We compute funds from operations ("FFO") in accordance with
standards established by the Board of Governors of NAREIT in its October 1999
White Paper ("White Paper"). The White Paper defines FFO as net income (loss)
(computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of
property, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.  FFO for 1997
has been restated to conform to the White Paper as amended in October 1999.  FFO
for 1997 has been impacted by non-recurring expenses associated with the
Offering of $12,197,000, and the write-off of unamortized loan costs of
$2,295,000.  For a more detailed discussion of FFO, see "Item 7. Management's

<P>Our primary source of revenue is rental income and tenant recoveries from
leases at the properties we own.  Of the 75 properties we owned as of December
31, 2000, four were acquired in 1994, eight in 1996, ten in 1997, 29 in 1998
(the "1998 Properties"), six in 1999 and 12 in 2000. In addition, we completed
the development of one property in 1999 (together with the six properties
acquired in 1999, the "1999 Properties") and five properties in 2000 (together
with the 12 properties acquired in 2000, the "2000 Properties").  As a result of
these acquisition and development activities, there were significant increases
in total revenues and expenses for 2000 as compared to 1999, and for 1999 as
compared to 1998. </P>

</I></STRONG><P>Rental revenue increased by $14.1 million, or 21%, to $82.5
million for 2000 compared to $68.4 million for 1999. The increase resulted
primarily from the 1999 Properties being owned for a full period and the
addition of the 2000 Properties.  Rental revenue from properties operating for a
full year during 1999 and 2000 (the "2000 Same Properties") increased by $1.7

from the 1999 Properties being owned for a full period and the addition of the
2000 Properties.  Operating expenses for the 2000 Same Properties increased by
$1.0 million, or 5.9%, primarily due to an increase in tenant related expenses
(substantially all of which are recoverable from our tenants through tenant
recoveries) partially offset by the fact that third party management fees are no
longer incurred at certain properties.</P>

<P>Interest expense increased by $6.1 million, or 31%, to $25.8 million for 2000

incurred to acquire the 1999 and 2000 Properties, (b) indebtedness incurred to
finance development properties which have been completed and (c) an increase in
the floating interest rate on our line of credit.  The weighted average
effective interest rate on our borrowings (not including the effect of swap
agreements) increased from 7.33% as of December 31, 1999 to 8.32% as of December

<P>Interest and other income increased by $298,000, or 24%, to $1.5 million for

<FONT SIZE=2><BLOCKQUOTE>(1) The Cash Basis presentation excludes the results
for 1431 Harbor Bay Parkway, Alameda, California. The lease for this property
(which was in place when we acquired the property in 1996) contains significant
step-down provisions that affected the cash rent paid by the tenant beginning in
January 1999. As a result, cash rent paid was reduced from $2,948,000 for 1998
to $2,128,000 for 1999. The lease, which expires in January 2014, requires
another step-down in rent beginning in January 2004 to $750,000 per year. If
this property was included in the Cash Basis presentation for 1999, revenue
would have increased 5.0%, rental operating expenses would have increased 9.2%

</FONT><I><FONT SIZE=3><STRONG><P>Unsecured Line of Credit</P>
</I></STRONG><P>We have an unsecured line of credit that provides for borrowings
of up to $325 million.  Borrowings under the line of credit bear interest at a
floating rate based on our election of either a LIBOR based rate or the higher
of the bank's reference rate and the Federal Funds rate plus 0.5%.  For each
LIBOR based advance, we must elect to fix the rate for a period of one, two,
three or six months. </P>
<P>The line of credit contains financial covenants, including, among other
things, maintenance of minimum net worth, a total liabilities to gross asset
value ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio. In addition, the terms of the
line of credit restrict, among other things, certain investments, indebtedness,
distributions and mergers.  Borrowings under the line of credit are limited to
an amount based on a pool of unencumbered assets.  Accordingly, as we acquire or
complete the development of additional unencumbered properties, borrowings
available under the line of credit will increase up to the maximum of $325
million.  As of December 31, 2000, borrowings under the line of credit were
limited to approximately $303 million and carried a weighted average interest
rate of 8.32%. </P>
<P>The line of credit expires February 2003 and provides for annual extensions
(provided there is no default) for two additional one-year periods upon notice
by the company and consent of the participating banks. </P>
<P>We utilize interest rate swap agreements to hedge our exposure to variable
interest rates associated with our unsecured line of credit.  These agreements
involve an exchange of fixed and floating interest payments without the exchange
of the underlying principal amount (the "notional amount").  Interest received
under all of our swap agreements is based on the one-month LIBOR rate.  The net
difference between the interest paid and the interest received is reflected as
an adjustment to interest expense. </P>

<P>With respect to our swap agreements, we are exposed to losses in the event
the financial institution is unable to perform under the agreements, or in the
event one month LIBOR is less than the agreed-upon fixed interest rates.  The
fair value of the swap agreements outstanding as of December 31, 2000 and
changes in their fair value as a result of changes in market interest rates are
not recognized in the financial statements. </P>
<STRONG><P>Other Resources and Liquidity Requirements</P>
</STRONG><P>In April 2000, we sold 500,000 shares of common stock to an
institutional investor.  The shares were issued at a price of $29.39 per share,
resulting in aggregate proceeds of approximately $14.2 million, net of offering
costs.</P>
<P>In October 2000, we completed a public offering of 1,125,000 shares of common
stock.  The shares were issued at a price of $33.8731 per share, resulting in
aggregate proceeds of approximately $37.9 million, net of underwriting discounts
and commissions and other offering costs.  </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>We expect to continue meeting our short-term liquidity and capital
requirements generally through our working capital and net cash provided by
operating activities.  We believe that the net cash provided by operating
activities will continue to be sufficient to make distributions necessary to
enable us to continue qualifying as a REIT.  We also believe that net cash
provided by operating activities will be sufficient to fund our recurring non-
revenue enhancing capital expenditures, tenant improvements and leasing
commissions. </P>
<P>We expect to meet certain long-term liquidity requirements, such as property
acquisitions, property development and redevelopment activities, scheduled debt
maturities, expansions and other non-recurring capital improvements, through
excess net cash provided by operating activities, long-term secured and
unsecured borrowings, including borrowings under the line of credit and the
issuance of additional debt and/or equity securities. </P>
<STRONG><P>Exposure to Environmental Liabilities</P>
</STRONG><P>In connection with the acquisition of all of our properties, we have
obtained Phase I environmental assessments to ascertain the existence of any
environmental liabilities or other issues.  The Phase I environmental
assessments of our properties have not revealed any environmental liabilities
that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition
or results of operations taken as a whole, nor are we aware of any material
environmental liabilities that have occurred since the Phase I environmental
assessments were completed. </P>
<STRONG><P>Capital Expenditures, Tenant Improvements and Leasing Costs</P>
</STRONG><P>The following table shows total and weighted average per square foot

are recoverable from tenants, revenue-enhancing or related to properties that
have undergone redevelopment) for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999, 1998,

<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp;</BLOCKQUOTE>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=3><P>Capital expenditures fluctuate in any given period due to
the nature, extent and timing of improvements required and the extent to which
they are recoverable from our tenants. Approximately 84% of our leases provide
for the recapture of certain capital expenditures (such as HVAC systems
maintenance and/or replacement, roof replacement and parking lot resurfacing).
In addition, we maintain an active preventative maintenance program at each of
our properties to minimize capital expenditures required. </P>
<P>Tenant improvements and leasing costs also fluctuate in any given year
depending upon factors such as the timing and extent of vacancies, property
characteristics, the type of lease (renewal tenant or retenanted space), the
involvement of external leasing agents and overall competitive market
conditions.  </P>
<STRONG><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Inflation</P>
</STRONG><P>As of December 31, 2000, approximately 83% of our leases (on a
square footage basis) were triple net leases, requiring tenants to pay
substantially all real estate taxes and insurance, common area and other
operating expenses (including increases thereto).  In addition, approximately
12% of our leases (on a square footage basis) required the tenants to pay a
majority of operating expenses. Approximately 92% of our leases (on a square
footage basis) contain effective annual rent escalations that are either fixed
(generally ranging from 3% to 4%) or indexed based on the consumer price index
or another index. Accordingly, we do not believe that our earnings or cash flow
from real estate operations are subject to any significant risk of inflation. An
increase in inflation, however, could result in an increase in the cost of our
variable rate borrowings, including our unsecured line of credit. </P>
<STRONG><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Funds from Operations</P>
</STRONG><P>We believe that funds from operations ("FFO") is helpful to
investors as a measure of the performance of an equity REIT because, along with
cash flows from operating activities, financing activities and investing
activities, it provides investors with an understanding of our ability to incur
and service debt, to make capital expenditures and to make distributions.  We
compute FFO in accordance with standards established by the Board of Governors
of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") in its
October 1999 White Paper (the "White Paper"), which may differ from the
methodology for calculating FFO utilized by other equity REITs, and,
accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs.  Further, FFO does not
represent amounts available for our discretionary use because a portion of FFO
is needed for capital replacement or expansion, debt service obligations or
other commitments and uncertainties.  The White Paper defines FFO as net income
(loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from
sales of property, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and
after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO should
not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with
GAAP) as an indication of our financial performance, or to cash flows from
operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our
liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs,
including our ability to make distributions. (See "Cash Flows" for information
regarding these measures of cash flow.) </P>

</FONT><FONT SIZE=3><STRONG><P>Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk</P>
</STRONG><P>Market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in
interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and equity
prices.  The primary market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk,
which is sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary and tax
policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations and
other factors that are beyond our control. </P>
<P>In order to modify and manage the interest characteristics of our outstanding
debt and limit the effects of interest rates on our operations, we may utilize a
variety of financial instruments, including interest rate swaps, caps, floors
and other interest rate exchange contracts.  The use of these types of
instruments to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates carries
additional risks such as counter-party credit risk and the legal enforceability
of hedging contracts. </P>
<P>Our future earnings, cash flows and fair values relating to financial
instruments are primarily dependent upon prevalent market rates of interest,
such as LIBOR. However, due to the purchase of our interest rate swap
agreements, the current effects of interest rate changes are reduced.  Based on
interest rates at, and our swap agreements in effect on, December 31, 2000, a 1%
increase in interest rates on our line of credit would decrease annual future
earnings and cash flows, after considering the effect of our interest rate swap
agreements, by approximately $810,000.  A 1% decrease in interest rates on our
line of credit would increase annual future earnings and cash flows, after
considering the effect of our interest rate swap agreements, by approximately
$810,000.  A 1% increase in interest rates on our secured debt and interest rate
swap agreements would decrease their fair value by approximately $9.9 million.
A 1% decrease in interest rates on our secured debt and interest rate swap
agreements would increase their fair value by approximately $11.7 million.  A 1%
increase or decrease in interest rates on our secured note receivable would not
have a material impact on its fair value. </P>
<P>These amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical
interest rates on our borrowing cost and our interest rate swap agreements.
These analyses do not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall
economic activity that could exist in such an environment.  Further, in the
event of a change of such magnitude, we would consider taking actions to further
mitigate our exposure to the change. However, due to the uncertainty of the
specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, the sensitivity
analysis assumes no changes in our capital structure. </P>

Independent Auditors</P>
</FONT></STRONG><FONT SIZE=3><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of<BR>
Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. </P>
<P>We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Alexandria
Real Estate Equities, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31,
2000 and 1999, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders'
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 2000. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in
the index at item 14(a). These financial statements and schedule are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits. </P>
<P>We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion. </P>
<P>In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Alexandria Real
Estate Equities, Inc. and subsidiaries at December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2000, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States. Also, in our opinion, the
related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects
the information set forth therein. </P>

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements </P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>1. Background</P>
</STRONG><P>Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. is a real estate investment
trust ("REIT") formed in 1994.  We are engaged primarily in the ownership,
operation, management, acquisition, conversion, retrofitting, expansion, and
selective development and redevelopment of properties containing a combination
of office and laboratory space.  We refer to these properties as "Life Science
Facilities." Our Life Science Facilities are designed and improved for lease
primarily to pharmaceutical, biotechnology, diagnostic, device, contract
research and personal care products companies, major scientific research
institutions, related government agencies and technology enterprises.  As of
December 31, 2000, our portfolio consisted of 75 properties in nine states with
approximately 4,857,000 rentable square feet, compared to 58 properties in nine
states with approximately 4,046,000 rentable square feet as of December 31,
1999. </P>
<STRONG><P>2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies</P>
<P>Basis of Presentation</P>
</STRONG><P>The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Alexandria and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated. </P>
<STRONG><P>Use of Estimates</P>
</STRONG><P>The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates. </P>
<STRONG><P>Cash Equivalents</P>
</STRONG><P>We consider all highly liquid investments with original maturities
of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. </P>
<STRONG><P>Reclassifications</P>
</STRONG><P>Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the
current year presentation. </P>
<STRONG><P>Investments</P>
</STRONG><P>We hold equity investments in certain publicly traded companies and
privately held entities. All of our investments in publicly traded companies are
considered "available for sale" under the provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and
Equity Securities," and have been included at fair value in other assets in the
accompanying balance sheets.  Fair value has been determined by the most
recently traded price at the balance sheet date, with unrealized gains and
losses shown as a separate component of stockholders' equity.  The cost of
investments sold is determined on the specific identification method, with
realized gains and losses included in interest and other income.</P>
<STRONG><P>2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies (continued)</P>
<P>Investments (continued)</P>
</STRONG><P>Investment income of $1,446,000 for 2000 consisted of gross realized
gains of $1,575,000 and gross realized losses of $129,000 and is included in
other income in the accompanying statements of income.  The fair value of
available-for-sale securities as of December 31, 2000 and 1999 was $4,148,000
and $172,000, respectively, with related gross unrealized gains of $2,249,000
and $172,000, respectively, and gross unrealized losses of $412,000 and $0,
respectively.  At December 31, 2000 and 1999, the cost of available-for-sale
securities totaled $2,311,000 and $0, respectively.</P>
<P>Investments in privately held entities as of December 31, 2000 and 1999,
totaled $14,777,000 and $3,544,000, respectively.  These investments are
accounted for under the cost method and are included in other assets in the
accompanying balance sheets.</P>
<STRONG><P>Rental Properties and Property Under Development</P>
</STRONG><P>Rental properties and property under development are stated at the
lower of cost or estimated fair value. Write-downs to estimated fair value would
be recognized when impairment indicators are present and a property's estimated
undiscounted future cash flows, before interest charges, are less than its book
value. In that situation, we would recognize an impairment loss to the extent
the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the property. Based on our
assessment, no write-downs to estimated fair value were necessary for the
periods presented. </P>
<P>The cost of maintenance and repairs is expensed as incurred. Major
replacements and betterments are capitalized and depreciated over their
estimated useful lives. </P>
<P>Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method using estimated lives
of 30 to 40 years for buildings and building improvements, 20 years for land
improvements and the term of the respective lease for tenant improvements. </P>

Policies (continued)</P>
<P>Loan Fees and Costs</P>
</STRONG><P>Fees and costs incurred in obtaining long-term financing are
amortized over the terms of the related loans and included in interest expense.
Loan fees and costs, net of related amortization, totaled $5,810,000 and
$3,018,000 as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively, and are included in
other assets in our balance sheets. </P>
<STRONG><P>Rental Income</P>
</STRONG><P>Rental income from leases with scheduled rent increases, free rent
and other rent adjustments are recognized on a straight-line basis over the
respective lease term. We include amounts currently recognized as income, and
expected to be received in later years, in deferred rent on our balance sheets.
Amounts received currently, but recognized as income in future years, are
included in accrued expenses as unearned rent on our balance sheets. </P>
<STRONG><P>Interest Income</P>
</STRONG><P>Interest income was $1,025,000, $1,013,000 and $978,000 in 2000,
1999 and 1998, respectively, and is included in interest and other income in the
accompanying statements of income. </P>
<STRONG><P>Leasing Costs</P>
</STRONG><P>Leasing costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the term
of the related lease. Leasing costs, net of related amortization, totaled
$11,652,000 and $7,159,000 as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively, and
are included in other assets in our balance sheets. </P>
<STRONG><P>Fair Value of Financial Instruments</P>
</STRONG><P>The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair
value. The carrying amount of our secured note receivable approximates fair
value because the applicable interest rate approximates the market rate for this
loan. </P>
<P>The fair value of our secured notes payable was estimated using discounted
cash flows analyses based on borrowing rates we believe we could obtain with
similar terms and maturities. As of December 31, 2000 and 1999, the fair value
of our secured notes payable was approximately $204,786,000 and $149,329,000,
respectively. </P>

<P>4. Secured Note Receivable </P>
</STRONG><P>In connection with the acquisition of a Life Science Facility in San
Diego, California in March 1998, we made a $6,000,000 loan to the sole tenant of
the property, fully secured by a first deed of trust on certain improvements at
the property. The loan bears interest at a rate of 11% per year, payable
monthly, and matures in March 2002. The loan is cross-defaulted to the lease
with the sole tenant. Under certain circumstances, we may obtain title to the
improvements that secure the loan, and, in such event, we may also require the
sole tenant at the property to lease such improvements back from us for an
additional rental amount. </P>
<STRONG><P>5. Unsecured Line of Credit</P>
</STRONG><P>We have an unsecured line of credit that provides for borrowings of
up to $325 million. Borrowings under the line of credit bear interest at a
floating rate based on our election of either a LIBOR based rate or the higher
of the bank's reference rate and the Federal Funds rate plus 0.5%. For each
LIBOR based advance, we must elect to fix the rate for a period of one, two,
three or six months. </P>
<P>The line of credit contains financial covenants, including, among other
things, maintenance of minimum net worth, a total liabilities to gross asset
value ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio. In addition, the terms of the
line of credit restrict, among other things, certain investments, indebtedness,
distributions and mergers. Borrowings under the line of credit are limited to an
amount based on a pool of unencumbered assets. Accordingly, as we acquire or
complete the development of additional unencumbered properties, borrowings
available under the line of credit will increase up to the maximum of $325
million. As of December 31, 2000, borrowings under the line of credit were
limited to approximately $303 million and carried a weighted average interest
rate of 8.32%. </P>
<P>The line of credit expires February 2003 and provides for annual extensions
(provided there is no default) for two additional one-year periods upon notice
by the company and consent of the participating banks. </P>
<P>We utilize interest rate swap agreements to hedge our exposure to variable
interest rates associated with our unsecured line of credit.  These agreements
involve an exchange of fixed and floating interest payments without the exchange
of the underlying principal amount (the "notional amount").  Interest received
under all of our swap agreements is based on the one-month LIBOR rate.  The net
difference between the interest paid and interest received is reflected as an
adjustment to interest expense.</P>

<P>With respect to our swap agreements, we are exposed to losses in the event
the financial institution is unable to perform under the agreements, or in the
event one-month LIBOR is less than the agreed-upon fixed interest rates. The
fair value of the swap agreements outstanding as of December 31, 2000 and
changes in their fair value as a result of changes in market interest rates are
not recognized in the financial statements.  </P>
<P>In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 (SFAS 133) "Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities," and its amendments Statements 137 and 138,
in June 1999 and June 2000, respectively.  This statement requires us to reflect
all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.  Derivatives that are not
hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income.  If the derivative is a
hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of
derivatives will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged
asset, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other
comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings.  The
ineffective portion of a derivative's change in fair value will be immediately
recognized in earnings.  The adoption of SFAS 133, as amended, on January 1,
2001 will result in a reduction in other comprehensive income of approximately
$3.5 million.</P>

stock generally have no voting rights. On or after June 11, 2004, we may, at our
option, redeem our Series A preferred stock, in whole or in part, at any time
for cash at a redemption price of $25.00 per share, plus accrued and unpaid
dividends. </P>
<STRONG><P>Preferred Stock and Excess Stock Authorizations</P>
</STRONG><P>Our charter authorizes the issuance of up to 100,000,000 shares of
preferred stock, of which 1,543,500 shares were issued and outstanding as of
December 31, 2000. In addition, 200,000,000 shares of "excess stock" (as
defined) are authorized, none of which were issued and outstanding at December
31, 2000. </P>
<STRONG><P>10. Commitments and Contingencies</P>
<P>Employee Retirement Savings Plan</P>
</STRONG><P>Effective January 1, 1997, we adopted a retirement savings plan
pursuant to Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code ("Code") whereby our
employees may contribute a portion of their compensation to their respective
retirement accounts, in an amount not to exceed the maximum allowed under the
Code. The plan provides that we contribute eight percent of our employees'
salary (subject to statutory limitations), which amounted to $254,000, $185,000
and $89,000, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998.
Employees who participate in the plan are immediately vested in their
contributions and in the contributions of the company. </P>

<STRONG><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>10. Commitments and Contingencies (continued)</P>
<P>Concentration of Credit Risk</P>
</STRONG><P>We maintain our cash and cash equivalents at insured financial
institutions. The combined account balances at each institution periodically
exceed FDIC insurance coverage, and, as a result, there is a concentration of
credit risk related to amounts in excess of FDIC insurance coverage. We believe
that the risk is not significant. </P>
<P>We are dependent on rental income from relatively few tenants in the life
science industry. The inability of any single tenant to make its lease payments
could adversely affect our operations. As of December 31, 2000, we had 173
leases with a total of 155 tenants and 40 of our 75 properties were each leased
to a single tenant. At December 31, 2000, our three largest tenants accounted
for approximately 16.6% of our aggregate annualized base rent. </P>
<P>We generally do not require collateral or other security from our tenants,
other than security deposits.  In addition to security deposits held in cash, we
hold $7.5 million in irrevocable letters of credit available from certain
tenants as security deposits for 20 leases as of December 31, 2000. </P>
<STRONG><P>Commitments</P>
</STRONG><P>As of December 31, 2000, we were committed under the terms of
certain leases to complete the construction of buildings and certain related
improvements at a remaining aggregate cost of $21.4 million. </P>
<P>As of December 31, 2000, we were also committed to fund approximately $38.5
million for the construction of building infrastructure improvements under the
terms of various leases and for certain investments. </P>

<STRONG><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>11. Stock Option Plans and Stock Grants</P>
<P>1997 Stock Plan</P>
</STRONG><P>In 1997, we adopted a stock option and incentive plan (the "1997
Stock Plan") for the purpose of attracting and retaining the highest quality
personnel, providing for additional incentives and promoting the success of the
company by providing employees the opportunity to acquire common stock pursuant
to (i) options to purchase common stock; and (ii) share awards. As of December
31, 2000, a total of 562,936 shares were reserved for the granting of future
options and share awards under the 1997 Stock Plan. </P>
<P>Options under our plan have been granted at prices that are equal to the
market value of the stock on the date of grant and expire ten years after the
date of grant. Employee options vest ratably in three annual installments from
the date of grant. Non-employee director options vest immediately on the date of
grant. The options outstanding under the 1997 Stock Plan expire at various dates
through October 2010. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<STRONG><P>11. Stock Option Plans and Stock Grants (continued)</P>
<P>1997 Stock Plan (continued)</P>
</STRONG><P>In addition, the 1997 Stock Plan permits us to issue share awards to
our employees and non-employee directors. A share award is an award of common
stock which (i) may be fully vested upon issuance or (ii) may be subject to the
risk of forfeiture under Section 83 of the Internal Revenue Code. For employees,
these shares generally vest over a one-year period and the sale of the shares is
restricted prior to the date of vesting. For non-employee directors, these
shares are generally fully vested upon issuance and the sale of the shares is
not restricted. During 2000, we awarded 18,400 shares of common stock. These
shares were recorded at fair value with a corresponding charge to stockholders'
equity. The unearned portion is amortized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis
over the vesting period. </P>
<P>We have elected to follow Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
"Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" ("APB 25") and related
Interpretations in accounting for our employee and non-employee director stock
options, stock grants and stock appreciation rights. Under APB 25, because the
exercise price of the options we granted equals the market price of the
underlying stock on the date of grant, no compensation expense has been
recognized. Although we have elected to follow APB 25, pro forma information
regarding net income and net income per share is required by Financial
Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation." This information has been determined as if we had accounted for
our stock options under the fair value method under Statement 123. The fair
value of the options issued under the 1997 Stock Plan was estimated at the date
of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted
average assumptions for 2000, 1999 and 1998: </P>
