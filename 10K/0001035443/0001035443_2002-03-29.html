<P><FONT SIZE=2>This document contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. You can identify some of the forward-looking statements
by the use of forward-looking words such as "believes", "expects", "may", "will", "should", "seeks", "intends", "plans", "estimates"
or "anticipates", or the negative of these words or similar words.  Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and
uncertainties regarding events, conditions and financial trends that may affect our future plans of operation, business strategy,
results of operations and financial position.  A number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from
those included within or contemplated by the forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, those described below under
the headings "Business Risks" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." We do not
undertake any responsibility to update any of these factors or to announce publicly any revisions to any of the forward-looking
statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. <A NAME="item1"></A></P>
<STRONG><P>Item 1. Business</P>
<I><P>General</P>
</I></STRONG><P>Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. is a Maryland corporation formed in October 1994 that has elected to be taxed
as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") for federal income tax purposes.  We are engaged primarily in the ownership, operation,
management, acquisition, expansion and selective redevelopment and development of high quality, strategically located properties
containing office and laboratory space designed and improved for lease principally to pharmaceutical, biotechnology, life science
product and services companies, not-for-profit scientific research institutions, universities and related government agencies
(collectively, the "life science industry"). Properties leased to tenants in the life science industry typically consist of suburban
office buildings containing scientific research and development laboratories and other improvements that are generic to tenants
operating in the life science industry.  We call such properties "life science facilities."  As of December 31, 2001, we owned 82
properties (collectively, the "properties"), containing approximately 5.3 million rentable square feet of office and laboratory
space. </P>
<I><STRONG><P>Business and Growth Strategy</P>
</I></STRONG><P>We focus our property operations and investment activities principally in the following life science markets: </P>




<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>California (in the San Diego, Pasadena and San Francisco Bay areas);</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>Seattle; </LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>suburban Washington, D.C. (including Maryland and Virginia);</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>eastern Massachusetts;</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>New Jersey and suburban Philadelphia; and</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>the Southeast (including North Carolina and Georgia). </LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
</UL>

<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Our tenant base is broad and diverse within the life science industry and reflects our focus on regional, national and
international tenants with substantial financial and operational resources. For a detailed description of our properties and tenants,
see "Item 2. Properties." We are led by a senior management team with extensive experience in both the real estate and life science
industries and are supported by an experienced Board of Directors. </P>
<P>We seek to maximize growth in funds from operations ("FFO") and cash available for distribution to stockholders through ownership,
operation, management, acquisition, expansion and selective redevelopment and development of life science facilities. See "Item 7.
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Funds from Operations" for a discussion of how
we compute and view FFO, as well as a discussion of other measures of cash flow. In particular, we seek to increase FFO and cash
available for distribution per share by: </P>





<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>acquiring high quality life science facilities at prices that will enable us to realize attractive returns in our
life science markets;</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>expanding existing or newly acquired properties or redeveloping existing office, warehouse or vacant space into
generic laboratory space that can be leased at higher rental rates;</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>selectively developing properties, primarily on a build-to-suit basis; </LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>retenanting and releasing space within our portfolio at higher rental rates and with minimal non-revenue enhancing
tenant improvement costs;</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>realizing contractual rental rate escalations, which are currently provided for in approximately 92% of our
leases;</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>implementing effective cost control measures, including negotiating pass-through provisions in tenant leases for
operating expenses and certain capital expenditures; and </LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>managing the level of debt on our balance sheet and our exposure to floating rate debt.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE></UL>
</UL>

<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P>Internal Growth</U>. We seek to achieve internal growth from several sources. For example, we seek to: </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>include rental rate escalation provisions in our leases;</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>improve investment returns through releasing of vacant space and replacement of existing tenants with new tenants at
higher rental rates;</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>achieve higher rental rates as existing leases expire; </LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>expand existing facilities that are fully leased and/or redevelop existing and/or newly acquired space to higher
rent, generic laboratory space; and</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>implement effective cost control measures, including negotiating pass-through provisions in tenant leases for
operating expenses and certain capital expenditures.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>


<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Our ability to negotiate contractual rent escalations in future leases and to achieve increases in rental rates will depend upon
market conditions and the demand for life science facilities at the time the leases are negotiated and the increases are
proposed.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<U><P>Acquisitions</U>. We seek to identify and acquire high quality life science facilities in our target markets on a selective
basis. Critical evaluation of prospective property acquisitions is an essential component of our acquisition strategy. When
evaluating acquisition opportunities, we assess a full range of matters relating to the properties, including the: </P>




<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>location of the property and our strategy in the relevant market;</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>quality of existing and prospective tenants;</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>condition and capacity of the building infrastructure;</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>quality and generic characteristics of laboratory facilities;</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>physical condition of the structure and common area improvements;</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>opportunities available for leasing vacant space and for retenanting occupied space; </LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>opportunities to redevelop existing space into higher rent generic laboratory space; and</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>opportunities to expand the existing facility.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>


<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P>Redevelopment.</U> We seek to enhance our growth by redeveloping existing office, warehouse or vacant space as generic laboratory
space that can be leased at higher rates.  As of December 31, 2001, we had 18 properties in our redevelopment program that contained
a total of 1.25 million square feet.  Of this total, 565,000 square feet are under redevelopment and currently vacant, and the
remaining 688,000 square feet are currently leased.  We also have identified approximately 319,000 square feet of additional space in
our existing portfolio for potential redevelopment opportunities.</P>

<P>Due to the fact that space undergoing redevelopment is vacant, our redevelopment program has the effect of currently reducing
rental revenue and FFO.  Despite our ongoing redevelopment activities, we have achieved consistent growth in FFO and FFO per share
(on a diluted basis).</P>

<U><P>Development</U>. Our development strategy is primarily to pursue selective build-to-suit projects where we expect to achieve
investment returns that will equal or exceed our returns on acquisitions.  We generally have undertaken build-to-suit projects only
if our investment in infrastructure will be substantially made for generic, rather than tenant specific, improvements.  On occasion,
we also develop properties in certain life science markets before we have leases in place.  Since our initial public offering, we
have completed the development of eight properties containing approximately 544,000 rentable square feet of office and warehouse
space. </P>

<U><P>Financing/Working Capital</U>. We believe that cash provided by operations and our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term
loan will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements. We generally expect to finance future acquisitions and
redevelopment and development projects through our unsecured line of credit and then to refinance some or all of that indebtedness
periodically with additional equity or debt capital. We may also issue shares of our common stock, preferred stock or interests in
our subsidiaries to fund future operations. </P>

<P>We seek to maintain a balance between the amounts of our fixed and variable debt with a view to moderating our exposure to
interest rate risk.  We also use financial instruments, such as interest rate swap agreements, to hedge our exposure to the variable
interest rates associated with our unsecured line of credit.  Interest rate swap agreements involve an exchange of fixed and floating
interest payments without the exchange of the underlying principal or "notional amount."  Interest received under our current
interest rate swap agreements is based on the one-month LIBOR rate.  See "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources" for a complete discussion of our unsecured line of credit,
interest rate swap agreements and other outstanding indebtedness. </P>
<I><STRONG><P>Business Risks</P>

</I><U><P>We Are Largely Dependent on the Life Sciences Industry for Revenues from Lease Payments</P>
</U></STRONG><P>In general, our strategy is to invest primarily in properties used by tenants in the life science industry. Our
business could be adversely affected if the life science industry experiences an economic downturn. Events within the life science
industry may have a more pronounced effect on our ability to make distributions to our stockholders than if we had diversified
investments. Also, our properties may be better suited for a particular life science industry tenant and could require modification
before we could release vacant space to another life science industry tenant. Generally, our properties also may not be suitable for
lease to traditional office tenants without significant expenditures on renovations. </P>
<U><STRONG><P>Our Tenants May Not Be Able to Pay Us if They Are Unsuccessful in Discovering, Developing, Making or Selling Their
Products and Technologies</P>

</U></STRONG><P>Our life science industry tenants are subject to a number of risks, any one or more of which may adversely affect
their ability to make rental payments to us: </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>Some of our tenants require significant funding to develop and commercialize their products and technologies, which
funding must be obtained from private investors, the public market, companies in the life science industry or federal, state and
local governments. Such funding may be unavailable, decreased or discontinued in the future which could adversely affect the ability
of a tenant to successfully discover, develop, make, market or sell its products and technologies, to generate revenues or to make
rental payments to us;</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>Even with sufficient funding, some of our tenants may not be able to discover or identify potential drug targets in
humans, or potential drugs for use in humans, or to create tools or technologies which are commercially useful in the discovery or
identification of potential drug targets or drugs;</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>Some of our tenants developing potential drugs may find that their drugs are not effective, or may even be harmful,
when tested in humans;</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>Some of our tenants may not be able to manufacture their drugs economically, even if such drugs are proven through
human clinical trials to be safe and effective in humans;</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>Drugs which are developed and manufactured by some of our tenants require regulatory approval prior to being made,
marketed, sold and used. The regulatory approval process to manufacture and market drugs is costly, typically takes several years,
requires the expenditure of substantial resources, is often unpredictable and a tenant may fail or experience significant delays in
obtaining these approvals;</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>Some of our tenants and their licensors require patent, copyright or trade secret protection to develop, make, market
and sell their products and technologies. A tenant may be unable to commercialize its products or technologies if patents covering
such products or technologies do not issue, or are successfully challenged, narrowed, invalidated or circumvented by third parties,
or if a tenant fails to successfully obtain licenses to the discoveries of third parties necessary to commercialize its products or
technologies; and</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>A drug made by a tenant may not be well accepted by doctors and patients, or may be less effective or accepted than

<P>We cannot assure you that our tenants will be able to develop, make, market or sell their products and technologies due to the
risks inherent in the life science industry. Any tenant that is unable to avoid, or sufficiently mitigate, the risks described above,
may have difficulty making rental payments to us. </P>

<U><STRONG><P>We Could be Held Liable for Damages Resulting from Our Tenants' Use of Hazardous Materials</P>
</U></STRONG><P>Some of our life science industry tenants engage in research and development activities that involve the controlled
use of hazardous materials, chemicals and biological and radioactive compounds. In the event of contamination or injury from the use
of these hazardous materials, we could be held liable for damages that result. This liability could exceed our resources and
environmental remediation insurance coverage and could adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. </P>

<P>Along with our tenants, we must comply with federal, state and local laws and regulations that govern the use, manufacture,
storage, handling and disposal of hazardous materials and waste products. Failure to comply with, or changes in, these laws and
regulations could adversely affect our business or our tenants' business and their ability to make rental payments to us. </P>

<U><STRONG><P>The Inability of Any Tenant to Make Rental Payments to Us Could Adversely Affect Our Business</P>
</U></STRONG><P>Our revenues are derived primarily from rental payments and reimbursement of operating expenses under our leases.
Therefore, if our tenants, especially significant tenants, failed to make rental payments under their leases, our financial condition
and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders could be adversely affected. </P>

<P>As of December 31, 2001, we had 194 leases with a total of 167 tenants.  Of our 82 properties, 45 were occupied by a single
tenant. Three of our tenants accounted for approximately 14.1% of our aggregate annualized base rent, or approximately 6.0%, 4.1% and
4.0%, respectively. "Annualized base rent" means the annualized fixed base rental amount in effect as of December 31, 2001, using
rental revenue calculated on a straight-line basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Annualized
base rent does not include reimbursements for real estate taxes and insurance, common area and other operating expenses,
substantially all of which are borne by the tenants in the case of triple net leases. </P>

<P>The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant may also adversely affect the income produced by a property. If any of our tenants
becomes a debtor in a case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, we cannot evict that tenant solely because of its bankruptcy. The
bankruptcy court may authorize the tenant to reject and terminate its lease with us. Our claim against such a tenant for unpaid
future rent would be subject to a statutory limitation that might be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed to us
under the tenant's lease. Any shortfall in rent payments could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to make distributions
to our stockholders. </P>

<U><STRONG><P>Our U.S. Government Tenants May Not Receive Annual Appropriations, Which Could Adversely Affect Their Ability to Pay
Us</P>

</U></STRONG><P>U.S. government tenants are subject to annual appropriations. If one of our U.S. government tenants fails to receive
its annual appropriation, it might not be able to make its lease payments to us. In addition, defaults under leases with federal
government tenants are governed by federal statute and not by state eviction or rent deficiency laws. All of our leases with U.S.
government tenants provide that the government tenant may terminate the lease under certain circumstances. As of December 31, 2001,
leases with U.S. government tenants at our properties accounted for approximately 4.2% of our aggregate annualized base rent. </P>

<U><STRONG><P>Loss of a Tenant Could Have a Negative Impact on Our Business</P>
</U></STRONG><P>A tenant may not renew its lease upon the expiration of the initial term. In addition, we may not be able to locate a
qualified replacement tenant upon expiration or termination of a lease. Consequently, we could lose the cash flow from the affected
property, which could negatively impact our business. We may have to divert cash flow generated by other properties to meet our
mortgage payments, if any, or to pay other expenses related to owning the affected property. As of December 31, 2001, leases at our
properties representing approximately 10.1% and 10.3% of the total square footage of our properties were scheduled to expire in 2002
and 2003, respectively. </P>

<U><STRONG><P>Poor Economic Conditions in Our Markets Could Adversely Affect Our Business</P>

<P>As a result of this geographic concentration, we are dependent upon the local economic conditions in these markets, including
local real estate conditions. Our operations may also be affected if too many competing properties are built in any of these markets.
If there is a downturn in the economy in any of these markets, our operations and our ability to make distributions to stockholders
could be adversely affected. We cannot assure you that these markets will continue to grow or will remain favorable to the life
science industry. </P>

<U><STRONG><P>We May Have Difficulty Managing Our Growth</P>
</U></STRONG><P>We have grown rapidly and expect to continue to grow by acquiring, redeveloping and selectively developing additional
properties. To manage our growth effectively, we must successfully integrate new properties into our existing operations. We may not
succeed with the integration. In addition, we may not effectively manage new properties, and new properties may not perform as

<U><STRONG><P>Our Debt Service Obligations May Have Adverse Consequences on Our Business Operations</P>
</U></STRONG><P>We use debt to finance our operations, including acquisitions of properties. Our incurrence of debt may have

<U><STRONG><P>Our Line of Credit Restricts Our Ability to Engage in Some Business Activities</P>
</U></STRONG><P>Our unsecured revolving credit facility contains customary negative covenants and other financial and operating
covenants that, among other things: </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness;</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>restrict our ability to make certain investments;</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>restrict our ability to merge with another company;</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>These restrictions could cause a default on our line of credit or have a negative effect on our operations and our ability to make
distributions to our stockholders. </P>

<U><STRONG><P>We May Not Be Able to Obtain Additional Capital to Further Our Business Objectives</P>
</U></STRONG><P>Our ability to acquire or develop properties is dependent upon our ability to obtain capital. An inability to obtain
capital on acceptable terms could delay or prevent us from acquiring, structuring and completing desirable investments, which would
adversely affect our business. Also, the issuance of additional shares of capital stock or interests in subsidiaries to fund future
operations could result in dilution of ownership for the then existing stockholders. </P>

<U><STRONG><P>If Interest Rates Rise, Our Debt Service Costs Will Increase</P>
</U></STRONG><P>Borrowings outstanding under our unsecured line of credit and certain other borrowings bear interest at a variable
rate, and we may incur additional variable rate debt in the future. Increases in market interest rates would increase our interest
expenses under these debt instruments and would increase the costs of refinancing existing indebtedness or obtaining new debt.
Accordingly, these increases could adversely affect our financial position and our ability to make distributions to stockholders.
</P>

<U><STRONG><P>We May Not Be Able to Acquire Properties or Operate Them Successfully</P>
</U></STRONG><P>Our success depends in large part upon our ability to acquire additional properties on satisfactory terms and to
operate them successfully. If we are unable to do so, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, the acquisition of life
science facilities generally involves a higher per square foot price than the acquisition of traditional suburban office properties.
</P>
<P>The acquisition, ownership and operation of real estate is subject to many risks, including the risks that: </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>our properties may not perform as we expect;</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>we may not be able to acquire a desired property because of competition from other real estate investors with

</U></STRONG><P>If our properties do not generate revenues sufficient to meet our operating expenses, including debt service and

<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In addition, if a lease at a property is not a triple net lease, we will have greater expenses associated with that property and
greater exposure to increases in such expenses. Significant expenditures, such as mortgage payments, real estate taxes, insurance and
maintenance costs, generally are fixed and do not decrease when revenues at the related property decrease. </P>

<U><STRONG><P>Improvements to Life Science Facilities Are More Costly Than Traditional Office Spaces</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Although we have historically been able to reflect the additional investment in generic infrastructure improvements in higher
rental rates, we are not sure that we will be able to continue to do so in the future. </P>

<U><STRONG><P>We May Not Be Able to Sell Our Properties Quickly to Raise Money</P>

</U></STRONG><P>Investments in real estate are relatively illiquid. Accordingly, we may not be able to sell our properties when we
desire or at acceptable prices in response to changes in economic or other conditions. In addition, the Internal Revenue Code limits
our ability to sell properties held for fewer than four years. These limitations on our ability to sell our properties may adversely
affect our cash flows and our ability to make distributions to stockholders. </P>

<U><STRONG><P>We Face Substantial Competition in Our Target Markets</P>
</U></STRONG><P>The significant competition for business in our target markets could have an adverse effect on our operations. We

<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>insurance companies;</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>pension and investment funds;</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>owner/occupants.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>



<P>Many of these entities have substantially greater financial resources than we do and may be able to accept more risk than we can
manage. These entities may be less sensitive to risks with respect to the creditworthiness of a tenant or the geographic proximity of
its investments. Competition from other entities also may reduce the number of suitable investment opportunities offered to us or may
increase the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell. </P>

<U><STRONG><P>Our Properties May Have Defects That Are Unknown to Us</P>

</U></STRONG><P>Although we review the physical condition of our properties before they are acquired, and on a periodic basis after
acquisition, any of our properties may have characteristics or deficiencies unknown to us that could adversely affect the property's
valuation or revenue potential. </P>

<U><STRONG><P>If We Fail to Qualify as a REIT, We Would Be Taxed at Corporate Rates and Would Not Be Able to Take Certain Deductions
When Computing Our Taxable Income</P>
</U></STRONG><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If in any taxable year we fail to qualify as a REIT: </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>we would be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates;</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing taxable income;</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>unless we were entitled to relief under the Internal Revenue Code, we would also be disqualified from treatment as a
REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which we lost qualification; and</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>we would no longer be required by the Internal Revenue Code to make any distributions to our stockholders.
</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>


<P>As a result of the additional tax liability, we might need to borrow funds or liquidate certain investments in order to pay the
applicable tax. Accordingly, funds available for investment or distribution to our stockholders would be reduced for each of the
years involved. </P>

<P>Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code to our
operations and the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. There are only limited
judicial or administrative interpretations of these provisions. Although we believe that we have operated since January 1996 in a
manner so as to qualify as a REIT, we cannot assure you that we are or will remain so qualified. </P>

<P>In addition, although we are not aware of any pending tax legislation that would adversely affect our ability to operate as a
REIT, new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could change the tax laws or interpretations of
the tax laws regarding qualification as a REIT, or the federal income tax consequences of that qualification, in an adverse manner.
</P>

<P>Although certain of our officers and directors have extensive experience in the acquisition, leasing, operation, financing and
development of real properties, prior to commencement of our operations, no officer had significant experience in operating a
business in accordance with the requirements for maintaining qualification as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code. </P>

<U><STRONG><P>There Are Limits on the Ownership of Our Capital Stock; A Stockholder May Lose Beneficial Ownership of Shares of Our
Common Stock Because of the Ownership Limits</P>

</U></STRONG><P>The Internal Revenue Code provides that, in order for us to maintain our qualification as a REIT, not more than 50%
of the value of our outstanding capital stock may be owned, directly or constructively, by five or fewer individuals or entities.
</P>

<P>In addition, our charter prohibits, with certain limited exceptions, direct or constructive ownership of shares of our capital
stock representing more than 9.8% of the combined total value of outstanding shares of our capital stock by any person (the
"Ownership Limit"). Our Board of Directors may exempt a stockholder from the Ownership Limit if, prior to the exemption, our Board of
Directors receives all information it deems necessary to determine or ensure our status as a REIT. </P>

<P>The constructive ownership rules are complex and may cause shares of our common stock owned directly or constructively by a group
of related individuals or entities to be constructively owned by one individual or entity. A transfer of shares to a person who, as a
result of the transfer, violates the Ownership Limit may be void or may be transferred to a trust, for the benefit of one or more
qualified charitable organizations designated by us. In that case, the intended transferee will have only a right to share, to the
extent of the transferee's original purchase price for such shares, in proceeds from the trust's sale of those shares. </P>

<U><STRONG><P>The Ownership Limit, Certain Other Provisions of Our Charter and Bylaws, and Our Stockholder Rights Plan May Delay or
Prevent Transactions that Stockholders May Deem to Be Desirable</P>

</U></STRONG><P>Our charter allows our Board of Directors to cause us to issue additional authorized but unissued shares of our
common stock or preferred stock without any stockholder approval. The issuance of preferred stock could make it more difficult for
another party to gain control of Alexandria. In addition, our Board of Directors could establish a series of preferred stock that
could delay, defer or prevent a transaction that might involve a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best
interest of our common stockholders. Our Board of Directors could also establish one or more additional series of preferred stock
that has a dividend preference, which may adversely affect our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. </P>

<P> Under our Stockholder Rights Plan, if a stockholder acquires beneficial ownership of 15% or more of our common stock, other
stockholders would become entitled to purchase our common stock at half the market price, which would likely result in substantial
dilution to the 15% or greater stockholder.  This, as well as the Ownership Limit described above and the additional provisions of
our charter and bylaws described below, could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control or other transaction that
might involve a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be considered by stockholders to be in their best interest.</P>

<P>As authorized by Maryland law, our charter permits our Board of Directors to authorize the issuance of additional authorized but
unissued shares of our common or preferred stock, and to classify or reclassify unissued shares of common or preferred stock, without
obtaining stockholder approval.  The issuance of preferred stock could, in addition to reducing our ability to pay dividends on our
common stock, make it more difficult for another party to gain control of Alexandria.  In addition, our charter permits the removal
of a director only upon two-thirds vote of the votes entitled to be cast at a meeting of stockholders and our bylaws require advance
notice of a stockholder's intention to nominate directors or present business for consideration by stockholders at an annual meeting
of our stockholders.</P>

<U><STRONG><P>Our Insurance May Not Adequately Cover All Potential Losses</P>
</U></STRONG><P>If we experience a loss at any of our properties that is not covered by insurance or that exceeds our insurance
policy limits, we could lose the capital invested in the affected property and, possibly, future revenues from that property. In
addition, we would continue to be obligated on any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the affected properties.
</P>

<P>We carry comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage and rental loss insurance with respect to our properties. We have
obtained earthquake insurance for all of our properties because many of them are located in the vicinity of active earthquake faults.
We also carry environmental remediation insurance and have title insurance policies on all of our properties. We obtain our title
insurance policies when we acquire the property. As a result, each policy covers an amount equal to the initial purchase price of
each property. Any of our title insurance policies may be in an amount less than the current value of the related property. </P>

<P>We believe that our insurance policy specifications, insured limits and deductibles are consistent with or superior to those
customarily carried for similar properties.  Our tenants are also required to maintain comprehensive insurance, including liability
and casualty insurance, that is customarily obtained for similar properties. There are, however, certain types of losses that we and
our tenants do not generally insure against because they are uninsurable or because it is not economical to insure against them.  In
the current market, there have been substantial increases in the premium cost of  property and liability insurance, and coverage
against terrorist activity has become difficult to obtain for high rise office buildings located in urban areas. We cannot predict
whether insurance coverage against terrorist activities will remain available for our properties,  most, but not all, of which are
low rise buildings in suburban areas</FONT><FONT SIZE=2 COLOR="#0000ff">.</P>

</FONT><U><FONT SIZE=2><STRONG><P>We Could Incur Significant Costs Complying With Environmental Laws</P>

</U></STRONG><P>Federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations may require us, as a current or prior owner or operator
of real estate, to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products released at or from any of our
properties. The cost of investigating and cleaning up contamination could be substantial. In addition, the presence of contamination,
or the failure to properly clean it up, may adversely affect our ability to sell or rent an affected property or to borrow funds
using that property as collateral. </P>

<P>Under environmental laws and regulations, we may have to pay governmental entities or third parties for property damage and for
investigation and clean-up costs incurred by those parties relating to contaminated properties regardless of whether we knew of or
caused the contamination. Even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination, we may be held responsible
for all of the clean-up costs. In addition, third parties may sue us for damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination
or jointly responsible parties may contest their responsibility or be financially unable to pay their share of such costs.</P>

<P>Environmental laws also govern the presence, maintenance and removal of asbestos-containing materials. These laws may impose fines
and penalties on us for the release of asbestos-containing materials and may allow third parties to seek recovery from us for
personal injury from exposure to asbestos fibers. We have detected asbestos-containing materials at some of our properties, but we do
not expect that it will result in material environmental costs or liabilities to us. </P>
<P>Environmental laws and regulations also require the removal or upgrading of certain underground storage tanks and regulate: </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>the discharge of storm water, wastewater and any water pollutants;</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>the emission of air pollutants;</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>the generation, management and disposal of hazardous or toxic chemicals, substances or wastes; and</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>workplace health and safety. </LI></BLOCKQUOTE>


<P>Some of our tenants routinely handle hazardous substances and wastes as part of their operations at our properties. Environmental
laws and regulations subject our tenants, and potentially us, to liability resulting from these activities. Environmental liabilities
could also affect a tenant's ability to make rental payments to us. We require our tenants to comply with these environmental laws
and regulations and to indemnify us for any related liabilities. </P>

<P>Independent environmental consultants have conducted Phase I or similar environmental assessments at all of our properties. We
intend to use consultants to conduct similar environmental assessments on our future acquisitions. This type of assessment generally
includes a site inspection, interviews and a public records review, but no subsurface sampling. These assessments and certain
additional investigations of our properties have not to date revealed any environmental liability that we believe would have a
material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The additional investigations included, as appropriate: </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>asbestos surveys;</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>radon surveys;</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>additional public records review;</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>subsurface sampling; and</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>other testing. </LI></BLOCKQUOTE>



<P>Nevertheless, it is possible that the assessments on our properties have not revealed, or that the assessments on future
acquisitions will not reveal, all environmental liabilities. Consequently, there may be material environmental liabilities of which
we are unaware that may result in substantial costs to us or our tenants and that could have a material adverse effect on our
business. </P>

<U><STRONG><P>We May Incur Significant Costs Complying With the Americans With Disabilities Act and Similar Laws</P>

</U></STRONG><P>Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, places of public accommodation and/or commercial facilities are required
to meet federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. We may be required to make substantial capital
expenditures at our properties to comply with this law. In addition, our noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines or an
award of damages to private litigants. </P>

<P>A number of additional federal, state and local laws and regulations exist regarding access by disabled persons. These regulations
may require modifications to our properties or may affect future renovations. This may limit the overall returns on our investments.
</P>

<P>We believe that our properties are substantially in compliance with the present requirements of the Americans with Disabilities
Act and similar laws. We have not, however, conducted an audit or an investigation of all of our properties to determine our
compliance. </P>

<U><STRONG><P>We May Incur Significant Costs If We Fail to Comply With Laws or If Laws Change</P>

</U></STRONG><P>Our properties are subject to many federal, state and local regulatory requirements and to state and local fire and
life-safety requirements. If we do not comply with all of these requirements, we may have to pay fines to governmental authorities or
damage awards to private litigants. </P>

<P>We believe that our properties are currently in compliance with all of these regulatory requirements. We do not know whether these
requirements will change or whether new requirements will be imposed. Changes in these regulatory requirements could require us to
make significant unanticipated expenditures. These expenditures could have an adverse effect on us and our ability to make
distributions to stockholders. </P>

<U><STRONG><P>The Loss of Services of Any of Our Executive Officers Could Adversely Affect Us</P>

</U></STRONG><P>We depend upon the services of relatively few executive officers. The loss of services of any one of our executive
officers could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and prospects. We use the extensive personal and business

<U><STRONG><P>We Could Become Highly Leveraged and Our Debt Service Obligations Could Increase</P>

</U></STRONG><P>Our organizational documents do not limit the amount of debt that we may incur. Therefore, we could become highly

<P>We have adopted a policy of incurring debt only if upon such incurrence our debt to total market capitalization ratio would not
exceed 57.5%. Our total market capitalization is the market value of our capital stock, including interests exchangeable for shares
of capital stock, plus total debt. Our Board of Directors could, however, change or eliminate this policy at any time. Higher
leverage also increases the risk of default on our debt obligations. </P>

<U><STRONG><P>Possible Future Sales of Shares of Our Common Stock Could Adversely Affect Its Market Price</P>

</U></STRONG><P>We cannot predict the effect, if any, of future sales of shares of our common stock on the market price of our common
stock from time to time. Sales of substantial amounts of capital stock (including common stock issued upon the exercise of stock
options), or the perception that such sales may occur, could adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock. </P>

<P>We have reserved for issuance to our officers, directors and employees pursuant to our Amended and Restated 1997 Stock Award and
Incentive Plan (the "Plan") that number of shares of our common stock that equals 12% of the total number of shares outstanding at
any time, provided that in no event may the number of shares of our common stock available for issuance under the Plan exceed
3,000,000 shares at any time.</P>

<P>As of December 31, 2001, options to purchase 849,870 shares of our common stock were outstanding, of which options to purchase
497,040 shares of our common stock were exercisable. We have filed a registration statement with respect to the issuance of shares of
our common stock pursuant to grants under the stock option plan. In addition, any shares issued under our stock option plan will be
available for sale in the public market from time to time without restriction by persons who are not our Affiliates (as defined in
Rule 144 adopted under the Securities Act of 1933). Affiliates will be able to sell shares of our common stock pursuant to exemptions
from the registration requirements or upon registration. </P>

<I><STRONG><P>Employees</P>

<P>Item 2. Properties.</P>
<I><P>General.</P>
</I></STRONG><P>Our properties range in size from approximately 15,000 to 248,000 square feet, are built to accommodate single or
multiple tenants and are generally one or two story concrete tilt-up, block and/or steel frame structures. The exteriors typically
resemble traditional suburban office properties, but interior infrastructures are designed to accommodate the needs of life science
industry tenants. These improvements typically are generic to life science industry tenants rather than being specific to a
particular tenant. As a result, we believe that the improvements have long-term value and utility and are usable by a wide range of
life science industry tenants. Generic infrastructure improvements include: </P>

<P>As of December 31, 2001, we had 194 leases with a total of 167 tenants, and 45 of our properties were single-tenant properties.
Leases in our multi-tenant buildings typically have terms of three to seven years, while the single-tenant building leases typically
have initial terms of 10 to 20 years. As of December 31, 2001: </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>approximately 82% of our leases (on a square footage basis) were triple net leases, requiring tenants to pay
substantially all real estate taxes and insurance, common area and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition
to base rent, and, in addition to our triple net leases, approximately 13% of our leases (on a square footage basis) required the
tenants to pay a majority of operating expenses;</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>approximately 92% of our leases (on a square footage basis) contained effective annual rent escalations that are
either fixed (generally ranging from 3% to 4%) or indexed based on a consumer price index or other index; and</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>approximately 87% of our leases (on a square footage basis) provided for the recapture of certain capital
expenditures (such as HVAC systems maintenance and/or replacement, roof replacement and parking lot resurfacing), which we believe
would typically be borne by the landlord in traditional office leases. </LI></BLOCKQUOTE>


<P>Our leases also typically give us the right to review and approve tenant alterations to the property. Generally, tenant-installed
improvements to the facilities remain our property after termination of the lease at our election. However, we are permitted under
the terms of most of our leases to require that the tenant remove the improvements and restore the premises to their original
condition. </P>

<FONT SIZE=2><P>Future distributions on our common stock will be determined by our Board of Directors and will be dependent upon a
number of factors, including actual cash available for distribution, our financial condition and capital requirements, the annual
distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and such other factors as our Board of Directors
deems relevant. To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must make annual distributions to stockholders of at least 90% of our
taxable income for the current taxable year, determined without regard to deductions for dividends paid and excluding any net capital
gains. Under certain circumstances, we may be required to make distributions in excess of cash flow available for distributions to
meet these distribution requirements. In such a case, we may borrow funds or may raise funds through the issuance of additional debt
or equity capital. We cannot assure you that we will make any future distributions.

<STRONG><P>Overview</P>
</STRONG><P>We are a publicly traded real estate operating company focused principally on the ownership, operation, management,
acquisition, expansion and selective redevelopment and development of high quality, strategically located properties containing
office/laboratory space leased principally to tenants in the life science industry (we refer to these properties as "life science
facilities"). </P>

<P>Our primary source of revenue is rental income and tenant recoveries from leases at the properties we own.  Of the 82 properties
we owned as of December 31, 2001, four were acquired in 1994, eight in 1996, ten in 1997, 29 in 1998 (the "1998 Properties"), six in
1999, 12 in 2000 and five in 2001. In addition, we completed the development of one property in 1999 (together with the six
properties acquired in 1999, the "1999 Properties"), five properties in 2000 (together with the 12 properties acquired in 2000, the
"2000 Properties") and two properties in 2001 (together with the five properties acquired in 2001, the "2001 Properties").  As a
result of these acquisition and development activities, there have been significant continuing increases in total revenues and
expenses, including significant increases in total revenues and expenses for 2001 as compared to 2000, and for 2000 as compared to
1999. </P>
<STRONG><P>Results of Operations</P>
<I><P>Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2001 to the Year Ended December 31, 2000</P>
</I></STRONG><P>Rental revenue increased by $16.7 million, or 20%, to $99.2 million for 2001 compared to $82.5 million for 2000. The
increase resulted primarily from the 2000 Properties being owned for a full period and the addition of the 2001 Properties.  Rental
revenue from properties operating for a full year during 2000 and 2001 (the "2001 Same Properties") increased by $3.7 million, or
6.4%, due to increases in rental rates and occupancy. </P>
<P>Tenant recoveries increased by $4.5 million, or 21%, to $25.4 million for 2001 compared to $20.9 million for 2000.  The increase
resulted primarily from the 2000 Properties being owned for a full period and the addition of the 2001 Properties.  Tenant recoveries
for the 2001 Same Properties increased by $516,000, or 3.2%, primarily due to increases in certain recoverable operating expenses.
</P>
<P>Interest and other income decreased by $238,000, or 7%, to $3.3 million for 2001 compared to $3.5 million for 2000, primarily due
to a decrease in interest income resulting from a decline in interest rates and a decline in service fee income.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Rental operating expenses increased by $4.2 million, or 19%, to $26.1 million for 2001 compared to $21.9 million for 2000.  The
increase resulted primarily from the 2000 Properties being owned for a full period and the addition of the 2001 Properties.
Operating expenses for the 2001 Same Properties increased by $983,000, or 5.9%, primarily due to an increase in utilities and tenant
related expenses (substantially all of which are recoverable from our tenants through tenant recoveries).</P>

<P>General and administrative expenses increased by $2.7 million, or 30%, to $11.7 million for 2001 compared to $9.0 million for 2000

<P>Interest expense increased by $3.3 million, or 13%, to $29.1 million for 2001 compared to $25.8 million for 2000.  The increase
resulted from (a) indebtedness incurred to acquire the 2000 and 2001 Properties and (b) indebtedness incurred to finance the
development and redevelopment of properties which have now been completed.  The increase in interest expense caused by these factors
was partially offset by a decrease in the floating interest rate on our unsecured line of credit.  The weighted average interest rate
on our borrowings (not including the effect of swap agreements) decreased from 8.32% as of December 31, 2000 to 3.92% as of December
31, 2001.  We have entered into certain swap agreements to hedge our borrowings at variable interest rates (see "Liquidity and

<P>Depreciation and amortization increased by $6.3 million, or 26%, to $30.6 million for 2001 compared to $24.3 million for 2000.

for the 2000 Same Properties increased by $2.3 million, or 17.1%, generally due to an increase in certain recoverable operating
expenses. </P>
<P>Interest and other income increased by $2.0 million, or 129%, to $3.5 million for 2000 compared to $1.5 million for 1999,

increase resulted primarily from the 1999 Properties being owned for a full period and the addition of the 2000 Properties.
Operating expenses for the 2000 Same Properties increased by $1.0 million, or 5.9%, primarily due to the increase in tenant related

</FONT><I><FONT SIZE=2><STRONG><P>Unsecured Line of Credit and Unsecured Term Loan</P>
</I></STRONG><P>We have an unsecured line of credit that provides for borrowings of up to $325 million.  Borrowings under the line of
credit bear interest at a floating rate based on our election of either a LIBOR based rate or the higher of the bank's reference rate
and the Federal Funds rate plus 0.5%.  For each LIBOR based advance, we must elect to fix the rate for a period of one, two, three or
six months. </P>
<P>The line of credit contains financial covenants, including, among other things, maintenance of minimum net worth, a total
liabilities to gross asset value ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio. In addition, the terms of the line of credit restrict,
among other things, certain investments, indebtedness, distributions and mergers.  The line of credit expires February 2003 and
provides for an extension (provided there is no default) for an additional one-year period upon notice by the company and consent of
the participating banks.  As of December 31, 2001, borrowings under the line of credit carried a weighted average interest rate of
3.92%. </P>
<P>In October 2001, we obtained a $50 million unsecured term loan which bears interest at a floating rate based on our election of
either a LIBOR based rate or the higher of the bank's reference rate and the Federal Funds rate plus 0.5%. For each LIBOR based
advance, we must elect to fix the rate for a period of one, two, three or six months.  The term loan contains financial covenants
substantially similar to those on our line of credit.  As of December 31, 2001, the term loan carried a weighted average interest
rate of 3.98%.</P>
<P>Aggregate borrowings under the line of credit and the term loan are limited to an amount based on the net operating income derived
from a pool of unencumbered assets.  Accordingly, as we acquire or complete the development or redevelopment of additional
unencumbered properties, aggregate borrowings available under the line of credit and the term loan will increase up to the maximum of
$375 million.  Under these provisions, as of December 31, 2001, aggregate borrowings under the line of credit and the term loan were
limited to $360 million.</P>
<P>We utilize interest rate swap agreements to hedge our exposure to variable interest rates associated with our unsecured line of
credit and unsecured term loan.  These agreements involve an exchange of fixed and floating interest payments without the exchange of
the underlying principal amount (the "notional amount").  Interest received under all of our swap agreements is based on the one-
month LIBOR rate.  The net difference between the interest paid and the interest received is reflected as an adjustment to interest
expense.</P>

<P>Effective January 1, 2001, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 (SFAS 133), "Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended by Statement No. 138, "Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain
Hedging Activities."  SFAS 133, as amended, establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative financial instruments such
as our interest rate swap agreements.  Specifically, SFAS 133 requires us to reflect our interest rate swap agreements on the balance
sheet at their estimated fair value.  We use a variety of methods and assumptions based on market conditions and risks existing at
each balance sheet date to determine the fair values of our interest rate swap agreements.  These methods of assessing fair value
result in a general approximation of value, and such value may never be realized.  As of January 1, 2001, the adoption of SFAS 133,
as amended, resulted in qualifying interest rate swap agreements reported on the balance sheet as a liability of approximately $3.5
million, with a corresponding reduction to accumulated other comprehensive income, a separate component of stockholders' equity.</P>
<P>All of our interest rate swap agreements meet the criteria to be deemed "effective" under SFAS 133 in reducing our exposure to
variable interest rates.  Accordingly, we have categorized these instruments as cash flow hedges.  While we intend to continue to
meet the conditions for hedge accounting, if hedges did not qualify as highly effective, the changes in the fair value of the
derivatives used as hedges would be reflected in earnings.</P>
<P>We do not believe we are exposed to more than a nominal amount of credit risk in our interest rate swap agreements as the
counterparties are established, well-capitalized financial institutions.  In addition, we have entered into master derivative
agreements to minimize those risks.</P>
<P>On January 22, 2001, we terminated an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $50 million, an interest pay rate of
7.25% and a maturity of December 31, 2001.  The terminated interest rate swap agreement was replaced with the 6.350% interest rate
swap agreement as shown in the table above.  The fair value of the terminated interest rate swap agreement at the date of termination
(a liability of $950,000) was transferred to the replacement 6.350% interest rate swap agreement.  During 2001, approximately
$475,000 was reclassified from other comprehensive income to interest expense.  Approximately $475,000 will be credited against
interest expense during 2002.  These adjustments result in an effective interest pay rate for the 6.350% interest rate swap agreement
of 7.30% for 2001 and 5.40% for 2002.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As of December 31, 2001, our interest rate swap agreements have been reported in the accompanying balance sheet at their fair
value as other liabilities of approximately $7.5 million. The offsetting adjustments were reflected as deferred losses in accumulated
other comprehensive income of $7.0 million.  Balances in accumulated other comprehensive income are recognized in earnings as swap
payments are made.</P>

<STRONG><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Valuation of Investments</P></STRONG>
<P>&#9;We hold equity investments in certain publicly traded companies and privately held entities.  In determining if and when a
decline in the market value of these investments below amortized cost is other than temporary, we evaluate the market conditions,
offering prices, trends of earnings and other key measures.  When such a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary, we
recognize an impairment loss in the current period operating results to the extent of the decline.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<STRONG><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Other Resources and Liquidity Requirements</P></STRONG>
</STRONG><P>In April 2001, we sold 500,000 shares of common stock to institutional investors.  The shares were issued at a price of
$36.44 per share, resulting in aggregate proceeds of approximately $16.8 million, net of offering costs.</P>
<P>We expect to continue meeting our short-term liquidity and capital requirements generally through our working capital and net cash
provided by operating activities.  We believe that the net cash provided by operating activities will continue to be sufficient to
enable us to make distributions necessary to continue qualifying as a REIT.  We also believe that net cash provided by operating
activities will be sufficient to fund our recurring non-revenue enhancing capital expenditures, tenant improvements and leasing
commissions. </P>
<P>We expect to meet certain long-term liquidity requirements, such as property acquisitions, property development and redevelopment
activities, scheduled debt maturities, expansions and other non-recurring capital improvements, through excess net cash provided by
operating activities, long-term secured and unsecured borrowings, including borrowings under the line of credit and the issuance of
additional debt and/or equity securities. </P>
<STRONG><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Exposure to Environmental Liabilities</P>
</STRONG><P>In connection with the acquisition of all of our properties, we have obtained Phase I environmental assessments to
ascertain the existence of any environmental liabilities or other issues.  The Phase I environmental assessments of our properties
have not revealed any environmental liabilities that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or
results of operations taken as a whole, nor are we aware of any material environmental liabilities that have occurred since the Phase
I environmental assessments were completed.  In addition, we carry a policy of pollution legal liability insurance covering exposure
to certain environmental losses at all of our properties.</P>

</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P>Capital expenditures fluctuate in any given period due to the nature, extent and timing of improvements
required and the extent to which they are recoverable from our tenants. Approximately 87% of our leases provide for the recapture of
certain capital expenditures (such as HVAC systems maintenance and/or replacement, roof replacement and parking lot resurfacing).  In
addition, we maintain an active preventative maintenance program at each of our properties to minimize capital expenditures required.
</P>


<P>Tenant improvements and leasing costs also fluctuate in any given year depending upon factors such as the timing and extent of
vacancies, property characteristics, the type of lease (renewal tenant or retenanted space), the involvement of external leasing
agents and overall competitive market conditions.  </P>

<STRONG><P>Inflation</P>

</STRONG><P>As of December 31, 2001, approximately 82% of our leases (on a square footage basis) were triple net leases, requiring
tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes and insurance, common area and other operating expenses (including increases
thereto).  In addition, approximately 13% of our leases (on a square footage basis) required the tenants to pay a majority of
operating expenses. Approximately 92% of our leases (on a square footage basis) contain effective annual rent escalations that are
either fixed (generally ranging from 3% to 4%) or indexed based on the consumer price index or another index. Accordingly, we do not
believe that our earnings or cash flow from real estate operations are subject to any significant risk of inflation. An increase in
inflation, however, could result in an increase in the cost of our variable rate borrowings, including our unsecured line of credit
and unsecured term loan. </P>

<STRONG><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Funds from Operations</P>
</STRONG><P>We believe that funds from operations ("FFO") is helpful to investors as an additional measure of the performance of an
equity REIT because, along with cash flows from operating activities, financing activities and investing activities, it provides
investors with an understanding of our ability to incur and service debt, to make capital expenditures and to make distributions.  We
compute FFO in accordance with standards established by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment
Trusts ("NAREIT") in its October 1999 White Paper (the "White Paper"), which may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO
utilized by other equity REITs, and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs.  Further, FFO does not represent amounts
available for our discretionary use because a portion of FFO is needed for capital replacement or expansion, debt service obligations
or other commitments and uncertainties.  The White Paper defines FFO as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP),
excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for
unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in
accordance with GAAP) as an indication of our financial performance, or to cash flows from operating activities (determined in
accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our
ability to make distributions. (See "Cash Flows" for information regarding these measures of cash flow.) </P>

</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><STRONG><P>Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk</P>

</STRONG><P>Market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity
prices and equity prices.  The primary market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk, which is sensitive to many factors,
including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors
that are beyond our control. </P>
<P>In order to modify and manage the interest characteristics of our outstanding debt and limit the effects of interest rates on our
operations, we may utilize a variety of financial instruments, including interest rate swaps, caps, floors and other interest rate
exchange contracts.  The use of these types of instruments to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates carries additional
risks such as counter-party credit risk and the legal enforceability of hedging contracts. </P>
<P>Our future earnings, cash flows and fair values relating to financial instruments are primarily dependent upon prevalent market
rates of interest, such as LIBOR. However, due to the purchase of our interest rate swap agreements, the current effects of interest
rate changes are reduced.  Based on interest rates at, and our swap agreements in effect on, December 31, 2001, a 1% increase in
interest rates on our line of credit and term loan would decrease annual future earnings and cash flows, after considering the effect
of our interest rate swap agreements, by approximately $1.8 million.  A 1% decrease in interest rates on our line of credit and term
loan would increase annual future earnings and cash flows, after considering the effect of our interest rate swap agreements, by
approximately $1.8 million.  A 1% increase in interest rates on our secured debt and interest rate swap agreements would decrease
their fair value by approximately $16.9 million.  A 1% decrease in interest rates on our secured debt and interest rate swap
agreements would increase their fair value by approximately $18.1 million.  A 1% increase or decrease in interest rates on our
secured note receivable would not have a material impact on its fair value. </P>
<P>These amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost and our interest
rate swap agreements.  These analyses do not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist
in such an environment.  Further, in the event of a change of such magnitude, we would consider taking actions to further mitigate
our exposure to the change. However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects,
the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in our capital structure. </P>

</FONT></STRONG><FONT SIZE=2><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of<BR>
Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. </P>
<P>We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. and subsidiaries (the
"Company") as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed
in the index at item 14(a). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits. </P>
<P>We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. </P>
<P>In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial
position of Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. and subsidiaries at December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the consolidated results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information
set forth therein. </P>

<FONT SIZE=2><P>1. Background</P>
</STRONG><P>Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. is a real estate investment trust ("REIT") formed in 1994.  We are engaged
primarily in the ownership, operation, management, acquisition, expansion and selective redevelopment and development of properties
containing a combination of office and laboratory space.  We refer to these properties as "life science facilities."  Our life
science facilities are designed and improved for lease primarily to pharmaceutical, biotechnology, life science product and service
companies, not-for-profit scientific research institutions, universities and related government agencies.  As of December 31, 2001,
our portfolio consisted of 82 properties in nine states with approximately 5,320,000 rentable square feet, compared to 75 properties
in nine states with approximately 4,857,000 rentable square feet as of December 31, 2000. </P>
<STRONG><P>2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies</P>

<P>Basis of Presentation</P>
</STRONG><P>The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Alexandria and its subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. </P>

<STRONG><P>Use of Estimates</P>
</STRONG><P>The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States, requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. </P>

<STRONG><P>Cash Equivalents</P>
</STRONG><P>We consider all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash
equivalents. </P>

<P><STRONG>Investments</P>
</STRONG><P>We hold equity investments in certain publicly traded companies and privately held entities primarily involved in the
life science industry. All of our investments in publicly traded companies are considered "available for sale" under the provisions
of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities," and have
been included at fair value in other assets in the accompanying balance sheets.  Fair value has been determined by the most recently
traded price at the balance sheet date, with unrealized gains and losses shown as a separate component of stockholders' equity.  The
cost of investments sold is determined by the specific identification method, with realized gains and losses included in interest and
other income.</P>

</STRONG><P>Rental properties and property under development are stated at the lower of cost or estimated fair value. Write-downs to
estimated fair value would be recognized when impairment indicators are present and a property's estimated undiscounted future cash
flows, before interest charges, are less than its book value. In that situation, we would recognize an impairment loss to the extent
the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the property. Based on our assessment, no write-downs to estimated fair value were
necessary for the periods presented. </P>

<P>The cost of maintenance and repairs is expensed as incurred. Major replacements and betterments are capitalized and depreciated
over their estimated useful lives. </P>

<P>Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method using estimated lives of 30 to 40 years for buildings and building

<P>Loan Fees and Costs</P>
</STRONG><P>Fees and costs incurred in obtaining long-term financing are amortized over the terms of the related loans and included
in interest expense. Loan fees and costs, net of related amortization, totaled $6,815,000 and $5,810,000 as of December 31, 2001 and
2000, respectively, and are included in other assets on our balance sheets. </P>

<STRONG><P>Rental Income</P>
</STRONG><P>Rental income from leases with scheduled rent increases, free rent and other rent adjustments are recognized on a
straight-line basis over the respective lease term. We include amounts currently recognized as income, and expected to be received in
later years, in deferred rent on our balance sheets. Amounts received currently, but recognized as income in future years, are
included in accrued expenses as unearned rent on our balance sheets. </P>

<B><P>Interest Income</P>
</B><P>Interest income was $923,000, $1,025,000 and $1,013,000 in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, and is included in interest and

amortization, totaled $14,559,000 and $11,652,000 as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, and are included in other assets on
our balance sheets. </P>

<STRONG><P>Fair Value of Financial Instruments</P>
</STRONG><P>The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value. The carrying amount of our secured note
receivable approximates fair value because the applicable interest rate approximates the market rate for this loan. </P>
<P>The fair value of our secured notes payable was estimated using discounted cash flows analyses based on borrowing rates we believe
we could obtain with similar terms and maturities. As of December 31, 2001 and 2000, the fair value of our secured notes payable was

</STRONG><P>We have an unsecured line of credit that provides for borrowings of up to $325 million.  Borrowings under the line of
credit bear interest at a floating rate based on our election of either a LIBOR based rate or the higher of the bank's reference rate
and the Federal Funds rate plus 0.5%. For each LIBOR based advance, we must elect to fix the rate for a period of one, two, three or
six months. </P>

<P>The line of credit contains financial covenants, including, among other things, maintenance of minimum net worth, a total
liabilities to gross asset value ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio. In addition, the terms of the line of credit restrict,
among other things, certain investments, indebtedness, distributions and mergers.  The line of credit expires February 2003 and
provides for an extension (provided there is no default) for an additional one-year period upon notice by the company and consent of
the participating banks.  As of December 31, 2001, borrowings outstanding on the line of credit carried a weighted average interest
rate of 3.92%. </P>

<P>In October 2001, we obtained a $50 million unsecured term loan which bears interest at a floating rate based on our election of
either a LIBOR based rate or the higher of the bank's reference rate and the Federal Funds rate plus 0.5%.  For each LIBOR based
advance, we must elect to fix the rate for a period of one, two, three or six months.  The term loan contains financial covenants
substantially similar to those on our line of credit.  As of December 31, 2001, the term loan carried a weighted average interest
rate of 3.98%.</P>

<P>Aggregate borrowings under the line of credit and the term loan are limited to an amount based on the net operating income derived
from a pool of unencumbered assets. Accordingly, as we acquire or complete the development or redevelopment of additional
unencumbered properties, aggregate borrowings available under the line of credit and the term loan will increase up to the maximum of
$375 million.  Under these provisions, as of December 31, 2001, aggregate borrowings under the line of credit and the term loan were
limited to $360 million.</P>

<P>We utilize interest rate swap agreements to hedge our exposure to variable interest rates associated with our unsecured line of
credit.  These agreements involve an exchange of fixed and floating interest payments without the exchange of the underlying
principal amount (the "notional amount").  Interest received under all of our swap agreements is based on the one-month LIBOR rate.
The net difference between the interest paid and interest received is reflected as an adjustment to interest expense.</P>

<P>Effective January 1, 2001, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 (SFAS 133), "Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended by Statement No. 138, "Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain
Hedging Activities."  SFAS 133, as amended, establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative financial instruments such
as our interest rate swap agreements.  Specifically, SFAS 133 requires us to reflect our interest rate swap agreements on the balance
sheet at their estimated fair value.  We use a variety of methods and assumptions based on market conditions and risks existing at
each balance sheet date to determine the fair values of our interest rate swap agreements.  These methods of assessing fair value
result in a general approximation of value, and such value may never be realized.  As of January 1, 2001, the adoption of SFAS 133,
as amended, resulted in qualifying interest rate swap agreements reported on the balance sheet as a liability of approximately $3.5
million, with a corresponding reduction to accumulated other comprehensive income, a separate component of stockholders' equity.</P>

<P>All of our interest rate swap agreements meet the criteria to be deemed "effective" under SFAS 133 in reducing our exposure to
variable interest rates.  Accordingly, we have categorized these instruments as cash flow hedges.</P>

<P>On January 22, 2001, we terminated an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $50 million, an interest pay rate of
7.25% and a maturity of December 31, 2001.  The terminated interest rate swap agreement was replaced with the 6.350% interest rate
swap agreement as shown in the table above.  The fair value of the terminated interest rate swap agreement at the date of termination
(a liability of $950,000) was transferred to the replacement 6.350% interest rate swap agreement.  During 2001, approximately
$475,000 was reclassified from other comprehensive income to interest expense.  Approximately $475,000 will be credited against
interest expense during 2002.  These adjustments result in an effective interest pay rate for the 6.350% interest rate swap agreement
of 7.30% for 2001 and 5.40% for 2002.</P>

<P>As of December 31, 2001, our interest rate swap agreements have been reported in the accompanying balance sheet at their fair
value as other liabilities of approximately $7.5 million.   The offsetting adjustments were reflected as deferred losses in
accumulated other comprehensive income of $7.0 million.  Balances in accumulated other comprehensive income are recognized in
earnings as swap payments are made.</P>

<STRONG><P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>9. Preferred Stock and Excess Stock</P>

<P>Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock</P>
</STRONG><P>In June 1999, we completed a public offering of 1,543,500 shares of our 9.50% Series A cumulative redeemable preferred
stock (including the shares issued upon exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option). The shares were issued at a price of
$25.00 per share, resulting in aggregate proceeds of approximately $36.9 million, net of underwriters' discounts and commissions and
other offering costs. The dividends on our Series A preferred stock are cumulative and accrue from the date of original issuance. We
pay dividends quarterly in arrears at an annual rate of $2.375 per share. Our Series A preferred stock has no stated maturity, is not
subject to any sinking fund or mandatory redemption and is not redeemable prior to June 11, 2004, except in order to preserve our
status as a REIT. Investors in our Series A preferred stock generally have no voting rights. On or after June 11, 2004, we may, at
our option, redeem our Series A preferred stock, in whole or in part, at any time for cash at a redemption price of $25.00 per share,
plus accrued and unpaid dividends. </P>

<STRONG><P>Preferred Stock and Excess Stock Authorizations</P>
</STRONG><P>Our charter authorizes the issuance of up to 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, of which 1,543,500 shares were issued
and outstanding as of December 31, 2001. In addition, 200,000,000 shares of "excess stock" (as defined) are authorized, none of which
were issued and outstanding at December 31, 2001. </P>

<STRONG><P>10. Commitments and Contingencies</P>

<P>Employee Retirement Savings Plan</P>
</STRONG><P>Effective January 1, 1997, we adopted a retirement savings plan pursuant to Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code
("Code") whereby our employees may contribute a portion of their compensation to their respective retirement accounts, in an amount
not to exceed the maximum allowed under the Code. The plan provides that we contribute eight percent of our employees' salary
(subject to statutory limitations), which amounted to $353,000, $254,000 and $185,000, respectively, for the years ended December 31,
2001, 2000 and 1999. Employees who participate in the plan are immediately vested in their contributions and in the contributions of
the company. </P>

<STRONG><P>Concentration of Credit Risk</P>
</STRONG><P>We maintain our cash and cash equivalents at insured financial institutions. The combined account balances at each
institution periodically exceed FDIC insurance coverage, and, as a result, there is a concentration of credit risk related to amounts
in excess of FDIC insurance coverage. We believe that the risk is not significant. </P>

<P>We are dependent on rental income from relatively few tenants in the life science industry. The inability of any single tenant to
make its lease payments could adversely affect our operations. As of December 31, 2001, we had 194 leases with a total of 167 tenants
and 45 of our 82 properties were each leased to a single tenant. At December 31, 2001, our three largest tenants accounted for
approximately 14.1% of our aggregate annualized base rent. </P>

<P>We generally do not require collateral or other security from our tenants, other than security deposits.  In addition to security
deposits held in cash, we hold $10.8 million in irrevocable letters of credit available from certain tenants as security deposits for
37 leases as of December 31, 2001. </P>

<STRONG><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>10. Commitments and Contingencies (continued)</P>
<P>Commitments</P>
</STRONG><P>As of December 31, 2001, we were committed under the terms of certain leases to complete the construction of buildings
and certain related improvements at a remaining aggregate cost of $12.9 million. </P>

<P>As of December 31, 2001, we were also committed to fund approximately $39.1 million for the construction of building
infrastructure improvements under the terms of various leases and for certain investments. </P>
<STRONG><P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>11. Stock Option Plans and Stock Grants</P>

<P>1997 Stock Plan</P>
</STRONG><P>In 1997, we adopted a stock option and incentive plan (the "1997 Stock Plan") for the purpose of attracting and retaining
the highest quality personnel, providing for additional incentives and promoting the success of the company by providing employees
the opportunity to acquire common stock pursuant to (i) options to purchase common stock; and (ii) share awards. As of December 31,
2001, a total of 409,623 shares were reserved for the granting of future options and share awards under the 1997 Stock Plan. </P>
<P>Options under our plan have been granted at prices that are equal to the market value of the stock on the date of grant and expire
ten years after the date of grant. Employee options vest ratably in three annual installments from the date of grant. Non-employee
director options vest immediately on the date of grant. The options outstanding under the 1997 Stock Plan expire at various dates
through November 2011. </P>

<P>In addition, the 1997 Stock Plan permits us to issue share awards to our employees and non-employee directors. A share award is an
award of common stock which (i) may be fully vested upon issuance or (ii) may be subject to the risk of forfeiture under Section 83
of the Internal Revenue Code. For employees, these shares generally vest over a one-year period and the sale of the shares is
restricted prior to the date of vesting. For non-employee directors, these shares are generally fully vested upon issuance and the
sale of the shares is not restricted. During 2001, we awarded 122,555 shares of common stock. These shares were recorded at fair
value with a corresponding charge to stockholders' equity. The unearned portion is amortized as compensation expense on a straight-
line basis over the vesting period. </P>

Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" ("APB 25") and related Interpretations in accounting for
our employee and non-employee director stock options, stock grants and stock appreciation rights. Under APB 25, because the exercise
price of the options we granted equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant, no compensation expense has
been recognized. Although we have elected to follow APB 25, pro forma information regarding net income and net income per share is
required by Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation." This information has
been determined as if we had accounted for our stock options under the fair value method under Statement 123. The fair value of the
options issued under the 1997 Stock Plan was estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the

<P>13. Subsequent Event (Unaudited)</P>
</STRONG><P>In January 2002, we completed a public offering of 2,300,000 shares of our 9.10% Series B cumulative redeemable preferred
stock (including the shares issued upon exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option).  The shares were issued at a price of
$25.00 per share, resulting in aggregate proceeds of approximately $55.1 million, net of underwriters' discounts and other offering
costs. The dividends on our Series B preferred stock are cumulative and accrue from the date of original issuance.  We pay dividends
quarterly in arrears at an annual rate of $2.275 per share.  Our Series B preferred stock has no stated maturity, is not subject to
any sinking fund or mandatory redemption and is not redeemable prior to January 22, 2007, except in order to preserve our status as a
REIT.  Investors in our Series B preferred stock generally have no voting rights.  On or after January 22, 2007, we may, at our
option, redeem our Series B preferred stock, in whole or in part, at any time for cash at a redemption price of $25.00 per share,
plus accrued and unpaid dividends.</P>

<P>In February 2002, we sold 418,970 shares of our common.  The shares were issued at a price of $39.46 per share, resulting in
aggregate proceeds of approximately $16.4 million (after deducting underwriting discounts and other offering costs).</P>
