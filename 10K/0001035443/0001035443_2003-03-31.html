</STRONG><P>This document contains forward-looking statements within the meaning
of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  You can identify some of the
forward-looking statements by the use of forward-looking words such as
"believes", "expects", "may", "will", "should", "seeks", "intends", "plans",
"estimates" or "anticipates", or the negative of these words or similar words.
Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties regarding
events, conditions and financial trends that may affect our future plans of
operation, business strategy, results of operations and financial position.  A
number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from
those included within or contemplated by the forward-looking statements,
including, but not limited to, those described below under the headings
"Business Risks" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations."  We do not undertake any responsibility to
update any of these factors or to announce publicly any revisions to any of the
forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future
events or otherwise. </P>
<STRONG><P>Item 1. Business</P>
<I><P>General</P>
</I></STRONG><P>We are a Maryland corporation formed in October 1994 that has
elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, for federal
income tax purposes.  We are engaged primarily in the ownership, operation,
management, acquisition, expansion and selective redevelopment and development
of high quality, strategically located properties containing office and
laboratory space designed and improved for lease principally to pharmaceutical,
biotechnology, life science product and services companies, not-for-profit
scientific research institutions, universities and related government agencies
(collectively, the "life science industry").  Properties leased to tenants in
the life science industry typically consist of suburban office buildings
containing scientific research and development laboratories and other
improvements that are generic to tenants operating in the life science industry.
We refer to such properties as "life science facilities."  As of December 31,
2002, we owned 89 properties (collectively, the "properties"), containing
approximately 5.7 million rentable square feet of office and laboratory space.
</P>
<I><STRONG><P>Business and Growth Strategy</P>
</I></STRONG><P>We focus our property operations and investment activities
principally in the following life science markets: </P>



<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>California (in the San Diego, Pasadena and San Francisco Bay
areas).</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>Seattle. </LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>suburban Washington, D.C. (including Maryland and
Virginia).</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>eastern Massachusetts.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>New Jersey and suburban Philadelphia.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>the Southeast (including North Carolina and Georgia).
</LI></BLOCKQUOTE></UL>
</UL>

<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Our tenant base is broad and diverse within the life science industry and
reflects our focus on regional, national and international tenants with
substantial financial and operational resources.  For a detailed description of
our properties and tenants, see "Item 2. Properties."  We are led by a senior
management team with extensive experience in both the real estate and life
science industries and are supported by an experienced Board of Directors. </P>
<P>We seek to maximize growth in funds from operations ("FFO") and cash
available for distribution to stockholders through ownership, operation,
management, acquisition, expansion and selective redevelopment and development
of life science facilities.  See "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Funds from Operations" for a
discussion of how we compute and view FFO, as well as a discussion of other
measures of cash flow. In particular, we seek to increase FFO and cash available
for distribution by: </P>


<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>acquiring high quality life science facilities at prices that
will enable us to realize attractive returns in our life science
markets.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>expanding existing or newly acquired properties or redeveloping
existing office, warehouse or vacant space into generic laboratory space that
can be leased at higher rental rates.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>selectively developing properties, primarily on a build-to-suit
basis. </LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>retenanting and releasing space within our portfolio at higher
rental rates and with minimal non-revenue enhancing tenant improvement
costs.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>realizing contractual rental rate escalations, which are
currently provided for in approximately 93% of our leases.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>implementing effective cost control measures, including
negotiating pass-through provisions in tenant leases for operating expenses and
certain capital expenditures.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>managing the level of debt on our balance sheet and our exposure
to floating rate debt.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE></UL>
</UL>

<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P>Internal Growth</U>. We seek to achieve internal growth from several sources.
For example, we seek to: </P>


<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>include rental rate escalation provisions in our
leases.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>improve investment returns through releasing of vacant space and
replacement of existing tenants with new tenants at higher rental
rates.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>achieve higher rental rates as existing leases expire.
</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>expand existing facilities that are fully leased and/or
redevelop existing and/or newly acquired space to higher rent, generic
laboratory space.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>implement effective cost control measures, including negotiating
pass-through provisions in tenant leases for operating expenses and certain
capital expenditures.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE></UL>
</UL>

<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Our ability to negotiate contractual rent escalations in future leases and to
achieve increases in rental rates will depend upon market conditions and the
demand for life science facilities at the time the leases are negotiated and the
increases are proposed.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<U><P>Acquisitions</U>. We seek to identify and acquire high quality life
science facilities in our target markets on a selective basis.  Critical
evaluation of prospective property acquisitions is an essential component of our
acquisition strategy.  When evaluating acquisition opportunities, we assess a
full range of matters relating to the properties, including the: </P>


<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>location of the property and our strategy in the relevant
market.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>quality of existing and prospective tenants.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>condition and capacity of the building
infrastructure.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>quality and generic characteristics of laboratory
facilities.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>physical condition of the structure and common area
improvements.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>opportunities available for leasing vacant space and for
retenanting occupied space.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>opportunities to redevelop existing space into higher rent
generic laboratory space.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>opportunities to expand the existing
facility.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE></UL>

<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P>Redevelopment.</U> We seek to enhance our growth by redeveloping existing
office, warehouse or vacant space as generic laboratory space that can be leased
at higher rates.  As of December 31, 2002, we had 12 properties in our
redevelopment program that contained a total of 890,000 square feet.  Of this
total, 429,000 square feet are under redevelopment and currently vacant, and the
remaining 461,000 square feet are currently leased.  We also have identified
approximately 265,000 square feet of additional space in our existing portfolio
for potential redevelopment opportunities.</P>

<P>Due to the fact that space undergoing redevelopment is vacant, our
redevelopment program has the effect of currently reducing rental revenue and
FFO.  Despite our ongoing redevelopment activities, we have achieved consistent
growth in FFO.</P>
<U><P>Development</U>. Our development strategy is primarily to pursue selective
build-to-suit projects where we expect to achieve investment returns that will
equal or exceed our returns on acquisitions.  We generally have undertaken
build-to-suit projects only if our investment in infrastructure will be
substantially made for generic, rather than tenant specific, improvements.  On
occasion, we also develop properties in certain life science markets before we
have leases in place.  Since our initial public offering, we have completed the
development of ten properties containing approximately 643,000 rentable square
feet of office and warehouse space. </P>
<U><P>Financing/Working Capital</U>. We believe that cash provided by operations
and our unsecured line of credit will be sufficient to fund our working capital
requirements.  We generally expect to finance future acquisitions and
redevelopment and development projects through our unsecured line of credit and
then to refinance some or all of that indebtedness periodically with additional
equity or debt capital.  We may also issue shares of our common stock, preferred
stock or interests in our subsidiaries to fund future operations. </P>
<P>We seek to maintain a balance between the amounts of our fixed and variable
debt with a view to moderating our exposure to interest rate risk.  We also use
financial instruments, such as interest rate swap agreements, to hedge our
exposure to the variable interest rates associated with our unsecured line of
credit.  Interest rate swap agreements involve an exchange of fixed and floating
interest payments without the exchange of the underlying principal or "notional
amount."  Interest received under our current interest rate swap agreements is
based on the one-month LIBOR rate.  See "Item 7. Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital
Resources" for a complete discussion of our unsecured line of credit, interest
rate swap agreements and other outstanding indebtedness. </P>
<I><STRONG><P>Business Risks</P>
</I><U><P>We Are Largely Dependent on the Life Sciences Industry for Revenues
from Lease Payments</P>
</U></STRONG><P>In general, our strategy is to invest primarily in properties
used by tenants in the life science industry.  Our business could be adversely
affected if the life science industry experiences an economic downturn.  Because
of our industry focus, events within the life science industry may have a more
pronounced effect on our ability to make distributions to our stockholders than
if we had diversified investments.  Also, our properties may be better suited
for a particular life science industry tenant and could require modification
before we are able to release vacant space to another life science industry
tenant.  Generally, our properties also may not be suitable for lease to
traditional office tenants without significant expenditures on renovations. </P>
<U><STRONG><P>Our Tenants May Not Be Able to Pay Us if They Are Unsuccessful in
Discovering, Developing, Making or Selling Their Products and Technologies</P>
</U></STRONG><P>Our life science industry tenants are subject to a number of
risks, including the following, any one or more of which may adversely affect
their ability to make rental payments to us: </P>


<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>Some of our tenants require significant funding to develop and
commercialize their products and technologies, which funding must be obtained
from private investors, the public market, companies in the life science
industry or federal, state and local governments.  Such funding may become
unavailable or difficult to obtain, which in turn may adversely affect a
tenant's ability to generate revenues or to pay us rent.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>Even with sufficient funding, some of our tenants may not be
able to discover or identify potential drug targets in humans, or potential
drugs for use in humans, or to create tools or technologies which are
commercially useful in the discovery or identification of potential drug targets
or drugs.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>Some of our tenants developing potential drugs may find that
their drugs are not effective, or may even be harmful, when tested in
humans.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>Some of our tenants may not be able to manufacture their drugs
economically, even if such drugs are proven through human clinical trials to be

<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>Drugs that are developed and manufactured by some of our tenants

obtaining these approvals.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>Some of our tenants and their licensors require patent,

<P>We cannot assure you that our tenants will be able to develop, make, market
or sell their products and technologies due to the risks inherent in the life
science industry.  Any tenant that is unable to avoid, or sufficiently mitigate,
the risks described above, may have difficulty making rental payments to us.
</P>
<U><STRONG><P>We Could be Held Liable for Damages Resulting from Our Tenants'
Use of Hazardous Materials</P>
</U></STRONG><P>Some of our life science industry tenants engage in research and
development activities that involve the controlled use of hazardous materials,
chemicals and biological and radioactive compounds.  In the event of
contamination or injury from the use of these hazardous materials, we could be
held liable for damages that result.  This liability could exceed our resources
and any recovery available through any applicable environmental remediation
insurance coverage and could adversely affect our ability to make distributions
to our stockholders. </P>
<P>Together with our tenants, we must comply with federal, state and local laws
and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal
of hazardous materials and waste products.  Failure to comply with, or changes
in, these laws and regulations could adversely affect our business or our
tenants' business and their ability to make rental payments to us. </P>
<U><STRONG><P>The Inability of Any Tenant to Pay Us Rent Could Adversely Affect
Our Business</P>
</U></STRONG><P>Our revenues are derived primarily from rental payments and
reimbursement of operating expenses under our leases.  If our tenants,
especially significant tenants, failed to make rental payments under their
leases, our financial condition, cash flow and our ability to make distributions
to our stockholders could be adversely affected. </P>
<P>As of December 31, 2002, we had 200 leases with a total of 173 tenants.  Of
our 89 properties, 51 were occupied by a single tenant.  Three of our tenants
accounted for approximately 14.0% of our aggregate annualized base rent, or
approximately 5.0%, 4.7% and 4.3%, respectively. "  Annualized base rent" means
the annualized fixed base rental amount in effect as of December 31, 2002, using
rental revenue calculated on a straight-line basis in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").  Annualized base rent does not include
reimbursements for real estate taxes and insurance, common area and other
operating expenses, substantially all of which are borne by the tenants in the
case of triple net leases. </P>
<P>The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant may also adversely affect the
income produced by a property.  If any of our tenants becomes a debtor in a case
under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, we cannot evict that tenant solely because of
its bankruptcy.  The bankruptcy court may authorize the tenant to reject and
terminate its lease with us.  Our claim against such a tenant for unpaid future
rent would be subject to a statutory limitation that might be substantially less
than the remaining rent actually owed to us under the tenant's lease.  Any
shortfall in rent payments could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability
to make distributions to our stockholders. </P>
<U><STRONG><P>Our U.S. Government Tenants May Not Receive Annual Appropriations,
Which Could Adversely Affect Their Ability to Pay Us</P>
</U></STRONG><P>U.S. government tenants may be subject to annual appropriations.
If one of our U.S. government tenants fails to receive its annual appropriation,
it might not be able to make its lease payments to us.  In addition, defaults
under leases with federal government tenants are governed by federal statute and
not by state eviction or rent deficiency laws.  All of our leases with U.S.
government tenants provide that the government tenant may terminate the lease
under certain circumstances.  As of December 31, 2002, leases with U.S.
government tenants at our properties accounted for approximately 3.8% of our
aggregate annualized base rent. </P>
<U><STRONG><P>Loss of a Tenant Could Have a Negative Impact on Our Business</P>
</U></STRONG><P>A tenant may not renew its lease upon the expiration of the
initial term.  In addition, we may not be able to locate a qualified replacement
tenant upon expiration or termination of a lease.  Consequently, we could lose
the cash flow from the affected property, which could negatively impact our
business.  We may have to divert cash flow generated by other properties to meet
our mortgage payments, if any, or to pay other expenses related to owning the
affected property.  As of December 31, 2002, leases at our properties
representing approximately 11.6% and 9.4% of the total square footage of our
properties were scheduled to expire in 2003 and 2004, respectively. </P>

<U><STRONG><P>We May Not Be Able to Obtain Additional Capital to Further Our
Business Objectives</P>
</U></STRONG><P>Our ability to acquire or develop properties depends upon our
ability to obtain capital.  Periodically, the real estate industry experiences
reduced supplies of favorably priced public equity or debt capital, which
decreases the level of new investment activity by publicly traded real estate
companies.  A prolonged period in which we cannot effectively access public
equity or debt markets may result in heavier reliance on alternative financing
sources to undertake new investments.  An inability to obtain equity or debt
capital on acceptable terms could delay or prevent us from acquiring,
structuring and completing desirable investments, which would adversely affect
our business.  Also, the issuance of additional shares of capital stock or
interests in subsidiaries to fund future operations could dilutethe ownership of
then existing stockholders. </P>
<U><STRONG><P>If Interest Rates Rise, Our Debt Service Costs Will Increase</P>
</U></STRONG><P>Borrowings outstanding under our unsecured line of credit and
certain other borrowings bear interest at a variable rate, and we may incur
additional variable rate debt in the future.  Increases in market interest rates
would increase our interest expenses under these debt instruments and would
increase the costs of refinancing existing indebtedness or obtaining new debt.
Accordingly, these increases could adversely affect our financial position and
our ability to make distributions to stockholders. </P>

funds available for investment or distribution to our stockholders would be

<P>Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and
complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code to our operations and the
determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within
our control.  There are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations
of these provisions.  Although we believe that we have operated, commencing with
our taxable year ended December 31, 1996, in a manner so as to qualify as a

<U><STRONG><P>There Are Limits on the Ownership of Our Capital Stock Under Which

maintain our qualification as a REIT, not more than 50% of the value of our
outstanding capital stock may be owned, directly or constructively, by five or
fewer individuals or entities. </P>
<P>In addition, our charter prohibits, with certain limited exceptions, direct
or constructive ownership of shares of our capital stock representing more than
9.8% of the combined total value of the outstanding shares of our capital stock
by any person (the "Ownership Limit").  Our Board of Directors may exempt a
stockholder from the Ownership Limit if, prior to the exemption, our Board of
Directors receives all information it deems necessary to determine or ensure our
status as a REIT. </P>
<P>The constructive ownership rules are complex and may cause shares of our
common stock owned directly or constructively by a group of related individuals
or entities to be constructively owned by one individual or entity.  A transfer
of shares to a person who, as a result of the transfer, violates the Ownership
Limit may be void or may be deemed to be made to a trust, for the benefit of one
or more qualified charitable organizations designated by us.  In that case, the
intended transferee will have only a right to share, to the extent of the
transferee's original purchase price for such shares, in proceeds from the

prevent a transaction that might involve a premium price for our common stock or
for other reasons be desired by our common stockholders or that have a dividend
preference which may adversely affect our ability to pay dividends on our common

<P>Our charter permits the removal of a director only upon a two-thirds vote of

<DL>
<DT>&#9;Under our Stockholder Rights Plan, if a stockholder acquires beneficial
ownership of 15% or more of our common stock, other stockholders would become
entitled to purchase our common stock at half the market price, which would
likely result in substantial dilution to the 15% or greater stockholder.  This

We carry comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage and rental loss
insurance with respect to our properties.  We have obtained earthquake insurance

our title insurance policies may be in an amount less than the current value of
the related property. </P>
<P>We believe that our insurance policy specifications, insured limits and
deductibles are consistent with or superior to those customarily carried for
similar properties.  Our tenants are also required to maintain comprehensive
insurance, including liability and casualty insurance, that is customarily
obtained for similar properties. There are, however, certain types of losses
that we and our tenants do not generally insure against because they are
uninsurable or because it is not economical to insure against them.  In the
current market, there have recently been substantial increases in the premium
cost of property and liability insurance. The availability of coverage against
certain types of losses, such as from terrorism or toxic mold, has become more
limited and, when available, is at a significantly higher premium cost. We
cannot predict whether insurance coverage against terrorism or toxic mold will
remain available for our properties because insurance companies may no longer

funds using that property as collateral. </P>
<P>Under environmental laws and regulations, we may have to pay governmental

costs incurred by those parties relating to contaminated properties regardless
of whether we knew of or caused the contamination.  Even if more than one party
may have been responsible for the contamination, we may be held responsible for
all of the clean-up costs.  In addition, third parties may sue us for damages
and costs resulting from environmental contamination or jointly responsible
parties may contest their responsibility or be financially unable to pay their

<P>Environmental laws also govern the presence, maintenance and removal of
asbestos-containing materials.  These laws may impose fines and penalties on us

distributions to stockholders. </P>
<U><STRONG><P>The Loss of Services of Any of Our Executive Officers Could
Adversely Affect Us</P>
</U></STRONG><P>We depend upon the services of relatively few executive
officers.  The loss of services of any one of them may adversely affect our
business, financial condition and prospects.  We use the extensive personal and
business relationships that members of our management have developed over time
with owners of life science facilities and with major life science industry
tenants.  We have employment agreements with allof our executive officers, but
cannot assure you that they will remain employed with us. </P>

<P>Our Board of Directors may amend or revise these policies at any time without
a vote of our stockholders. A change in these policies could adversely affect
our business and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. </P>
<U><STRONG><P>We Could Become Highly Leveraged and Our Debt Service Obligations
Could Increase</P>
</U></STRONG><P>Our organizational documents do not limit the amount of debt
that we may incur.  Therefore, we could become highly leveraged.  This would
result in an increase in our debt service obligations that could adversely
affect our cash flow and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.
</P>
<P>We have adopted a policy of incurring debt only if upon such incurrence our
debt to total market capitalization ratio would not exceed 57.5%.  Our total
market capitalization is the market value of our capital stock, including
interests exchangeable for shares of capital stock, plus total debt.  Our Board
of Directors could, however, change or eliminate this policy at any time.
Higher leverage could also increase the risk of default on our debt obligations.
</P>
<U><STRONG><P>Our Distributions to Stockholders May Decline at Any Time</P>
</U></STRONG><P>We may not continue our current level of distributions to
stockholders. Our Board of Directors will determine future distributions based
on a number of factors, including: </P>


<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>our amount of cash available for distribution.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>

<U><STRONG><P>Possible Future Sales of Shares of Our Common Stock Could
Adversely Affect Its Market Price</P>
</U></STRONG><P>We cannot predict the effect, if any, of future sales of shares
of our common stock on the market price of our common stock from time to time.
Sales of substantial amounts of capital stock (including common stock issued
upon the exercise of stock options), or the perception that such sales may
occur, could adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock.
</P>
<P>We have reserved for issuance to our officers, directors and employees
pursuant to our Amended and Restated 1997 Stock Award and Incentive Plan that
number of shares of our common stock that equals 12% of the total number of
shares outstanding at any time, provided that in no event may the number of
shares of our common stock available for issuance under the plan exceed
3,000,000 shares at any time.</P>
<P>As of December 31, 2002, options to purchase 1,011,166 shares of our common
stock were outstanding, of which options to purchase 514,169 shares of our
common stock were exercisable.  We have filed a registration statement with
respect to the issuance of shares of our common stock pursuant to grants under
the stock option plan.  In addition, any shares issued under our stock option
plan will be available for sale in the public market from time to time without
restriction by persons who are not our Affiliates (as defined in Rule 144
adopted under the Securities Act of 1933).  Affiliates will be able to sell
shares of our common stock pursuant to exemptions from the registration
requirements or upon registration. </P>
<U><P>External Factors May Adversely Impact the Valuation of Investments</P>
</U><P>&#9;We hold equity investments in certain publicly traded companies and
privately held entities primarily involved in the life science industry.  The
valuation of these investments is affected by many external factors beyond our
control, include, but are not limited to, market prices, market conditions,
prospects for favorable or unfavorable clinical trial results, new product
initiatives and new collaborative agreements.  Unfavorable developments with
respect to any of these factors may have an adverse impact on the valuation of
our investments.</P>

248,000 square feet, are built to accommodate single or multiple tenants and are
generally one or two story concrete tilt-up, block and/or steel frame
structures. The exteriors typically resemble traditional suburban office
properties, but interior infrastructures are designed to accommodate the needs
of life science industry tenants. These improvements typically are generic to
life science industry tenants rather than being specific to a particular tenant.
As a result, we believe that the improvements have long-term value and utility
and are usable by a wide range of life science industry tenants. Generic

<P>As of December 31, 2002, we had 200 leases with a total of 173 tenants, and
51 of our properties were single-tenant properties. Leases in our multi-tenant
buildings typically have terms of three to seven years, while the single-tenant
building leases typically have initial terms of 10 to 20 years. As of December
31, 2002: </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>approximately 86% of our leases (on a square footage basis) were
triple net leases, requiring tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes
and insurance, common area and other operating expenses (including increases
thereto) in addition to base rent, and, in addition to our triple net leases,
approximately 9% of our leases (on a square footage basis) required the tenants
to pay a majority of operating expenses;</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>approximately 93% of our leases (on a square footage basis)
contained effective annual rent escalations that are either fixed (generally
ranging from 3% to 4%) or indexed based on a consumer price index or other
index; and</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>approximately 88% of our leases (on a square footage basis)

leases. </LI></BLOCKQUOTE></UL>

<P>Our leases also typically give us the right to review and approve tenant
alterations to the property. Generally, tenant-installed improvements to the
facilities remain our property after termination of the lease at our election.
However, we are permitted under the terms of most of our leases to require that
the tenant remove the improvements and restore the premises to their original

<FONT SIZE=3><P>Future distributions on our common stock will be determined by
our Board of Directors and will be dependent upon a number of factors, including
actual cash available for distribution, our financial condition and capital
requirements, the annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of
the Internal Revenue Code and such other factors as our Board of Directors deems
relevant. To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must make annual
distributions to stockholders of at least 90% of our taxable income for the
current taxable year, determined without regard to deductions for dividends paid
and excluding any net capital gains. Under certain circumstances, we may be
required to make distributions in excess of cash flow available for
distributions to meet these distribution requirements. In such a case, we may
borrow funds or may raise funds through the issuance of additional debt or
equity capital. We cannot assure you that we will make any future distributions.

</UL>

<P>Our primary source of revenue is rental income and tenant recoveries from
leases at the properties we own.  Of the 89 properties we owned as of December
31, 2002, four were acquired in 1994, nine in 1996, ten in 1997, 29 in 1998, six
in 1999, 12 in 2000, five in 2001 and four in 2002. In addition, we completed
the development of one property in 1999, five properties in 2000 (together with
the 12 properties acquired in 2000, the "2000 Properties"), two properties in
2001 (together with the five properties acquired in 2001, the "2001 Properties")
and two properties in 2002 (together with the four properties acquired in 2002,
the "2002 Properties").  As a result of these acquisition and development
activities, there have been significant continuing increases in total revenues
and expenses, including significant increases in total revenues and expenses for
2002 as compared to 2001, and for 2001 as compared to 2000. </P>

<B><P>Critical Accounting Policies</P>

<P>&#9;</B>Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of
operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States ("GAAP").  Our significant accounting policies are described in
the notes to our consolidated financial statements.  The preparation of these
financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates,
judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses.  We base these estimates, judgments and
assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we
believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.  Actual results may differ
from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.</P>

<I><P>REIT Compliance</P>

</I><P>We have elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ("REIT")
under the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code"). Qualification as a REIT involves
the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Code to our
operations and financial results and the determination of various factual
matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. We believe that our
current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and
regulations promulgated under the Code to enable us to qualify, and continue to
qualify, as a REIT. However, it is possible that we have been organized or have
operated in a manner that would not allow us to qualify as a REIT, or that our
future operations could cause us to fail to qualify.</P>
<P>If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, then we will be required
to pay federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on
our taxable income at regular corporate rates. If we lose our REIT status, then
our net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders would
be significantly reduced for each of the years involved and we would no longer
be required to make distributions to our stockholders. </P>

<I><P>Rental Properties and Properties Under Development</P>

</I><P>Rental properties and properties under development are stated at cost.
Write-downs to estimated fair value would be recognized when impairment
indicators are present and a property's estimated undiscounted future cash
flows, before interest charges, are less than its book value. In that situation,
we would recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeds
the fair value of the property. </P>

<I><P>Capitalization of Costs</P>

<P>&#9;</I>We capitalize direct construction and development costs, including
predevelopment costs, interest, property taxes, insurance and indirect project
costs, including payroll and other costs directly associated with the
acquisition, development or construction of a project.  Costs incurred after a
project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use are expensed as
incurred.  Costs previously capitalized related to abandoned acquisition or
development opportunities are written-off.  Should development activity
decrease, a portion of interest, property taxes, insurance and certain costs
would no longer be eligible for capitalization, and would be expensed as
incurred.</P>
<P>&#9;We also capitalize leasing costs, including broker fees and certain costs
related to our leasing personnel.  These costs are amortized on a straight-line
basis over the terms of the related leases.  Costs previously capitalized
related to unsuccessful leasing opportunities are written-off. </P>

<I><P>Valuation of Investments</P>

</I><P>&#9;We hold equity investments in certain publicly traded companies and
privately held entities primarily involved in the life science industry.  If a
decline in the fair value of an investment below its carrying value is
determined to be other than temporary, such investment is written down to its
estimated fair value with a non-cash charge to current earnings. The factors
that we consider in our valuation assessments include, but are not limited to,
market prices, market conditions, prospects for favorable or unfavorable
clinical trial results, new product initiatives and new collaborative
agreements.</P>

<I><P>Interest Rate Swap Agreements</P>

<P>&#9;</I>We utilize interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of our
exposure to variable interest rates associated with our unsecured line of
credit.  These agreements involve an exchange of fixed and floating interest
payments without the exchange of the underlying principal amount (the "notional
amount").  Interest received under all of our swap agreements is based on the
one-month LIBOR rate.  The net difference between the interest paid and the
interest received is reflected as an adjustment to interest expense. </P>
<P>&#9;We reflect our interest rate swap agreements on the balance sheet at
their estimated fair values.  We use a variety of methods and assumptions based
on market conditions and risks existing at each balance sheet date to determine
the fair values of our interest rate swap agreements.  These methods of
assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value, and such value
may never be realized.</P>
<P>&#9;All of our interest rate swap agreements meet the criteria to be deemed
"effective" under Statement of Financial Accountings Standards No. 133 in
reducing our exposure to variable interest rates.  Accordingly, we have
categorized these instruments as cash flow hedges.  While we intend to continue
to meet the conditions for hedge accounting, if hedges did not qualify as highly
effective, the changes in the fair value of the derivatives used as hedges would
be reflected in earnings.</P>
<P>&#9;We do not believe we are exposed to more than a nominal amount of credit
risk in our interest rate swap agreements as our counterparties are established,
well-capitalized financial institutions.</P>

<I><P>Revenue Recognition</P>

</I><P>Rental income from leases with scheduled rent increases, free rent and
other rent adjustments are recognized on a straight-line basis over the
respective lease terms. We maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may
result from the inability of our tenants to make required payments. If a tenant
fails to make contractual payments beyond any allowance, we may recognize
additional bad debt expense in future periods equal to the amount of unpaid rent
and deferred rent.</P>

<I><P>Discontinued Operations</P>

<P>&#9;</I>The determination of whether a property qualifies as an asset held
for sale and should be classified as discontinued operations requires an
evaluation of certain criteria, some of which require the use of judgment.  A
property is classified as held for sale when all of the following criteria for a
plan of sale have been met: 1) management, having the authority to approve the
action, commits to a plan to sell the property, 2) the property is available for
immediate sale in its present condition, subject only to the terms that are
usual and customary, 3) an active program to locate a buyer, and other actions
required to complete the plan to sell, have been initiated, 4) the sale of the
property is probable and is expected to be completed within one year, 5) the
property is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in
relation to its current fair value and 6) actions necessary to complete the plan
indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made
or that the plan will be withdrawn. When all of these criteria have been met,
the property is classified as held for sale and its operations are classified as
discontinued operations. Amounts from prior periods are reclassified from
continuing operations to discontinued operations. A loss is recognized for any
initial adjustment of the asset's carrying amount to fair value less costs to
sell in the period the asset qualifies as held for sale.</P>

<STRONG><P>Results of Operations</P>

<I><P>Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2002 to the Year Ended December
31, 2001</P>

</I></STRONG><P>Rental revenue increased by $18.2 million, or 19%, to $113.4
million for 2002 compared to $95.2 million for 2001.  The increase resulted
primarily from the 2001 Properties being owned for a full year and the addition
of the 2002 Properties.  Rental revenue from properties operating for a full
year during 2001 and 2002 (the "2002 Same Properties") increased by $2.7
million, or 3.7%, due to increases in rental rates and offset by a slight
decrease in occupancy.  The occupancy level of the 2002 Same Properties was
97.6% as of December 31, 2002, compared to 98.2% as of December 31, 2001. </P>
<P>Tenant recoveries increased by $5.0 million, or 20%, to $29.7 million for
2002 compared to $24.6 million for 2001.  The increase resulted primarily from
the 2001 Properties being owned for a full year and the addition of the 2002
Properties.  Tenant recoveries for the 2002 Same Properties increased by
$915,000, or 4.6%, primarily due to increases in certain recoverable operating
expenses. </P>
<P>Interest and other income decreased by $1.6 million, or 49%, to $1.6 million
for 2002 compared to $3.2 million for 2001, primarily due to a decrease in
interest income resulting from a decline in interest rates, the repayment of a
$6 million secured note receivable in March 2002 and a decrease in realized
gains on investments.</P>
<P>Rental operating expenses increased by $4.6 million, or 18%, to $30.0 million
for 2002 compared to $25.4 million for 2001.  The increase resulted primarily
from the 2001 Properties being owned for a full year and the addition of the
2002 Properties.  Operating expenses for the 2002 Same Properties increased by
$1.2 million, or 6.4%, primarily due to an increase in property insurance and
property taxes (substantially all of which are recoverable from our tenants
through tenant recoveries).</P>
<P>The following is a comparison of property operating data for the 2002 Same
Properties computed under generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP
Basis") and under generally accepted accounting principles, adjusted to exclude
the effect of straight-line rent adjustments required by GAAP ("Cash Basis")

<P>General and administrative expenses increased by $1.7 million, or 15%, to
$13.4 million for 2002 compared to $11.7 million for 2001 primarily due to the
continued increase in the scope of our operations.  From January 1, 2001 to
December 31, 2002, we expanded our scope of operations to include an additional
13 properties containing approximately 880,000 rentable square feet for a total
of 89 properties located in nine states with approximately 5.7 million rentable
square feet.   To assist in managing this increase in the size of our operating
portfolio, we have added personnel and offices in certain of the markets where
we have properties.</P>
<P>Interest expense decreased by $2.7 million, or 10%, to $25.0 million for 2002
compared to $27.7 million for 2001.  The decrease resulted primarily from a
reduction in the floating interest rate on our unsecured line of credit.  The
weighted average interest rate on our borrowings (not including the effect of
swap agreements) decreased from 3.92% as of December 31, 2001 to 3.07% as of
December 31, 2002.  We have entered into certain swap agreements to hedge our
borrowings at variable interest rates (see "Liquidity and Capital Resources -
Unsecured Line of Credit ").  The decrease in interest expense caused by this
factor was partially offset by an increase in indebtedness incurred to acquire
the 2001 and 2002 Properties and indebtedness incurred to finance the
development and redevelopment of properties. </P>
<P>Depreciation and amortization increased by $3.7 million, or 12%, to $33.3
million for 2002 compared to $29.6 million for 2001.  The increase resulted
primarily from depreciation associated with the 2001 Properties being owned for
a full year and the addition of the 2002 Properties. </P>
<P>During 2002, we recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $2.5 million
associated with a decline in the value of certain investments below their
carrying value determined to be other than temporary.  </P>
<P>Income from discontinued operations of $624,000 for 2002 reflects the results
of operations of two properties that have been designated as held for sale.  In
connection with these prospective sales, we recorded a non-cash impairment
charge of $1,150,000 related to a property in the San Francisco Bay market which
cannot be redeveloped pursuant to its original strategic objectives.  This
charge has been included in discontinued operations for 2002.  </P>
<P>Extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt of $1 million for 2002 was
incurred as a result of an early retirement of a $7.2 million secured loan in
connection with a refinancing of an asset.  This extraordinary loss is related
to prepayment penalties and the write-off of loan costs. </P>

</I></STRONG><P>Rental revenue increased by $16.7 million, or 21%, to $95.2
million for 2001 compared to $78.6 million for 2000.  The increase resulted
primarily from the 2000 Properties being owned for a full year and the addition
of the 2001 Properties.  Rental revenue from properties operating for a full
year during 2000 and 2001 (the "2001 Same Properties") increased by $3.7
million, or 6.4%, due to increases in rental rates and offset by a slight
decrease in occupancy.  The occupancy level of the 2001 Same Properties was
96.8% as of December 31, 2001, compared to 97.7% as of December 31, 2000. </P>
<P>Tenant recoveries increased by $4.4 million, or 22%, to $24.6 million for
2001 compared to $20.3 million for 2000.  The increase resulted primarily from
the 2000 Properties being owned for a full year and the addition of the 2001
Properties.  Tenant recoveries for the 2001 Same Properties increased by
$516,000, or 3.2%, generally due to an increase in certain recoverable operating
expenses. </P>
<P>Interest and other income decreased by $233,000, or 7%, to $3.2 million for
2001 compared to $3.4 million for 2000, resulting primarily from a decline in
interest rates and a decline in service fee income.  Service fee income is
earned when we supervise construction projects for third parties.</P>
<P>Rental operating expenses increased by $4.2 million, or 20%, to $25.4 million
for 2001 compared to $21.2 million for 2000.  The increase resulted primarily
from the 2000 Properties being owned for a full year and the addition of the
2001 Properties.  Operating expenses for the 2001 Same Properties increased by
$983,000, or 5.9%, primarily due to an increase in utilities and tenant related
expenses (substantially all of which are recoverable from our tenants through
tenant recoveries).</P>

<P>Interest expense increased by $3.4 million, or 14%, to $27.7 million for 2001

and tenant security deposits.</P>
<P>Net cash used in investing activities increased by $35.7 million to $227.8

</FONT><I><FONT SIZE=3><STRONG><P>Unsecured Line of Credit </P>
</I></STRONG><P>In July 2002, we expanded and extended our unsecured line of
credit.  Our new line of credit amends our $325 million unsecured line of credit
that was scheduled to mature in February 2003 and has been used to pay off our
$50 million unsecured term loan.  The maximum permitted amount of borrowings
under the amended line of credit is $425 million.  The amended line of credit
has a maturity date of July 2005, which may be extended at our sole option for
an additional one-year period.  Borrowings under our unsecured line of credit,
as amended, bear interest at a floating rate based on our election of either a
LIBOR-based rate or the higher of the bank's reference rate and the Federal
Funds rate plus 0.5%.  For each LIBOR-based advance, we must elect a LIBOR
period of one, two, three or six months.</P>
<P>Our line of credit contains financial covenants, including, among other
things, maintenance of minimum net worth, a total liabilities to gross asset
value ratio, and a fixed charge coverage ratio.  In addition, the terms of the
line of credit restrict, among other things, certain investments, indebtedness,
distributions and mergers.  As of December 31, 2002, borrowings outstanding on
the line of credit carried a weighted average interest rate of 3.07%.</P>
<P>Aggregate borrowings under the line of credit may be limited to an amount
based on the net operating income derived from a pool of unencumbered
properties.  As of December 31, 2002, the amount calculated under these
provisions exceeded the maximum permitted borrowings of $425 million.</P>
<P>We utilize interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of our exposure
to variable interest rates associated with our unsecured line of credit.  These
agreements involve an exchange of fixed and floating interest payments without
the exchange of the underlying principal amount (the "notional amount").
Interest received under all of our swap agreements is based on the one-month
LIBOR rate.  The net difference between the interest paid and the interest
received is reflected as an adjustment to interest expense.</P>

<P>Effective January 1, 2001, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 133 ("SFAS 133"), "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities," as amended by Statement No. 138, "Accounting for Certain
Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities."  SFAS 133, as amended,
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative financial
instruments such as our interest rate swap agreements.  Specifically, SFAS 133
requires us to reflect our interest rate swap agreements on the balance sheet at
their estimated fair values.  We use a variety of methods and assumptions based
on market conditions and risks existing at each balance sheet date to determine
the fair values of our interest rate swap agreements.  These methods of
assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value, and such value
may never be realized.  As of January 1, 2001, the adoption of SFAS 133, as
amended, resulted in qualifying interest rate swap agreements reported on the
balance sheet as a liability of approximately $3.5 million, with a corresponding
reduction to accumulated other comprehensive income, a separate component of
stockholders' equity.</P>
<P>All of our interest rate swap agreements meet the criteria to be deemed
"effective" under SFAS 133 in reducing our exposure to variable interest rates.
Accordingly, we have categorized these instruments as cash flow hedges.  While
we intend to continue to meet the conditions for hedge accounting, if hedges did
not qualify as highly effective, the changes in the fair value of the
derivatives used as hedges would be reflected in earnings.</P>
<P>We do not believe we are exposed to more than a nominal amount of credit risk
in our interest rate swap agreements as our counterparties are established,
well-capitalized financial institutions.  In addition, we have entered into
master derivative agreements with each counterparty.  These master derivative
agreements (all of which are on the standard International Swaps &amp;
Derivatives Association, Inc. ("ISDA") form) define certain terms between us and
each counterparty to address and minimize certain risks associated with our swap
agreements, including a default by a counterparty.</P>
<P>On January 22, 2001, we terminated an interest rate swap agreement with a
notional amount of $50 million, an interest pay rate of 7.25% and a maturity of
December 31, 2001.  The terminated interest rate swap agreement was replaced
with the 6.35% interest rate swap agreement as shown in the table above.  The
fair value of the terminated interest rate swap agreement at the date of
termination (a liability of $950,000) was transferred to the replacement 6.35%
interest rate swap agreement.  During 2001, approximately $475,000 was
reclassified from other comprehensive income to interest expense.  Approximately
$475,000 was credited against interest expense during 2002.  These adjustments
resulted in an effective interest pay rate for the 6.35% interest rate swap
agreement of 7.30% for 2001 and 5.40% for 2002.</P>
<P>As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, our interest rate swap agreements have been
reported in the accompanying balance sheets at their fair value as other
liabilities of approximately $9.0 million and $7.5 million, respectively.  The
offsetting adjustments were reflected as deferred losses in accumulated other
comprehensive income of $9.0 million and $7.0 million, respectively.  Balances
in accumulated other comprehensive income are recognized in earnings as swap
payments are made.</P>
<STRONG><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Other Resources and Liquidity Requirements</P>
</STRONG><P>In January 2002, we completed a public offering of 2,300,000 shares
of our 9.10% Series B cumulative redeemable preferred stock.  The shares were
issued at a price of $25.00 per share, resulting in aggregate proceeds of
approximately $55.1 million, net of offering costs.  In February 2002, we sold
418,970 shares of our common stock.  The shares were issued at a price of $39.46
per share, resulting in aggregate proceeds of approximately $16.1 million, net
of offering costs.  In July 2002, we sold 2,000,000 shares of our common stock.
The shares were issued at a price of $41.07 per share, resulting in aggregate
proceeds of approximately $81.4 million, net of offering costs.</P>
<P>We expect to continue meeting our short-term liquidity and capital
requirements generally through our working capital and net cash provided by
operating activities.  We believe that the net cash provided by operating
activities will continue to be sufficient to enable us to make distributions
necessary to continue qualifying as a REIT.  We also believe that net cash
provided by operating activities will be sufficient to fund our recurring non-
revenue enhancing capital expenditures, tenant improvements and leasing
commissions. </P>
<P>We expect to meet certain long-term liquidity requirements, such as property
acquisitions, property development and redevelopment activities, scheduled debt
maturities, expansions and other non-recurring capital improvements, through
excess net cash provided by operating activities, long-term secured and
unsecured borrowings, including borrowings under the line of credit and the
issuance of additional debt and/or equity securities. </P>
<STRONG><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Exposure to Environmental Liabilities</P>
</STRONG><P>In connection with the acquisition of all of our properties, we have
obtained Phase I environmental assessments to ascertain the existence of any
environmental liabilities or other issues.  The Phase I environmental
assessments of our properties have not revealed any environmental liabilities
that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition
or results of operations taken as a whole, nor are we aware of any material
environmental liabilities that have occurred since the Phase I environmental
assessments were completed.  In addition, we carry a policy of pollution legal
liability insurance covering exposure to certain environmental losses at all of
our properties.</P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>Capital expenditures fluctuate in any given period due to the nature, extent
and timing of improvements required and the extent to which they are recoverable
from our tenants. Approximately 88% of our leases provide for the recapture of
certain capital expenditures (such as HVAC systems maintenance and/or
replacement, roof replacement and parking lot resurfacing).  In addition, we
maintain an active preventative maintenance program at each of our properties to
minimize capital expenditures required. </P>
<P>Tenant improvements and leasing costs also fluctuate in any given year
depending upon factors such as the timing and extent of vacancies, property age,
location and characteristics, the type of lease (renewal tenant or retenanted
space), the involvement of external leasing agents and overall competitive
market conditions. </P>
<STRONG><P>Inflation</P>
</STRONG><P>As of December 31, 2002, approximately 86% of our leases (on a
square footage basis) were triple net leases, requiring tenants to pay
substantially all real estate taxes and insurance, common area and other
operating expenses (including increases thereto).  In addition, approximately 9%
of our leases (on a square footage basis) required the tenants to pay a majority
of operating expenses. Approximately 93% of our leases (on a square footage
basis) contain effective annual rent escalations that are either fixed
(generally ranging from 3% to 4%) or indexed based on the consumer price index
or another index. Accordingly, we do not believe that our earnings or cash flow
from real estate operations are subject to any significant risk of inflation. An
increase in inflation, however, could result in an increase in the cost of our
variable rate borrowings, including our unsecured line of credit. </P>
<STRONG><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Funds from Operations</P>
</STRONG><P>We believe that funds from operations ("FFO") is helpful to
investors as an additional measure of the performance of an equity REIT.  We
compute FFO in accordance with standards established by the Board of Governors
of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") in its
April 2002 White Paper (the "White Paper"), which may differ from the
methodology for calculating FFO utilized by other equity REITs, and,
accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs. The White Paper defines
FFO as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or
losses) from assets, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and
after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.  While FFO
is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of REITs, it
should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in
accordance with GAAP) as an indication of our financial performance, or to cash
flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a
measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our
cash needs, including our ability to make distributions. (See "Cash Flows" for
information regarding these measures of cash flow.) </P>

</FONT><FONT SIZE=3><P><A NAME="item7a"></A><STRONG>Item 7a. Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk</P>
</STRONG><P>Market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in
interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and equity
prices.  The primary market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk,
which may result from many factors, including governmental monetary and tax
policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations and
other factors that are beyond our control. </P>
<P>In order to modify and manage the interest rate characteristics of our
outstanding debt and to limit the effects of interest rate risks on our
operations, we may utilize a variety of financial instruments, including
interest rate swaps, caps, floors and other interest rate exchange contracts.
The use of these types of instruments to hedge our exposure to changes in
interest rates carries additional risks, such as counter-party credit risk and
the legal enforceability of hedging contracts. </P>
<P>Our future earnings, cash flows and fair values relating to financial
instruments are primarily dependent upon prevalent market rates of interest,
such as LIBOR. However, our interest rate swap agreements are intended to reduce
the effects of interest rate changes.  Based on interest rates at, and our swap
agreements in effect on, December 31, 2002, we estimate that a 1% increase in
interest rates on our line of credit, after considering the effect of our
interest rate swap agreements, would decrease annual future earnings and cash
flows by approximately $1.4 million.  We further estimate that a 1% decrease in
interest rates on our line of credit, after considering the effect of our
interest rate swap agreements in effect December 31, 2002, would increase annual
future earnings and cash flows by approximately $1.4 million.  A 1% increase in
interest rates on our secured debt and interest rate swap agreements would
decrease their aggregate fair value by approximately $18.4 million.  A 1%
decrease in interest rates on our secured debt and interest rate swap agreements
would increase their aggregate fair value by approximately $19.3 million. </P>
<P>These amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical
interest rates on our borrowing cost and our interest rate swap agreements in
effect on December 31, 2002.  These analyses do not consider the effects of the
reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an
environment.  Further, in the event of a change of such magnitude, we would
consider taking actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change. However,
due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their
possible effects, the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in our capital
structure. </P>
<P>We have exposure to equity price market risk because of our equity
investments in certain publicly traded companies and privately held entities.
We classify investments in publicly traded companies as available-for-sale and,
consequently, record them on our balance sheet at fair value with unrealized
gains or losses reported as a component of comprehensive income or loss.
Investments in privately held entities are generally accounted for under the
cost method, as we do not influence any of the investees' operating or financial
policies.  For all investments, we recognize other than temporary declines in
value against earnings in the same period the decline in value was deemed to
have occurred.  In 2002, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of $2,545,000
to write down certain investments for which we deemed the decline in fair value
to be other than temporary.  There is no assurance that future declines in
values will not have a material adverse impact on our future results of
operations.  By way of example, a 10% decrease in the fair value of our equity
investments would decrease their fair value by approximately $4 million.</P>

Independent Auditors</P>
</FONT></STRONG><FONT SIZE=3><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of<BR>
Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. </P>
<P>We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Alexandria
Real Estate Equities, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31,
2002 and 2001, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders'
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 2002. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in
the index at item 15(a). These financial statements and schedule are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits. </P>
<P>We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion. </P>
<P>In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Alexandria Real
Estate Equities, Inc. and subsidiaries at December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2002, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States. Also, in our opinion, the
related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects
the information set forth therein. </P>

<FONT SIZE=3><P>1. Background</P>
</STRONG><P>Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. is a real estate investment
trust ("REIT") formed in 1994.  We are engaged primarily in the ownership,
operation, management, acquisition, expansion and selective redevelopment and
development of properties containing a combination of office and laboratory
space.  We refer to these properties as "life science facilities."  Our life
science facilities are designed and improved for lease primarily to
pharmaceutical, biotechnology, life science product and service companies, not-
for-profit scientific research institutions, universities and related government
agencies.  As of December 31, 2002, our portfolio consisted of 89 properties in
nine states with approximately 5,747,000 rentable square feet, compared to 83
properties in nine states with approximately 5,320,000 rentable square feet as
of December 31, 2001. </P>

Policies</P>
<P>Basis of Presentation</P>
</STRONG><P>The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Alexandria and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated. </P>
<STRONG><P>Use of Estimates</P>
</STRONG><P>The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date
of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
</P>
<STRONG><P>Cash Equivalents</P>
</STRONG><P>We consider all highly liquid investments with original maturities
of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.</P>
<B><P>Reclassifications</P>
</B><P>Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the
current year presentation.</P>

"Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities" ("SFAS 115"),
and are recorded at fair value and included in other assets in the accompanying
balance sheets.  Fair value has been determined by the closing trading price at
the balance sheet date, with unrealized gains and losses shown as a separate
component of stockholders' equity.  The classification of investments under SFAS
115 is determined at the time each investment is made, and such determination is
reevaluated at each balance sheet date.  The cost of investments sold is
determined by the specific identification method, with realized gains and losses
included in interest and other income.</P>
<P>Investments in privately held entities are included in other assets and
accounted for under the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.
18, "The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock" ("APB
18").  As we do not influence any of the investees' operating or financial
policies, investments in privately held entities are accounted for under the
cost method.</P>
<P>For all of our investments, if a decline in the fair value of an investment
below its carrying value is determined to be other than temporary, such
investment is written down to its estimated fair value with a non-cash charge to
current earnings. <STRONG> </P>

</B><P>In December 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB")
issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, "Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosure" ("SFAS 148"), which
addresses alternative methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily
changes to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee
compensation.  Effective January 1, 2003, the Company adopted the fair value
recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123,
"Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" ("SFAS 123"), prospectively to all
employee awards granted, modified or settled after January 1, 2003.  The cost
related to stock-based employee compensation included in the determination of
net income for 2002 and 2001 is less than that which would have been recognized
if the fair value based method had been applied to all awards since the original
effective dates of SFAS 123.  See Note 10, Stock Option Plans and Stock
Grants.</P>
<P>In April 2002, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
145, "Rescission of FASB Statement No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB
Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections" ("SFAS 145"), which requires any
gain or loss on early extinguishment of debt that was classified as an
extraordinary item that does not meet certain criteria, be reclassified from
extraordinary item to continuing operations.  In accordance with SFAS 145, the
extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt recognized in 2002 will be
reclassified to continuing operations in 2003.</P>
<P>In August 2001, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets" ("SFAS
144"), which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or
disposal of long-lived assets and supercedes SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of,"
and the accounting and reporting provisions of APB Opinion No. 30, "Reporting
the Results of Operations" for a disposal of a segment of business.  We adopted
SFAS 144 on January 1, 2002.  See Note 12, Discontinued Operations.</P>
<P>In June 2001, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
141, "Business Combinations" ("SFAS 141") and No. 142, "Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets" ("SFAS 142").  SFAS 141 requires that the purchase method of
accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001.
It also includes guidance on the initial recognition and measurement of goodwill
and other intangible assets arising from business combinations.  SFAS 142
requires that these assets be reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Intangible assets with finite lives will continue to be amortized over their
estimated useful lives.  The adoption of SFAS 141 and 142 did not have a
material impact on our liquidity, financial position or results of
operations.</P>

<P>4. Unsecured Line of Credit </P>
</STRONG><P>In July 2002, we expanded and extended our unsecured line of credit.
Our new line of credit amends our $325 million unsecured line of credit that was
scheduled to mature in February 2003 and has been used to pay off our $50
million unsecured term loan.  The maximum permitted amount of borrowings under
the amended line of credit is $425 million.  The amended line of credit has a
maturity date of July 2005, which may be extended at our sole option for an
additional one-year period.  Borrowings under our unsecured line of credit, as
amended, bear interest at a floating rate based on our election of either a
LIBOR-based rate or the higher of the bank's reference rate and the Federal
Funds rate plus 0.5%.  For each LIBOR-based advance, we must elect a LIBOR
period of one, two, three or six months.</P>
<P>Our line of credit contains financial covenants, including, among other
things, maintenance of minimum net worth, a total liabilities to gross asset
value ratio, and a fixed charge coverage ratio.  In addition, the terms of the
line of credit restrict, among other things, certain investments, indebtedness,
distributions and mergers.  As of December 31, 2002, borrowings outstanding on
the line of credit carried a weighted average interest rate of 3.07%.</P>
<P>Aggregate borrowings under the line of credit may be limited to an amount
based on the net operating income derived from a pool of unencumbered
properties.  As of December 31, 2002, the amount calculated under these
provisions exceeded the maximum permitted borrowings of $425 million.</P>
<P>We utilize interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of our exposure
to variable interest rates associated with our unsecured line of credit.  These
agreements involve an exchange of fixed and floating interest payments without
the exchange of the underlying principal amount (the "notional amount").
Interest received under all of our swap agreements is based on the one-month
LIBOR rate.  The net difference between the interest paid and the interest
received is reflected as an adjustment to interest expense.</P>

<P><FONT size=3>Effective January 1, 2001, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 133 ("SFAS 133"), "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities," as amended by Statement No. 138, "Accounting for Certain
Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities."  SFAS 133, as amended,
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative financial
instruments such as our interest rate swap agreements.  Specifically, SFAS 133
requires us to reflect our interest rate swap agreements on the balance sheet at
their estimated fair values.  We use a variety of methods and assumptions based
on market conditions and risks existing at each balance sheet date to determine
the fair values of our interest rate swap agreements.  These methods of
assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value, and such value
may never be realized.  As of January 1, 2001, the adoption of SFAS 133, as
amended, resulted in qualifying interest rate swap agreements reported on the
balance sheet as a liability of approximately $3.5 million, with a corresponding
reduction to accumulated other comprehensive income, a separate component of
stockholders' equity.</P>
<P>All of our interest rate swap agreements meet the criteria to be deemed
"effective" under SFAS 133 in reducing our exposure to variable interest rates.
Accordingly, we have categorized these instruments as cash flow hedges.  While
we intend to continue to meet the conditions for hedge accounting, if hedges did
not qualify as highly effective, the changes in the fair value of the
derivatives used as hedges would be reflected in earnings.</P>
<P>We do not believe we are exposed to more than a nominal amount of credit risk
in our interest rate swap agreements as our counterparties are established,
well-capitalized financial institutions. </P>
<P>On January 22, 2001, we terminated an interest rate swap agreement with a
notional amount of <BR>
</P>
<B><P>4</B><STRONG>. Unsecured Line of Credit (continued)</P>
</STRONG><P>$50 million, an interest pay rate of 7.25% and a maturity of
December 31, 2001.  The terminated interest rate swap agreement was replaced
with the 6.35% interest rate swap agreement as shown in the table above.  The
fair value of the terminated interest rate swap agreement at the date of
termination (a liability of $950,000) was transferred to the replacement 6.35%
interest rate swap agreement.  During 2001, approximately $475,000 was
reclassified from other comprehensive income to interest expense.  Approximately
$475,000 was credited against interest expense during 2002.  These adjustments
resulted in an effective interest pay rate for the 6.35% interest rate swap
agreement of 7.30% for 2001 and 5.40% for 2002.</P>
<P>As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, our interest rate swap agreements have been
reported in the accompanying balance sheets at their fair value as other
liabilities of approximately $9.0 million and $7.5 million, respectively.  The
offsetting adjustments were reflected as deferred losses in accumulated other
comprehensive income of $9.0 million and $7.0 million, respectively.  Balances
in accumulated other comprehensive income are recognized in earnings as swap
payments are made.</P>

<P>8. Preferred Stock and Excess Stock</P>
<H4>Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock</H4>
</STRONG><P>There are 1,543,500 shares of our 9.50% Series A cumulative
redeemable preferred stock outstanding.  The shares were issued in 1999 at a
price of $25.00 per share.  We pay dividends quarterly in arrears at an annual
rate of $2.375 per share. Our Series A preferred stock has no stated maturity,
is not subject to any sinking fund or mandatory redemption and is not redeemable
prior to June 11, 2004, except in order to preserve our status as a REIT.
Investors in our Series A preferred stock generally have no voting rights. On or
after June 11, 2004, we may, at our option, redeem our Series A preferred stock,
in whole or in part, at any time for cash at a redemption price of $25.00 per
share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends. </P>
<B><P>Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock</P>
</B><P>In January 2002, we completed a public offering of 2,300,000 shares of
our 9.10% Series B cumulative redeemable preferred stock (including the shares
issued upon exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option). The shares
were issued at a price of $25.00 per share, resulting in aggregate proceeds of
approximately $55.1 million, net of underwriters' discounts and other offering
costs. The dividends on our Series B preferred stock are cumulative and accrue
from the date of original issuance. We pay dividends quarterly in arrears at an
annual rate of $2.275 per share. Our Series B preferred stock has no stated
maturity, is not subject to any sinking fund or mandatory redemption and is not
redeemable prior to January 22, 2007, except in order to preserve our status as
a REIT. Investors in our Series B preferred stock generally have no voting
rights. On or after January 22, 2007, we may, at our option, redeem our Series B
preferred stock, in whole or in part, at any time for cash at a redemption price
of $25.00 per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends.</P>
<STRONG><P>Preferred Stock and Excess Stock Authorizations</P>
</STRONG><P>Our charter authorizes the issuance of up to 100,000,000 shares of
preferred stock, of which 3,843,500 shares were issued and outstanding as of
December 31, 2002. In addition, 200,000,000 shares of "excess stock" (as
defined) are authorized, none of which were issued and outstanding at December
31, 2002. </P>
<STRONG><P>9. Commitments and Contingencies</P>
<P>Employee Retirement Savings Plan</P>
</STRONG><P>We have a retirement savings plan pursuant to Section 401(k) of the
Internal Revenue Code ("Code") whereby our employees may contribute a portion of
their compensation to their respective retirement accounts, in an amount not to
exceed the maximum allowed under the Code. We have elected to provide
discretionary profit sharing contributions (subject to statutory limitations),
which amounted to $428,000, $353,000 and $254,000, respectively, for the years
ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000. Employees who participate in the plan
are immediately vested in their contributions and in the contributions of the
company. </P>
<STRONG><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>9. Commitments and Contingencies (continued)</P>
<P>Concentration of Credit Risk</P>
</STRONG><P>We maintain our cash and cash equivalents at insured financial
institutions. The combined account balances at each institution periodically
exceed FDIC insurance coverage, and, as a result, there is a concentration of
credit risk related to amounts in excess of FDIC insurance coverage. We believe
that the risk is not significant. </P>
<P>We are dependent on rental income from relatively few tenants in the life
science industry. The inability of any single tenant to make its lease payments
could adversely affect our operations. As of December 31, 2002, we held leases
with a total of 173 tenants and 51 of our 89 properties were each leased to a
single tenant. At December 31, 2002, our three largest tenants accounted for
approximately 14.0% of our aggregate annualized base rent. </P>
<P>We generally do not require collateral or other security from our tenants,
other than security deposits.  In addition to security deposits held in cash, we
held $15.7 million in irrevocable letters of credit available from certain
tenants as security deposits for 47 leases as of December 31, 2002.</P>
<STRONG><P>Commitments</P>
</STRONG><P>As of December 31, 2002, we were committed under the terms of
construction contracts and certain leases to complete the development of
buildings and related improvements at a remaining aggregate cost of $6.0
million. </P>
<P>As of December 31, 2002, we were also committed to fund approximately $51.4
million for the construction of building infrastructure improvements and for
certain investments. </P>
<P>As of December 31, 2002, we were committed under the terms of ground leases
at five of our properties and one land development parcel.  The ground leases
have remaining lease terms of 14 to 53 years (exclusive of extension options),
with aggregate remaining ground lease payments of approximately $26.2
million.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<STRONG><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>10. Stock Option Plans and Stock Grants</P>
<P>1997 Stock Plan</P>
</STRONG><P>In 1997, we adopted a stock option and incentive plan (the "Stock
Plan") for the purpose of attracting and retaining the highest quality
personnel, providing for additional incentives and promoting the success of the
company by providing employees the opportunity to acquire common stock pursuant
to (i) options to purchase common stock; and (ii) share awards. As of December
31, 2002, a total of 362,211 shares were reserved for the granting of future
options and share awards under the Stock Plan. </P>
<P>Options under our plan have been granted at prices that are equal to the
market value of the stock on the date of grant and expire ten years after the
date of grant. Employee options vest ratably in three annual installments from
the date of grant. Non-employee director options vest immediately on the date of
grant. The options outstanding under the Stock Plan expire at various dates
through November 2011. </P>
<P>In addition, the Stock Plan permits us to issue share awards to our employees
and non-employee directors.  A share award is an award of common stock which (i)
may be fully vested upon issuance or (ii) may be subject to the risk of
forfeiture under Section 83 of the Internal Revenue Code. Shares issued
generally vest over a one-year period and the sale of the shares is restricted
prior to the date of vesting.   During 2002, we awarded 76,075 shares of common
stock. These shares were recorded at fair value with a corresponding charge to
stockholders' equity.  The unearned portion is amortized as stock compensation
expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<STRONG><P>10. Stock Option Plans and Stock Grants (continued)</P>
<P>1997 Stock Plan (continued)</P>
</STRONG><P>For 2002 and all prior years, we have elected to follow Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees"
("APB 25") and related Interpretations in accounting for our employee and non-
employee director stock options, stock grants and stock appreciation rights.
Effective January 1, 2003, the Company has adopted the fair value recognition
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 123, "Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation" ("SFAS 123"), prospectively to all employee awards
granted, modified or settled after January 1, 2003.  Under APB 25, because the
exercise price of the options we granted equals the market price of the
underlying stock on the date of grant, no compensation expense has been
recognized. Although we have elected to follow APB 25, pro forma information
regarding net income and net income per share is required by SFAS 123.  This
information has been determined as if we had accounted for our stock options
under the fair value method under SFAS 123. The fair value of the options issued
under the Stock Plan was estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes
option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions for 2002,
2001 and 2000: </P>

<P><B>12. Discontinued Operations</B></P>
<P>On January 1, 2002, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144,
&quot;Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets&quot;
(&quot;SFAS 144&quot;) became effective. SFAS 144 addresses financial accounting
and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets.  Under SFAS
144, a</STRONG> property is classified as held for sale when all of the
following criteria for a plan of sale have been met: 1) management, having the
authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the property, 2) the
property is available for immediate sale in its present condition, subject only
to the terms that are usual and customary, 3) an active program to locate a
buyer, and other actions required to complete the plan to sell have been
initiated, 4) the sale of the property is probable and is expected to be
completed within one year, 5) the property is being actively marketed for sale
at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value, and 6)
actions necessary to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that
significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.
When all of these criteria have been met, the property is classified as held for
sale and its operations are classified as discontinued operations. Amounts from
prior periods are reclassified from continuing operations to discontinued
operations. A loss is recognized for any initial adjustment of the asset's
carrying amount to fair value less costs to sell in the period the asset
qualifies as held for sale.  The accompanying statements have been
presented in compliance with SFAS 144.</P>
<P>As of December 31, 2002, we had two properties that have been designated as
&quot;held for sale&quot; under the provisions of SFAS 144.  The net book value
of one of the properties, a parcel of land which cannot be redeveloped pursuant
to our original strategic objectives, has been reduced by an impairment charge
of $1,150,000. This charge has been reflected in discontinued operations for
2002.  Interest expense included in discontinued operations represents interest
related to a secured note payable which is expected to be either assumed by the
buyer or repaid at the close of the anticipated sale.</P>
