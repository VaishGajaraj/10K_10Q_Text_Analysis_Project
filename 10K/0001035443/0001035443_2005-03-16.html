"believes", "expects", "may", "will", "should", "seeks", "intends", "plans",
"estimates" or "anticipates", or the negative of these words or similar words.
Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties regarding

number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from
those included within or contemplated by the forward-looking statements,
including, but not limited to, those described below under the headings "Item 1.
Business-Business Risks" and "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of

<I><P>General</P>
</I></B><P>We are a Maryland corporation formed in October 1994 that has
elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") for federal
income tax purposes.  We are engaged primarily in the ownership, operation,
management, acquisition, expansion and selective redevelopment and development
of high quality, strategically located properties containing office/
laboratory space designed and improved for lease primarily to pharmaceutical,
biotechnology, life science product, service, biodefense, educational and
translational medicine institutions/entities, as well as related government
agencies (collectively, the "life science industry").  Properties leased to
tenants in the life science industry typically consist of suburban office
buildings containing scientific research and development laboratories and other
improvements that are generic to tenants operating in the life science industry.
We refer to such properties as "life science properties".  As of December 31,
2004, we owned 112 properties (collectively, the "properties") in nine states
containing approximately 7.4 million rentable square feet of office/
laboratory space.   </P>
<I><B><P>Business and Growth Strategy</P>
</I></B><P>We focus our property operations and investment activities
principally in the following life science markets: </P>

areas).</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>

</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
</UL>

<P>Our tenant base is broad and diverse within the life science industry and
reflects our focus on regional, national and international tenants with
substantial financial and operational resources.  For a more detailed
description of our properties and tenants, see "Item 2. Properties."  We have an
experienced Board of Directors and are led by a senior management team with
extensive experience in both the real estate and life science industries. </P>
<P>We seek to maximize growth in funds from operations ("FFO") and cash
available for distribution to stockholders through the ownership, operation,
management, acquisition, expansion and selective redevelopment and development
of life science properties.  See "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Funds from Operations" for a

</UL>

<P>Our ability to negotiate contractual rent escalations in future leases and to
achieve increases in rental rates will depend upon market conditions and the
demand for life science properties at the time the leases are negotiated and the
increases are proposed.</P>
<U><P>Acquisitions</U>. We seek to identify and acquire high quality life
science properties in our target markets on a selective basis.  Critical
evaluation of prospective property acquisitions is an essential component of our
acquisition strategy.  When evaluating acquisition opportunities, we assess a
full range of matters relating to the properties, including the: </P>

<UL>

<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>location of the property and our strategy in the relevant
market;</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>quality of existing and prospective tenants;</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>condition and capacity of the building

<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>opportunities to expand the existing
property.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
</UL>

<U>
<P>Redevelopment.</U> We seek to enhance our growth by redeveloping existing
office, warehouse or vacant space as generic laboratory space that can be leased
at higher rates.  As of December 31, 2004, we had 17 properties in our
redevelopment program that contained a total of approximately 1,296,000 square
feet.  Of this total, approximately 669,000 square feet were under redevelopment
and currently vacant, and the remaining approximately 627,000 square feet were
currently leased.  We have also identified approximately 625,000 square feet of
additional space in our existing portfolio for potential redevelopment.</P>
<U><P>Development</U>. Our development strategy is primarily to pursue selective
build-to-suit projects where we expect to achieve investment returns that will
equal or exceed our returns on acquisitions.  We generally have undertaken
build-to-suit projects only if our investment in infrastructure will be
substantially made for generic, rather than tenant-specific, improvements. As of
December 31, 2004, we had six parcels of land under development for
approximately 358,000 square feet of office/laboratory space.  In addition, we
currently own parcels of land and may expand existing properties, representing
an aggregate future development potential of approximately 3,719,000 rentable
square feet of office/laboratory space.</P>

<U><P>Financing/Working Capital</U>.  We believe that cash provided by
operations, our unsecured line of credit and our unsecured term loan will be
sufficient to fund our working capital requirements.  We generally expect to
finance future acquisitions and redevelopment and development projects through
our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan and, then, to refinance
some or all of that indebtedness periodically with additional equity or debt
capital.  We may also issue shares of our common stock, preferred stock or
interests in our subsidiaries to fund future operations.  See "Item 7.
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations-Unsecured Line of Credit and Unsecured Term Loan".</P>
<P>We seek to maintain a balance between the amounts of our fixed and variable
debt with a view to moderating our exposure to interest rate risk.  We also use
financial instruments, such as interest rate swap agreements, to hedge a portion
of our exposure to the variable interest rates associated with our unsecured
line of credit and unsecured term loan.  Interest rate swap agreements involve
an exchange of fixed and floating interest rate payments without the exchange of
the underlying principal or "notional amount".  Interest received under our
current interest rate swap agreements is based on the one-month LIBOR rate.  <A
NAME="OLE_LINK6">See "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources"</A> for a
more complete discussion of our unsecured line of credit, unsecured term loan,
interest rate swap agreements and other outstanding indebtedness. </P>
<U><P>Preferred Securities</U>.  We have in the last year, and expect to
continue, to issue additional series of preferred stock that are senior to our
common stock.  At December 31, 2004, we had approximately $187.0 million of
preferred stock outstanding.  The preferred stock has general preference rights
with respect to liquidation and quarterly distributions.  In June 2004, we
completed a public offering of 5,185,500 shares of our 8.375% Series C
cumulative redeemable preferred stock with aggregate proceeds of approximately
$124.0 million.  In July 2004, we redeemed all 1,543,500 outstanding shares of
our 9.50% Series A cumulative redeemable preferred stock.  Future redemptions or

<I><B><P>Business Risks</P>
</I><U><P>We Are Largely Dependent on the Life Science Industry for Revenues
from Lease Payments</P>
</U></B><P>In general, our strategy is to invest primarily in properties
used by tenants in the life science industry.  Our business could be adversely
affected if the life science industry experiences an economic downturn.  Because
of our industry focus, events within the life science industry may have a more
pronounced effect on our ability to make distributions to our stockholders than
if we had more diversified investments.  Also, some of our properties may be
better suited for a particular life science industry tenant and could require
modification before we are able to release vacant space to another life science
industry tenant.  Generally, our properties may not be suitable for lease to
traditional office tenants without significant expenditures on renovations. </P>
<U><B><P>Our Tenants May Not Be Able to Pay Us if They Are Unsuccessful in
Discovering, Developing, Making or Selling Their Products and Technologies</P>
</U></B><P>Our life science industry tenants are subject to a number of
risks, including the following, any one or more of which may adversely affect
their ability to make rental payments to us. </P>

<UL>

<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>Some of our tenants require significant funding to develop and
commercialize their products and technologies, which funding must be obtained
from private investors, the public markets, companies in the life science
industry or federal, state and local governments.  Such funding may become
unavailable or difficult to obtain, which in turn may adversely affect a
tenant's ability to generate revenues or to pay us rent.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>Even with sufficient funding, some of our tenants may not be
able to discover or identify potential drug targets in humans, or potential
drugs for use in humans, or to create tools or technologies which are
commercially useful in the discovery or identification of potential drug targets
or drugs.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>Some of our tenants developing potential drugs may find that
their drugs are not effective, or may even be harmful, when tested in
humans.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>Some of our tenants may not be able to manufacture their drugs
economically, even if such drugs are proven through human clinical trials to be
safe and effective in humans.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>Drugs that are developed and manufactured by some of our tenants
require regulatory approval prior to being made, marketed, sold and used.  The
regulatory approval process to manufacture and market drugs is costly, typically
takes several years, requires the expenditure of substantial resources and is
often unpredictable.  A tenant may fail or experience significant delays in
obtaining these approvals.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>Some of our tenants and their licensors require patent,
copyright or trade secret protection to develop, make, market and sell their
products and technologies.  A tenant may be unable to commercialize its products
or technologies if patents covering such products or technologies do not issue,
or are successfully challenged, narrowed, invalidated or circumvented by third
parties, or if a tenant fails to obtain licenses to the discoveries of third
parties necessary to commercialize its products or
technologies.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>A drug made by a tenant may not be well accepted by doctors and
patients, or may be less effective or accepted than competitor's drugs, or may
be subsequently recalled from the market, even if it is successfully developed,
proven safe and effective in human clinical trials,  manufactured and the
requisite regulatory approvals are obtained.</LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
</UL>

<P>We cannot assure you that our tenants will be able to develop, make, market
or sell their products and technologies due to the risks inherent in the life
science industry.  Any tenant that is unable to avoid, or sufficiently mitigate,
the risks described above, may have difficulty making rental payments to us.
</P>
<U><B><P>We Could be Held Liable for Damages Resulting from Our Tenants'
Use of Hazardous Materials</P>
</U></B><P>Many of our life science industry tenants engage in research and
development activities that involve the controlled use of hazardous materials,
chemicals and biological and radioactive compounds.  In the event of
contamination or injury from the use of these hazardous materials, we could be
held liable for damages that result.  This liability could exceed our resources
and any recovery available through any applicable environmental remediation
insurance coverage, and could adversely affect our ability to make distributions
to our stockholders. </P>
<P>Together with our tenants, we must comply with federal, state and local laws
and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal
of hazardous materials and waste products.  Failure to comply with, or changes
in, these laws and regulations could adversely affect our business or our
tenants' business and their ability to make rental payments to us. </P>
<U><B><P>The Inability of Any Tenant to Pay Us Rent Could Adversely Affect
Our Business</P>
</U></B><P>Our revenues are derived primarily from rental payments and
reimbursement of operating expenses under our leases.  If our tenants,
especially significant tenants, fail to make rental payments under their leases,
our financial condition, cash flow and our ability to make distributions to our
stockholders could be adversely affected. </P>
<P>As of December 31, 2004, we had 249 leases with a total of 213 tenants.  Of
our 112 properties, 64 properties were occupied by a single tenant.  Our three
largest tenants accounted for approximately 11.6% of our aggregate annualized
base rent, or approximately 5.2%, 3.7% and 2.7%, respectively. "Annualized base
rent" means the annualized fixed base rental amount in effect as of December 31,
2004, using rental revenues calculated on a straight-line basis in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").  Annualized base rent
does not include reimbursements for real estate taxes and insurance, common area
and other operating expenses, substantially all of which are borne by the
tenants in the case of triple net leases. </P>
<P>The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant may also adversely affect the
income produced by a property.  If any of our tenants becomes a debtor in a case
under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, we cannot evict that tenant solely because of
its bankruptcy.  The bankruptcy court may authorize the tenant to reject and
terminate its lease with us.  Our claim against such a tenant for unpaid future
rent would be subject to a statutory limitation that might be substantially less
than the remaining rent actually owed to us under the tenant's lease.  Any
shortfall in rent payments could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability
to make distributions to our stockholders. </P>
<U><B>
<P>Our U.S. Government Tenants May Not Receive Annual Appropriations, Which
Could Adversely Affect Their Ability to Pay Us</P>
</U></B><P>U.S. government tenants may be subject to annual appropriations.
If one of our U.S. government tenants fails to receive its annual appropriation,
it might not be able to make its lease payments to us.  In addition, defaults
under leases with federal government tenants are governed by federal statute and
not by state eviction or rent deficiency laws.  All of our leases with U.S.
government tenants provide that the government tenant may terminate the lease
under certain circumstances.  As of December 31, 2004, leases with U.S.
government tenants at our properties accounted for approximately 4.2% of our
aggregate annualized base rent. </P>
<U><B><P>Loss of a Tenant Could Have a Negative Impact on Our Business</P>
</U></B><P>A tenant may not renew its lease upon the expiration of the
initial term.  In addition, we may not be able to locate a qualified replacement
tenant upon expiration or termination of a lease.  Consequently, we could lose
the cash flow from the affected property, which could negatively impact our
business.  We may have to divert cash flow generated by other properties to meet
our mortgage payments, if any, or to pay other expenses related to owning the
affected property.  As of December 31, 2004, leases at our properties
representing approximately 6.4% and 11.8% of the total square footage of our
properties were scheduled to expire in 2005 and 2006, respectively. </P>
<U><B><P>Poor Economic Conditions in Our Markets Could Adversely Affect Our

these markets could adversely affect our operations and our ability to make

<U><B><P>We May Have Difficulty Managing Our Growth</P>
</U></B><P>We expect to continue to grow by acquiring, redeveloping and

we must successfully integrate new properties into our existing operations.  We
may not succeed with the integration.  In addition, we may not effectively

make distributions to our stockholders. </P>
<U><B><P>We May Not Be Able to Obtain Additional Capital to Further Our
Business Objectives</P>
</U></B><P>Our ability to acquire, redevelop or develop properties depends
upon our ability to obtain capital.  Periodically, the real estate industry
experiences reduced supplies of favorably-priced equity or debt capital, which
decreases the level of new investment activity by publicly-traded real estate
companies.  A prolonged period in which we cannot effectively access the public
equity or debt markets may result in heavier reliance on alternative financing
sources to undertake new investments.  An inability to obtain equity or debt
capital on acceptable terms could delay or prevent us from acquiring,
structuring and completing desirable investments, which could adversely affect
our business.  Also, the issuance of additional shares of capital stock or
interests in subsidiaries to fund future operations could dilute the ownership
of then existing stockholders. </P>
<P>We have filed a "shelf" registration statement on Form S-3, under which we
may offer from time to time and at our discretion, common stock, preferred
stock, warrants and debt securities with an aggregate public offering price of
up to $500,000,000, in amounts, at prices and on terms to be determined at the
time of offering.</P>
<U><B><P>If Interest Rates Rise, Our Debt Service Costs Will Increase</P>
</U></B><P>Borrowings outstanding under our unsecured line of credit,
unsecured term loan and certain other borrowings bear interest at a variable
rate, and we may incur additional variable rate debt in the future.  Increases
in market interest rates would increase our interest expense under these debt
instruments and would increase the costs of refinancing existing indebtedness or
obtaining new debt.  Accordingly, these increases could adversely affect our
financial position and our ability to make distributions to stockholders. </P>
<U><B><P>We May Not Be Able to Acquire Properties or Operate Them
Successfully</P>
</U></B><P>Our success depends in large part upon our ability to acquire
additional properties on satisfactory terms and to operate them successfully.
If we are unable to do so, our business could be adversely affected.  In
addition, the acquisition of life science properties generally involves a higher
per square foot price than the acquisition of traditional suburban office
properties. </P>

<P>In addition, our charter prohibits, with certain limited exceptions, direct
or constructive ownership of shares of our capital stock representing more than
9.8% of the combined total value of the outstanding shares of our capital stock
by any person (the "Ownership Limit").  Our Board of Directors may exempt a
stockholder from the Ownership Limit if, prior to the exemption, our Board of
Directors receives all information it deems necessary to determine or ensure our
status as a REIT. </P>
<P>The constructive ownership rules are complex and may cause shares of our
common stock owned directly or constructively by a group of related individuals

of shares to a person who, as a result of the transfer, violates the Ownership
Limit, may be void or may be deemed to be made to a trust, for the benefit of

for other reasons be desired by our common stockholders or that have a dividend
preference which may adversely affect our ability to pay dividends on our common

<DL>
<DT>&#9;Under our Stockholder Rights Plan, if a stockholder acquires beneficial
ownership of 15% or more of our common stock, other stockholders would become
entitled to purchase our common stock at half the market price, which would

<P>Our Insurance May Not Adequately Cover All Potential Losses</P>
</U></B><P>If we experience a loss at any of our properties that is not
covered by insurance or that exceeds our insurance policy limits, we could lose
the capital invested in the affected property and, possibly, future revenues
from that property. In addition, we could continue to be obligated on any
mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the affected properties.
We carry comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage and rental loss
insurance with respect to our properties.  We have obtained earthquake insurance
for all of our properties because many of them are located in the vicinity of
active earthquake faults.  We also carry environmental remediation insurance and
have title insurance policies on all of our properties.  We obtain our title
insurance policies when we acquire the property, with each policy covering an
amount equal to the initial purchase price of each property. Accordingly, any of
our title insurance policies may be in an amount less than the current value of
the related property. </P>
<P>We believe that our insurance policy specifications, insured limits and
deductibles are consistent with or superior to those customarily carried for
similar properties.  Our tenants are also required to maintain comprehensive
insurance, including liability and casualty insurance, that is customarily
obtained for similar properties. There are, however, certain types of losses
that we and our tenants do not generally insure against because they are
uninsurable or because it is not economical to insure against them.  In the
current market, there have recently been substantial increases in the premium
cost of property and liability insurance. The availability of coverage against
certain types of losses, such as from terrorism or toxic mold, has become more
limited and, when available, is at a significantly higher premium cost. We
cannot predict whether insurance coverage against terrorism or toxic mold will
remain available for our properties because insurance companies may no longer
offer coverage against such losses or, if offered, such coverage may become
prohibitively expensive.  Most, but not all, of our properties are low-rise

released at or from any of our properties.  The cost of investigating and
cleaning up contamination could be substantial and could exceed the amount of
any environmental remediation insurance coverage available to us.  In addition,
the presence of contamination, or the failure to properly clean it up, may
adversely affect our ability to lease or sell an affected property, or to borrow
funds using that property as collateral. </P>
<P>Under environmental laws and regulations, we may have to pay governmental
entities or third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean-up
costs incurred by those parties relating to contaminated properties regardless
of whether we knew of or caused the contamination.  Even if more than one party
may have been responsible for the contamination, we may be held responsible for
all of the clean-up costs.  In addition, third parties may sue us for damages
and costs resulting from environmental contamination or jointly responsible
parties may contest their responsibility or be financially unable to pay their
share of such costs.</P>
<P>Environmental laws also govern the presence, maintenance and removal of
asbestos-containing materials.  These laws may impose fines and penalties on us
for the release of asbestos-containing materials and may allow third parties to

<P>Many of our tenants routinely handle hazardous substances and wastes as part
of their operations at our properties.  Environmental laws and regulations
subject our tenants, and potentially us, to liability resulting from these
activities.  Environmental liabilities could also affect a tenant's ability to
make rental payments to us.  We require our tenants to comply with these
environmental laws and regulations and to indemnify us for any related
liabilities. </P>
<P>Independent environmental consultants have conducted Phase I or similar
environmental assessments at all of our properties.  We intend to use
consultants to conduct similar environmental assessments on our future
acquisitions.  This type of assessment generally includes a site inspection,
interviews and a public records review, but no subsurface sampling.  These
assessments and certain additional investigations of our properties have not to
date revealed any environmental liability that we believe would have a material
adverse effect on our business or results of operations. </P>

<P>Nevertheless, it is possible that the assessments on our properties have not
revealed, or that assessments on future acquisitions, will not reveal all
environmental liabilities.  Consequently, there may be material environmental
liabilities of which we are unaware that may result in substantial costs to us

<U><B><P>We May Incur Significant Costs Complying With the Americans With
Disabilities Act and Similar Laws</P>
</U></B><P>Under the Americans With Disabilities Act, places of public
accommodation and/or commercial facilities are required to meet federal
requirements related to access and use by disabled persons.  We may be required
to make substantial capital expenditures at our properties to comply with this
law.  In addition, our noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines or
an award of damages to private litigants. </P>
<P>A number of additional federal, state and local laws and regulations exist
regarding access by disabled persons.  These regulations may require
modifications to our properties or may affect future renovations.  This may
limit the overall returns on our investments. </P>
<P>We believe that our properties are substantially in compliance with the
present requirements of the Americans With Disabilities Act and similar laws.
</P>
<U><B><P>We May Incur Significant Costs If We Fail to Comply With Laws or

</U></B><P>Our properties are subject to many federal, state and local
regulatory requirements and to state and local fire and life-safety
requirements.  If we do not comply with all of these requirements, we may have
to pay fines to governmental authorities or damage awards to private litigants.
We believe that our properties are currently in compliance with all of these
regulatory requirements.  We do not know whether these requirements will change
or whether new requirements will be imposed.  Changes in these regulatory
requirements could require us to make significant unanticipated expenditures.
These expenditures could have an adverse effect on us and our ability to make
distributions to stockholders. </P>

<P>We have adopted a policy of incurring debt only if, upon such incurrence, our
debt to total market capitalization ratio would not exceed 57.5%.  Our total
market capitalization is the market value of our capital stock, including
interests exchangeable for shares of capital stock, plus total debt.  Our Board
of Directors could, however, change or eliminate this policy at any time.
Higher leverage could also increase the risk of default on our debt obligations.

range in size up to 284,000 square feet, are built to accommodate single or
multiple tenants and are generally one or two story concrete tilt-up, block

suburban office properties, but interior infrastructures are designed to
accommodate the needs of life science industry tenants. These improvements
typically are generic to life science industry tenants rather than being
specific to a particular tenant. As a result, we believe that the improvements
have long-term value and utility and are usable by a wide range of life science

<P>Future distributions on our common stock will be determined by and at the
discretion of our Board of Directors and will be dependent upon a number of
factors, including actual cash available for distribution, our financial
condition and capital requirements, the annual distribution requirements under
the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and such other factors as our
Board of Directors deems relevant. To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we
must make annual distributions to stockholders of at least 90% of our taxable
income for the current taxable year, determined without regard to deductions for
dividends paid and excluding any net capital gains. Under certain circumstances,
we may be required to make distributions in excess of cash flow available for
distributions to meet these distribution requirements. In such a case, we may
borrow funds or may raise funds through the issuance of additional debt or
equity capital. We cannot assure you that we will make any future distributions.
</P>
<P>The tax treatment of distributions on common stock paid in 2004 is as
follows:  (1) 76.8% ordinary dividend, (2) 19.8% return of capital, (3) 2.4%
capital gain at 15%, and (4) 1.0% Section 1250 capital gain at 25%.  The tax
treatment of distributions paid in 2003 is as follows: (1) 87.5% ordinary
dividend, (2) 3.0% return of capital, (3) 1.7% capital gain at 15%, and (4) 7.8%
Section 1250 capital gain at 25%,</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><LI>GAAP basis accounting for real estate assets utilizes historical
cost accounting and assumes real estate values diminish over time.  In an effort
to overcome the miscorrelation between real estate values and historical cost
accounting for real estate assets, the Board of Governors of the National
Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") established the
measurement tool of Funds From Operations ("FFO").  Since its introduction, FFO
has become a widely used non-GAAP financial measure by REITs.  We believe that
FFO is helpful to investors as an additional measure of the performance of an
equity REIT.  We compute FFO in accordance with standards established by the
Board of Governors of NAREIT in its April 2002 White Paper (the "White Paper")
and related implementation guidance, which may differ from the methodology for
calculating FFO utilized by other equity REITs, and, accordingly, may not be
comparable to such other REITs.  In 2003, NAREIT issued guidance, which modifies
the calculation of FFO for both past and future periods.  In accordance with
NAREIT's revised guidance, we now include losses from early extinguishment of
debt and real estate impairment charges in our calculation of FFO.  As such, the
reported amounts of FFO for the year ended December 31, 2002 have been modified
from those previously reported.  The White Paper defines FFO as net income
(loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from
sales, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for
unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.  While FFO is a relevant and
widely used measure of operating performance for REITs, it should not be
considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP)
as an indication of financial performance, or to cash flows from operating
activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity,
nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our
ability to make distributions.  We believe that net income is the most directly
comparable GAAP financial measure to FFO.  For a more detailed discussion of
FFO, see "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations - Funds from Operations."</LI></BLOCKQUOTE></OL>

<P>Our success also depends upon economic trends generally and various market
conditions.  We caution you not to place undue reliance on forward-looking
statements, which reflect our analysis only and speak as of the date of this
report or, if different, as of the dates indicated in the statements.  We assume

<P>We are a publicly-traded real estate investment trust focused primarily on
the ownership, operation, management, acquisition, expansion and selective
redevelopment and development of high quality, strategically located properties
containing office/laboratory space leased principally to tenants in the life
science industry.  We refer to these properties as "life science
properties".</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 2004, we: </P>

<UL>

<LI>Acquired 23 properties with an aggregate of approximately
1,630,000 rentable square feet.  In addition, we completed the development of a
property with an aggregate of approximately 104,000 rentable square
feet.</LI>
 <LI>Expanded our unsecured line of credit from $440 million to $500
million and extended its term to December 2007, which may be further extended at
our sole option for an additional one-year period.</LI>
 <LI>Expanded our unsecured term loan from $150 million to $250
million and extended its term to December 2009.</LI>
 <LI>Sold one property with approximately 42,000 rentable square
feet. </LI>
 <LI>Completed a public offering of 5,185,500 shares of our 8.375%
Series C cumulative redeemable preferred stock ("Series C preferred
stock").</LI>
 <LI>Redeemed all of the outstanding shares of our 9.50% Series A
cumulative preferred stock with proceeds from the Series C preferred stock
offering.  </LI>
</UL>

<P>Our primary source of revenue is rental income and tenant recoveries from
leases at the properties we own.  Of the 112 properties we owned as of December
31, 2004, four were acquired in 1994, nine in 1996, nine in 1997, 26 in 1998,
six in 1999, 11 in 2000, five in 2001, four in 2002, four in 2003 (the "2003
Properties") and 23 in 2004.  In addition, we completed the development of one
property in 1999, five properties in 2000 (together with the 11 properties
acquired in 2000, the "2000 Properties"), two properties in 2001 (together with
the five properties acquired in 2001, the "2001 Properties"), two properties in
2002 (together with the four properties acquired in 2002, the "2002 Properties")
and one property in 2004 (together with the 23 properties acquired in 2004, the
"2004 Properties").  As a result of these acquisition and development
activities, as well as our ongoing leasing and redevelopment activities, there
have been significant increases in total revenues and expenses, including
significant increases in total revenues and expenses for 2004 as compared to
2003, and for 2003 as compared to 2002. </P>
<B><P>Critical Accounting Policies</P>
<P>&#9;</B>Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of
operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States ("GAAP").  Our significant accounting policies are described in
the notes to our consolidated financial statements.  The preparation of these
financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates,
judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses.  We base these estimates, judgments and
assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we
believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.  Actual results may differ
from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.</P>
<I><P>REIT Compliance</P>
</I><P>We have elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ("REIT")
under the Internal Revenue Code.  Qualification as a REIT involves the
application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue
Code to our operations and financial results, and the determination of various
factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control.  We believe
that our current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and
regulations promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code to enable us to qualify,
and continue to qualify, as a REIT.  However, it is possible that we have been
organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow us to qualify as a
REIT, or that our future operations could cause us to fail to qualify.</P>
<P>If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, then we will be required
to pay federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on
our taxable income at regular corporate rates.  If we lose our REIT status, then
our net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders would
be significantly reduced for each of the years involved and we would no longer
be required to make distributions to our stockholders. </P>
<I>
<P>Rental Properties and Properties Under Development</P>
</I><P>In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141,
"Business Combinations", we perform the following procedures when
making an allocation of the purchase price of real estate: (1) estimate the
value of the real estate as of the acquisition date on an "as if vacant" basis;
(2) allocate the "as if vacant" value among land, land improvements, buildings,
building improvements, tenant improvements and equipment; (3) calculate the
value of the intangibles as the difference between the "as if vacant" value and
the purchase price; and (4) allocate the intangible value to above, below and at
market leases, origination costs associated with in-place leases, tenant
relationships and other intangible assets.</P>
<P>The values allocated to land improvements, buildings, building improvements,
tenant improvements and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis using
an estimated life of 20 years for land improvements, 40 years for buildings and
building improvements, the respective lease term for tenant improvements and the
estimated useful life for equipment.  The values of above and below market
leases are amortized over the life of the related lease and recorded as either
an increase (for below market leases) or a decrease (for above market leases) to
rental income.  The values of at-market leases and origination costs are
classified as leasing costs, included in other assets on our balance sheets and
amortized over the remaining life of the lease. </P>
<P>Rental properties and properties under development are individually evaluated
for impairment when conditions exist which may indicate that it is probable that
the sum of expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying
amount of the property.  Upon determination that impairment has occurred, a
write-down is recorded to reduce the carrying amount of the property to its
estimated fair value. </P>
<I><P>Capitalization of Costs</P>
<P>&#9;</I>In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
34, "Capitalization of Interest Cost" ("SFAS 34") and Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 67, "Accounting for Costs and Initial Rental Operations
of Real Estate Projects" ("SFAS 67"), we capitalize direct construction and
development costs, including predevelopment costs, interest, property taxes,
insurance and other costs directly related and essential to the acquisition,
development or construction of a project.  Pursuant to SFAS 34 and SFAS 67,
capitalization of construction and development costs is required while
activities are ongoing to prepare an asset for its intended use.  Costs incurred
after a project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use are
expensed as incurred.  Costs previously capitalized related to abandoned
acquisition or development opportunities are written-off.  Should development
activity cease, a portion of interest, property taxes, insurance and certain
costs would no longer be eligible for capitalization, and would be expensed as
incurred.  Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as
incurred.</P>
<P>&#9;We also capitalize costs directly related and essential to our leasing
activities.  These costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the terms
of the related leases.  Costs that were previously capitalized and which related
to unsuccessful leasing opportunities are written-off. </P>
<I>
<P>Accounting for Investments </P>
</I><P>&#9;We hold equity investments in certain publicly-traded companies and
privately held entities primarily involved in the life science industry.  All of
our investments in publicly-traded companies are considered "available for sale"
in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115,
"Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities" ("SFAS 115"),
and are recorded at fair value.  Fair value has been determined as the closing
trading price at the balance sheet date, with unrealized gains and losses shown
as a separate component of stockholders' equity.  The classification of
investments under SFAS 115 is determined at the time each investment is made,
and such determination is reevaluated at each balance sheet date.  The cost of
investments sold is determined by the specific identification method, with net
realized gains included in other income.</P>
<P>Investments in privately held entities are generally accounted for under the
cost method because we do not influence any operating or financial policies of
the entities in which we invest.  Certain investments are accounted for under
the equity method in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18,
"The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock" and Emerging
Issues Task Force Topic D-46, "Accounting for Limited Partnership Investments".
Under the equity method of accounting, we record our investment initially at
cost and adjust the carrying amount of the investment to recognize our share of
the earnings or losses of the investee subsequent to the date of our investment.
</P>
<P>For all of our investments, if a decline in the fair value of an investment
below its carrying value is determined to be other than temporary, such
investment is written-down to its estimated fair value with a non-cash charge to
current earnings. <B> </B>The factors that we consider in making these
assessments include, but are not limited to, market prices, market conditions,
financial condition, prospects for favorable or unfavorable clinical trial
results, new product initiatives and/or sales, and new collaborative
agreements.</P>
<I><P>Interest Rate Swap Agreements</P>
<P>&#9;</I>We utilize interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of our
exposure to variable interest rates associated with our unsecured line of credit
and unsecured term loan.  These agreements involve an exchange of fixed and
floating interest payments without the exchange of the underlying principal
amount (the "notional amount").  Interest received under all of our swap
agreements is based on the one-month LIBOR rate.  The net difference between the
interest paid and the interest received is reflected as an adjustment to
interest expense. </P>
<P>&#9;We reflect our interest rate swap agreements on the balance sheet at
their estimated fair values.  We use a variety of methods and assumptions based
on market conditions and risks existing at each balance sheet date to determine
the fair values of our interest rate swap agreements.  These methods of
assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value, and such value
may never be realized.</P>
<P>&#9;All of our interest rate swap agreements meet the criteria to be deemed
"highly effective" under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities" in reducing our exposure to variable interest rates.  Accordingly,
we have categorized these instruments as cash flow hedges.  While we intend to
continue to meet the conditions for such hedge accounting, if hedges did not
qualify as "highly effective", the changes in the fair value of the derivatives
used as hedges would be reflected in earnings.</P>
<P>&#9;We do not believe we are exposed to more than a nominal amount of credit
risk in our interest rate swap agreements as our counterparties are established,
well-capitalized financial institutions.</P>
<I>
<P>Recognition of Rental Income</P>
</I><P>Rental income from leases with scheduled rent increases, free rent and
other rent adjustments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the
respective lease terms.  We include amounts currently recognized as income, and
expected to be received in later years, in deferred rent in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets.  Amounts received currently, but recognized as
income in future years, are included as unearned rent in accounts payable,
accrued expenses and tenant security deposits in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets.  Tenant recoveries related to reimbursement of real estate
taxes, insurance, repairs and maintenance, and other operating expenses are
recognized as revenue in the period the applicable expenses are incurred. </P>
<P>We maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the
inability of our tenants to make required payments.  If a tenant fails to make
contractual payments beyond any allowance, we may recognize additional bad debt
expense in future periods equal to the amount of unpaid rent and deferred rent.
</P>
<I><P>Discontinued Operations</P>
<P>&#9;</I>We follow the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets" in determining whether a property qualifies as an asset "held for sale"
and should be classified as "discontinued operations".  A property is classified
as "held for sale" when all of the following criteria for a plan of sale have
been met: (1) management, having the authority to approve the action, commits to
a plan to sell the property; (2) the property is available for immediate sale in
its present condition, subject only to the terms that are usual and customary;
(3) an active program to locate a buyer, and other actions required to complete
the plan to sell, have been initiated; (4) the sale of the property is probable
and is expected to be completed within one year; (5) the property is being
actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its
current fair value; and (6) actions necessary to complete the plan of sale
indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made
or that the plan will be withdrawn. When all of these criteria have been met,
the property is classified as "held for sale" and its operations are classified
as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of income.  When a
property is designated as "held for sale", amounts for all prior periods
presented are reclassified from continuing operations to discontinued
operations.  A loss is recognized for any initial adjustment of the asset's
carrying amount to fair value less costs to sell in the period the asset
qualifies as "held for sale".  Depreciation of assets is discontinued commencing
on the date they are designated as "held for sale".  </P>

<B><P>Results of Operations</P>
<I><P>Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2004 to the Year Ended December
31, 2003</P>
</I></B><P>Rental revenues increased by $17.5 million, or 14%, to $143.9
million for 2004 compared to $126.4 million for 2003.  The increase resulted
primarily from the 2003 Properties being owned for a full year and the addition
of the 2004 Properties.  Rental revenues from properties operating for a full
year during 2004 and 2003 (the "2004 Same Properties") increased by $2.2
million, or 2.2%, primarily due to increases in rental rates and a slight
increase in occupancy.  The average occupancy level of the 2004 Same Properties
was 97.1% as of December 31, 2004, compared to 96.6% as of December 31, 2003.
</P>
<P>Tenant recoveries increased by $3.8 million, or 12%, to $35.9 million for
2004 compared to $32.1 million for 2003.  The increase resulted primarily from
the 2003 Properties being owned for a full year and the addition of the 2004
Properties.  Tenant recoveries for the 2004 Same Properties increased by
$575,000, or 2.3%, primarily due to increases in certain recoverable operating
expenses during 2004. </P>
<P>Other income increased by $1.5 million, or 71%, to $3.5 million for 2004
compared to $2.1 million for 2003, primarily due to an increase in realized
gains on investments and from a general increase in miscellaneous sources of
income.</P>
<P>Rental operating expenses increased by $5.6 million, or 17%, to $38.4 million
for 2004 compared to $32.8 million for 2003.  The increase resulted primarily
from the 2003 Properties being owned for a full year and the addition of the
2004 Properties.  Operating expenses for the 2004 Same Properties increased by
$398,000, or 1.6%, primarily due to increases in salaries for property
engineers, property taxes and repair and maintenance expenses offset slightly by
a decrease in property insurance expenses (substantially all of which are
recoverable from our tenants through tenant recoveries).</P>
<P>General and administrative expenses increased by $894,000, or 6%, to $15.1
million for 2004 compared to $14.2 million for 2003, mainly due to compliance
with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Operation Outreach and general
increases in administrative costs.  Our Operation Outreach program provides
financial assistance to families of activated and deployed soldiers that faced
significant financial challenges and had significant financial needs. </P>
<P>Interest expense increased by $2.3 million, or 9%, to $28.7 million for 2004
compared to $26.4 million for 2003.  The increase resulted primarily from
increases in indebtedness on our unsecured line of credit, unsecured term loan
and secured notes payable, and to increases in the floating interest rates on
our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan.  These borrowings were
utilized to finance the acquisition of the 2003 and 2004 Properties, and the
development and redevelopment of properties. The weighted average effective
interest rate on these borrowings (not including the effect of interest rate
swap agreements) increased from 2.64% as of December 31, 2003 to 3.72% as of
December 31, 2004.  We have entered into certain swap agreements to hedge a
portion of exposure to variable interest rates with our unsecured line of credit
and unsecured term loan (see "Liquidity and Capital Resources - Unsecured Line
of Credit and Unsecured Term Loan").</P>
<P>Depreciation and amortization increased by $3.9 million, or 10%, to $42.5
million for 2004 compared to $38.6 million for 2003.  The increase resulted
primarily from depreciation associated with the 2003 Properties being owned for
a full year and the addition of the 2004 Properties. </P>
<P>Income from discontinued operations of $1.6 million for 2004 reflects the
results of operations of one property that was designated as "held for sale" as
of December 31, 2003.  In connection with this sale, we recorded a gain of
approximately $1.6 million during 2004. Income from discontinued operations of
$11.1 million for 2003 reflects the results of operations of three properties
that were designated as "held for sale" as of December 31, 2002.  In connection
with the sale of these properties, we recorded a net gain of approximately $8.3
million during 2003.</P>
<I><B><P>Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2003 to the Year Ended
December 31, 2002</P>
</I></B><P>Rental revenues increased by $14.7 million, or 13%, to $126.4
million for 2003 compared to $111.7 million for 2002.  The increase resulted
primarily from the 2002 Properties being owned for a full year and the addition
of the 2003 Properties.  Rental revenues from properties operating for a full
year during 2003 and 2002 (the "2003 Same Properties") increased by $1.7
million, or 2.1%, due to increases in rental rates and offset by a slight
decrease in occupancy.  The average occupancy level of the 2003 Same Properties
was 96.7% as of December 31, 2003, compared to 97.2% as of December 31, 2002.
</P>
<P>Tenant recoveries increased by $3.1 million, or 11%, to $32.1 million for
2003 compared to $29.0 million for 2002.  The increase resulted primarily from
the 2002 Properties being owned for a full year and the addition of the 2003
Properties.  Tenant recoveries for the 2003 Same Properties increased by
$659,000, or 2.9%, primarily due to increases in certain recoverable operating
expenses. </P>
<P>Other income increased by $511,000, or 33%, to $2.1 million for 2003 compared
to $1.6 million for 2002, primarily due to an increase in realized gains on

<P>Rental operating expenses increased by $3.7 million, or 13%, to $32.8 million
for 2003 compared to $29.1 million for 2002.  The increase resulted primarily
from the 2002 Properties being owned for a full year and the addition of the
2003 Properties.  Operating expenses for the 2003 Same Properties increased by
$871,000, or 4.1%, primarily due to an increase in property insurance and
property taxes (substantially all of which are recoverable from our tenants
through tenant recoveries).</P>
<P>General and administrative expenses increased by $775,000, or 6%, to $14.2
million for 2003 compared to $13.4 million for 2002, mainly due to general
increases in administrative costs, primarily payroll and related expenses.</P>
<P>Interest expense increased by $1.4 million, or 6%, to $26.4 million for 2003
compared to $25.0 million for 2002.  The increase resulted primarily from an
increase in indebtedness on our unsecured line of credit, unsecured term loan
and secured notes payable.  These borrowings were utilized to finance the
acquisition of the 2002 and 2003 Properties and the development and
redevelopment of properties.  The increase in interest expense was partially
offset by a decrease in the floating interest rate on our unsecured line of
credit and unsecured term loan.  The weighted average effective interest rate on
these borrowings (not including the effect of interest rate swap agreements)
decreased from 3.07% as of December 31, 2002 to 2.64% as of December 31, 2003.
We have entered into certain swap agreements to hedge a portion of exposure to
variable interest rates with our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term
loan (see "Liquidity and Capital Resources - Unsecured Line of Credit and
Unsecured Term Loan").</P>
<P>Depreciation and amortization increased by $5.7 million, or 17%, to $38.6
million for 2003 compared to $32.9 million for 2002.  The increase resulted
primarily from depreciation associated with the 2002 Properties being owned for
a full year and the addition of the 2003 Properties. </P>
<P>Income from discontinued operations of $11.1 million for 2003 reflects the
results of operations of three properties that were designated as "held for
sale" as of December 31, 2002.  In connection with the sale of these properties,
we recorded a net gain of approximately $8.3 million during 2003.  Income
from discontinued
operations of $1.8 million for 2002 reflects the results of operations of four
properties that have been designated as "held for sale".  In connection with
these prospective sales, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $1,150,000
related to a property in the San Francisco Bay market that could not be
redeveloped pursuant to its original strategic objectives.  This charge has been
included in income from discontinued operations for 2002.  </P>

<P>Liquidity and Capital Resources</P>
<I><P>Cash Flows</P>
</I></B><P>Net cash provided by operating activities for 2004 decreased by
$7.1 million to $67.8 million compared to $74.8 million for 2003.  An increase
in cash flows from our portfolio of operating properties was offset by a decrease in
net cash provided by operating activities primarily from changes in operating assets
(tenant security deposits and other restricted cash, deferred rent and other assets).</P>
<P>Net cash used in investing activities for 2004 increased by $310.9 million to
$450.7 million compared to $139.8 million for 2003.  This increase was primarily
due to an increase in property acquisitions, increases in additions to rental
properties and properties under development, and a decrease in proceeds from
sales of rental properties.</P>
<P>Net cash provided by financing activities for 2004 increased by $315.0
million to $381.1 million compared to $66.2 million for 2003.  This increase was
primarily due to the net proceeds from our Series C preferred stock offering,
increases in borrowings from our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term
loan, and an increase in proceeds from secured notes payable.  This was
partially offset by the redemption of our Series A cumulative redeemable
preferred stock. </P>

</FONT><I><FONT SIZE=2><B><P>Unsecured Line of Credit and Unsecured Term
Loan</P>
</I></B><P>In December 2004, we amended our unsecured line of credit to
increase our borrowing capacity from $440 million to $500 million.
Borrowings
under our unsecured line of credit, as amended, bear interest at a floating rate
based on our election of either a LIBOR-based rate or the higher of the bank's
reference rate and the Federal Funds rate, plus 0.5%.  For each LIBOR-based
advance, we must elect a LIBOR period of one, two, three or six months.  The
unsecured line of credit expires December 2007 and may be extended at our sole
option for an additional one-year period.  As of December 31, 2004, we had
borrowings of $298.0 million outstanding on the unsecured line of credit
with a weighted average interest rate of 3.72%.  </P>
<P>In December 2004, we amended our unsecured term loan to increase the loan
from $150 million to $250 million.  The unsecured term loan bears interest at a
floating rate based on our election of either a LIBOR-based rate or the higher
of the bank's reference rate and the Federal Funds rate, plus 0.5%.  For each
LIBOR-based advance, we must elect to fix for a period of one, two three or six
months.  The unsecured term loan expires in December 2009.  As of December 31,
2004, we had borrowings of $250.0 million outstanding on the unsecured term loan
with a weighted average interest rate of 3.72%.</P>
<P>Our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan contain financial
covenants, including, among other things, maintenance of minimum net worth, a
leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio.  In addition, the terms of the
unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan restrict, among other things,
certain investments, indebtedness, distributions and mergers.</P>


<P>Aggregate borrowings under the unsecured line of credit and unsecured term
loan may be limited to an amount based on the net operating income derived from
a pool of unencumbered properties.  Accordingly, as we acquire or complete the
development or redevelopment of additional unencumbered properties, aggregate
borrowings available under the unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan
will increase up to a maximum combined amount of $750 million.  Under these
provisions as of December 31, 2004, aggregate borrowings under our unsecured
line of credit and unsecured term loan were limited to $666 million.  Under the
amended and restated unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan, we have
an option to increase our maximum available commitment by an additional $100
million.</P>


<P>We utilize interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of our exposure
to variable interest rates associated with our unsecured line of credit and
unsecured term loan.  These agreements involve an exchange of fixed and floating
interest payments without the exchange of the underlying principal amount (the
"notional amount").  Interest received under all of our swap agreements is based
on the one-month LIBOR rate.  The net difference between the interest paid and
the interest received is reflected as an adjustment to interest expense.</P>

December 31, 2004 (dollars in thousands):</P>

<P>We do not believe we are exposed to more than a nominal amount of credit risk
in our interest rate swap agreements as our counterparties are established,
well-capitalized financial institutions.  In addition, we have entered into
master derivative agreements with each counterparty.  These master derivative
agreements (all of which are on the standard International Swaps &amp;
Derivatives Association, Inc. form) define certain terms between us and each
counterparty to address and minimize certain risks associated with our swap
agreements, including a default by a counterparty<B>.</P>
</B>
<P>As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, our interest rate swap agreements have been
classified at their fair values of approximately $2.1 million and $6.3 million,
respectively, in accounts payable, accrued expenses and tenant security deposits
in our consolidated balance sheets.  The offsetting adjustments of $2.1 million
and $6.3 million, respectively, were reflected as deferred losses
in accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss) in the stockholders' equity section of our consolidated balance
sheets.  Balances in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are
recognized in earnings as swap payments are made.</P>
<I><B><P>Other Resources and Liquidity Requirements</I></B> </P>
<P>In June 2004, we completed a public offering of 5,185,500 shares of our
8.375% Series C cumulative redeemable preferred stock
(including the shares issued upon exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment
option).  The shares were issued at a price of $25.00 per share, resulting in
aggregate proceeds of approximately $124.0 million (after deducting
underwriters' discounts and other offering costs).  </P>
<P>In December 2004, we amended and restated our existing unsecured line of
credit and unsecured term loan.  The maximum permitted borrowings under the
unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan increased to $500 million and
$250 million, respectively.  We may in the future elect to increase commitments
under the unsecured line of credit by up to an additional $100 million.</P>
<P>We expect to continue meeting our short-term liquidity and capital
requirements generally through our working capital and net cash provided by
operating activities.  We believe that the net cash provided by operating
activities will continue to be sufficient to enable us to make distributions
necessary to continue qualifying as a REIT.  We also believe that net cash
provided by operating activities will be sufficient to fund recurring non-
revenue enhancing capital expenditures, tenant improvements and leasing
commissions. </P>
<P>We expect to meet certain long-term liquidity requirements, such as for
property acquisitions, property development and redevelopment activities,
scheduled debt maturities, expansions and other non-recurring capital
improvements, through net cash provided by operating activities, long-term
secured and unsecured indebtedness, including borrowings under the unsecured
line of credit and unsecured term loan, and the issuance of additional debt
and/or equity securities. </P>
<I><B><P>Exposure to Environmental Liabilities</I></B> </P>
<P>In connection with the acquisition of all of our properties, we have obtained
Phase I environmental assessments to ascertain the existence of any
environmental liabilities or other issues.  The Phase I environmental
assessments of our properties have not revealed any environmental liabilities
that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition
or results of operations taken as a whole, nor are we aware of any material
environmental liabilities that have occurred since the Phase I environmental
assessments were completed.  In addition, we carry a policy of pollution legal
liability insurance covering exposure to certain environmental losses at all of
our properties.</P>

</FONT><LI>Major capital expenditures consist of roof replacements and HVAC
systems that are typically identified and considered at the time a property is
acquired.  Major capital expenditures also include one-time costs related to the
implementation of our national branding and signage program.
Major capital expenditures for 2004 include a one-time HVAC system upgrade at
one property totaling  $1,551,000 ($0.25 per square foot in portfolio).
Major capital expenditures for 2003 include $1,072,000 ($0.19 per square foot in
portfolio) in one-time costs related to the implementation of our national
branding and signage program.
Recurring capital expenditures for 2002 include $552,000 ($0.10 per square foot
in portfolio) related to a fully leased property in San Diego, California that
underwent substantial renovation in 2002.
Excludes space that has undergone redevelopment before retenanting.
</LI></OL>

<FONT SIZE=2><P>Capital expenditures fluctuate in any given period due to the
nature, extent and timing of improvements required and the extent to which they
are recoverable from our tenants. Approximately 91% of our leases provide for
the recapture of certain capital expenditures (such as HVAC systems maintenance
and/or replacement, roof replacement and parking lot resurfacing).  In addition,
we maintain an active preventative maintenance program at each of our properties
to minimize capital expenditures required. </P>
<P>Tenant improvements and leasing costs also fluctuate in any given year
depending upon factors such as the timing and extent of vacancies, property age,
location and characteristics, the type of lease (renewal tenant or retenanted
space), the involvement of external leasing agents and overall competitive
market conditions. </P>
<B><P>Inflation</P>
</B><P>As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, approximately 83% and 88%,
respectively, of our leases (on a square footage basis) were triple net leases,
requiring tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes and insurance,
common area and other operating expenses, including increases thereto.  The
decrease in tripe net leases from 2003 to 2004 is primarily due to gross leases
added to the portfolio from properties acquired in 2004.  Gross leases are
generally converted to triple net leases upon renewal or rollover.  In addition,
as of December 31, 2004, approximately 7% of our leases (on a square footage
basis) required the tenants to pay a majority of operating expenses.
Approximately 89% of our leases (on a square footage basis) contained effective
annual rent escalations that are either fixed (generally ranging from 3% to
3.5%) or indexed based on the consumer price index or another index.
Accordingly, we do not believe that our earnings or cash flow from real estate
operations are subject to any significant risk from inflation. An increase in
inflation, however, could result in an increase in the cost of our variable rate
borrowings, including our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan. </P>
<B><P>Funds from Operations</P>
</B><P>GAAP basis accounting for real estate assets utilizes historical
cost accounting and assumes real estate values diminish over time.  In an effort
to overcome the miscorrelation between real estate values and historical cost
accounting for real estate assets, the Board of Governors of the National
Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") established the
measurement tool of Funds From Operations ("FFO").  Since its introduction, FFO
has become a widely used non-GAAP financial measure by REITs.  We believe that
FFO is helpful to investors as an additional measure of the performance of an
equity REIT.  We compute FFO in accordance with standards established by the
Board of Governors of NAREIT in its April 2002 White Paper (the "White Paper")
and related implementation guidance, which may differ from the methodology for
calculating FFO utilized by other equity REITs, and, accordingly, may not be
comparable to such other REITs.  In 2003, NAREIT issued guidance which modifies
the calculation of FFO for both past and future periods.  In accordance with
NAREIT's revised guidance, we now include losses from early extinguishment of
debt and real estate impairment charges in our calculation of FFO.  As such, the
reported amounts of FFO for the year ended December 31, 2002 have been modified
from those previously reported.  The White Paper defines FFO as net income
(loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from
sales, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.  While FFO is a
relevant and widely used measure of operating performance for REITs, it should
not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with
GAAP) as an indication of financial performance, or to cash flows from operating
activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity,
nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our
ability to make distributions. (See "Liquidity and Capital Resources - Cash
Flows" above for information regarding these measures of cash flow.)  We believe
that net income is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to FFO.

<FONT SIZE=2><B><P><A NAME="item7a"></A>Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk</P>
</B><P>Market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in
interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and equity
prices.  The primary market risk to which we believe we are exposed is interest
rate risk, which may result from many factors, including governmental monetary
and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political
considerations and other factors that are beyond our control. </P>
<P>In order to modify and manage the interest rate characteristics of our
outstanding debt and to limit the effects of interest rate risks on our
operations, we may utilize a variety of financial instruments, including
interest rate swaps, caps, floors and other interest rate exchange contracts.
The use of these types of instruments to hedge a portion of our exposure to
changes in interest rates carries additional risks, such as counter-party credit
risk and the legal enforceability of hedging contracts. </P>
<P>Our future earnings, cash flows and fair values relating to financial
instruments are primarily dependent upon prevalent market rates of interest,
such as LIBOR. However, our interest rate swap agreements are intended to reduce
the effects of interest rate changes.  Based on interest rates at, and our swap
agreements in effect on, December 31, 2004 and 2003, we estimate that a 1%
increase in interest rates on our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term
loan, after considering the effect of our interest rate swap agreements, would
decrease annual future earnings and cash flows by approximately $2.0 million and
$1.4 million, respectively.  We further estimate that a 1% decrease in interest
rates on our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan, after considering
the effect of our interest rate swap agreements in effect on December 31, 2004
and 2003, would increase annual future earnings and cash flows by approximately
$2.0 million and $1.4 million, respectively.  A 1% increase in interest rates on
our secured debt and interest rate swap agreements would decrease their
aggregate fair value by approximately $27.2 million and $15.3 million at
December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  A 1% decrease in interest rates on
our secured debt and interest rate swap agreements would increase their
aggregate fair value by approximately $28.4 million and $16.4 million at
December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. </P>
<P>These amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical
interest rates on our borrowing cost and our interest rate swap agreements in
effect on December 31, 2004 and 2003 .  These analyses do not consider the
effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in
such an environment.  Further, in the event of a change of such magnitude, we
would consider taking actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change.
However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and
their possible effects, the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in our
capital structure. </P>
<P>We have exposure to equity price market risk because of our equity
investments in certain publicly-traded companies and privately held entities.
We classify investments in publicly-traded companies as available-for-sale and,
consequently, record them on our balance sheet at fair value with unrealized
gains or losses reported as a component of comprehensive income or loss.
Investments in privately held entities are generally accounted for under the
cost method because we do not influence any of the operating or financial
policies of the entities in which we invest.  For all investments, we recognize
other than temporary declines in value against earnings in the same period the
decline in value was deemed to have occurred.  In 2002, we recorded non-cash
impairment charges of $2,545,000 to write- down certain investments for which we
deemed the decline in fair value to be other than temporary.  There is no
assurance that future declines in values will not have a material adverse impact
on our future results of operations.  By way of example, a 10% decrease in the
fair value of our equity investments as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 would
decrease their fair value by approximately $6.7 million and $4.7 million,
respectively.</P>

Over Financial Reporting</P>
</B><P>The management of Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. and
subsidiaries (the "Company") is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting.  Internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.  The Company's internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance
with the authorizations of the Company's management and directors; and (3)
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.  Management has assessed the
effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2004.  In making its assessment, management has utilized the
criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the
Treadway Commission in "Internal Control - Integrated Framework".  Management
concluded that based on its assessment, the Company's internal control over
financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2004.  Management's
assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2004 has been audited by Ernst &amp; Young LLP, an
independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report on the
next page. </P>

Firm</DT>

</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2><P>To the Board of Directors and Stockholders
of<BR>
Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. </P>
<P>We have audited management's assessment, included in the accompanying
Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that
Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company")
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(the "COSO criteria"). The Company's management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on management's assessment and an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial
reporting based on our audit. </P>
<P>We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, evaluating management's assessment, testing and evaluating
the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such
other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.</P>
<P>A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.</P>
<P>Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.</P>
<P>In our opinion, management's assessment that the Company maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 is
fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria.  Also, in
our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on the
COSO criteria.</P>
<P>We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related
consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004, and our report dated
March 4, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.</P>

<P>To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of<BR>
Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. </P>
<P><A NAME="OLE_LINK5">We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company")
as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of
income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2004.  Our audits also included the financial
statement schedule listed in the index at item 15(a). These financial statements
and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
schedule based on our audits. </P>
<P></A>We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. </P>
<P>In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Alexandria Real
Estate Equities, Inc. and subsidiaries at December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2004, in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.  Also, in our opinion, the related
financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial
statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
information set forth therein. </P>
<P>We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Company's
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on
criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report
dated March 4, 2005, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.</P>

<B><P>Investments</P>
</B><P>We hold equity investments in certain publicly-traded companies and
privately held entities primarily involved in the life science industry. All of
our investments in publicly-traded companies are considered "available for sale"
in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115,
"Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities" ("SFAS 115"),
and are recorded at fair value.  Fair value has been determined as the closing
trading price at the balance sheet date, with unrealized gains and losses shown
as a separate component of stockholders' equity.  The classification of
investments under SFAS 115 is determined at the time each investment is made,
and such determination is reevaluated at each balance sheet date.  The cost of
investments sold is determined by the specific identification method, with
realized gains and losses included in other income in the accompanying
consolidated statements of income.</P>
<P>Investments in privately held entities are generally accounted for under the
cost method because we do not influence any operating or financial policies of
the entities in which we invest.  Certain investments are accounted for under
the equity method in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18,
"The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock" ("APB 18") and
Emerging Issues Task Force Topic D-46, "Accounting for Limited Partnership
Investments" ("EITF Topic D-46"). Under the equity method we record our
investment initially at cost and adjust the carrying amount of the investment to
recognize our share of the earnings or losses of the investee subsequent to the
date of our investment.</P>
<P>For all of our investments, if a decline in the fair value of an investment
below its carrying value is determined to be other than temporary, such
investment is written-down to its estimated fair value with a non-cash charge to
current earnings. The factors that we consider in making these assessments
include, but are not limited to, market prices, market conditions, prospects for
favorable or unfavorable clinical trial results, new product initiatives and new
collaborative agreements. </P>


<B><P>Rental Properties and Properties Under Development</P>
</B><P>In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
141, "Business Combinations", we perform the following procedures
when making an allocation of the purchase price of real estate: (1) estimate the
value of the real estate as of the acquisition date on an "as if vacant" basis;
(2) allocate the "as if vacant" value among land, land improvements, buildings,
building improvements, tenant improvements and equipment; (3) calculate the
value of the intangibles as the difference between the "as if vacant" value and
the purchase price; and (4) allocate the intangible value to above, below and at
market leases, origination costs associated with in-place leases, tenant
relationships and other intangible assets.</P>

<P>The values allocated to land improvements, buildings, building improvements,
tenant improvements and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis using
an estimated life of 20 years for land improvements, 40 years for buildings and
building improvements, the respective lease term for tenant improvements and the
estimated useful life for equipment.  The values of above and below market
leases are amortized over the life of the related lease and recorded as either
an increase (for below market leases) or a decrease (for above market leases) to
rental income.  The values of at-market leases and origination costs are
classified as leasing costs, included in other assets in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets and amortized over the remaining life of the lease.
</P>
<P>Rental properties and properties under development are individually evaluated
for impairment when conditions exist which may indicate that it is probable that
the sum of expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying
amount of the property.  Upon determination that impairment has occurred, a
write-down is recorded to reduce the carrying amount of the property to its
estimated fair value. </P>
<P>In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 34,
"Capitalization of Interest Cost" ("SFAS 34") and Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 67, "Accounting for Costs and Initial Rental Operations
of Real Estate Projects" ("SFAS 67"), we capitalize direct construction and
development costs, including predevelopment costs, interest, property taxes,
insurance and other costs directly related and essential to the acquisition,
development or construction of a project.  Pursuant to SFAS 34 and SFAS 67,
capitalization of construction and development costs is required while
activities are ongoing to prepare an asset for its intended use. Costs incurred
after a project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use are
expensed as incurred.  Costs previously capitalized related to abandoned
acquisition or development opportunities are written-off.  Should development
activity cease, a portion of interest, property taxes, insurance and certain
costs would no longer be eligible for capitalization, and would be expensed as
incurred.  Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as
incurred.</P>


<P>In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144,
"Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets" ("SFAS 144"),
we classify a property as "held for sale" when all of the following
criteria for a plan of sale have been met: (1) management, having the authority
to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the property, (2) the property
is available for immediate sale in its present condition, subject only to the
terms that are usual and customary, (3) an active program to locate a buyer, and
other actions required to complete the plan to sell, have been initiated, (4)
the sale of the property is probable and is expected to be completed within one
year, (5) the property is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is
reasonable in relation to its current fair value, and (6) actions necessary to
complete the plan of sale indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes
to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.  When the property
is classified as "held for sale", its operations are classified as discontinued
operations in our consolidated statements of income.  When a property is
designated as "held for sale", amounts for all prior periods presented are
reclassified from continuing operations to discontinued operations.  A loss is
recognized for any initial adjustment of the asset's carrying amount to fair
value less costs to sell in the period the asset qualifies as "held for
sale".  Depreciation of assets is discontinued commencing on the date
they are designated as "held for sale".  </P>

<P>As of December 31, 2004, we had no properties designated as "held
for sale" in accordance with SFAS 144.
As of December 31, 2003, we had one property designated as "held for
sale".  This property was sold during the first quarter of 2004.  During the
year ended December 31, 2003, we sold three properties, two of which were
designated as "held for sale" as of December 31, 2002. See Note 13, Discontinued
Operations. </P>

<P>Emerging Issues Task Force Topic D-42, "The Effect on the Calculation of
Earnings Per Share for the Redemption or Induced Conversion of Preferred Stock"
("EITF Topic D-42") provides, among other things, that any excess of (1) the
fair value of the consideration transferred to the holders of preferred stock
redeemed over (2) the carrying amount of the preferred stock, should be
subtracted from net earnings to determine net income available to common
stockholders in the calculation of earnings per share.  The cost to issue our
preferred stock was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital in the
years that the preferred stock was issued.  Upon any redemption of our preferred
stock, the respective offering costs, representing the excess of the fair value
of the consideration transferred to the holders over the carrying amount of the
preferred stock, will be recognized as a dividend to preferred stockholders.
During 2004, we recorded a charge of approximately $1,876,000 to net income
available to common stockholders for costs related to the redemption of our 9.5%
Series A cumulative redeemable preferred stock.  Dividends on preferred stock
are deducted from net income to arrive at net income allocable to common
stockholders.</P>

Effective January 1, 2003, the Company adopted the fair value recognition
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 123, "Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation" ("SFAS 123"), prospectively to all employee awards
granted, modified or settled after January 1, 2003.  We did not grant any stock
options in 2004 or 2003.  Under APB 25, because the exercise price of the
options we granted equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date
of grant, no compensation expense has been recognized. Although we have elected
to follow APB 25 for previously granted options, pro forma information regarding
net income and net income per share is required by SFAS 123.  This information

<B><P>Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards</P>
</B><P>In March 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") of the Financial
Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") reached a consensus on Issue No. 03-1, "The
Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain
Investments" ("EITF 03-1").  EITF 03-1 provides guidance on other-than-temporary
impairment of marketable debt and equity securities accounted for under
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, "Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities" ("SFAS 115") and Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 124, "Accounting for Certain Investments Held
by Not-for-Profit Organizations" (SFAS 124"), and non-marketable equity
securities accounted for under the cost method.  EITF 03-1 provides a three-step
model to determine (1) when an investment is considered impaired; (2) whether
the impairment is other-than-temporary; and (3) the measurement of the
impairment loss.  The guidance also requires certain disclosures about
unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other-than-temporary
impairments.  In addition, EITF 03-1 provides that a company does not have to
estimate the fair value of an investment accounted for under the cost method if
there are no identified events or changes in circumstances that may have a
significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment.  In September
2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position ("FSP") 03-1-1, "Effective Date of
Paragraphs 10-20 of EITF 03-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment
and Its Application to Certain Investments", which delays the effective date of
the recognition and measurement provisions of EITF 03-1 until certain
implementation issues are addressed and a final FSP providing implementation
guidance is issued.  The Company adopted the disclosure guidance of EITF 03-1 in
December 2004.  We do not expect the adoption of the recognition and measurement
provisions of EITF 03-1 to have a material impact on our financial statements.
</P>
<P>In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment" ("SFAS 123R").  SFAS 123R requires
measurement of all employee stock-based compensation awards using a fair value
method and the recording of such expense in the financial statements.  This
eliminates the accounting for such awards using the intrinsic method pursuant to
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees" ("APB 25").  SFAS 123R is effective beginning in our third quarter of
2005.  Upon adoption of SFAS 123R, we intend to use the modified-prospective
transition method whereby compensation expense will be recognized relating to
the remaining unvested portion of outstanding stock options at the time of
adoption, and the expense will be recognized over the remaining service period.
We do not expect the adoption of SFAS 123R to have a material impact on our
financial statements. </P>


<B><P>Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards (continued)</P>
</B><P>In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 153, "Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets ("SFAS 153"), which amends
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 29, "Accounting for Nonmonetary
Transactions" ("APB 29").  SFAS 153 addresses the measurement of exchanges of
nonmonetary assets and redefines the scope of transactions that should be
measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged.  SFAS 153 is effective
for nonmonetary asset exchanges beginning in our third quarter of 2005.  We do
not expect the adoption of SFAS 153 to have a material impact on our financial
statements.<A NAME="OLE_LINK1"></P>

<B><P>4.  Investments</P>
</B><P>We hold equity investments in certain publicly-traded companies and
privately held entities primarily involved in the life science industry. All of
our investments in publicly-traded companies are considered "available for sale"
in accordance with SFAS 115, and are recorded at fair value.  Investments in
privately held entities are generally accounted for under the cost method
because we do not influence any operating or financial policies of the entities
in which we invest.  Certain investments are accounted for under the equity
method in accordance with APB 18 and EITF Topic D-46. <A NAME="OLE_LINK3"> For
all of our investments, if a decline in the fair value of an investment below
its carrying value is determined to be other than temporary, such investment is
written-down to its estimated fair value with a non-cash charge to current
earnings. The factors that we consider in making these assessments include, but
are not limited to, market prices, market conditions, prospects for favorable or
unfavorable clinical trial results, new product initiatives and new
collaborative agreements. </A> For additional discussion of our accounting
policies with respect to investments, see Note 2, Basis of Presentation and

</pre>


<P>Investments in available-for-sale securities with gross unrealized losses
as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 have been in a continuous unrealized loss
position for less than twelve months.  We believe that these unrealized losses
are temporary and accordingly we have not recognized other-than-temporary
impairment related to available-for-sale securities as of December 31, 2004 and
2003.</P>

<P>Our investments in privately held entities as of December 31, 2004 and
2003 totaled $48,295,000 and $45,045,000, respectively.  Of these totals,
$47,433,000 and $42,331,000 are accounted for under the cost method.  The
remainder ($862,000 and $2,714,000 for 2004 and 2003, respectively) are
accounted for under the equity method in accordance with APB 18 and EITF Topic
D-46. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, there were no unrealized losses in our
investments in privately held entities.  </P>
<P>Net investment income of $2,436,000 and $536,000 was recognized in 2004 and
2003, respectively, and is included in other income in the accompanying
consolidated statements of income.  Net investment income in 2004 consisted of
equity in income of $208,000 related to investments in privately held entities
accounted for under the equity method, gross realized gains of $2,508,000, and
gross realized losses of $280,000.  Net investment income in 2003 consisted of
equity in income of $306,000 related to investments in privately held entities
accounted for under the equity method, gross realized gains of $532,000, and
gross realized losses of $302,000.  During 2002 we recognized an aggregate
non-cash impairment charge of $2,545,000 for other-than-temporary declines in the
fair value of our investments in private companies.</P>

<B><P>5. Unsecured Line of Credit and Unsecured Term Loan</P>
</B><P>In December 2004, we amended our unsecured line
of credit to increase our borrowing capacity from $440 million to $500 million.
Borrowings under our unsecured line of credit, as amended, bear interest at a
floating rate based on our election of either a LIBOR-based rate or the higher
of the bank's reference rate and the Federal Funds rate, plus 0.5%.  For each
LIBOR-based advance, we must elect a LIBOR period of one, two, three or six
months.  The unsecured line of credit expires December 2007 and may be extended
at our sole option for an additional one-year period.  As of December 31, 2004,
we had borrowings of $298.0 million outstanding on the unsecured line of credit
with a weighted average interest rate of 3.72%.  </P>
<P>In December 2004, we amended our unsecured term loan to increase the loan
from $150 million to $250 million.  The unsecured term loan bears interest at a
floating rate based on our election of either a LIBOR-based rate or the higher
of the bank's reference rate and the Federal Funds rate, plus 0.5%.  For each
LIBOR-based advance, we must elect to fix for a period of one, two three or six
months.  The unsecured term loan expires in December 2009.  As of December 31,
2004, we had borrowings of $250.0 million outstanding on the unsecured term loan
with a weighted average interest rate of 3.72%.</P>
<P>Our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan contain financial
covenants, including, among other things, maintenance of minimum net worth, a
leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio.  In addition, the terms of the
unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan restrict, among other things,
certain investments, indebtedness, distributions and mergers.   </P>
<P>Aggregate borrowings under the unsecured line of credit and unsecured term
loan may be limited to an amount based on the net operating income derived from
a pool of unencumbered properties.  Accordingly, as we acquire or complete the
development or redevelopment of additional unencumbered properties, aggregate
borrowings available under the unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan
will increase up to a maximum combined amount of $750 million.  Under these
provisions as of December 31, 2004, aggregate borrowings under our unsecured
line of credit and unsecured term loan were limited to $666 million. Under the
amended and restated unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan, we have
an option to increase our maximum available commitment by an additional $100
million.</P>

<P>We utilize interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of our
exposure to variable interest rates associated with our unsecured line of credit
and unsecured term loan.  These agreements involve an exchange of fixed and
floating interest payments without the exchange of the underlying principal
amount (the "notional amount").  Interest received under all of our swap
agreements is based on the one-month LIBOR rate.  The net difference between the
interest paid and the interest received is reflected as an adjustment to
interest expense.</P>

<P>Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 ("SFAS 133"), "Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended by Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 138, "Accounting for Certain Derivative
Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities" establishes accounting and reporting
standards for derivative financial instruments such as our interest rate swap
agreements.  Specifically, SFAS 133 requires us to reflect our interest rate
swap agreements on the balance sheet at their estimated fair values.  We use a
variety of methods and assumptions based on market conditions and risks existing
at each balance sheet date to determine the fair values of our interest rate
swap agreements.  These methods of assessing fair value result in a general
approximation of value, and such value may never be realized.</P>
<B><P>5</B><B>. Unsecured Line of Credit and Unsecured Term Loan
(continued)</P>
</B><P>All of our interest rate swap agreements meet the criteria to be
deemed "highly effective" under SFAS 133 in reducing our exposure to variable
interest rates.  Accordingly, we have categorized these instruments as cash flow
hedges.  While we intend to continue to meet the conditions for such hedge
accounting, if hedges did not qualify as "highly effective", the changes in the
fair value of the derivatives used as hedges would be reflected in earnings.</P>
<P>We do not believe we are exposed to more than a nominal amount of credit risk
in our interest rate swap agreements as our counterparties are established,
well-capitalized financial institutions. </P>
<P>As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, our interest rate swap agreements have been
classified in accounts payable, accrued expenses and tenant security deposits in
the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at their fair values of
approximately $2.1 million and $6.3 million, respectively.  The offsetting
adjustments of $2.1 million and $6.3 million, respectively, were reflected as
deferred losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the
stockholders' equity section of the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
Balances in accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) are recognized in earnings as swap payments are
made.  During the next twelve months, we expect to reclassify $0.9 million from
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to interest expense.</P>

stock") at a redemption price of $25.00 per share plus $0.5409722 per share
representing accumulated and unpaid dividends to the redemption date.  In
accordance with EITF Topic D-42, we recorded a charge of approximately
$1,876,000 to net income available to common stockholders during the second
quarter of 2004 for costs related to the redemption of the Series A preferred
stock.  We redeemed our Series A preferred stock with proceeds from the Series C
preferred stock offering.</P>
<B><P>Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock</P>
</B><P>In January 2002, we completed a public offering of 2,300,000 shares of
our 9.10% Series B cumulative redeemable preferred stock ("Series B preferred
stock") (including the shares issued upon exercise of the underwriters' over-
allotment option).  The shares were issued at a price of $25.00 per share,
resulting in aggregate proceeds of approximately $55.1 million (after deducting
underwriters' discounts and other offering costs).  The dividends on our Series
B preferred stock are cumulative and accrue from the date of original issuance.
We pay dividends quarterly in arrears at an annual rate of $2.275 per share.
Our Series B preferred stock has no stated maturity, is not subject to any
sinking fund or mandatory redemption and is not redeemable prior to January 22,
2007, except in order to preserve our status as a REIT.  Investors in our Series
B preferred stock generally have no voting rights.  On or after January 22,
2007, we may, at our option, redeem our Series B preferred stock, in whole or in
part, at any time with proceeds from the sale of equity securities at a
redemption price of $25.00 per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends.</P>
<B><P>Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock</P>
</B><P>In June 2004, we completed a public offering of 5,185,500 shares of our
8.375% Series C cumulative redeemable preferred stock ("Series C preferred
stock") (including the shares issued upon exercise of the underwriters' over-
allotment option).  The shares were issued at a price of $25.00 per share,
resulting in aggregate proceeds of approximately $124.0 million (after deducting
underwriters' discounts and other offering costs).  The proceeds were used to
redeem our Series A preferred stock with the remaining portion used to pay down
our unsecured line of credit.  The dividends on our Series C preferred stock are
cumulative and accrue from the date of original issuance.  We pay dividends
quarterly in arrears at an annual rate of $2.09375 per share.  Our Series C
preferred stock has no stated maturity, is not subject to any sinking fund or
mandatory redemption and is not redeemable prior to June 29, 2009, except in
order to preserve our status as a REIT.  Investors in our Series C preferred
stock generally have no voting rights.  On or after June 29, 2009, we may, at
our option, redeem our Series C preferred stock, in whole or in part, at any
time for cash at a redemption price of $25.00 per share, plus accrued and unpaid
dividends.</P>
<B><P>Preferred Stock and Excess Stock Authorizations</P>
</B><P>Our charter authorizes the issuance of up to 100,000,000 shares of
preferred stock, of which 7,485,500 shares were issued and outstanding as of
December 31, 2004. In addition, 200,000,000 shares of "excess stock" (as
defined) are authorized, none of which were issued and outstanding at December
31, 2004. </P>
<B><P>10. Commitments and Contingencies</P>
<P>Employee Retirement Savings Plan</P>
</B><P>We have a retirement savings plan pursuant to Section 401(k) of the
Internal Revenue Code whereby our employees may contribute a portion of their
compensation to their respective retirement accounts, in an amount not to exceed
the maximum allowed under the Internal Revenue Code.  We have elected to provide
discretionary profit sharing contributions (subject to statutory limitations),
which amounted to $515,000, $461,000 and $428,000, respectively, for the years
ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. Employees who participate in the plan
are immediately vested in their contributions and in the contributions of the
company. </P>
<B><P>Concentration of Credit Risk</P>
</B><P>We maintain our cash and cash equivalents at insured financial
institutions.  The combined account balances at each institution periodically
exceed FDIC insurance coverage, and, as a result, there is a concentration of
credit risk related to amounts in excess of FDIC insurance coverage.  We believe
that the risk is not significant. </P>
<P>We are dependent on rental income from relatively few tenants in the life
science industry.  The inability of any single tenant to make its lease payments
could adversely affect our operations.  As of December 31, 2004, we held leases
with a total of 213 tenants and 64 of our 112 properties were each leased to a
single tenant.  At December 31, 2004, our three largest tenants accounted for
approximately 11.6% of our aggregate annualized base rent. </P>
<P>We generally do not require collateral or other security from our tenants,
other than security deposits.  In addition to security deposits held in cash, we
held $32.9 million in irrevocable letters of credit available from certain
tenants as security deposits for 73 leases as of December 31, 2004.</P>
<B><P>Commitments</P>
</B><P>As of December 31, 2004, we were committed under the terms of
construction contracts to complete the construction of properties under
development at a remaining aggregate cost of $18.3 million. </P>
<P>As of December 31, 2004, we were also committed to fund approximately $23.2
million for the construction of building infrastructure improvements under the
terms of leases and/or construction contracts and approximately $17.2 million
for certain investments. </P>
<P>Ground lease obligations as of December 31, 2004 include leases at seven of
our properties and one land development parcel.  These lease obligations, of
approximately $65.3 million, have remaining lease terms of 28 to 51 years,
exclusive of extension options.  </P>

<B><P>11. Stock Option Plans and Stock Grants</P>
<P>1997 Stock Plan</P>
</B><P>In 1997, we adopted a stock option and incentive plan (the "Stock
Plan") for the purpose of attracting and retaining the highest quality
personnel, providing for additional incentives and promoting the success of the
company by providing employees the opportunity to acquire common stock pursuant
to (i) options to purchase common stock; and (ii) share awards. As of December
31, 2004, a total of 218,790 shares were reserved for the granting of future
options and share awards under the Stock Plan. </P>
<P>Options under our plan have been granted at prices that are equal to the
market value of the stock on the date of grant and expire ten years after the
date of grant. Employee options vest ratably in three annual installments from
the date of grant. Non-employee director options vest immediately on the date of
grant. The options outstanding under the Stock Plan expire at various dates
through October 2012. </P>
<P>In addition, the Stock Plan permits us to issue share awards to our employees
and non-employee directors.  A share award is an award of common stock, which
(i) may be fully vested upon issuance or (ii) may be subject to the risk of
forfeiture under Section 83 of the Internal Revenue Code.  Shares issued
generally vest over a one to three year period from the date of issuance and the
sale of the shares is restricted prior to the date of vesting.   During 2004, we
awarded 130,143 shares of common stock. The unearned portion of these awards is
amortized as stock compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the
vesting period. </P>
<P>The fair value of the options issued under the Stock Plan was estimated at
the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following
weighted average assumptions for 2004, 2003 and 2002: </P>

<P>During the first quarter of 2004, we sold one property located in the
Suburban Washington D.C. market that had been designated as "held for sale" as
of December 31, 2003.  The total sale price for the property was approximately
$5.7 million.  In connection with the sale, we recorded a gain on sale of
property of approximately $1.6 million.  During the fourth quarter of 2003, we
sold one property located in the Suburban Washington D.C. market that had been
designated as "held for sale" during the fourth quarter of 2003.  The total sale
price for the property was approximately $9.0 million.  In connection with the
sale, we recorded a loss on sale of property of approximately $36,000.  During
the third quarter of 2003, we sold one property located in the Eastern
Massachusetts market that had been previously designated as "held for sale" as
of December 31, 2002.  The total sale price for the property was approximately
$46.5 million.  In connection with this sale, we recorded a gain on sale of
property of approximately $8.8 million.  Interest expense included in
discontinued operations represents interest related to a secured note payable,
which was assumed by the buyer in connection with the sale of this property.
During the first quarter of 2003, we sold one property located in the San
Francisco Bay market which could not be redeveloped pursuant to our original
strategic objectives and that had been designated as "held for sale" as of
December 31, 2002.  The total sale price for the property was
approximately $6.8 million.  In connection with this sale, we recorded a loss on
sale of property of approximately $455,000 in 2003.  Gains and losses on sales
of these properties are included on the income statement in income from
discontinued operations, net.  The non-cash impairment charge of $1.2 million in
discontinued operations in 2002 relates to the reduction in the net book value
as of December 31, 2002 of the property in the San Francisco Bay market which
could not be redeveloped and was sold in the first quarter of 2003.</P>
