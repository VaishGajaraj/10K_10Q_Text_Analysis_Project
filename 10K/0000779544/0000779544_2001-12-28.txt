Item 1.   Business

General

     Ark Restaurants Corp. (the "Registrant" or the "Company") is a holding
company formed in 1983. Through its subsidiaries, it owns and operates 26
restaurants and bars, 19 fast food concepts, catering operations, and wholesale
and retail bakeries. Initially its facilities were located only in New York
City. At this time, twelve of the restaurants are located in New York City, four
are located in Washington, D.C., nine are located in Las Vegas, Nevada, and one
is located in Islamorada, Florida. The Company's Las Vegas operations include
three restaurants within the New York-New York Hotel & Casino Resort, and
operation of the Resort's room service, banquet facilities, employee dining room
and nine food court operations. The Company also owns and operates four
restaurants and four food court facilities at the Venetian Casino Resort and one
restaurant and six food court facilities at the Aladdin Resort and Casino and
one restaurant within the Forum Shops at Caesar's Shopping Center.

     In addition to the shift from a Manhattan-based operation to a multi-city
operation, the nature of the facilities operated by the Company has shifted from
smaller, neighborhood restaurants to larger, destination restaurants intended to
benefit from high patron traffic attributable to the uniqueness of the
restaurant's location. Most of the restaurants opened in recent years are of the
latter description. The Company opened the restaurant operations at the New
York-New York Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada in fiscal 1997. In fiscal
1998, the Company acquired one such destination restaurant, the Stage Deli
located at the Forum Shops in Las Vegas, Nevada, and opened another destination
restaurant, Red located at the South Street Seaport in New York. In fiscal 1999,
the Company opened Thunder Grill in Union Station, Washington, D.C. During
fiscal 2000, the Company opened two restaurants and four food court facilities
at the Venetian Casino Resort as well as one restaurant and a 15,000 square foot
food court containing multiple outlets at the Aladdin Resort & Casino, in Las
Vegas, Nevada. The Company will shortly begin construction of a restaurant and
bar at the Neonopolis Center to be known as The Saloon at Fremont Street in Las
Vegas, Nevada, which is scheduled to open in the third quarter of fiscal 2002.
The Company has sold a number of its smaller, neighborhood restaurants.

     The names and themes of each of the Company's restaurants are different
except for the Company's three America restaurants, two Sequoia restaurants, two
Gonzalez y Gonzalez restaurants and two Lutece restaurants. The menus in the
Company's restaurants are extensive, offering a wide variety of high quality
foods at generally moderate prices. Of the Company's restaurants, the two Lutece
restaurants may be classified as expensive. The atmosphere at many of the
restaurants is lively and extremely casual. Most of the restaurants have
separate bar areas utilized by diners awaiting tables. A majority of the net
sales of the Company is derived from dinner as opposed to lunch service. Most of
the restaurants are open seven days a week and most serve lunch as well as
dinner.

     While decor differs from restaurant to restaurant, interiors are marked by
distinctive architectural and design elements which often incorporate dramatic
interior open spaces and extensive glass exteriors. The wall treatments,
lighting and decorations are typically vivid, unusual and, in some cases, highly
theatrical.

     The following table sets forth certain information with respect to the
Company's facilities currently in operation and the one facility intended to be
opened in fiscal 2002.

(1)  Restaurants are, from time to time, renovated and/or renamed. "Year Opened"
     refers to the year in which the Company or an affiliated predecessor of the
     Company first opened, acquired or began managing a restaurant at the
     applicable location, notwithstanding that the restaurant may have been
     renovated and/or renamed since that date.

(2)  Seating capacity refers to the seating capacity of the indoor part of a
     restaurant available for dining in all seasons and weather conditions.
     Outdoor seating capacity, if applicable, is set forth in parentheses and

     goal is $3.0 million. Under the lease for Gonzalez y Gonzalez and the
     Village Eateries, the combined sales goal is $10.0 million. Each of the
     restaurants is currently operating at a level substantially in excess of
     the minimum sales level required to exercise the renewal option for each
     such restaurant.

(7)  The Company operates nine small food court restaurants in the Villages

Restaurant Expansion

     In fiscal 2001, the Company opened V-Bar, a bar and Venus, a lounge and
tiki bar, both at the Venetian Casino Resort in Las Vegas, Nevada. The Company
is about to commence construction of a restaurant and bar to be known as The
Saloon and scheduled to open in the third quarter of fiscal 2002 at the new
Neonopolis Center at Fremont Street in Las Vegas, Nevada.

     The opening of a new restaurant is invariably accompanied by substantial
pre-opening expenses and early operating losses associated with the training of
personnel, excess kitchen costs, costs of supervision and other expenses during
the pre-opening period and during a post-opening "shake out" period until
operations can be considered to be functioning normally. The amount of such
pre-opening expenses and early operating losses can generally be expected to
depend upon the size and complexity of the facility being opened. The Company
incurred pre-opening expenses and early operating losses of approximately
$100,000 in fiscal 2001, $2,393,000 in fiscal 2000, and $400,000 in fiscal 1999.

     The Company's restaurants generally do not achieve substantial increases
from year to year in net sales or profits, which the Company considers to be
typical of the restaurant industry. The Company will have to continue to open
new and successful restaurants or expand or change existing restaurants to
achieve significant increases in net sales or to replace net sales of
restaurants which lose customer favor or which close because of lease
expirations or other reasons. There can be no assurance that a restaurant will
be successful after it is opened, particularly since in many instances the
Company does not operate its new restaurants under a trade name currently used
by the Company, thereby requiring new restaurants to establish their own
identity.

     The Saloon at Fremont Street in Las Vegas is the only new restaurant
currently planned by the Company. The Company may take advantage of
opportunities, considered to be favorable, when they occur, depending upon the
availability of financing and other factors.

Recent Restaurant Dispositions and Charges

     The management agreement for the three restaurants operated by the Company
in Boston (Marketplace Cafe, Brewskeller Pub and Marketplace Grill) expired on
December 31, 2000 and was not renewed.

     In January 2001, the Company closed its America restaurant in Tyson's
Corner, McLean, Virginia. The Company's efforts to sell this restaurant had been
unsuccessful. The Company continuously assessed the carrying value of this
restaurant in accordance with SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets To Be Disposed Of, and determined that the restaurant's value
was impaired based upon the future undiscounted anticipated cash flows. The
Company assessed the discounted cash flow value of the property and it recorded
an impairment charge of $810,769 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000.

     The Company was a partner with a 50% interest in a partnership that was
formed to develop and construct four restaurants at a large theatre development
in Southfield, Michigan. In March 2000, the Company withdrew from the project
and incurred charges, during fiscal 2000, of $4,988,000 from the write-off of
advances for construction costs and working capital needs on the project. In
fiscal 2001, the Company recorded a charge of $150,000 due to a partial
write-off of a note which the Company collected in March 2001. The note was
issued in March 2000 when the Company withdrew from the Southfield, Michigan
project.


                                      -8-




<PAGE>


     The Company believes that its restaurant and food court operations at the
Aladdin in Las Vegas, Nevada were significantly impaired by the events of
September 11th. The restaurant and food court operations experienced severe
sales declines in the aftermath of September 11th and the Aladdin itself
declared bankruptcy on September 28, 2001. The Company continues to operate the
business pending the resolution of the Aladdin bankruptcy proceeding, but an
impairment charge of $10,045,000 was recorded in fiscal 2001.

Restaurant Management

     Each restaurant is managed by its own manager and has its own chef. Food
products and other supplies are purchased primarily from various unaffiliated
suppliers, in most cases by the Company's headquarters' personnel. The Company's
Columbus Bakery supplies bakery products to most of the Company's New York City
restaurants. Each of the Company's restaurants has two or more assistant
managers and sous chefs (assistant chefs). The executive chef department at
Company headquarters designs menus and supervises the kitchens. Financial and
management control is maintained at the corporate level through the use of an
automated data processing system that includes centralized accounting and
reporting. The Company has developed its own proprietary software which
processes information input daily at the Company's restaurants.

Employees

     At December 8, 2001, the Company employed 2,070 persons (including
employees at managed facilities), 1,490 of whom were full-time employees, 580 of
whom were part-time employees, 29 of whom were headquarters personnel, 189 of
whom were restaurant management personnel, 636 of whom were kitchen personnel
and 1,216 of whom were restaurant service personnel. A number of the Company's
restaurant service personnel are employed on a part-time basis. Changes in
minimum wage levels may affect the labor costs of the Company and the restaurant
industry generally because a large percentage of restaurant personnel are paid
at or slightly above the minimum wage. With the exception of some of the
employees at Lutece in New York, the Company's employees are not covered by a
collective bargaining agreement.

     The 2,070 total number of persons employed by the Company compares with
2,595 total number of persons employed by the Company prior to the September 11,
2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. See "Events of
September 11, 2001" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations".

Government Regulation

     The Company is subject to various Federal, state and local laws and
regulations affecting its business, including a variety of regulatory provisions
relating to the wholesomeness of food, sanitation, health, safety and licensing
in the sale of alcoholic beverages. A number of the Company's restaurants have
open or enclosed outdoor cafes which require the approval of, or licensing by, a
number of governmental agencies. The suspension by any regulatory agency of the
food service or the liquor license of any of the Company's restaurants would
have a material adverse effect upon the affected restaurant and, depending upon
the restaurant affected, could adversely affect the Company as a whole.

     The New York State Liquor Authority must approve any transaction in which a
shareholder of the Company increases his holdings to 10% or more of the
outstanding capital stock of the Company and any transaction involving 10% or
more of the outstanding capital stock of the Company.

Seasonal Nature Of Business

     The Company's business is highly seasonal. The second quarter of the
Company's fiscal year, consisting of the non-holiday portion of the cold weather
season in New York and Washington (January, February and March), is the poorest
performing quarter. The Company achieves its best results during the warm
weather, attributable to the Company's extensive outdoor dining availability,
particularly at Bryant Park in New York and Sequoia in Washington, D.C. (the
Company's largest restaurants) and the Company's outdoor cafes. The Company's
facilities in Las Vegas operate on a more consistent basis through the year.

Events of September 11, 2001

     The terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in New York and the
Pentagon in Washington, D.C. on September 11, 2001 have had a material adverse
effect on the Company's revenues. As a result of the attacks, one Company
restaurant, The Grill Room, experienced some damage. The Grill Room, located at
2 World Financial Center which is adjacent to the World Trade Center and which
was substantially damaged, has been closed since September 11 , 2001 and will
likely not reopen until late in fiscal 2002. Several other Company restaurants
in New York City were closed from several days to a month as a result of their
proximity to the World Trade Center, resulting in revenue losses.

     The Company's restaurants in travel destinations, consisting of all of its
restaurants in Washington and Las Vegas and certain restaurants in New York, are
intended to benefit from high tourist traffic. The decline in travel resulting
from the attacks has had a material adverse effect on revenues from those
restaurants. Recovery of those restaurants depends upon restoration of public
confidence in the air transportation system and the public's willingness and
inclination to resume vacation and convention travel.

     By early October after the attacks, the Company had taken major steps to
adapt costs to the Company's then current prospects. The Company believes that
this effort will allow for positive cash flow and earnings in the 2002 fiscal
year and continued debt reduction.

Results of Operations".

Forward Looking Statements

     This report contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and
uncertainties. Discussions containing such forward-looking statements may be
found in the material set forth under "Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations" as well as throughout this report
generally. The Company's actual results could differ materially from those
anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors,
including without limitation the effects of the events of September 11, 2001 and
those additional factors set forth below.

     The restaurant business is intensely competitive and involves an extremely
high degree of risk. The Company believes that a large number of new restaurants
open each year and that a significant number of them do not succeed. Even
successful restaurants rapidly can lose popularity due to changes in consumer
tastes, turnover in personnel, the opening of competitive restaurants,
unfavorable reviews and other factors. There can be no assurance that the
Company's existing restaurants will retain such patronage as they currently
enjoy or that new restaurants opened by the Company will be successful.


                                      -10-




<PAGE>


There is active competition for competent chefs and management personnel and
intense competition among major restaurateurs and food service companies for the
larger, unique sites suitable for restaurants.

     The Company's restaurants generally do not achieve substantial increases
from year to year in net sales or profits. The Company will have to continue to
open new and successful restaurants or expand or change existing restaurants to
achieve significant increases in net sales or to replace net sales of
restaurants which experience declining popularity or which close because of
lease expirations or other reasons. The acquisition or construction of new
restaurants requires significant capital resources. New large scale projects
that have been the focus of the Company's efforts in recent years would likely
require additional financing. If the Company were to identify a favorable
restaurant opportunity, there is no assurance that the required financing would
be available.

Item 2.   Properties

     The Company's restaurant facilities and the Company's executive offices are
occupied under leases. Most of the Company's restaurant leases provide for the
payment of base rents plus real estate taxes, insurance and other expenses and,
in certain instances, for the payment of a percentage of the Company's sales at
such facility. These leases (including leases for managed restaurants) have
terms (including any available renewal options) expiring as follows:

</TABLE>

     The Company's executive, administrative and clerical offices, located in
approximately 8,500 square feet of office space at 85 Fifth Avenue, New York,
New York, are occupied under a lease which expires in October 2008, including a
five-year renewal option. The Company maintains an office in Washington, D.C.
for its catering operations under a short-term lease, which expires in May 2010,
including a five year renewal option.

Item 3.   Legal Proceedings

     In the ordinary course of its business, the Company is a party to various
lawsuits arising from accidents at its restaurants and workmen's compensation
claims, which are generally handled by the Company's insurance carriers.

     The employment by the Company of management personnel, waiters, waitresses
and kitchen staff at a number of different restaurants has resulted in the
institution, from time to time, of litigation alleging violation by the Company
of employment discrimination laws. The Company does not believe that any of such
suits will have a materially adverse effect upon the Company, its financial
condition or operations.

     A lawsuit was commenced against the Company in October 1997 in the District
Court for the Southern District of New York by 44 present and former employees
alleging various violations of Federal wage and hour laws. The complaint sought
an injunction against further violations of the labor laws and payment of unpaid
minimum wages, overtime and other allegedly required amounts, liquidated
damages, penalties and attorney's fees. The lawsuit was settled for
approximately $1,245,000 in May 2001. Based upon settlement discussions in the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2000, the Company recorded a charge of $1,300,000 at
that time.

     Several unfair labor practice charges were filed against the Company in
1997 with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) with respect to the
Company's Las Vegas subsidiary. The charges were heard in October 1997. At issue
was whether the Company unlawfully terminated nine employees and disciplined six
other employees allegedly in retaliation for their union activities. An
Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) found that six employees were terminated
unlawfully and three were discharged for valid reasons and four employees were
disciplined lawfully and two employees unlawfully. On appeal, the NLRB found
that the Company lawfully disciplined five employees, and unlawfully disciplined
one employee. The Company is appealing the adverse rulings of the NLRB to the
D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. The Company does not believe that an adverse
outcome in this proceeding will have a material adverse effect upon the
Company's financial condition or operations.

Item 4.   Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

     Not applicable.

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
        of Operations

Accounting period

         The Company's fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest September 30.
The fiscal years ended September 29, 2001, September 30, 2000 and October 2,
1999 included 52 weeks.

Net Sales

         Net sales at restaurants owned by the Company increased by 6.5% from
fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001 and increased by 7.6% from fiscal 1999 to fiscal
2000. Net sales increased by $9,370,000 from sales at restaurants which the
Company either opened in fiscal 2001 or did not operate for the full period last
year (The Venetian Casino Resort ("the Venetian") concepts: Lutece, Tsunami,
Venus and V-Bar; the Aladdin Resort and Casino ("the Aladdin") concepts: Fat
Anthony's and the Alakazam Food Court; and Jack Rose in New York City). The
increase in net sales for fiscal 2001 was offset by a decrease of $612,000 (a
0.6% decrease) in same store sales and the loss of sales totaling $963,000 at a
restaurant that the Company no longer operates (America in McLean, Virginia).

         The terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in New York and the
Pentagon in Washington, DC on September 11th had an adverse effect on net sales
for fiscal 2001. One Company restaurant (The Grill Room) experienced some
damage. The Grill Room is located in an office building adjacent to the World
Trade Center (in 2 World Financial Center which experienced substantial damage)
and will likely not reopen until late in fiscal 2002 due to the damage sustained
by the office building. No other Company restaurants were physically damaged;
however, several other Company restaurants in New York City were closed from
several days to a month due to their proximity to the World Trade Center
(Sequoia, Red, Gonzalez y Gonzalez). The Company's restaurants in Washington DC
and Las Vegas and certain New York Company restaurants were also impacted by
significant decreases in corporate and tourist travel. Prior to September 11,
2001 the Company's same store sales during the 2001 fiscal year and the last
quarter of that fiscal year had been up 1.7% and 1.6%, respectively over last
year's comparable periods.

         Net sales for fiscal 2000 increased by $8,749,000 from sales at
restaurants which the Company either opened during the year or did not operate
for the full comparable period in the prior year (The Venetian concepts: Lutece,
Tsunami and four food court outlets; the Aladdin concepts: Fat Anthony's and the
Alakazam Food Court; and Thunder Grill in Washington, DC). Net sales also
increased by $3,764,000 from a 3.6% increase in same store sales. The increase
in net sales in fiscal 2000 was offset in part by the loss of sales totaling
$4,102,000 at restaurants that the Company no longer operates (B. Smith's DC,
Perretti Italian Cafe, Louisiana Community Bar & Grill and B. Smith's New York).

Costs and Expenses

         The Company's cost of sales consists principally of food and beverage
costs at restaurants owned by the Company. Cost of sales as a percentage of net
sales was 25.6% in fiscal 2001, 26.0% in fiscal 2000 and 26.4% in fiscal 1999.

         Operating expenses of the Company, consisting of restaurant payroll,
occupancy and other expenses at restaurants owned by the Company, as a
percentage of net sales, were 75.5% in fiscal 2001, 67.6% in fiscal 2000 and
62.7% in fiscal 1999. Operating expenses in fiscal 2001 were adversely affected


                                      -16-







<PAGE>


by an asset impairment charge of $10,045,000, or 7.9% of net sales, associated
with the write down of its restaurant and food court operations at the Aladdin
(Fat Anthony's and the Alakazam Food Bazaar). Operating expenses in fiscal 2001
were also impacted by a charge of $935,000 due to the cancellation of a
development project.

         Operating expenses in fiscal 2000 were adversely affected by an
impairment charge of $811,000 associated with the anticipated sale of a
restaurant (America in McLean, Virginia), expenses of $280,000 from the sale of
a managed restaurant (Arlo) and a $1,300,000 charge associated with a wage and
hour lawsuit. Operating expenses are net of gains on the sale of restaurants
totaling $209,000 in fiscal 2001, $87,000 in fiscal 2000 and $752,000 in fiscal
1999.

         Restaurant payroll was 35.5% of net sales in fiscal 2001, 36.1% in
fiscal 2000 and 35.4% in fiscal 1999, and occupancy expenses were 14.4% of net
sales in fiscal 2001, 12.8% in fiscal 2000 and 12.2% in fiscal 1999. A
significant portion in the increase in occupancy expenses in fiscal 2001 as
compared to fiscal 2000 were due to poor sales results at the Company's
operations at the Aladdin and sales decreases at many of the Company's
restaurants in the weeks following the September 11th attack. Restaurant payroll
and occupancy expenses in fiscal 2000 were impacted by expenses associated with
newly opened restaurant operations.

         Asset impairment charges were 7.9% of net sales in fiscal 2001 and 0.7%
in fiscal 2000. Other operating expenses were 13% of net sales in fiscal 2001,
13.9% in fiscal 2000 and 11.4% in fiscal 1999. Other operating expenses in
fiscal 2001 were impacted by a charge due to the cancellation of a development
project and operating expenses in fiscal 2000 were adversely impacted by
expenses from the sale of the managed restaurant (Arlo) and the charge
associated with the wage and hour lawsuit.

         The Company incurred pre-opening expenses and early operating losses at
newly opened restaurants of approximately $100,000 in fiscal 2001, $2,393,000 in
fiscal 2000, and $400,000 in fiscal 1999. The fiscal 2000 expenses and losses
were from opening restaurants and food court operations within two Las Vegas
casinos (Lutece and Tsunami in the Venetian along with four food court outlets;
and Fat Anthony's and the food court outlets in the Aladdin). The Company also
converted an existing restaurant in New York City (B. Smith's New York was
changed to Jack Rose). The Company typically incurs significant pre-opening
expenses in connection with its new restaurants which are expensed as incurred.
Furthermore, it is not uncommon that such restaurants experience operating
losses during the early months of operation.

         General and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were
5.5% in fiscal 2001, 6.0% in fiscal 2000 and 5.5% in fiscal 1999. If net sales
at managed restaurants were included in consolidated net sales, general and
administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales would have been 5.4% in
fiscal 2001, 5.6% in fiscal 2000 and 5.0% in fiscal 1999. General and
administrative expenses in fiscal 2001 were impacted by $400,000 in legal
expenses incurred in connection with a potential transaction. A significant
portion of the increase in fiscal 2000 as compared to fiscal 1999 is due to
costs associated with the expansion of the Company's corporate sales department,
travel expenditures associated with the new openings in Las Vegas and legal
expenditures from the wage and hour lawsuit.

         The Company managed one restaurant owned by others (El Rio Grande) at
September 29, 2001 while the Company managed four restaurants owned by others
(El Rio Grande in Manhattan, the Marketplace Cafe, the Marketplace Grill, and
the Brewskeller Pub in Boston, Massachusetts) at September 30, 2000. Net sales
of these restaurant facilities, which are not included in consolidated net
sales, were $4,380,000 in fiscal 2001, $8,867,000 in fiscal 2000 and $9,804,000
in fiscal 1999. The decrease in net sales of managed operations is principally
due to the termination of a management


                                      -17-







<PAGE>


contract. The management agreement for the three Boston restaurants expired on
December 31, 2000 and was not renewed. The contribution of these restaurants to
management fee income was $134,000 in fiscal 2001, $278,000 in fiscal 2000 and
$496,000 in fiscal 1999.

         The Company was a partner with a 50% interest in a partnership that was
formed to develop and construct four restaurants at a large theatre development
in Southfield, Michigan. In March 2000, the Company withdrew from the project
and incurred charges, during fiscal 2000, of $4,988,000 from the write-off of
advances for construction costs and working capital needs on the project. In
fiscal 2001, the Company recorded a charge of $150,000 due to a partial
write-off of a note which the Company collected in March 2001. The note was
issued in March 2000 when the Company withdrew from the Southfield, Michigan
project. Such charges are reflected as "Joint Venture Loss" on the Consolidated
Statement of Operations.

         Interest expense was $2,446,000 in fiscal 2001, $2,007,000 in fiscal
2000 and $425,000 in fiscal 1999. The significant increase is principally due to
borrowings to finance the construction costs and working capital requirements of
the Las Vegas restaurant facilities, which opened in fiscal 2000.

         Interest income was $150,000 in fiscal 2001, $172,000 in fiscal 2000
and $226,000 in fiscal 1999.

         Other income, which generally consists of purchasing service fees, and
the sale of logo merchandise at various restaurants, was $344,000 in fiscal
2001, $438,000 in fiscal 2000 and $436,000 in fiscal 1999.

Income Taxes

         The provision for income taxes reflects Federal income taxes calculated
on a consolidated basis and state and local income taxes calculated by each New
York subsidiary on a non consolidated basis. Most of the restaurants owned or
managed by the Company are owned or managed by a separate subsidiary.

         For state and local income tax purposes, the losses incurred by a
subsidiary may only be used to offset that subsidiary's income with the
exception of the restaurants which operate in the District of Columbia.
Accordingly, the Company's overall effective tax rate has varied depending on
the level of losses incurred at individual subsidiaries. Due to losses incurred
in both fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000 and the carry back of such losses, the
Company realized an overall tax benefit of 32.8% and of 35% of such losses in
fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000, respectively. The Company's effective tax rate was
36.4% in fiscal 1999.

         The Company's overall effective tax rate in the future will be affected
by factors such as pre-tax income earned outside of New York City (Nevada has no
state income tax and other states in which the Company operates have income tax
rates substantially lower in comparison to New York), the utilization of state
and local net operating loss carry forwards, and any pre-tax losses incurred at
the Company's New York subsidiaries. In order to more effectively utilize tax
loss carry forwards at restaurants that were unprofitable, the Company has
merged certain profitable subsidiaries with certain loss subsidiaries.

         The Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1993 provides tax credits to the
Company for FICA taxes paid by the Company on tip income of restaurant service
personnel. The net benefit to the Company was $489,000 in fiscal 2001, $503,000
in fiscal 2000 and $512,000 in fiscal 1999.

         The Internal Revenue Service is currently examining the Company's
returns for the fiscal years ended September 30, 1995 through October 2, 1998.
The Company does not expect the results from such examination to have a material
effect on the Company's financial condition.

Liquidity and Sources of Capital

         The Company's primary source of capital is cash provided by operations
and funds available from the revolving credit agreement with its main bank, Bank
Leumi USA. The Company from time to time also utilizes equipment financing in
connection with the construction of a restaurant and seller financing in
connection with the acquisition of a restaurant. The Company utilizes capital
primarily to fund the cost of developing and opening new restaurants and
acquiring existing restaurants.

         The net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2001 ($1,891,000),
fiscal 2000 ($25,244,000) and fiscal 1999 ($6,096,000) was principally for the
Company's continued investment in fixed assets associated with constructing new
restaurants. In fiscal 2001 the Company opened two bars at the Venetian in Las
Vegas, Nevada (V-Bar and Venus). In fiscal 2000 the Company opened two
restaurants and four food court outlets in the Venetian (Lutece, Tsunami and the
food court outlets), and the Company opened one restaurant and six food court
outlets in the Aladdin in Las Vegas, Nevada (Fat Anthony's and the Alakazam Food
Court). In fiscal 1999, the Company opened a restaurant in Union Station in
Washington, DC (Thunder Grill) and began constructing the restaurants and food
court outlets at the Venetian.

         The net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2001 ($5,577,000)
was principally due to repayments of long-term debt on the Company's main credit
facility in excess of borrowings on such facility. The net cash provided from
financing activities in fiscal 2000 ($20,710,000) was principally from
borrowings on the Company's Revolving Credit Facility. The net cash used in
financing activities in fiscal 1999 ($1,632,000) was due to the repurchase of
423,000 shares of the Company's outstanding common stock offset by a net
increase in long-term debt in excess of debt repayments.

         The Company had a working capital deficit of $5,809,000 at September
29, 2001 as compared to working capital deficit of $4,921,000 at September 30,
2000. The restaurant business does not require the maintenance of significant
inventories or receivables; thus the Company is able to operate with negative
working capital.

         At November 21, 2000, the Company's Revolving Credit and Term Loan
Facility with its main bank included a $28,500,000 facility for constructing and
acquiring new restaurants and for working capital purposes at the Company's
existing restaurants. The facility required the Company to repay any borrowings
to the extent such borrowings exceed $26,000,000 on June 30, 2001, $23,000,000
on September 30, 2001 and $22,000,000 on December 27, 2001. At December 27, 2001
the facility was to convert into a term loan payable over three years. The loans
bore interest at prime plus 1/2%. At September 29, 2001 the Company had
borrowings of $22,500,000 outstanding on the facility. The Company also had a
$1,000,000 Letter of Credit Facility for use in lieu of lease security deposits
and the Company had delivered $889,000 in irrevocable letters of credit on this
facility.

         The Revolving Credit Facility limits the amount of indebtedness that
may be incurred by the Company. Certain provisions of the agreement may impair
the Company's ability to borrow funds. The agreement contains certain financial
covenants such as minimum cash flow in relation to the Company's debt service
requirements, ratio of debt to equity, and the maintenance of minimum
shareholders' equity. At September 29, 2001, the Company was not in compliance
with several of the requirements of the agreement principally due to the
impairment charges incurred in connection with its restaurant and food


                                      -19-







<PAGE>


service operations at the Aladdin in Las Vegas, Nevada. Such non-compliance has
been waived by the bank.

         As a result of amendments to the Revolving Credit Facility in November
2001 and December 2001, the financial covenants were amended for forthcoming
periods, the conversion date of the existing facility has been postponed from
December 27, 2001 to June 30, 2002, and the Company may borrow up to $26,000,000
until June 30, 2002. At June 30, 2002, the Company is required to repay any
borrowings to the extent such borrowings exceed $22,000,000 and the revolving
loans will be converted into term loans payable over 36 months.

         Pursuant to an equipment financing facility with its main bank, the
Company borrowed $2,851,000 in January 1997 at an interest rate of 8.75% to
refinance the purchase of various restaurant equipment at the New York-New York
Hotel & Casino Resort. The note, which is payable in 60 equal monthly
installments through January 2002, is secured by such restaurant equipment. At
September 29, 2001 the Company had $231,000 outstanding on this facility. In
April 2000, the Company borrowed $1,570,000 from its main bank at an interest
rate of 8.8% to refinance the purchase of various restaurant equipment at the
Venetian. The note which is payable in 60 equal monthly installments through May
2005, is secured by such restaurant equipment. At September 29, 2001 the Company
had $1,216,000 outstanding on this facility.

         The Company entered into a sale and leaseback agreement with GE Capital
for $1,652,000 in November 2000 to refinance the purchase of various restaurant
equipment at its food and beverage operations at the Aladdin in Las Vegas,
Nevada. The lease bears interest at 8.65% per annum and is payable in 48 equal
monthly installments of $31,785 until maturity in November 2004 at which time
the Company has an option to purchase the equipment for $519,440. Alternatively,
the Company can extend the lease for an additional 12 months at the same monthly
payment until maturity in November 2005 and repurchase the equipment at such
time for $165,242.

         The Company does not anticipate any capital intensive projects during
fiscal 2002 and expects that a significant portion of its projected cash flow
will be applied to debt reduction.

Restaurant Expansion

         The Company opened two bars (V-Bar and Venus) at the Venetian in Las
Vegas, Nevada in fiscal 2001. In fiscal 2000, the Company opened two restaurants
(Tsunami and Lutece) along with three food court outlets at the Venetian and
also opened one restaurant (Fat Anthony's) along with six food court outlets
(Alakazam Food Bazaar) at the Aladdin in Las Vegas, Nevada.

         The Company will shortly begin constructing a 200-seat restaurant and
bar at the Neonopolis Center at Fremont Street in downtown Las Vegas, Nevada.
The Company received a $2,400,000 construction and operating allowance from the
landlord and expects to construct and open the restaurant within the limits of
that allowance.

         The Company is not currently committed to any other projects.

Events of September 11, 2001

         The Company experienced severe sales decreases in the immediate
aftermath of the September 11th terrorist attacks and the operating results for
the fiscal 2001-year were impacted. The Company continues to experience negative
same store sales, although on a much improved level as compared to the


                                      -20-







<PAGE>


immediate weeks following the attack. The Company has aggressively reduced its
payroll at restaurants and at the corporate level. In addition, the Company's
Revolving Credit Facility has been amended in the manner described above under
"Liquidity and Sources of Capital". As a result and given recent sales trends,
the Company believes that it will generate sufficient cash flow in fiscal 2002
to meet its debt obligations.

         One Company restaurant (The Grill Room) itself experienced some damage
in the September 11th attack and is located in the World Financial Center which
experienced substantial damage. It will likely not reopen until late in fiscal
2002. Several other Company restaurants were closed from several days to a month
due to their proximity to the World Trade Center. The damage is still being
assessed. The Company ultimately expects to recover a substantial portion of
physical costs and business interruption losses at these restaurants. However,
at September 29, 2001 the Company did not provide any benefit in the
consolidated financial statements as the extent of the damage was unknown and
the insurance claims are still being quantified.

         The Company believes that its restaurant and food court operations at
the Aladdin in Las Vegas, Nevada were significantly impaired by the events of
September 11th. The restaurant and food court operations experienced severe
sales declines in the aftermath of September 11th and the Aladdin itself
declared bankruptcy on September 28, 2001. The Company continues to operate the
business pending the resolution of the Aladdin bankruptcy proceedings, but an
impairment charge of $10,045,000 was recorded in the fiscal 2001.

         The long-term effects of the terrorist attacks cannot yet be
determined. The Company's restaurants in travel destinations, consisting of all
of its restaurants in Washington and Las Vegas and certain restaurants in New
York, are intended to benefit from high tourist traffic. The decline in travel
resulting from the attacks has had a material adverse effect on revenues from
those restaurants. Recovery of those restaurants depends upon restoration of
public confidence in the air transportation system and its willingness and
inclination to resume vacation and convention travel.

Recent Developments

         The Financial Accounting Standards Board has recently issued the
following accounting pronouncements:

         SFAS No. 141 "Business Combinations", requires that all business
combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 be accounted for using one method,
the purchase method. Use of the pooling of interests method is now prohibited.

         SFAS No. 142 "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" addresses financial
accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets.
Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill and some intangible assets will no longer be
amortized, but rather reviewed for impairment on a periodic basis. Impairment
losses for goodwill and certain intangible assets that arise due to the initial
application of this statement are to be reported as resulting from a change in
accounting principle. The provisions of this statement will be applied at the
beginning of the Company's 2003 fiscal year. The Company is in the process of
evaluating the financial statement impact from adopting this standard.

         SFAS No, 143 "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" requires
the recording of the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement
obligation in the period in which it is incurred. This statement is effective
for the Company at the beginning of the Company's 2004 fiscal year. The Company
does not

expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on the Company's
financial position or results of operations.

         SFAS No. 144 "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived
Assets" supersedes existing accounting literature dealing with impairment and
disposal of long-lived assets, including discontinued operations. It addresses
financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long-lived assets and
for long-lived assets to be disposed of, and expands current reporting for
discontinued operations to include disposals of a "component" of an entity that
has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale. This statement is
effective for the Company at the beginning of the Company's 2003 fiscal year.
The Company is in the process of evaluating the financial statement impact of
this standard.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT


To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Ark Restaurants Corp.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Ark Restaurants
Corp. and its subsidiaries as of September 29, 2001 and September 30, 2000, and
the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity and cash
flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended September 29, 2001.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Ark Restaurants Corp. and
subsidiaries as of September 29, 2001 and September 30, 2000, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the
period ended September 29, 2001, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.

ARK RESTAURANTS CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 29, 2001, SEPTEMBER 30, 2000 AND OCTOBER 2, 1999
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.    BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

      Ark Restaurants Corp. and subsidiaries (the "Company") own and operate 26
      restaurants and bars, 19 fast food concepts, catering operations and
      wholesale and retail bakeries. Twelve restaurants are located in New York
      City, four in Washington, D.C., nine in Las Vegas, Nevada, and one in
      Islamorada, Florida. The Las Vegas operations include three restaurants
      within the New York-New York Hotel & Casino Resort and operation of the
      Resort's room service, banquet facilities, employee dining room and nine
      food court operations. Four restaurants are within the Venetian Casino
      Resort as well as four food court concepts; one restaurant is within
      Desert Passage which adjoins the Aladdin Casino Resort along with six food
      court concepts; and one restaurant within the Forum Shops at Caesar's
      Shopping Center.

      Accounting Period - The Company's fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest
      September 30. The fiscal years ended September 29, 2001, September 30,
      2000 and October 2, 1999 included 52 weeks.

      Significant Estimates - In the process of preparing its consolidated
      financial statements, the Company estimates the appropriate carrying value
      of certain assets and liabilities which are not readily apparent from
      other sources. The primary estimates underlying the Company's financial
      statements include allowances for potential bad debts on accounts and
      notes receivable, the useful lives and recoverability of its assets, such
      as property and intangibles, fair values of financial instruments, the
      realizable value of its tax assets and other matters. Management bases its
      estimates on certain assumptions, which they believe are reasonable in the
      circumstances, and while actual results could differ from those estimates,
      management does not believe that any change in those assumptions in the
      near term would have a material effect on the Company's consolidated
      financial position or the results of operation.

      Principles of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements
      include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All
      significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
      consolidation. Investments in affiliated companies where the Company is
      able to exercise significant influence over operating and financial
      policies even though the Company holds 50% or less of the voting stock,
      are accounted for under the equity method.

      Cash Equivalents - Cash equivalents include instruments with original
      maturities of three months or less.

      Accounts Receivable - Included in accounts receivable are amounts due from
      employees of $1,548,000 and $1,401,000 at September 29, 2001 and September
      30, 2000, respectively. Such amounts, which are due on demand, are
      principally due from various employees exercising stock options in
      accordance with the Company's Stock Option Plan (see Note 10).

      Inventories - Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in,
      first-out) or market, and consist of food and beverages, merchandise for
      sale and other supplies.

      Fixed Assets - Leasehold improvements and furniture, fixtures and
      equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of furniture, fixtures and
      equipment (including equipment under capital leases) is computed using the
      straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective
      assets (seven years). Amortization of improvements to leased properties is
      computed using the straight-line method


                                      F-6






<PAGE>


      based upon the initial term of the applicable lease or the estimated
      useful life of the improvements, whichever is less, and ranges from 5 to
      35 years.

      The Company includes in leasehold improvements in progress restaurants
      that are under construction. Once the projects have been completed the
      Company will begin amortizing the assets.

      The Company annually assesses any impairment in value of long-lived assets
      and certain identifiable intangibles to be held and used. For the year
      ended September 29, 2001, an impairment charge of $10,045,000 was incurred
      on the Company's restaurant operations at Desert Passage, the retail
      complex at the Aladdin Resort & Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada, to reduce the
      operations' assets to their estimated fair values (see Note 2). For the
      year ended September 30, 2000 an impairment charge of $811,000 was
      incurred on a restaurant that the Company owned in McLean, Virginia. Such
      restaurant was closed during the fiscal year ended September 29, 2001. For
      the year ended October 2, 1999 no impairment charges were deemed
      necessary.

      Costs incurred during the construction period of restaurants, including
      rental of premises, training and payroll, are expensed as incurred.

      Intangible and Other Assets - Costs associated with acquiring leases and
      subleases, principally purchased leasehold rights, have been capitalized
      and are being amortized on the straight-line method based upon the initial
      terms of the applicable lease agreements, which range from 10 to 21 years.

      Goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition of shares of the
      Company's common stock from a former shareholder, as discussed in Note 4,
      is being amortized over a period of 40 years. Goodwill arising from
      restaurant acquisitions is being amortized over periods ranging from 10 to
      15 years.

      The Company adopted in the quarter ended January 1, 2000, Statement of
      Position 98-5, Reporting on the Costs of Start-Up Activities, which
      requires costs of start-up activities and organization costs to be
      expensed as incurred. The Company had previously capitalized organization
      costs and then amortized such costs over five years. The Company had net
      deferred organization expenses of $300,000 in intangible assets as of
      October 2, 1999 and such amount ($189,000 after taxes) is reported in the
      fiscal year ended September 30, 2000 as a cumulative effect of a change in
      accounting principle.

      Covenants not to compete arising from restaurant acquisitions are
      amortized over the contractual period of five years.

      Certain legal and bank commitment fees incurred in connection with the
      Company's Revolving Credit and Term Loan Facility, as discussed in Note 7,
      were capitalized as deferred financing fees and are being amortized over
      four years, the term of the facility.

      Operating Lease Deferred Credit - Several of the Company's operating
      leases contain predetermined increases in the rentals payable during the
      term of such leases. For these leases, the aggregate rental expense over
      the lease term is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
      The excess of the expense charged to operations in any year over the
      amounts payable under the leases during that year is recorded as a
      deferred credit. The deferred credit subsequently reverses over the lease
      term (Note 8).

      Occupancy Expenses - Occupancy expenses include rent, rent taxes, real
      estate taxes, insurance and utility costs.

      Income Per Share of Common Stock - Net income per share is computed in
      accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No.
      128, Earnings Per Share, and is calculated on the


                                      F-7






<PAGE>


      basis of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during
      each period plus, for diluted earnings per share, the additional dilutive
      effect of common stock equivalents. Common stock equivalents using the
      treasury stock method consist of dilutive stock options.

      Stock Options - The Company accounts for its stock options granted to
      employees under the intrinsic value-based method for employee stock-based
      compensation and provides pro forma disclosure of net income and earnings
      per share as if the accounting provision of SFAS No.123 had been adopted.
      The Company generally does not grant stock options to outsiders.

      Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards - SFAS No. 133, Accounting
      for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended by SFAS No.
      137 and 138, establishes standards for measuring, classifying and
      reporting all derivative financial instruments in the financial
      statements. SFAS No. 133 implemented by the Company beginning the first
      quarter of fiscal year 2001 did not have a material impact on the
      Company's financial position or results of operations.

      SFAS No, 141, Business Combinations, requires that all business
      combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 be accounted for using one
      method, the purchase method. Use of the pooling of interests method is now
      prohibited.

      Future Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards - SFAS No. 142,
      Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, addresses financial accounting and
      reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets. Under SFAS
      No. 142, goodwill and some intangible assets will no longer be amortized,
      but rather reviewed for impairment on a periodic basis. Impairment losses
      for goodwill and certain intangible assets that arise due to the initial
      application of this Statement are to be reported as resulting from a
      change in accounting principle. The provisions of this Statement will be
      applied at the beginning of the Company's 2003 fiscal year. The Company is
      in the process of evaluating the financial statement impact from adopting
      this standard.

      SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, requires the
      recording of the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement
      obligation in the period in which it is incurred. The Statement is
      effective for the Company at the beginning of fiscal year 2004. The
      Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material
      impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.

      SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
      Assets, supercedes existing accounting literature dealing with impairment
      and disposal of long-lived assets, including discontinued operations. It
      addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of
      long-lived assets and for long-lived assets to be disposed of and expands
      current reporting for discontinued operations to include disposals of a
      "component" of an entity that has been disposed of or is classified as
      held for sale. The Statement is effective for the Company at the beginning
      of fiscal year 2003. The Company is in the process of evaluating the
      financial statement impact of this standard.

      Reclassifications - Certain reclassifications of prior year balances have
      been made to conform with current year presentation.

2.    EFFECTS OF THE SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 TERRORIST ATTACKS

      One Company restaurant, The Grill Room, suffered some damage. The
      restaurant is located in an office building adjacent to the World Trade
      Center (in 2 World Financial Center) and will likely not reopen until late
      in fiscal 2002 due to the damage sustained by the office building. The
      full extent of the damage is still being evaluated as access to the
      restaurant has been limited. Several other Company


                                      F-8






<PAGE>


      restaurants were also closed from several days to a month due to their
      proximity to the World Trade Center. The Company has extensive property
      and business interruption insurance policies and the Company ultimately
      expects to recover a substantial portion of its physical costs and
      business interruption losses at these restaurants. However, at September
      29, 2001, the Company did not provide any benefit in the consolidated
      financial statements as the extent of the damage was unknown and the
      insurance claims are still being quantified.

      The Company believes that its restaurant and food court operations at the
      Aladdin Casino Resort in Las Vegas, Nevada (the "Aladdin") were
      significantly impaired by the events of September 11th. The restaurant and
      food court operations experienced severe sales declines in the aftermath
      of September 11th and the Aladdin declared bankruptcy on September 28,
      2001. The Company continues to operate the business pending the resolution
      of the Aladdin's bankruptcy, but an impairment charge of $10,045,000 was
      recorded in the fiscal year ended September 29, 2001.

3.    LONG-TERM RECEIVABLES

      Long-term receivables consist of the following:

      (a) In March 2000, the Company withdrew from a partnership that was formed
          to develop and construct four restaurants at a large theatre
          development in Southfield, Michigan. The Company was issued this note
          in consideration of its working capital advances to the project. The
          Company collected $850,000 in March 2001 and recorded a charge of
          $150,000 on the uncollected balance.

      (b) In December 1996, the Company sold a restaurant for $900,000. Cash of
          $50,000 was received on sale and the balance is due in installments
          through December 2006.

      (c) In October 1997, the Company sold a restaurant for $1,750,000, of
          which $200,000 was paid in cash and the balance is due in monthly
          installments under the terms of two notes bearing interest at a rate
          of 7.5%. One note, with an initial principal balance of $400,000, was
          being paid in 24 monthly installments of $19,000 through April 2000.
          The second note, with an initial principal balance of $1,150,000, will
          be paid in 104 monthly installments of $15,000 commencing May 2000 and
          ending December 2008. At December 2008, the then outstanding balance
          of $519,000 matures.

          The Company recognized a gain on sale of approximately $221,000,
          $88,000 and $142,000 in the fiscal years ended September 29, 2001,
          September 30, 2000 and October 2, 1999, respectively. Additional
          deferred gains totaling $585,000 at fiscal year ended September 29,
          2001 could be recognized in future periods as the notes are collected.
          The Company deferred recognizing this additional gain and recorded an
          allowance for possible uncollectible note against the outstanding
          note. This uncertainty is based on the significant length of time of
          this note (over 10 years) and the substantial balance, which matures
          in December 2008 ($519,000).

      (d) In December 1998, the Company sold a restaurant for $500,000, of which
          $250,000 was paid in cash and the balance of $250,000 was financed by
          a note. The note was due in monthly installments of $6,000, inclusive
          of interest at 10%, from May 1999 through April 2004. The buyer
          defaulted on the note during the fiscal year ended September 29, 2001
          and subsequently filed for bankruptcy. The Company recovered $12,000
          and wrote off the remaining balance of $209,000.

      (e) In June 2000, the Company terminated the management of a restaurant in
          New York City. The Company received cash of $164,000 and notes
          totaling $234,000 as consideration for its then outstanding working
          capital loans. The Company recognized a loss of $280,000 on the
          termination.

The carrying value of the Company's long-term receivables approximates its
current aggregate fair value.

          of $22,000,000 are due in full and the balance can be converted into a
          term loan payable over 36 months. The facility also includes a
          $1,000,000 letter of credit facility for use in lieu of lease security
          deposits. The Company generally is required to pay commissions of
          1 1/2% per annum on outstanding letters of credit.

          The Company's subsidiaries each guaranteed the obligations of the
          Company under the foregoing facilities and granted security interests
          in their respective assets as collateral for such guarantees. In
          addition, the Company pledged stock of such subsidiaries as security
          for obligations of the Company under such facilities.

          The agreement includes restrictions relating to, among other things,
          indebtedness for borrowed money, capital expenditures, mergers, sale
          of assets, dividends and liens on the property of the Company. The
          agreement also contains financial covenants such as minimum cash flow
          in relation to the Company's debt service requirements, ratio of debt
          to equity, and the maintenance of minimum shareholders' equity. The
          Company received a waiver from the bank for the covenants it was not
          in compliance with, at September 29, 2001.

      (b) In January 1997, the Company borrowed from its main bank, $2,851,000
          to refinance the purchase of various restaurant equipment at its food
          and beverage facilities in a hotel and casino in Las Vegas, Nevada.
          The notes bear interest at 8.75% per annum and are payable in 60 equal
          monthly installments of $58,833 inclusive of interest, until maturity
          in January 2002. The Company granted the bank a security interest in
          such restaurant equipment. In connection with such financing, the
          Company granted the bank the right to purchase 35,000 shares of the
          Company's common stock at the exercise price of $11.625 per share
          through December 2001. The fair value of the warrants was estimated at
          the date of grant, credited to additional paid-in capital and is being
          amortized over the life of the warrants.

      (c) In April 2000, the Company borrowed from its main bank $1,570,000 to
          refinance the purchase of various restaurant equipment at its food and
          beverage facilities in a hotel and casino in Las Vegas, Nevada. The
          notes bear interest at 8.80% per annum and are payable in 60 equal
          monthly installments of $32,439 inclusive of interest, until maturity
          in May 2005.

      eligible borrowings described in (a) above are as follows:

8.    COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

      Leases - The Company leases its restaurants, bar facilities, and
      administrative headquarters through its subsidiaries under terms expiring
      at various dates through 2029. Most of the leases provide for the payment
      of base rents plus real estate taxes, insurance and other expenses and, in
      certain instances, for the payment of a percentage of the restaurants'
      sales in excess of stipulated amounts at such facility.

      As of September 29, 2001, future minimum lease payments, net of sublease
      rentals, under noncancelable leases are as follows:

</TABLE>

      In connection with the leases included in the table above, the Company
      obtained and delivered irrevocable letters of credit in the aggregate
      amount of $889,000 as security deposits under such leases.

      Rent expense was $12,756,000, $10,783,000 and $9,639,000 during the fiscal
      years ended September 29, 2001, September 30, 2000 and October 2, 1999,
      respectively. Rent expense for the fiscal years ended September 29, 2001,
      September 30, 2000 and October 2, 1999 includes approximately $218,000,
      $109,000 and $149,000, of operating lease deferred credits, representing
      the difference between rent expense recognized on a straight-line basis
      and actual amounts currently payable. Contingent rentals, included in rent
      expense, were $3,236,000, $3,470,000 and $2,799,000 for the fiscal years
      ended September 29, 2001, September 30, 2000 and October 2, 1999,
      respectively.

      Legal Proceedings - In the ordinary course of its business, the Company is
      a party to various lawsuits arising from accidents at its restaurants and
      workmen's compensation claims, which are generally handled by the
      Company's insurance carriers.

      The employment by the Company of management personnel, waiters, waitresses
      and kitchen staff at a number of different restaurants has resulted in the
      institution, from time to time, of litigation alleging violation by the
      Company of employment discrimination laws. The Company does not believe
      that any of such suits will have a materially adverse effect upon the
      Company, its financial condition or operations.

      A lawsuit was commenced against the Company in October 1997 in the
      District Court for the Southern District of New York by 44 present and
      former employees alleging various violations of Federal wage and hour
      laws. The complaint sought an injunction against further violations of the
      labor laws and payment of unpaid minimum wages, overtime and other
      allegedly required amounts, liquidated damages, penalties and attorney's
      fees. The lawsuit was settled for approximately $1,245,000 in May 2001.
      Based upon settlement discussion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000, the
      Company recorded a charge of $1,300,000 at that time.


                                      F-14

      Several unfair labor practice charges were filed against the Company in
      1997 with the National Labor Relations Board ("NLRB") with respect to the
      Company's Las Vegas subsidiary. The charges were heard in October 1997. At
      issue was whether the Company unlawfully terminated nine employees and
      disciplined six other employees allegedly in retaliation for their union
      activities. An Administrative Law Judge ("ALJ") found that six employees
      were terminated unlawfully and three were discharged for valid reasons and
      four employees were disciplined lawfully and two employees unlawfully. On
      appeal, the NLRB found that the Company lawfully disciplined five
      employees and unlawfully disciplined one employee. The Company is
      appealing the adverse rulings of the NLRB to the D.C. Circuit Court of
      Appeals. The Company does not believe that an adverse outcome in this
      proceeding will have a material adverse effect upon the Company's
      financial condition or operations.

9.    COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE PLAN

      In August 1998, the Company authorized the repurchase of up to 500,000
      shares of the Company's outstanding common stock. In April 1999, the
      Company authorized the repurchase of an additional 300,000 shares of the
      Company's outstanding common stock. For the years ended September 29,
      2001, September 30, 2000 and October 2, 1999, the Company repurchased 400,
      141,000 and 423,000 shares at a total cost of $3,000, $1,350,000 and
      $4,228,000, respectively.

10.   STOCK OPTIONS

      On October 15, 1985, the Company adopted a Stock Option Plan (the "Plan")
      pursuant to which the Company reserved for issuance an aggregate of
      175,000 shares of common stock. In May 1991 and March 1994, the Company
      amended such Plan to increase the number of shares issuable under the Plan
      to 350,000 and 448,000, respectively. In March 1996, the Company adopted a
      second plan and reserved for issuance an additional 135,000 shares.
      Subsequent amendments in March 1997, February 1999 and March 2001
      increased the number of shares included under the plan to 270,000, 470,000
      and 650,000, respectively. Options granted under the Plans to key
      employees are exercisable at prices at least equal to the fair market
      value of such stock on the dates the options were granted. The options
      expire five years after the date of grant and are generally exercisable as
      to 25% of the shares commencing on the first anniversary of the date of
      grant and as to an additional 25% commencing on each of the second, third
      and fourth anniversaries of the date of grant.

      SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation ("SFAS No. 123"),
      requires the Company to disclose pro forma net income and pro forma
      earnings per share information for employee stock option grants to
      employees as if the fair-value method defined in SFAS No. 123 had been
      applied. The fair value of each stock option grant is estimated on the
      date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing. The assumptions for
      fiscal 1999 include: risk-free interest rate of 6.25%; no dividend yield;
      expected life of four years; and expected volatility of 38%. The 10,000
      options granted in fiscal 2001 had no pro forma effect. There were no
      options granted during fiscal 2000.

      The pro forma impact was as follows:

      The exercise of nonqualified stock options in the fiscal years ended
      September 30, 2000 and October 2, 1999, resulted in income tax benefits of
      $16,000 and $21,000, respectively, which were credited to additional
      paid-in capital. The income tax benefits result from the difference
      between the market price on the exercise date and the option price.

11.   MANAGEMENT FEE INCOME

      As of September 29, 2001, the Company provides management services to one
      restaurant owned by an outside party. In accordance with the contractual
      arrangements, the Company earns management fees based on operating profits
      as defined by the agreement.

      Restaurants managed had net sales of $4,380,000, $8,867,000 and $9,803,000
      during the management periods within the years ended September 29, 2001,
      September 30, 2000 and October 2, 1999, respectively, which are not
      included in consolidated net sales of the Company.

12.   INCOME TAXES

      The provision for income taxes reflects Federal income taxes calculated on
      a consolidated basis and state and local income taxes calculated by each
      subsidiary on a nonconsolidated basis. For New York State and City income
      tax purposes, the losses incurred by a subsidiary may only be used to

      Deferred tax assets or liabilities are established for: (a) temporary
      differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for
      financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes,
      and (b) operating loss carryforwards. The tax effects of items comprising
      the Company's net deferred tax asset are as follows:

</TABLE>

      A valuation allowance for deferred taxes is required if, based on the
      evidence, it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets
      will not be realized. The Company believes that uncertainty exists with
      respect to future realization of certain operating loss carryforwards and
      operating lease deferred credits. Therefore, the Company provided a
      valuation allowance of $941,000 at September 29, 2001 and $918,000 at
      September 30, 2000. The Company has state operating loss carryforwards of
      $14,196,000 and local operating loss carryforwards of $9,550,000, which
      expire in the years 2002 through 2015.

      During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2000, the Company and the
      Internal Revenue Service finalized the adjustments to the Company's
      Federal income tax returns for the fiscal years ended September 28, 1991
      through October 1, 1994. The final adjustments primarily relate to: (i)
      legal and accounting expenses incurred in connection with new or acquired
      restaurants that the Internal Revenue Service asserts should have been
      capitalized and amortized rather than currently expensed and (ii) travel
      and meal expenses for which the Internal Revenue Service asserts the
      Company did not comply with certain record keeping requirements or the
      Internal Revenue Code. The settlement did not have a material effect on
      the Company's financial condition. The Internal Revenue Service is
      currently examining the Company's returns for the fiscal year ended
      September 30, 1995 through October 3, 1998. The Company does not expect
      the results from such examination to have a material effect on the
      Company's financial condition.

14.   INCOME PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK

      The Company adopted in the first quarter of fiscal 1998, Financial
      Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 128, "Earnings per Share," which
      established new standards for computing and presenting earnings per share.
      The Company now discloses "Basic Earnings per Share," which is based upon
      the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during
      each period and "Diluted Earnings per Share," which requires the Company
      to include common stock equivalents consisting of dilutive stock options
      and warrants. The Company also retroactively applied the new standard to
      all periods presented.

      A reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and
      diluted per share computations for the fiscal year ended October 2, 1999
      follows. For the fiscal years ended September 29, 2001 and September 30,
      2000, there were no dilutive stock options and warrants.
