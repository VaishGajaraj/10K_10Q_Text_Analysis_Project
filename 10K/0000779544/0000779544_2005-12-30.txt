Overview

Ark Restaurants Corp. (the "Registrant" or the "Company") is a New York
corporation formed in 1983. Through its subsidiaries, it owns and operates 23
restaurants and bars, 26 fast food concepts, catering operations, and wholesale
and retail bakeries. Initially its facilities were located only in New York
City. At this time, eight of the restaurants are located in New York City, four
are located in Washington, D.C., nine are located in Las Vegas, Nevada, and two
are located in Atlantic City, New Jersey. The Company's Las Vegas operations
include:

        --      three restaurants within the New York-New York Hotel & Casino
Resort, and operation of the resort's room service, banquet facilities, employee
dining room and nine food court operations;

        --      two restaurants, two bars and four food court facilities at the
Venetian Casino Resort;

        --      one restaurant at the Neonopolis Center at Fremont Street; and

        --      one restaurant within the Forum Shops at Caesar's Shopping
Center.

In 2004, the Company established operations in Florida which include five fast
food facilities in Tampa, Florida and eight fast food facilities in Hollywood,
Florida, each at a Hard Rock Hotel and Casino operated by the Seminole Indian
Tribe at these locations. All pre-opening expenses were borne by outside
investors who invested in a limited liability company established to develop,
construct, operate and manage these facilities. The Company is the managing
member of this limited liability company and, through this limited liability
company, the Company leases and manages the operations of each of these
facilities in exchange for a monthly management fee equal to five-percent of the
gross receipts of these facilities. Neither the Company nor any of its
subsidiaries contributed any capital to this limited liability company. None of
the obligations of this limited liability company are guaranteed by the Company
and investors in this limited liability company have no recourse against the
Company or any of its assets.

In December 2005, the Company established operations in Atlantic City, New
Jersey by opening a bar, Luna Lounge, in the Resorts Atlantic City Hotel and
Casino. The Company anticipates opening a separate restaurant, a Gallagher's
Steakhouse, at the Resorts Atlantic City Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, New
Jersey on New Years Eve 2005.

In addition to the shift from a Manhattan-based operation to a multi-city
operation, the nature of the facilities operated by the Company has shifted from
smaller, neighborhood restaurants to larger, destination restaurants intended to
benefit from high patron traffic attributable to the uniqueness of the
restaurant's location. Most of the Company's restaurants which are in operation
and which have been opened in recent years are of the latter description. These
include the restaurant operations at the New York-New York Hotel & Casino in Las
Vegas, Nevada (1997); the Stage Deli located at the Forum Shops in Las Vegas,
Nevada, Red, located at the South Street Seaport in New York (1998); Thunder
Grill in Union Station, Washington, D.C. (1999); two restaurants and four food
court facilities at the Venetian Casino Resort in Las Vegas, Nevada (2000); The
Saloon, at the Neonopolis Center in downtown Las Vegas, Nevada (2002); the 13
fast food facilities in Tampa, Florida and Hollywood, Florida, respectively
(2004); and the Gallagher's Steakhouse and Luna Lounge in the Resorts Atlantic
City Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey (2005). The Company is not
currently committed to any new projects. The Company has sold a number of its
smaller, neighborhood restaurants.

The names and themes of each of the Company's restaurants are different except
for the Company's two America restaurants, two Sequoia restaurants, two Gonzalez
y Gonzalez restaurants and two Gallagher's Steakhouse restaurants. The menus in
the Company's restaurants are extensive, offering a wide variety of high quality
foods at generally moderate prices. Of the Company's restaurants, the Lutece
restaurant may be classified as expensive. The atmosphere at many of the
restaurants is lively and extremely casual. Most of the restaurants have
separate bar areas. A majority of the net sales of the Company is derived from
dinner as opposed to lunch service. Most of the restaurants are open seven days
a week and most serve lunch as well as dinner.

While decor differs from restaurant to restaurant, interiors are marked by
distinctive architectural and design elements which often incorporate dramatic
interior open spaces and extensive glass exteriors. The wall treatments,
lighting and decorations are typically vivid, unusual and, in some cases, highly
theatrical.

The following table sets forth the facilities the Company currently leases and
operates:

        is $3.0 million. Under the lease for Gonzalez y Gonzalez and the Village
        Eateries, the combined sales goal is $10.0 million. Each of the
        restaurants is currently operating at a level substantially in excess of
        the minimum sales level required to exercise the renewal option for each
        respective restaurant.

(7)     The Company operates eight small food court restaurants in the Villages
        Eateries food court at the New York-New York Hotel & Casino. The Company
        also operates that hotel's room service, banquet facilities and employee
        cafeteria.

(8)     The restaurant experienced damage in the attack on the World Trade
        Center on September 11, 2001. In addition, substantial damage was
        sustained by the World Financial Center in which the restaurant is
        located. The restaurant closed on September 11, 2001 and reopened in
        early December 2002.

Revenues from facilities managed by the Company are not included in the
Company's consolidated sales.

Restaurant Expansion

The Company anticipates opening its Gallagher's Steakhouse restaurant the
Resorts Atlantic City Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey on New Years
Eve 2005. The Company recently opened a separate bar in the Resorts Atlantic
City Hotel and Casino, Luna Lounge.

The opening of a new restaurant is invariably accompanied by substantial
pre-opening expenses and early operating losses associated with the training of
personnel, excess kitchen costs, costs of supervision and other expenses during
the pre-opening period and during a post-opening "shake out" period until
operations can be considered to be functioning normally. The amount of such
pre-opening expenses and early operating losses can generally be expected to
depend upon the size and complexity of the facility being opened. The Company
incurred no pre-opening expenses or early operating losses in fiscal 2005.

The Company's restaurants generally do not achieve substantial increases from
year to year in revenue, which the Company considers to be typical of the
restaurant industry. To achieve significant increases in revenue or to replace
revenue of restaurants that lose customer favor or which close because of lease
expirations or other reasons, the Company would have to open additional
restaurant facilities or expand existing restaurants. There can be no assurance
that a restaurant will be successful after it is opened, particularly since in
many instances the Company does not operate its new restaurants under a trade
name currently used by the Company, thereby requiring new restaurants to
establish their own identity.

Apart from these agreements, the Company is not currently committed to any
projects. The Company may take advantage of opportunities it considers to be
favorable, when they occur, depending upon the availability of financing and
other factors.

Recent Restaurant Dispositions and Charges

In fiscal 2003, the Company determined that its restaurant, Lutece, located in
New York City, had been impaired by the events of September 11th and the
continued weakness in the economy. Based upon the sum of the future undiscounted
cash flows related to the Company's long-lived fixed assets at Lutece, the
Company determined that impairment had occurred. To estimate the fair value of
such long-lived fixed assets, for determining the impairment amount, the Company
used the expected present value of the future cash flows. The Company projected
continuing negative operating cash flow for the foreseeable future with no value
for subletting or assigning the lease for the premises. As a result, the Company
determined that there was no value to the long-lived fixed assets. The Company
had an investment of $667,000 in leasehold improvements, furniture fixtures and
equipment. The Company believed that these assets would have nominal value upon
disposal and recorded an impairment charge of $667,000 during fiscal 2003. Due
to continued weak sales, the Company closed Lutece during the second quarter of
2004. The Company recorded a net operating loss of $60,000 during the fiscal
year ended October 1, 2005 which is included in losses from discontinued
operations. In fiscal 2004, the Company also incurred a one-time charge of
$470,000 related to pension plan contributions required in connection with the
closing of Lutece which is payable monthly over a nine year period beginning May
17, 2004 and bears interest at a rate of 8% per annum.

On December 1, 2003, the Company sold a restaurant, Lorelei, for approximately
$850,000. The book value of inventory, fixed assets, intangible assets and
goodwill related to this entity was approximately $625,000. The Company recorded
a gain on the sale of approximately $225,000 during the first quarter of fiscal
2004.

The Company's restaurant Ernie's, located on the upper west side of Manhattan
opened in 1982. As a result of a steady decline in sales, the Company felt that
a new concept was needed at this location. The restaurant was closed June 16,
2003 and reopened in August 2003. Total conversion costs were approximately
$350,000. Sales at the new restaurant, La Rambla, failed to reach the level
sufficient to achieve the results the Company required. As a result, the Company
sold this restaurant on January 1, 2004 and realized a gain on the sale of this
restaurant of approximately $214,000. Net operating losses of $12,000 were
included in losses from discontinued operations for the fiscal year ended
October 1, 2005.

The Company's restaurant Jack Rose located on the west side of Manhattan has
experienced weak sales for several years. In addition, this restaurant did not
fit the Company's desired profile of being in a landmark destination location.
As a result, the Company sold this restaurant on February 23, 2004. The Company
realized a loss on the sale of this restaurant of $137,000 which was recorded
during the second quarter of fiscal 2004. Net operating losses of $19,000 were
included in losses from discontinued operations for the fiscal year ended
October 1, 2005.

The Company's restaurant, America, located in New York City has experienced
declining sales for several years. In March 2004, the Company entered into a new
lease for this restaurant at a significantly increased rent. The Company entered
into this lease with the belief that due to the location and the uniqueness of
the space the lease had value. On January 19, 2005, the Company signed a
definitive agreement for the sale of this restaurant which closed on March 15,
2005. The Company realized a pre-tax gain of $644,000 on the sale of this
restaurant. Net operating income of $47,000 was included in losses from
discontinued operations for the fiscal year ended October 1, 2005.

As a result of the above mentioned sales, the Company allocated $75,000 of
goodwill to these restaurants and reduced goodwill by this amount in fiscal
2005.

Restaurant Management

Each restaurant is managed by its own manager and has its own chef. Food
products and other supplies are purchased primarily from various unaffiliated
suppliers, in most cases by Company headquarters' personnel. The Company's
Columbus Bakery supplies bakery products to most of the Company's New York City
restaurants in addition to operating a retail bakery. The Company's Columbus
Bakery in Las Vegas supplies bakery products to most of the Company's Las Vegas
restaurants in addition to operating a wholesale bakery. Each of the Company's
restaurants has two or more assistant managers and sous chefs (assistant chefs).
Financial and management control is maintained at the corporate level through
the use of an automated data processing system that includes centralized
accounting and reporting.

Purchasing and Distribution

The Company strives to obtain quality menu ingredients, raw materials and other
supplies and services for its operations from reliable sources at competitive
prices. Substantially all menu items are prepared on each restaurant's premises
daily from scratch, using fresh ingredients. Each restaurant's management
determines the quantities of food and supplies required and orders the items
from local, regional and national suppliers on terms negotiated by the Company's
centralized purchasing staff. Restaurant-level inventories are maintained at a
minimum dollar-value level in relation to sales due to the relatively rapid
turnover of the perishable produce, poultry, meat, fish and dairy commodities
that are used in operations.

The Company attempts to negotiate short-term and long-term supply agreements
depending on market conditions and expected demand. However, the Company does
not contract for long periods of time for its


                                       8
<PAGE>

fresh commodities such as produce, poultry, meat, fish and dairy items and,
consequently, such commodities can be subject to unforeseen supply and cost
fluctuations. Independent foodservice distributors deliver most food and supply
items daily to restaurants. The financial impact of such supply agreements would
not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position.

Employees

At December 10, 2005, the Company employed 1,990 persons (including employees at
managed facilities), 1,448 of whom were full-time employees, 542 of whom were
part-time employees, 30 of whom were headquarters personnel, 202 of whom were
restaurant management personnel, 557 of whom were kitchen personnel and 1,201 of
whom were restaurant service personnel. A number of the Company's restaurant
service personnel are employed on a part-time basis. Changes in minimum wage
levels may affect the labor costs of the Company and the restaurant industry
generally because a large percentage of restaurant personnel are paid at or
slightly above the minimum wage. The Company's employees are not covered by a
collective bargaining agreement.

Government Regulation

The Company is subject to various federal, state and local laws affecting its
business. Each restaurant is subject to licensing and regulation by a number of
governmental authorities that may include alcoholic beverage control, health,
sanitation, environmental, zoning and public safety agencies in the state or
municipality in which the restaurant is located. Difficulties in obtaining or
failures to obtain the required licenses or approvals could delay or prevent the
development and openings of new restaurants, or could disrupt the operations of
existing restaurants.

Alcoholic beverage control regulations require each of our restaurants to apply
to a state authority and, in certain locations, county and municipal authorities
for licenses and permits to sell alcoholic beverages on the premises. Typically,
licenses must be renewed annually and may be subject to penalties, temporary
suspension or revocation for cause at any time. Alcoholic beverage control
regulations impact many aspects of the daily operations of our restaurants,
including the minimum ages of patrons and employees consuming or serving such
beverages; employee alcoholic beverages training and certification requirements;
hours of operation; advertising; wholesale purchasing and inventory control of
such beverages; seating of minors and the service of food within our bar areas;
and the storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages. State and local
authorities in many jurisdictions routinely monitor compliance with alcoholic
beverage laws. The failure to receive or retain, or a delay in obtaining, a
liquor license for a particular restaurant could adversely affect the Company's
ability to obtain such licenses elsewhere.

The Company is subject to "dram-shop" statutes in most of the states in which it
has operations, which generally provide a person injured by an intoxicated
person the right to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served
alcoholic beverages to such person. The Company carries liquor liability
coverage as part of its existing comprehensive general liability insurance. A
settlement or judgment against the Company under a "dram-shop" statute in excess
of liability coverage could have a material adverse effect on operations.

Various federal and state labor laws govern the Company's operations and its
relationship with employees, including such matters as minimum wages, breaks,
overtime, fringe benefits, safety, working conditions and citizenship
requirements. The Company is also subject to the regulations of the Immigration
and Naturalization Service (INS). If employees of the Company do not meet
federal citizenship or residency requirements, this could lead to a disruption
in the Company's work force. Significant government-imposed increases in minimum
wages, paid leaves of absence and mandated


                                       9
<PAGE>

health benefits, or increased tax reporting, assessment or payment requirements
related to employees who receive gratuities could be detrimental to the
profitability of the Company.

The Company's facilities must comply with the applicable requirements of the
Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 ("ADA") and related state statutes. The
ADA prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability with respect to public
accommodations and employment. Under the ADA and related state laws, when
constructing new restaurants or undertaking significant remodeling of existing
restaurants, the Company must make them more readily accessible to disabled
persons.

The New York State Liquor Authority must approve any transaction in which a
shareholder of the licensee increases his holdings to 10% or more of the
outstanding capital stock of the licensee and any transaction involving 10% or
more of the outstanding capital stock of the licensee.

Seasonal Nature Of Business

The Company's business is highly seasonal. The second quarter of the Company's
fiscal year, consisting of the non-holiday portion of the cold weather season in
New York and Washington (January, February and March), is the poorest performing
quarter. The Company achieves its best results during the warm weather,
attributable to the Company's extensive outdoor dining availability,
particularly at Bryant Park in New York and Sequoia in Washington, D.C. (the
Company's largest restaurants) and the Company's outdoor cafes. However, even
during summer months these facilities can be adversely affected by unusually
cool or rainy weather conditions. The Company's facilities in Las Vegas
generally operate on a more consistent basis through the year.

Terrorism and International Unrest

The terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon in
Washington, D.C. on September 11, 2001 had a material adverse effect on the
Company's revenues. As a result of the attacks, one Company restaurant, The
Grill Room, located at 2 World Financial Center, which is adjacent to the World
Trade Center, experienced some damage. The Grill Room was closed from September
11, 2001 and reopened in early December 2002.

The Company's restaurants in New York, Las Vegas, Washington D.C. and Florida
benefit from tourist traffic. Though the Las Vegas market has shown resiliency,
the sluggish economy and the lingering effects of September 11, 2001 have had an
adverse effect on the Company's restaurants. Recovery depends upon a general
improvement in economic conditions and the public's willingness and inclination
to resume vacation and convention travel. Additional acts of terrorism in the
United States or substantial international unrest may have a material adverse
effect on the Company's business and revenues.

Forward Looking Statements and Risk Factors

This report contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and
uncertainties. Discussions containing such forward-looking statements may be
found in the material set forth under "Item 1. Business" and "Item 7.
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations" as well as throughout this report generally. The Company's actual
results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking
statements as a result of certain factors, including those discussed below.

The restaurant business is intensely competitive and involves an extremely high
degree of risk. The Company believes that a large number of new restaurants open
each year and that a significant number of


                                       10
<PAGE>

them do not succeed. Even successful restaurants can rapidly lose popularity due
to changes in consumer tastes, turnover in personnel, the opening of competitive
restaurants, unfavorable reviews and other factors. There can be no assurance
that the Company's existing restaurants will retain such patronage as they
currently enjoy or that new restaurants opened by the Company will be
successful. There is active competition for competent chefs and management
personnel and intense competition among major restaurateurs and food service
companies for the larger, unique sites suitable for restaurants.

To achieve significant increases in revenue or to replace revenue of restaurants
which experience declining popularity or which close because of lease
expirations or other reasons, the Company would have to open additional
restaurant facilities. The opening of new restaurants is subject to a wide
variety of uncertainties, including the ability to negotiate favorable lease
provisions, the location of the restaurant, the development of a menu and
concept that appeals to consumers and the availability of skilled restaurant
managers. The acquisition or construction of new restaurants also requires
significant capital resources. New large-scale projects that have been the focus
of the Company's efforts in recent years would likely require additional
financing. If the Company were to identify a favorable restaurant opportunity,
there is no assurance that the required financing would be available.

Item 2.        Properties
-------        ----------

The Company's restaurant facilities and the Company's executive offices are
occupied under leases. Most of the Company's restaurant leases provide for the
payment of base rents plus real estate taxes, insurance and other expenses and,
in certain instances, for the payment of a percentage of the Company's sales at
such facility. These leases (including leases for managed restaurants) have
terms (including any available renewal options) expiring as follows:

</TABLE>

The Company's executive, administrative and clerical offices are located in
approximately 8,500 square feet of office space at 85 Fifth Avenue, New York,
New York. In October 2003 the Company's landlord for this property commenced an
action against the Company stating that the Company failed to validly exercise
its five-year renewal option to extend the lease through October 2008. The
Company currently occupies this property pending the result of litigation with
its landlord. See "Item 3. Legal Proceedings" for a discussion regarding this
litigation.

The Company's lease for office space related to its Washington, D.C. catering
operations expires in 2012.

For information concerning the Company's future minimum rental commitments under
non-cancelable operating leases, see Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Item 3.        Legal Proceedings
-------        -----------------

In the ordinary course of its business, the Company is a party to various
lawsuits arising from accidents at its restaurants and workers' compensation
claims, which are generally handled by the Company's insurance carriers.

The employment by the Company of management personnel, waiters, waitresses and
kitchen staff at a number of different restaurants has resulted in the
institution, from time to time, of litigation alleging violation by the Company
of employment discrimination laws. The Company does not believe that any of such
suits will have a materially adverse effect upon the Company, its financial
condition or operations.

In October 2003, the Company's landlord for its executive, administrative and
clerical offices located in New York, New York commenced an action against the
Company in the Supreme Court, New York County asserting the Company had failed
to validly exercise its option with respect to the premises at issue and that
the Landlord was entitled to immediate and exclusive possession of the premises.
The Company answered and asserted affirmative defenses and counterclaims. By an
order dated May 25, 2004, the court denied the landlord's motion for summary
judgment on its complaint while granting, in part, the landlord's motion to
dismiss the Company's affirmative defenses and counterclaims. Both the landlord
and the Company appealed from the May 25, 2004 order, but no decision on the
appeals has been issued. Pending the outcome of this litigation, the Company
remains in possession of the premises.

Item 7.        Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
-------        Results of Operations
               ---------------------

Accounting period

The Company's fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest September 30. The Company
reports fiscal years under a 52/53-week format. This reporting method is used by
many companies in the hospitality industry and is meant to improve year-to-year
comparisons of operating results. Under this method, certain years will contain
53 weeks. The fiscal years ended September 27, 2003 and October 1, 2005 each
included 52 weeks. The fiscal year ended October 2, 2004 included 53 weeks.

Overview

The Company has reclassified its statements of operations data for the prior
periods presented below, in accordance with FAS 144, as a result of the sale of
three of the Company's restaurants and the closure of one restaurant during the
fiscal year ended October 2, 2004 and the sale of another restaurant during the
fiscal year ended October 1, 2005. The operations of these restaurants have been
presented as discontinued operations for the fiscal years ended October 2, 2004
and October 1, 2005. See "Item 1 -Recent Restaurant Dispositions and Charges",
"Item 7 - Recent Restaurant Dispositions" and Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Revenues

Total revenues at restaurants owned by the Company decreased by 1.1% from fiscal
2004 to fiscal 2005 and increased by 12.4% from fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2004.

Same store sales decreased 0.9%, or $989,000, on a Company-wide basis from
fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005. This decrease was primarily due to the fact that
fiscal 2004 contained an extra week of sales as opposed to fiscal 2005,
resulting in a 4.0%, or $2,678,000, decrease in same store sales at the
Company's Las Vegas restaurants, a 3.6%, or $1,122,000, increase in same store
sales at the Company's New York restaurants and a 3.2%, or $567,000, increase in
same store sales at the Company's Washington D.C. restaurants. If the
fifty-third week of fiscal 2004 were excluded from same store sales, the result
would be a 1.2%, or $1,381,000, increase in same store sales on a Company-wide
basis, a 2.0%, or $1,312,000, decrease in same store sales at the Company's Las
Vegas restaurants, a 5.7%, or $1,791,000, increase in same store sales at the
Company's New York restaurants and a 5.3%, or $902,000, increase in same store
sales at the Company's Washington D.C. restaurants. The increases in New York
and Washington D.C. were principally due to a general improvement in economic
conditions and the public's willingness and inclination to resume vacation and
convention travel.

During the fourth quarter of 2002 the Company abandoned its restaurant and food
court operations at the Desert Passage, the retail complex at the Aladdin Resort
& Casino in Las Vegas. From fiscal 2002 to


                                       17
<PAGE>

fiscal 2001 sales decreased at this location from $4,999,000 to $2,853,000, or
42.9%, resulting in the Company's decision to abandon these operations.

Of the $5,219,000 decrease in revenues from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002,
$3,282,000 is attributable to the year long closure of the Grill Room restaurant
located in 2 World Financial Center, an office building adjacent to the World
Trade Center site. This restaurant was damaged in the September 11, 2001 attack
and reopened in early fiscal 2003. A $256,000 increase in sales is attributable
to the opening of the Saloon at the Neonopolis Center in downtown Las Vegas.

Other operating income, which consists of the sale of merchandise at various
restaurants, management fee income and door sales were $1,826,000 in fiscal
2005, $850,000 in fiscal 2004 and $679,000 in fiscal 2003.

Costs and Expenses

Food and beverage cost of sales as a percentage of total revenue was 25.1% in
fiscal 2005, 25.5% in fiscal 2004 and 24.7% in fiscal 2003.

Total costs and expenses increased by $1,244,000, or 1.2%, from fiscal 2004 to
fiscal 2005. The increase in the minimum wage in New York and Washington, D.C.,
the cost of compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and increased energy costs
contributed to this increase.

Total costs and expenses increased by $9,101,000, or 9.4%, from fiscal 2003 to
fiscal 2004. Increases in food costs, rent and payroll, as a result of the
increase in total revenues, contributed to this increase. Sales increases in
restaurants where the Company pays a percentage rent resulted in an increase in
percentage rent of $374,000 during fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003. Other
operating costs and expenses also increased in fiscal 2004 due to the increase
in total revenue and a one time charge of $270,000 used to pay for casino
entertainment tax liability. The Company had previously thought that certain of
its operations at the Venetian Hotel Resort Casino were exempt from casino
entertainment tax due to the fact that such operations were not on the casino
floor. As subsequent tax ruling by tax authorities determined that such
operations were subject to casino entertainment tax and the Company determined
to include such charge in other operating costs and expenses.

Payroll expenses as a percentage of total revenues was 31.3% in fiscal 2005
compared to 31.2% in fiscal 2004 and 32.3% in fiscal 2003. Payroll expense was
$36,212,000, $36,045,000 and $33,176,000 in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. In fiscal 2003, the Company had aggressively adapted its cost
structure in response to lower sales expectations following September 11th. Due
to the increase in sales during fiscal 2004, the Company had increased its
payroll expenses incrementally. In fiscal 2005, the increase of the minimum wage
in New York and Washington, D.C. resulted in an increase in payroll expenses.
The Company continually evaluates its payroll expenses as they relate to sales.

No pre-opening expenses and early operating losses were incurred during fiscal
2005, 2004 or 2003. The Company did not open any new restaurants during fiscal
2005, 2004 and 2003. The Company typically incurs significant pre-opening
expenses in connection with its new restaurants that are expensed as incurred.
Furthermore, it is not uncommon that such restaurants experience operating
losses during the early months of operation.

General and administrative expenses, as a percentage of total revenue, were 6.3%
in fiscal 2005, 5.6% in fiscal 2004 and 6.5% in fiscal 2003. The decrease in
these expenses as a percentage of total revenue during fiscal 2004 is primarily
due to increased total revenue during this period.

The Company managed two restaurants it did not own (The Saloon and El Rio
Grande) and also managed the Tampa and Hollywood Florida food court operations
at October 1, 2005. The Company managed two restaurants it did not own (The
Saloon and El Rio Grande) at October 2, 2004. The Company managed one restaurant
it did not own (El Rio Grande) at September 27, 2003. Sales of El Rio Grande,
which are not included in consolidated sales, were $3,262,000 in fiscal 2005,
$2,786,000 in fiscal 2004 and $2,765,000 in fiscal 2003. The Company's lease of
The Saloon was converted into a management agreement effective as of August 22,
2004, whereby the Company receives a management fee of $7,000 per month
regardless of the results of operations of this restaurant. During fiscal 2004,
the Company entered into agreements to manage 11 fast food restaurants located
in the Hard Rock Casinos in Hollywood and Tampa, Florida. Sales from these
operations totaled $8,843,000 during the 2005 fiscal year.

Interest expense was $25,000 in fiscal 2005, $190,000 in fiscal 2004 and
$732,000 in fiscal 2003. The significant decreases during these periods was due
to lower outstanding borrowings on the Company's credit facility and the benefit
from rate decreases in the prime-borrowing rate. As of October 1, 2005, the
Company had no borrowings on its credit facility. Interest income was $101,000
in fiscal 2005, $138,000 in fiscal 2004 and $162,000 in fiscal 2003.

Other income, which generally consists of purchasing service fees and other
income at various restaurants, was $671,000, $595,000 and $973,000 for fiscal
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Other income was impacted during fiscal 2003
by the Company's receipt of $508,000 in World Trade Center Grants for four
restaurants located in downtown New York that were adversely impacted by the
September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.

Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes reflects Federal income taxes calculated on a
consolidated basis and state and local income taxes calculated by each New York
subsidiary on a non-consolidated basis. Most of the restaurants owned or managed
by the Company are owned or managed by a separate subsidiary.

For state and local income tax purposes, the losses incurred by a subsidiary may
only be used to offset that subsidiary's income, with the exception of the
restaurants operating in the District of Columbia. Accordingly, the Company's
overall effective tax rate has varied depending on the level of losses incurred
at individual subsidiaries. During fiscal 2002 the Company abandoned its
restaurant and food court operations at the Desert Passage, the retail complex
at the Aladdin Resort & Casino in Las Vegas. In fiscal 2002, the Company was
able to utilize the deferred tax asset created in fiscal 2001, by the impairment
of these operations. During the years ended October 2, 2004 and October 1, 2005,
the Company decreased its allowance for the utilization of the deferred tax
asset arising from state and local operating loss carryforwards by $395,000 and
$125,000 in such years based on the merger of certain unprofitable subsidiaries
into profitable ones.

The Company's overall effective tax rate in the future will be affected by
factors such as the level of losses incurred at the Company's New York
facilities, which cannot be consolidated for state and local tax purposes,
pre-tax income earned outside of New York City and the utilization of state and
local net operating loss carry forwards. Nevada has no state income tax and
other states in which the Company operates have income tax rates substantially
lower in comparison to New York. In order to utilize more effectively tax loss
carry forwards at restaurants that were unprofitable, the Company has merged
certain profitable subsidiaries with certain loss subsidiaries.

The Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1993 provides tax credits to the Company for
FICA taxes paid by the Company on tip income of restaurant service personnel.
The net benefit to the Company was $779,000 in fiscal 2005, $591,000 in fiscal
2004 and $132,000 in fiscal 2003.

During fiscal 2002, the Company and the Internal Revenue Service finalized the
adjustments to the Company's Federal income tax returns for fiscal years 1995
through 1998. The settlement did not have a material effect on the Company's
consolidated financial statements. During fiscal 2006, the Company and the
Internal Revenue Service finalized the adjustments to the Company's Federal
income tax returns for fiscal years 1999 through 2004. This settlement did not
have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

Liquidity and Sources of Capital

The Company's primary source of capital has been cash provided by operations and
funds available from its main bank, Bank Leumi USA. The Company from time to
time also utilizes equipment financing in connection with the construction of a
restaurant and seller financing in connection with the acquisition of a
restaurant. The Company utilizes capital primarily to fund the cost of
developing and opening new restaurants, acquiring existing restaurants owned by
others and remodeling existing restaurants owned by the Company.

The net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2005 of ($3,836,000) was
primarily used for the replacement of fixed assets at existing restaurants and
the construction of a restaurant and bar in Atlantic City, New Jersey. The net
cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2004 of ($1,336,000) was primarily
used for the replacement of fixed assets at existing restaurants. The net cash
used in investing activities in fiscal 2003 of ($1,434,000) was used for the
expansion of an existing restaurant in Las Vegas and for the replacement of
fixed assets at existing restaurants.

The net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2005 ($4,397,000), was
principally used for the payment of dividends. The net cash used in financing
activities in fiscal 2004 ($5,106,000) and fiscal 2003 ($8,356,000) was
principally due to repayments of long-term debt on the Company's main credit
facility in excess of borrowings on such facility.

The Company had a working capital surplus of $4,299,000 at October 1, 2005 as
compared to a working capital surplus of $1,893,000 at October 2, 2004.

The Company's Revolving Credit and Term Loan Facility (the "Facility") with its
main bank (Bank Leumi USA), which included a $8,500,000 credit line to finance
the development and construction of new restaurants and for working capital
purposes at the Company's existing restaurants, matured on March 12, 2005. The
Company does not currently plan to enter into another credit facility and
expects required cash to be provided by operations. As of October 1, 2005, the
Company had no borrowings on its credit facility. The Facility also includes a
$500,000 Letter of Credit Facility for use in lieu of lease security deposits.
The Company has delivered $253,000 in irrevocable letters of credit on this
Facility at October 1, 2005. The Company generally is required to pay
commissions of 1 1/2% per annum on outstanding letters of credit.

The Company's subsidiaries each guaranteed the obligations of the Company under
the Facility and granted security interests in their respective assets as
collateral for such guarantees. In addition, the Company pledged stock of such
subsidiaries as security for obligations of the Company under such Facility.

In April 2000, the Company borrowed $1,570,000 from its main bank at an interest
rate of 8.8% to refinance the purchase of various restaurant equipment at the
Venetian. The note which was payable in 60 equal monthly installments through
May 2005, was secured by such restaurant equipment. At October 1, 2005 the
Company had nothing outstanding on this facility.

The Company entered into a sale and leaseback agreement with GE Capital for
$1,652,000 in November 2000 to refinance the purchase of various restaurant
equipment at its food and beverage facilities in a hotel and casino in Las
Vegas, Nevada. The lease bears interest at 8.65% per annum and is payable in 48
equal monthly installments of $32,000 until maturity in November 2004 at which
time the Company had an option to purchase the equipment for $519,000 or extend
the lease for an additional 12 months at the same monthly payment until maturity
in November 2005 and repurchase the equipment at such time for $165,000. In
November 2004, the Company chose to extend the lease for an additional 12
months.

The Company originally accounted for this agreement as an operating lease and
did not record the assets or the lease liability in the financial statements.
During the year ended September 29, 2001, the Company recorded the entire amount
payable under the lease as a liability of $1,600,000 based on the anticipated
abandonment of the Aladdin operations. In 2002, the operations at the Aladdin
were abandoned and at October 1, 2005 $117,000 remained accrued in other current
liabilities representing future operating lease payments.

A quarterly cash dividend in the amount of $0.35 per share was declared on
October 12, 2004. Subsequent to October 12, 2004, quarterly cash dividends in
the amount of $0.35 per share were declared on January 12, April 12, July 12 and
October 11, 2005. Prior to this, the Company had not paid any cash dividends
since its inception. The Company intends to continue to pay such quarterly cash
dividend for the foreseeable future, however, the payment of future dividends is
at the discretion of the Company's Board of Directors and is based on future
earnings, cash flow, financial condition, capital requirements, changes in U.S.
taxation and other relevant factors.

Restaurant Expansion

In December 2005, the Company opened a restaurant, Gallagher's Steakhouse, and a
bar, Luna Lounge, at the Resorts Atlantic City Hotel and Casino in Atlantic
City, New Jersey.

Recent Restaurant Dispositions and Charges

In fiscal 2003, the Company determined that its restaurant, Lutece, located in
New York City, had been impaired by the events of September 11th and the
continued weakness in the economy. Based upon the sum of the future undiscounted
cash flows related to the Company's long-lived fixed assets at Lutece, the
Company determined that impairment had occurred. To estimate the fair value of
such long-lived fixed assets, for determining the impairment amount, the Company
used the expected present value of the future cash flows. The Company projected
continuing negative operating cash flow for the foreseeable future with no value
for subletting or assigning the lease for the premises. As a result, the Company
determined that there was no value to the long-lived fixed assets. The Company
had an investment of $667,000 in leasehold improvements, furniture fixtures and
equipment. The Company believed that these assets would have nominal value upon
disposal and recorded an impairment charge of $667,000 during fiscal 2003. Due
to continued weak sales, the Company closed Lutece during the second quarter of
2004. The Company recorded a net operating loss of $60,000 during the fiscal
year ended October 1, 2005 which is included in losses from discontinued
operations. In fiscal 2004, the Company also incurred a one-time charge of
$470,000 related to pension plan contributions required in connection with the
closing of Lutece which is payable monthly over a nine year period beginning May
17, 2004 and bears interest at a rate of 8% per annum.

On December 1, 2003, the Company sold a restaurant, Lorelei, for approximately
$850,000. The book value of inventory, fixed assets, intangible assets and
goodwill related to this entity was approximately


                                       22
<PAGE>

$625,000. The Company recorded a gain on the sale of approximately $225,000
during the first quarter of fiscal 2004.

The Company's restaurant Ernie's, located on the upper west side of Manhattan
opened in 1982. As a result of a steady decline in sales, the Company felt that
a new concept was needed at this location. The restaurant was closed June 16,
2003 and reopened in August 2003. Total conversion costs were approximately
$350,000. Sales at the new restaurant, La Rambla, failed to reach the level
sufficient to achieve the results the Company required. As a result, the Company
sold this restaurant on January 1, 2004 and realized a gain on the sale of this
restaurant of approximately $214,000. Net operating losses of $12,000 were
included in losses from discontinued operations for the fiscal year ended
October 1, 2005.

The Company's restaurant Jack Rose located on the west side of Manhattan has
experienced weak sales for several years. In addition, this restaurant did not
fit the Company's desired profile of being in a landmark destination location.
As a result, the Company sold this restaurant on February 23, 2004. The Company
realized a loss on the sale of this restaurant of $137,000 which was recorded
during the second quarter of fiscal 2004. Net operating losses of $19,000 were
included in losses from discontinued operations for the fiscal year ended
October 1, 2005.

The Company's restaurant, America, located in New York City has experienced
declining sales for several years. In March 2004, the Company entered into a new
lease for this restaurant at a significantly increased rent. The Company entered
into this lease with the belief that due to the location and the uniqueness of
the space the lease had value. On January 19, 2005, the Company signed a
definitive agreement for the sale of this restaurant which closed on March 15,
2005. The Company realized a pre-tax gain of $644,000 on the sale of this
restaurant. Net operating income of $47,000 was included in losses from
discontinued operations for the fiscal year ended October 1, 2005.

Critical Accounting Policies

Financial Reporting Release No. 60, published by the SEC, recommends that all
companies include a discussion of critical accounting policies used in the
preparation of their financial statements. The Company's significant accounting
policies are more fully described in Note 1 to the Company's consolidated
financial statements. While all these significant accounting policies impact its
financial condition and results of operations, the Company views certain of
these policies as critical. Policies determined to be critical are those
policies that have the most significant impact on the Company's consolidated
financial statements and require management to use a greater degree of judgment
and estimates. Actual results may differ from those estimates.

The Company believes that given current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely
that applying any other reasonable judgments or estimate methodologies would
cause a material effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations,
financial position or cash flows for the periods presented in this report.

Below are listed certain policies that management believes are critical:

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements requires the application of certain
accounting policies, which may require the Company to make estimates and
assumptions of future events. In the process of preparing its consolidated
financial statements, the Company estimates the appropriate carrying value of
certain assets and liabilities, which are not readily apparent from other
sources. The primary estimates underlying the


                                       23
<PAGE>

Company's financial statements include allowances for potential bad debts on
accounts and notes receivable, the useful lives and recoverability of its
assets, such as property and intangibles, fair values of financial instruments,
the realizable value of its tax assets and other matters. Management bases its
estimates on certain assumptions, which they believe are reasonable in the
circumstances and actual results could differ from those estimates. Although
management does not believe that any change in those assumptions in the near
term would have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial
position or the results of operation, differences in actual results could be
material to the financial statements.

Long-Lived Assets

The Company annually assesses any impairment in value of long-lived assets to be
held and used. The Company evaluates the possibility of impairment by comparing
anticipated undiscounted cash flows to the carrying amount of the related
long-lived assets. If such cash flows are less than carrying value the Company
then reduces the asset to its fair value. Fair value is generally calculated
using discounted cash flows. Various factors such as sales growth and operating
margins and proceeds from a sale are part of this analysis. Future results could
differ from the Company's projections with a resulting adjustment to income in
such period.

Leases

The Company is obligated under various lease agreements for certain restaurants.
The Company recognizes rent expense on a straight-line basis over the expected
lease term, including option periods as described below. Within the provisions
of certain leases there are escalations in payments over the base lease term, as
well as renewal periods. The effects of the escalations have been reflected in
rent expense on a straight-line basis over the expected lease term, which
includes option periods when it is deemed to be reasonably assured that the
Company would incur an economic penalty for not exercising the option.
Percentage rent expense is generally based upon sales levels and is expensed as
incurred. Certain leases include both base rent and percentage rent. The Company
records rent expense on these leases based upon reasonably assured sales levels.
The consolidated financial statements reflect the same lease terms for
amortizing leasehold improvements as were used in calculating straight-line rent
expense for each restaurant. The judgments of the Company may produce materially
different amounts of amortization and rent expense than would be reported if
different lease terms were used.

Deferred Income Tax Valuation Allowance

The Company provides such allowance due to uncertainty that some of the deferred
tax amounts may not be realized. Certain items, such as state and local tax loss
carry forwards, are dependent on future earnings or the availability of tax
strategies. Future results could require an increase or decrease in the
valuation allowance and a resulting adjustment to income in such period.

Accounting for Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

During 2001, the FASB issued FAS 142, which requires that for the Company,
effective September 28, 2002, goodwill, including the goodwill included in the
carrying value of investments accounted for using the equity method of
accounting, and certain other intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite
useful life, cease amortizing. FAS 142 requires that goodwill and certain
intangible assets be assessed for impairment using fair value measurement
techniques. Specifically, goodwill impairment is determined using a two-step
process. The first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify
potential impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit (the
Company is being treated as one


                                       24
<PAGE>

reporting unit) with its net book value (or carrying amount), including
goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount,
goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of
the impairment test is unnecessary. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit
exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is
performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of
the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting
unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying
amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that
goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the
amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. That is, the fair value
of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that
unit (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had
been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit
was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit. The impairment test
for other intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the
intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the
intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an
amount equal to that excess.

Determining the fair value of the reporting unit under the first step of the
goodwill impairment test and determining the fair value of individual assets and
liabilities of the reporting unit (including unrecognized intangible assets)
under the second step of the goodwill impairment test is judgmental in nature
and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Similarly,
estimates and assumptions are used in determining the fair value of other
intangible assets. These estimates and assumptions could have a significant
impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the
magnitude of any such charge. To assist in the process of determining goodwill
impairment, the Company obtains appraisals from independent valuation firms. In
addition to the use of independent valuation firms, the Company performs
internal valuation analyses and considers other market information that is
publicly available. Estimates of fair value are primarily determined using
discounted cash flows and market comparisons and recent transactions. These
approaches use significant estimates and assumptions including projected future
cash flows (including timing), discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in
future cash flows, perpetual growth rate, determination of appropriate market
comparables and the determination of whether a premium or discount should be
applied to comparables. Based on the above policy no impairment charges were
recorded during the fiscal years ended 2005, 2004 and 2003.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 123
(R), "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation." SFAS No. 123 (R) establishes
standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its
equity instruments for goods or services. SFAS No. 123 (R) focuses primarily on
accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services through
the issuance of stock options and other share-based payment transactions. SFAS
No. 123 (R) requires that the fair value of such equity instruments be
recognized as expense in the historical financial statements as services are
performed. Prior to SFAS No. 123 (R), only certain pro forma disclosures of fair
value were required. SFAS No. 123 (R) shall be effective for public entities
that do not file as small business issuers as of the beginning of the first
annual reporting period that begins after December 15, 2005. SFAS No. 123 (R)
shall be effective for the Company beginning in its first quarter of fiscal
2006. The Company has not determined if the adoption of this new accounting
pronouncement is expected to have a material impact on the financial statements
of the Company for fiscal 2006.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm


To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Ark Restaurants Corp.


We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Ark Restaurants
Corp. and Subsidiaries as of October 1, 2005 and October 2, 2004, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity and cash
flows for the years then ended. These consolidated financial statements are
the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Ark
Restaurants Corp. and Subsidiaries as of October 1, 2005 and October 2, 2004,
and their results of operations and cash flows for the years then ended, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM


To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Ark Restaurants Corp.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of operations,
shareholders' equity and cash flows of Ark Restaurants Corp. and subsidiaries
(the "Company") for the fiscal year ended September 27, 2003. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

We conducted our audit in accordance with standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to
have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over
financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over
financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining,
on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the results of operations and cash flows of Ark Restaurants
Corp. and subsidiaries for the fiscal year ended September 27, 2003, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.

ARK RESTAURANTS CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEARS ENDED OCTOBER 1, 2005, OCTOBER 2, 2004 AND SEPTEMBER 27, 2003
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


1.    BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

      Ark Restaurants Corp. and subsidiaries (the "Company") own and operate 23
      restaurants, 26 fast food concepts, catering operations and wholesale and
      retail bakeries. Nine restaurants are located in New York City, nine in
      Las Vegas, Nevada and four in Washington, D.C. The Las Vegas operations
      include three restaurants within the New York-New York Hotel & Casino
      Resort and operation of the resort's room service, banquet facilities,
      employee dining room and nine food court concepts. Four restaurants and
      bars are within the Venetian Casino Resort as well as four food court
      concepts; one restaurant is within the Forum Shops at Caesar's Shopping
      Center and one restaurant is in downtown Las Vegas at the Neonopolis
      Center. The Company also manages five fast food facilities in Tampa,
      Florida and eight fast food facilities in Hollywood, Florida, each at a
      Hard Rock Hotel and Casino owned by the Seminole Indian Tribe at these
      locations. One restaurant and one bar are located in the Resorts Casino in
      Atlantic City, New Jersey.

      Accounting Period--The Company's fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest
      September 30. The fiscal year ended October 1, 2005 included 52 weeks. The
      fiscal years ended October 2, 2004 and September 27, 2003 included 53
      weeks and 52 weeks, respectively.

      Significant Estimates--In the process of preparing its consolidated
      financial statements, the Company estimates the appropriate carrying value
      of certain assets and liabilities which are not readily apparent from
      other sources. The primary estimates underlying the Company's financial
      statements include allowances for potential bad debts on long-term
      receivables, the useful lives and recoverability of its assets, such as
      property and intangibles, fair values of financial instruments, the
      realizable value of its tax assets and other matters. Management bases its
      estimates on certain assumptions, which it believes are reasonable in the
      circumstances, and while actual results could differ from those estimates,
      management does not believe that any change in those assumptions in the
      near term would have a material effect on the Company's consolidated
      financial statements.

      Principles of Consolidation--The consolidated financial statements include
      the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All
      intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
      consolidation.

      Cash Equivalents--Cash equivalents include instruments with maturities of
      three months or less, when purchased.

      Accounts Receivable--Accounts receivable is primarily composed of normal
      business receivables such as credit card receivables that are paid off in
      a short period of time. See Notes 16 and 17 for a discussion of related
      party receivables.

      Inventories--Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in,
      first-out) or market, and consist of food and beverages, merchandise for
      sale and other supplies.

      Fixed Assets--Leasehold improvements and furniture, fixtures and equipment
      are stated at cost. Depreciation of furniture, fixtures and equipment
      (including equipment under capital leases) is computed using the
      straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective
      assets (three to seven years). Amortization of improvements to leased
      properties is computed using the straight-line method based upon the
      initial term of the applicable lease or the estimated useful life of the
      improvements, whichever is less, and ranges from 5 to 30 years. For leases
      with renewal periods at the Company's option, if failure to exercise a
      renewal option imposes an economic penalty to the Company, management may
      determine at the inception of the lease that renewal is reasonably assured
      and include the renewal option period in the determination of appropriate
      estimated useful lives.

      The Company includes in construction in progress improvements in
      restaurants that are under construction. Once the projects have been
      completed, the Company will begin depreciating and amortizing the assets.
      Start-up costs incurred during the construction period of restaurants,
      including rental of premises, training and payroll, are expensed as
      incurred.

      The Company follows Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS")
      No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,
      which requires impairment losses to be recorded on long-lived assets used
      in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the
      undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less
      than the asset's carrying amount. In the evaluation of the fair value and
      future benefits of long-lived assets, the Company performs an analysis of
      the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows of the related
      long-lived assets. If the carrying value of the related asset exceeds the
      undiscounted cash flows, the carrying value is reduced to its fair value.
      Various factors including future sales growth and profit margins are
      included in this analysis. Management believes at this time that carrying
      values and useful lives continue to be appropriate.

      For the years ended October 1, 2005 and October 2, 2004, no impairment
      charges were deemed necessary. For the year ended September 27, 2003, an
      impairment charge of $667,000 was incurred on the restaurant Lutece (Note
      2).

      Intangible Assets and Goodwill--As of September 29, 2002, the Company
      adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 142, Accounting for Goodwill and Other
      Intangible Assets. This statement requires that for the Company goodwill,
      including the goodwill included in the carrying value of investments
      accounted for using the equity method of accounting, and certain other
      intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite useful life, cease
      amortizing. SFAS No. 142 requires that goodwill and certain intangible
      assets be assessed for impairment using fair value measurement techniques.
      Specifically, goodwill impairment is determined using a two-step process.
      The first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify
      potential impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit
      (the Company is being treated as one reporting unit) with its net book
      value (or carrying amount), including goodwill. If the fair value of the
      reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit
      is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is
      unnecessary. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair
      value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to
      measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the
      goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting
      unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying
      amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of
      that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that
      excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same
      manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination.
      That is, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the
      assets and liabilities of that unit (including any unrecognized intangible
      assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business
      combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase
      price paid to acquire the reporting unit. The impairment test for other
      intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value

                                      F-8

<PAGE>

      of the intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value of
      the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is
      recognized in an amount equal to that excess.

      Determining the fair value of the reporting unit under the first step of
      the goodwill impairment test and determining the fair value of individual
      assets and liabilities of the reporting unit (including unrecognized
      intangible assets) under the second step of the goodwill impairment test
      is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant
      estimates and assumptions. Similarly, estimates and assumptions are used
      in determining the fair value of other intangible assets. These estimates
      and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an
      impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge.
      To assist in the process of determining goodwill impairment, the Company
      obtains appraisals from independent valuation firms. In addition to the
      use of independent valuation firms, the Company performs internal
      valuation analyses and considers other market information that is publicly
      available. Estimates of fair value are primarily determined using
      discounted cash flows and market comparisons and recent transactions.
      These approaches use significant estimates and assumptions including
      projected future cash flows (including timing), discount rate reflecting
      the risk inherent in future cash flows, perpetual growth rate,
      determination of appropriate market comparables and the determination of
      whether a premium or discount should be applied to comparables. Based on
      the above policy no impairment charges were recorded during the fiscal
      years ended 2005, 2004 and 2003.

      Costs associated with acquiring leases and subleases, principally
      purchased leasehold rights, have been capitalized and are being amortized
      on the straight-line method based upon the initial terms of the applicable
      lease agreements, which range from 10 to 21 years.

      Covenants not to compete arising from restaurant acquisitions are
      amortized over the contractual period of five years.

      Amortization expense for intangible assets not including goodwill was
      $28,000, $27,000 and $15,000 for the years ended October 1, 2005, October
      2, 2004, and September 27, 2003, respectively.

      Leases - The Company is obligated under various lease agreements for
      certain restaurants. The Company recognizes rent expense on a
      straight-line basis over the expected lease term, including option periods
      as described below. Within the provisions of certain leases there are
      escalations in payments over the base lease term, as well as renewal
      periods. The effects of the escalations have been reflected in rent
      expense on a straight-line basis over the expected lease term, which
      includes option periods when it is deemed to be reasonably assured that
      the Company would incur an economic penalty for not exercising the option.
      Percentage rent expense is generally based upon sales levels and is
      expensed as incurred. Certain leases include both base rent and percentage
      rent. The Company records rent expense on these leases based upon
      reasonably assured sales levels. The consolidated financial statements
      reflect the same lease terms for amortizing leasehold improvements as were
      used in calculating straight-line rent expense for each restaurant. The
      judgments of the Company may produce materially different amounts of
      amortization and rent expense than would be reported if different lease
      terms were used.

      Other Assets-- Certain legal and bank commitment fees incurred in
      connection with the Company's Revolving Credit and Term Loan Facility, as
      discussed in Note 7, were capitalized as deferred financing fees and were
      amortized over two years, the remaining term of the facility.

      Operating Lease Deferred Credit--Several of the Company's operating leases
      contain predetermined increases in the rentals payable during the term of
      such leases. For these leases, the aggregate rental expense over the lease
      term is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The
      excess of the


                                      F-9


<PAGE>


      expense charged to operations in any year and amounts payable under the
      leases during that year are recorded as a deferred credit. The deferred
      credit subsequently reverses over the lease term (Note 8).

      Occupancy Expenses--Occupancy expenses include rent, rent taxes, real
      estate taxes, insurance and utility costs.

      Income Taxes--Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability
      method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax
      consequences attributable to the temporary differences between the
      financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their
      respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
      Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
      expected to apply in the years in which those temporary differences are
      expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and
      liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that
      includes the enactment date. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a
      valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely
      than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be
      realized

      Income Per Share of Common Stock--Basic net income per share is computed
      in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS") No.
      128, Earnings Per Share, and is calculated on the basis of the weighted
      average number of common shares outstanding during each period. Diluted
      net income per share reflects the additional dilutive effect of
      potentially dilutive shares (principally those arising from the assumed
      exercise of stock options).

      Stock Options--The Company accounts for stock options granted to employees
      under the intrinsic value-based method for employee stock-based
      compensation and provides pro forma disclosure of net income and earnings
      per share as if the accounting provisions of Statement of Financial
      Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
      ("SFAS No. 123") had been adopted. The Company generally does not grant
      options to outsiders.

      SFAS No. 123 requires the Company to disclose pro forma net income and pro
      forma earnings per share information for employee stock option grants to
      employees as if the fair-value method defined in SFAS No. 123 had been
      applied. The Company utilized the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to
      quantify the pro forma effects on net income and earnings per share of all
      options granted. During fiscal 2005 194,000 options to purchase common
      stock were granted. There were no options granted during fiscal 2004 and
      2003 and no charges to operations for options issued to employees during
      fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003.

      In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148
      ("SFAS No. 148") and SFAS No. 123, the Company's pro forma option expense
      is computed using Black-Scholes option pricing model. To comply with SFAS
      No. 148, the Company is presenting the following table to illustrate the
      effect on the net income and income per share if it had applied the fair
      value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, as amended, to options
      granted under the stock-based employee compensation plan. For purposes of
      this pro forma disclosure, the estimated value of the options is amortized
      ratably to expense over the options' vesting periods.

        These options will vest after two years and expire ten years after the
        date of grant. The Company did not record any intrinsic value for these
        options. The assumptions used for fiscal 2005 for the pro forma effects
        of options granted on December 21, 2004 included a risk-free interest
        rate of 3.37%, volatility of 37%, a dividend yield of 3% and an expected
        life of three years.

2. RECENT RESTAURANT DISPOSITIONS

      In fiscal 2003, the Company determined that its restaurant, Lutece,
      located in New York City, had been impaired by the events of September
      11th and the continued weakness in the economy. Based upon the sum of the
      future undiscounted cash flows related to the Company's long-lived fixed
      assets at Lutece, the Company determined that impairment had occurred. To
      estimate the fair value of such long-lived fixed assets, for determining
      the impairment amount, the Company used the expected present value of the
      future cash flows. The Company projected continuing negative operating
      cash flow for the foreseeable future with no value for subletting or
      assigning the lease for the premises. As a result, the Company determined
      that there was no value to the long-lived fixed assets. The Company had an
      investment of $667,000 in leasehold improvements, furniture fixtures and
      equipment. The Company believed that these assets would have nominal value
      upon disposal and recorded an impairment charge of $667,000 during fiscal
      2003. Due to continued weak sales, the Company closed Lutece during the
      second quarter of 2004. The Company recorded net operating losses of
      $804,000 for Lutece during the fiscal year ended October 2, 2004 which are
      included in losses from discontinued operations. In 2004, the Company also
      incurred a one-time charge of $470,000 related to pension plan
      contributions required in connection with the closing of Lutece which is
      payable monthly over a nine year period beginning May 17, 2004 and bears
      interest at 8% per annum. Net operating losses of $60,000 were included in
      losses from discontinued operations for the fiscal year ended October 1,
      2005.

      On December 1, 2003, the Company sold a restaurant, Lorelei, for
      approximately $850,000. The book value of inventory, fixed assets,
      intangible assets and goodwill related to this entity was approximately
      $625,000. The Company recorded a gain on the sale of approximately
      $225,000 during the first quarter



                                      F-11

<PAGE>



      of fiscal 2004 which is included in losses from discontinued operations.
      Net operating losses of $145,000 were recorded in discontinued operations
      in fiscal 2004. There were no additional expenses related to this
      restaurant during the fiscal year ended October 2, 2004.

      The Company's restaurant Ernie's, located on the upper west side of
      Manhattan opened in 1982. As a result of a steady decline in sales, the
      Company felt that a new concept was needed at this location. The
      restaurant was closed June 16, 2003 and reopened in August 2003. Total
      conversion costs were approximately $350,000. Sales at the new restaurant,
      La Rambla, failed to reach the level sufficient to achieve the results the
      Company required. As a result, the Company sold this restaurant on January
      1, 2004 and realized a gain on the sale of this restaurant of
      approximately $214,000. Net operating losses of $230,000 were included in
      losses from discontinued operations for the fiscal year ended October 2,
      2004. Net operating losses of $12,000 were included in losses from
      discontinued operations for the fiscal year ended October 1, 2005.

      The Company's restaurant Jack Rose located on the west side of Manhattan
      has experienced weak sales for several years. In addition, this restaurant
      did not fit the Company's desired profile of being in a landmark
      destination location. As a result, the Company sold this restaurant on
      February 23, 2004. The Company realized a loss on the sale of this
      restaurant of $137,000 which was recorded during the second quarter of
      fiscal 2004. The Company recorded net operating losses of $148,000 during
      fiscal 2004 for this restaurant. These losses are included in losses from
      discontinued operations. Net operating losses of $19,000 were included in
      losses from discontinued operations for the fiscal year ended October 1,
      2005.

      The Company's restaurant America, located in New York City, has
      experienced declining sales for several years. In March 2004, the Company
      entered into a new lease for this restaurant at a significantly increased
      rent. The Company entered into this lease with the belief that due to the
      location and the uniqueness of the space the lease had value. On January
      19, 2005, the Company signed a definitive agreement for the sale of this
      restaurant which closed on March 15, 2005. The Company realized a pre-tax
      gain of $644,000 on the sale of this restaurant. Net operating income of
      $47,000 was recorded in income from discontinued operations for the fiscal
      year ended October 1, 2005.

      In accordance with SFAS No. 144, all prior years included in the
      accompanying consolidated statements of operations and cash flows have
      been reclassified to separately show the results of operations and cash
      flows of these discontinued operations. Total revenues of these
      discontinued operations were $1,871,000, $6,501,000 and $13,860,000 in
      fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

      As a result of the above mentioned sales, the Company allocated $75,000 of
      goodwill to these restaurants and reduced goodwill by this amount in
      fiscal 2005.

            (a)   In December 1996, the Company sold a restaurant for $900,000.
                  Cash of $50,000 was received on sale and the balance is due in
                  installments through December 2006.

            (b)   In October 1997, the Company sold a restaurant for $1,750,000,
                  of which $200,000 was paid in cash and the balance is due in
                  monthly installments under the terms of two notes bearing
                  interest at 7.5%. One note, with an initial principal balance
                  of $400,000, was paid in 24 monthly installments of $19,000
                  through April 2000. The second note, with an initial principal
                  balance of $1,150,000, will be paid in 104 monthly
                  installments of $15,000 commencing May 2000 and ending
                  December 2008. At December 2008, the then outstanding balance
                  of $519,000 matures.

                  The Company recognized a gain of approximately $585,000 in the
                  fiscal year ended September 27, 2003 in connection with the
                  sale of this restaurant. The gain recognized reflected the
                  realization of a gain that had been deferred originally due to
                  the length of the note and the substantial balance due upon
                  maturity ($519,000). A review of the performance of this note
                  and the security underlying it has lead management to conclude
                  that the full amount will likely be collected and,
                  accordingly, the note no longer requires a reserve.
                  Consequently, the Company eliminated this reserve and included
                  the amount in revenue, in other income, for the year ended
                  September 27, 2003. As a result of the reclassification of
                  discontinued operations this gain is included in losses from
                  discontinued operations for fiscal 2003.

            (c)   In June 2000, the Company sold this restaurant for $438,000.
                  Cash of $188,000 was received on sale and the balance was due
                  in installments through June 2006. In February 2001, the buyer
                  defaulted and the Company took possession of this restaurant
                  and sold it to another

                  party in June 2002. The total price was $270,000, cash of
                  $145,000 was received on sale and the balance was due in
                  installments through December 2007. The buyer fully paid the
                  note during fiscal 2005.

            (d)   In March 2005, the Company sold this restaurant for
                  $1,300,000. Cash of $600,000 was included on the sale. Of the
                  $600,000 cash, $200,000 was paid to the Company as a fee to
                  manage the restaurant for four months prior to closure and the
                  balance was paid directly to the landlord. The remaining
                  $700,000 was received in the form of a note payable in
                  installments through June 2011.

                  The Company recognized a gain during the year ended October 1,
                  2005 of $644,000.

      additional $1,000,000 towards the construction. The bar opened in December
      2005 and the Company anticipates that the restaurant will be opened on New
      Years Eve 2005. The future minimum lease payments from these lease
      agreements are included in the above schedule.

      Legal Proceedings--In the ordinary course of its business, the Company is
      a party to various lawsuits arising from accidents at its restaurants and
      worker's compensation claims, which are generally handled by the Company's
      insurance carriers.

      The employment by the Company of management personnel, waiters, waitresses
      and kitchen staff at a number of different restaurants has resulted in the
      institution, from time to time, of litigation alleging violation by the
      Company of employment discrimination laws. The Company does not believe
      that any of such suits will have a materially adverse effect upon the
      Company's consolidated financial statements. In October 2003, the
      Company's landlord for its executive, administrative and clerical offices
      located in New York, New York commenced an action against the Company in
      the Supreme Court, New York County asserting the Company had failed to
      validly exercise its option with respect to the premises at issue and that
      the Landlord was entitled to immediate and exclusive possession of the
      premises. The Company answered and asserted affirmative defenses and
      counterclaims. By an order dated May 25, 2004, the court denied the
      landlord's motion for summary judgment on its complaint while granting, in
      part, the landlord's motion to dismiss the Company's affirmative defenses
      and counterclaims. Both the landlord and the Company appealed from the May
      25, 2004 order, but no decision on the appeals has been issued. Pending
      the outcome of this litigation, the Company remains in possession of the
      premises.

9.    COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE PLAN

      In August 1998, the Company authorized the repurchase of up to 500,000
      shares of the Company's outstanding common stock. In April 1999, the
      Company authorized the repurchase of an additional 300,000 shares of the
      Company's outstanding common stock. For the years ended October 1, 2005
      and September 27, 2003, there were no repurchases of common stock. For the
      year ended October 2, 2004 the Company repurchased 2,500 shares at a total
      cost of $35,000.

10.   STOCK OPTIONS

      The Company has options outstanding under two stock option plans, the 1996
      Stock Option Plan (the "1996 Plan") and the 2004 Stock Option Plan (the
      "2004 Plan"). In 2004 the Company terminated the 1996 Plan. This action
      terminated the 257,000 authorized but unissued options under the 1996 Plan
      but it did not affect any of the options previously issued under the 1996
      Plan.

      Options granted under the 1996 Plan are exercisable at prices at least
      equal to the fair market value of such stock on the dates the options were
      granted. The options expire five years after the date of grant


                                      F-17

<PAGE>




      and are generally exercisable as to 25% of the shares commencing on the
      first anniversary of the date of grant and as to an additional 25%
      commencing on each of the second, third and fourth anniversaries of the
      grant date.

      Options granted under the 2004 Plan are exercisable at prices at least
      equal to the fair market value of such stock on the dates the options were
      granted. The options expire ten years after the date of grant and are
      generally exercisable as to 50% of the shares commencing on the first
      anniversary of the date of grant and as to an additional 50% commencing on
      the second anniversary of the date of grant.

11.   MANAGEMENT FEE INCOME

      As of October 1, 2005, the Company provides management services to two
      fast food courts and one restaurant it does not own. In accordance with
      the contractual arrangements, the Company earns management fees based on
      operating profits as defined by the agreement.

      Management fee income relating to these services was $1,568,000, $386,000
      and $120,000 for the years ended October 1, 2005, October 2, 2004 and
      September 27, 2003, respectively.





                                      F-18

      during the management periods within the years ended October 1, 2005,
      October 2, 2004 and September 27, 2003, respectively, which are not
      included in consolidated net sales of the Company.

12.   INCOME TAXES

      The provision for income taxes reflects Federal income taxes calculated on
      a consolidated basis and state and local income taxes calculated by each
      subsidiary on a nonconsolidated basis. For New York State and City income
      tax purposes, the losses incurred by a subsidiary may only be used to
      offset that subsidiary's income.

      The provision (benefit) for income taxes attributable to continuing and
      discontinued operations consists of the following:

      A valuation allowance for deferred taxes is required if, based on the
      evidence, it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets
      will not be realized. The Company believes that uncertainty exists with
      respect to future realization of certain operating loss carryforwards and
      operating lease deferred credits. Therefore, the Company provided a
      valuation allowance of $358,000 at October 1, 2005, $486,000 at October 2,
      2004. The Company decreased its allowance for the utilization of the
      deferred tax asset arising from state and local operating loss
      carryforwards by $125,000 and $395,000 for the years ended October 1, 2005
      and October 2, 2004, respectively, based on the merger of certain
      unprofitable subsidiaries into profitable ones. The Company has state
      operating loss carryforwards of $27,296,000, which expire in the years
      2006 through 2020.

      Subsequent to the fiscal year ended October 1, 2005 the Company agreed to
      a settlement with the Internal Revenue Service which covered fiscal years
      ended October 2, 1999 through October 2, 2004. The final adjustments
      primarily involve the timing of deductions made during the fiscal year
      ended September 28, 2003 relating to the abandonment of the Company's
      restaurant and food court operations at Desert Passage which adjoins the
      Aladdin Casino Resort in Las Vegas, Nevada. This settlement did not have a
      material effect on the Company's financial condition.

      During the fiscal year ended September 27, 2003, the Company and the
      Internal Revenue Service finalized the adjustments to the Company's
      Federal income tax returns for the fiscal years ended September 30, 1995
      through October 3, 1998. The final adjustments primarily relate to: (i)
      legal and accounting expenses incurred in connection with new or acquired
      restaurants that the Internal Revenue Service asserts should have been
      capitalized and amortized rather than currently expensed and (ii) travel
      and meal expenses for which the Internal Revenue Service asserts the
      Company did not comply with certain record keeping requirements or the
      Internal Revenue Code. These settlements did not have a material effect on
      the Company's financial condition.

      (a)   During the fiscal year ended September 27, 2003, the Company applied
            for grants to the World Trade Center Business Recovery Grant Program
            for four restaurants located in downtown New York. The program was
            established to compensate businesses for economic losses resulting
            from the September 11, 2001 disaster. As a result of our
            applications, the Company received compensation of $508,000 during
            the fourth quarter of the year ended September 27, 2003.
