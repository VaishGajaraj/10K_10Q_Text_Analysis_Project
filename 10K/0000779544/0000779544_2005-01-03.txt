Item 1. Business

Overview

Ark Restaurants Corp. (the "Registrant" or the "Company") is a New York
corporation formed in 1983. Through its subsidiaries, it owns and operates 22
restaurants and bars, 26 fast food concepts, catering operations, and wholesale
and retail bakeries. Initially its facilities were located only in New York
City. At this time, nine of the restaurants are located in New York City, four
are located in Washington, D.C., and nine are located in Las Vegas, Nevada. The
Company's Las Vegas operations include:

     o three restaurants within the New York-New York Hotel & Casino Resort, and
operation of the resort's room service, banquet facilities, employee dining room
and nine food court operations;

     o two restaurants, two bars and four food court facilities at the Venetian
Casino Resort;

     o one restaurant at the Neonopolis Center at Fremont Street; and

     o one restaurant within the Forum Shops at Caesar's Shopping Center.

In 2004, the Company established operations in Florida which include five fast
food facilities in Tampa, Florida and eight fast food facilities in Hollywood,
Florida, each at a Hard Rock Hotel and Casino operated by the Seminole Indian
Tribe at these locations. All pre-opening expenses were borne by outside
investors who invested in a limited liability company established to develop,
construct, operate and manage these facilities. The Company is the managing
member of this limited liability company and, through this limited liability
company, the Company leases and manages the operations of each of these
facilities in exchange for a monthly management fee equal to five-percent of the
gross receipts of these facilities. Neither the Company nor any of its
subsidiaries contributed any capital to this limited liability company. None of
the obligations of this limited liability company are guaranteed by the Company
and investors in this limited liability company have no recourse against the
Company or any of its assets.

In addition to the shift from a Manhattan-based operation to a multi-city
operation, the nature of the facilities operated by the Company has shifted from
smaller, neighborhood restaurants to larger, destination restaurants intended to
benefit from high patron traffic attributable to the uniqueness of the
restaurant's location. Most of the Company's restaurants which are in operation
and which have been opened in recent years are of the latter description. These
include the restaurant operations at the New York-New York Hotel & Casino in Las
Vegas, Nevada (1997); the Stage Deli located at the Forum Shops in Las Vegas,
Nevada, Red, located at the South Street Seaport in New York (1998); Thunder
Grill in Union Station, Washington, D.C. (1999); two restaurants and four food
court facilities at the Venetian Casino Resort in Las Vegas, Nevada (2000); The
Saloon, at the Neonopolis Center in downtown Las Vegas, Nevada (2002); and the
13 fast food facilities in Tampa, Florida and Hollywood, Florida, respectively
(2004). The Company recently entered into agreements to operate a Gallagher's
Steakhouse restaurant and a separate bar, yet to be named, to be constructed in
the Resorts Atlantic City Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Apart
from these agreements, the Company is not currently committed to any new
projects. The Company has sold a number of its smaller, neighborhood
restaurants.

The names and themes of each of the Company's restaurants are different except
for the Company's three America restaurants, two Sequoia restaurants, two
Gonzalez y Gonzalez restaurants and, when opened in Atlantic City, two
Gallagher's Steakhouse restaurants. The menus in the Company's restaurants are


                                        2

extensive, offering a wide variety of high quality foods at generally moderate
prices. Of the Company's restaurants, the Lutece restaurant may be classified as
expensive. The atmosphere at many of the restaurants is lively and extremely
casual. Most of the restaurants have separate bar areas. A majority of the net
sales of the Company is derived from dinner as opposed to lunch service. Most of
the restaurants are open seven days a week and most serve lunch as well as
dinner.

While decor differs from restaurant to restaurant, interiors are marked by
distinctive architectural and design elements which often incorporate dramatic
interior open spaces and extensive glass exteriors. The wall treatments,
lighting and decorations are typically vivid, unusual and, in some cases, highly
theatrical.

The following table sets forth information with respect to the Company's
facilities currently in operation.

     level required to exercise the renewal option for each respective
     restaurant.

(9)  The Company operates eight small food court restaurants in the Villages
     Eateries food court at the New York-New York Hotel & Casino. The Company
     also operates that hotel's room service, banquet facilities and employee
     cafeteria.

(10) The restaurant experienced damage in the attack on the World Trade Center
     on September 11, 2001. In addition, substantial damage was sustained by the
     World Financial Center in which the restaurant is located. The restaurant
     closed on September 11, 2001 and reopened in early December 2002.

(11) Restaurant owned by a third party and managed by the Company. The Company
     receives $7,000 per month for managing the restaurant.

Restaurant Expansion

The Company recently entered into agreements to operate a Gallagher's Steakhouse
restaurant and a separate bar, yet to be named, to be constructed in the Resorts
Atlantic City Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey.

The opening of a new restaurant is invariably accompanied by substantial
pre-opening expenses and early operating losses associated with the training of
personnel, excess kitchen costs, costs of supervision and other expenses during
the pre-opening period and during a post-opening "shake out" period until
operations can be considered to be functioning normally. The amount of such
pre-opening expenses and early operating losses can generally be expected to
depend upon the size and complexity of the facility being opened. The Company
incurred no pre-opening expenses or early operating losses in fiscal 2004.

The Company's restaurants generally do not achieve substantial increases from
year to year in revenue, which the Company considers to be typical of the
restaurant industry. To achieve significant increases in revenue or to replace
revenue of restaurants that lose customer favor or which close because of lease
expirations or other reasons, the Company would have to open additional
restaurant facilities or expand existing restaurants. There can be no assurance
that a restaurant will be successful after it is opened, particularly since in
many instances the Company does not operate its new restaurants under a trade
name currently used by the Company, thereby requiring new restaurants to
establish their own identity.

Apart from these agreements, the Company is not currently committed to any
projects. The Company may take advantage of opportunities it considers to be
favorable, when they occur, depending upon the availability of financing and
other factors.

Recent Restaurant Dispositions and Charges

In fiscal 2003, the Company determined that its restaurant, Lutece, located in
New York City, had been impaired by the events of September 11th and the
continued weakness in the economy. Based upon the sum of the future undiscounted
cash flows related to the Company's long-lived fixed assets at Lutece, the
Company determined that impairment had occurred. To estimate the fair value of
such long-lived fixed assets, for determining the impairment amount, the Company
used the expected present value of the


                                        6




<PAGE>

future cash flows. The Company projected continuing negative operating cash flow
for the foreseeable future with no value for subletting or assigning the lease
for the premises. As a result, the Company determined that there was no value to
the long-lived fixed assets. The Company had an investment of $667,000 in
leasehold improvements, furniture fixtures and equipment. The Company believed
that these assets would have nominal value upon disposal and recorded an
impairment charge of $667,000 during fiscal 2003. Due to continued weak sales,
the Company closed Lutece during the second quarter of 2004. The Company
recorded a net operating losses of $804,000 during the fiscal year ended October
2, 2004 which is included in losses from discontinued operations. The Company
also incurred a one-time charge of $470,000 related to pension plan
contributions required in connection with the closing of Lutece which is payable
monthly over a nine year period beginning May 17, 2004 and bears interest at a
rate of 8% per annum.

On December 1, 2003, the Company sold a restaurant, Lorelei, for approximately
$850,000. The book value of inventory, fixed assets, intangible assets and
goodwill related to this entity was approximately $625,000. The Company recorded
a gain on the sale of approximately $225,000 during the first quarter of fiscal
2004 which is included in losses from discontinued operations. Net operating
losses of $145,000 were recorded in discontinued operations in the 39-week
period ended June 26, 2004. There were no additional expenses related to this
restaurant during the fiscal year ended October 2, 2004.

The Company's restaurant Ernie's, located on the upper west side of Manhattan
opened in 1982. As a result of a steady decline in sales, the Company felt that
a new concept was needed at this location. The restaurant was closed June 16,
2003 and reopened in August 2003. Total conversion costs were approximately
$350,000. Sales at the new restaurant, La Rambla, failed to reach the level
sufficient to achieve the results the Company required. As a result, the Company
sold this restaurant on January 1, 2004 and realized a gain on the sale of this
restaurant of approximately $214,000. Net operating losses of $230,000 were
included in losses from discontinued operations for the fiscal year ended
October 2, 2004.

The Company's restaurant Jack Rose located on the west side of Manhattan has
experienced weak sales for several years. In addition, this restaurant did not
fit the Company's desired profile of being in a landmark destination location.
As a result, the Company sold this restaurant on February 23, 2004. The Company
realized a loss on the sale of this restaurant of $137,000 which was recorded
during the second quarter of fiscal 2004. The Company recorded net operating
losses of $148,000 during fiscal 2004 for this restaurant. These losses are
included in losses from discontinued operations.

With regard to the Company's America restaurant in New York, New York, as of
October 2, 2004, the Company has classified the assets and liabilities of this
restaurant as "held for sale" in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets" ("FAS 144") based on the fact that the Company has met the
criteria under FAS 144. The Company expects the sale of this restaurant to be
completed in the second quarter of 2005.

Restaurant Management

Each restaurant is managed by its own manager and has its own chef. Food
products and other supplies are purchased primarily from various unaffiliated
suppliers, in most cases by Company headquarters' personnel. The Company's
Columbus Bakery supplies bakery products to most of the Company's New York City
restaurants in addition to operating a retail bakery. The Company's Columbus
Bakery in Las Vegas supplies bakery products to most of the Company's Las Vegas
restaurants in addition to operating a wholesale bakery. Each of the Company's
restaurants has two or more assistant managers and sous


                                        7




<PAGE>

chefs (assistant chefs). Financial and management control is maintained at the
corporate level through the use of an automated data processing system that
includes centralized accounting and reporting.

Purchasing and Distribution

The Company strives to obtain quality menu ingredients, raw materials and other
supplies and services for its operations from reliable sources at competitive
prices. Substantially all menu items are prepared on each restaurant's premises
daily from scratch, using fresh ingredients. Each restaurant's management
determines the quantities of food and supplies required and orders the items
from local, regional and national suppliers on terms negotiated by the Company's
centralized purchasing staff. Restaurant-level inventories are maintained at a
minimum dollar-value level in relation to sales due to the relatively rapid
turnover of the perishable produce, poultry, meat, fish and dairy commodities
that are used in operations.

The Company attempts to negotiate short-term and long-term supply agreements
depending on market conditions and expected demand. However, the Company does
not contract for long periods of time for its fresh commodities such as produce,
poultry, meat, fish and dairy items and, consequently, such commodities can be
subject to unforeseen supply and cost fluctuations. Independent foodservice
distributors deliver most food and supply items daily to restaurants. The
financial impact of such supply agreements, would not have a material adverse
effect on the Company's financial position.

Employees

At December 10, 2004, the Company employed 2,038 persons (including employees at
managed facilities), 1,465 of whom were full-time employees, 573 of whom were
part-time employees, 33 of whom were headquarters personnel, 201 of whom were
restaurant management personnel, 599 of whom were kitchen personnel and 1,205 of
whom were restaurant service personnel. A number of the Company's restaurant
service personnel are employed on a part-time basis. Changes in minimum wage
levels may affect the labor costs of the Company and the restaurant industry
generally because a large percentage of restaurant personnel are paid at or
slightly above the minimum wage. The Company's employees are not covered by a
collective bargaining agreement.

Government Regulation

The Company is subject to various federal, state and local laws affecting its
business. Each restaurant is subject to licensing and regulation by a number of
governmental authorities that may include alcoholic beverage control, health,
sanitation, environmental, zoning and public safety agencies in the state or
municipality in which the restaurant is located. Difficulties in obtaining or
failures to obtain the required licenses or approvals could delay or prevent the
development and openings of new restaurants, or could disrupt the operations of
existing restaurants.

Alcoholic beverage control regulations require each of our restaurants to apply
to a state authority and, in certain locations, county and municipal authorities
for licenses and permits to sell alcoholic beverages on the premises. Typically,
licenses must be renewed annually and may be subject to penalties, temporary
suspension or revocation for cause at any time. Alcoholic beverage control
regulations impact many aspects of the daily operations of our restaurants,
including the minimum ages of patrons and employees consuming or serving such
beverages; employee alcoholic beverages training and certification requirements;
hours of operation; advertising; wholesale purchasing and inventory control of
such beverages; seating of minors and the service of food within our bar areas;
and the storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages. State and local
authorities in many jurisdictions routinely monitor compliance with alcoholic
beverage laws. The failure to receive or retain, or a delay in obtaining, a
liquor license for a


                                        8




<PAGE>

particular restaurant could adversely affect the Company's ability to obtain
such licenses elsewhere.

The Company is subject to "dram-shop" statutes in most of the states in which it
has operations, which generally provide a person injured by an intoxicated
person the right to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served
alcoholic beverages to such person. The Company carries liquor liability
coverage as part of its existing comprehensive general liability insurance. A
settlement or judgment against the Company under a "dram-shop" statute in excess
of liability coverage could have a material adverse effect on operations.

Various federal and state labor laws govern the Company's operations and its
relationship with employees, including such matters as minimum wages, breaks,
overtime, fringe benefits, safety, working conditions and citizenship
requirements. The Company is also subject to the regulations of the Immigration
and Naturalization Service (INS). If employees of the Company do not meet
federal citizenship or residency requirements, this could lead to a disruption
in the Company's work force. Significant government-imposed increases in minimum
wages, paid leaves of absence and mandated health benefits, or increased tax
reporting, assessment or payment requirements related to employees who receive
gratuities could be detrimental to the profitability of the Company.

The Company's facilities must comply with the applicable requirements of the
Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 ("ADA") and related state statutes. The
ADA prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability with respect to public
accommodations and employment. Under the ADA and related state laws, when
constructing new restaurants or undertaking significant remodeling of existing
restaurants, the Company must make them more readily accessible to disabled
persons.

The New York State Liquor Authority must approve any transaction in which a
shareholder of the Company increases his holdings to 10% or more of the
outstanding capital stock of the Company and any transaction involving 10% or
more of the outstanding capital stock of the Company.

Seasonal Nature Of Business

The Company's business is highly seasonal. The second quarter of the Company's
fiscal year, consisting of the non-holiday portion of the cold weather season in
New York and Washington (January, February and March), is the poorest performing
quarter. The Company achieves its best results during the warm weather,
attributable to the Company's extensive outdoor dining availability,
particularly at Bryant Park in New York and Sequoia in Washington, D.C. (the
Company's largest restaurants) and the Company's outdoor cafes. However, even
during summer months these facilities can be adversely affected by unusually
cool or rainy weather conditions. The Company's facilities in Las Vegas
generally operate on a more consistent basis through the year.

Terrorism and International Unrest

The terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon in
Washington, D.C. on September 11, 2001 had a material adverse effect on the
Company's revenues. As a result of the attacks, one Company restaurant, The
Grill Room, located at 2 World Financial Center, which is adjacent to the World
Trade Center, experienced some damage. The Grill Room was closed from September
11, 2001 and reopened in early December 2002.

The Company's restaurants in New York, Las Vegas, Washington D.C. and Florida
benefit from tourist traffic. Though the Las Vegas market has shown resiliency,
the sluggish economy and the lingering effects of September 11, 2001 have had an
adverse effect on the Company's restaurants. Recovery


                                        9




<PAGE>

depends upon a general improvement in economic conditions and the public's
willingness and inclination to resume vacation and convention travel. Additional
acts of terrorism in the United States or substantial international unrest may
have a material adverse effect on the Company's business and revenues.

Forward Looking Statements and Risk Factors

This report contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and
uncertainties. Discussions containing such forward-looking statements may be
found in the material set forth under "Item 1. Business" and "Item 7.
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations" as well as throughout this report generally. The Company's actual
results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking
statements as a result of certain factors, including those discussed below.

The restaurant business is intensely competitive and involves an extremely high
degree of risk. The Company believes that a large number of new restaurants open
each year and that a significant number of them do not succeed. Even successful
restaurants can rapidly lose popularity due to changes in consumer tastes,
turnover in personnel, the opening of competitive restaurants, unfavorable
reviews and other factors. There can be no assurance that the Company's existing
restaurants will retain such patronage as they currently enjoy or that new
restaurants opened by the Company will be successful. There is active
competition for competent chefs and management personnel and intense competition
among major restaurateurs and food service companies for the larger, unique
sites suitable for restaurants.

To achieve significant increases in revenue or to replace revenue of restaurants
which experience declining popularity or which close because of lease
expirations or other reasons, the Company would have to open additional
restaurant facilities. The opening of new restaurants is subject to a wide
variety of uncertainties, including the ability to negotiate favorable lease
provisions, the location of the restaurant, the development of a menu and
concept that appeals to consumers and the availability of skilled restaurant
managers. The acquisition or construction of new restaurants also requires
significant capital resources. New large-scale projects that have been the focus
of the Company's efforts in recent years would likely require additional
financing. If the Company were to identify a favorable restaurant opportunity,
there is no assurance that the required financing would be available.

Item 2. Properties

The Company's restaurant facilities and the Company's executive offices are
occupied under leases. Most of the Company's restaurant leases provide for the
payment of base rents plus real estate taxes, insurance and other expenses and,
in certain instances, for the payment of a percentage of the Company's sales at
such facility. These leases (including leases for managed restaurants) have
terms (including any available renewal options) expiring as follows:

<TABLE>

The Company's executive, administrative and clerical offices are located in
approximately 8,500 square feet of office space at 85 Fifth Avenue, New York,
New York. In October 2003 the Company's landlord for this property commenced an
action against the Company stating that the Company failed to validly exercise
its five-year renewal option to extend the lease through October 2008. The
Company currently occupies this property pending the result of litigation with
its landlord. See "Item 3. Legal Proceedings" for a discussion regarding this
litigation.

The Company's lease for office space related to its Washington, D.C. catering
operations expires in 2012.

For information concerning the Company's future minimum rental commitments under
non-cancelable operating leases, see Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

See also "Item 1. Business - Overview" for a list of restaurant properties.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

In the ordinary course of its business, the Company is a party to various
lawsuits arising from accidents at its restaurants and workers' compensation
claims, which are generally handled by the Company's insurance carriers.

The employment by the Company of management personnel, waiters, waitresses and
kitchen staff at a number of different restaurants has resulted in the
institution, from time to time, of litigation alleging violation by the Company
of employment discrimination laws. The Company does not believe that any of such
suits will have a materially adverse effect upon the Company, its financial
condition or operations.

Several unfair labor practice charges were filed against the Company in 1997
with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) with respect to the Company's Las
Vegas subsidiary. The charges were heard in October 1997. At issue was whether
the Company unlawfully terminated nine employees and disciplined six other
employees allegedly in retaliation for their union activities. An Administrative
Law Judge (ALJ) found that six employees were terminated unlawfully, three were
discharged for valid reasons, four employees were disciplined lawfully and two
employees were disciplined unlawfully. On appeal, the NLRB found that the
Company lawfully disciplined five employees, and unlawfully disciplined one
employee. The Company appealed the adverse rulings of the NLRB to the D.C.
Circuit Court of Appeals. In July 2003 the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals
affirmed the determinations of the NLRB. The Company offered to reinstate the
employees and all refused. The Company did incur any liability as a result.

In October 2003, the Company's landlord for its executive, administrative and
clerical offices located in New York, New York commenced an action against the
Company in the Supreme Court, New York County asserting the Company had failed
to validly exercise its option with respect to the premises at issue and that
the Landlord was entitled to immediate and exclusive possession of the premises.
The Company answered and asserted affirmative defenses and counterclaims. By an
order dated May 25, 2004, the court denied the landlord's motion for summary
judgment on its complaint while granting, in part, the landlord's motion to
dismiss the Company's affirmative defenses and counterclaims. Both the landlord
and the Company appealed from the May 25, 2004 order, but no decision on the
appeals has been issued. Pending the outcome of this litigation, the Company
remains in possession of the premises.

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
        of Operations

Accounting period

The Company's fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest September 30. The Company
reports fiscal years under a 52/53-week format. This reporting method is used by
many companies in the hospitality industry and is meant to improve year-to-year
comparisons of operating results. Under this method, certain years will contain
53 weeks. The fiscal years ended September 27, 2003 and September 28, 2002 each
included 52 weeks. The fiscal year ended October 2, 2004 included 53 weeks.

Overview

In connection with the consummated sale of three of the Company's restaurants,
the closure of one restaurant and the proposed sale of another restaurant, the
operations of these restaurants have been presented as discontinued operations
for the fiscal year ended 2004, and the Company has reclassified its statements
of operations data for the prior periods presented below, in accordance with FAS
144. See "Item 1 -Recent Restaurant Dispositions and Charges", "Item 7 - Recent
Restaurant Dispositions" and Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Revenues

Total revenues at restaurants owned by the Company increased by 12.6% from
fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2004 and increased by 1.1% from fiscal 2002 to fiscal
2003.

Same store sales increased 12.3%, or $12,984,000, on a Company-wide basis from
fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2004. This increase was the result of a 12.2%, or
$7,242,000, increase in same store sales at the Company's Las Vegas restaurants,
an 11.5%, or $3,560,000, increase in same store sales at the Company's New York
restaurants and a 14.3%, or $2,182,000, increase in same store sales at the
Company's Washington D.C. restaurants. The increases in New York and Washington
D.C. were principally due to the a general improvement in economic conditions,
the public's willingness and inclination to resume vacation and convention
travel and unusually good weather in these areas during spring and summer of
2004 which enabled the Company to use additional seating in its outdoor cafes.
Although the Company had not raised the price of menu items offered to its
customers for several years due to business conditions, the impact of the
increase in food costs during 2004 caused the Company to review the price of
menu items offered to its customers. The Company determined during 2004 to
increase the price of menu items offered to its customers in specific locations
where the Company believed consumer demand has created some elasticity.

During the fourth quarter of 2002 the Company abandoned its restaurant and food
court operations at the Desert Passage, the retail complex at the Aladdin Resort
& Casino in Las Vegas. During fiscal 2002 sales decreased 42.9% at this location
compared to fiscal 2001, resulting in the Company's decision to abandon these
operations. If this decrease is excluded from same store Las Vegas sales, the
Company's remaining operations in Las Vegas experienced a sales increase of
$190,000 during fiscal 2002.

Of the $11,896,000 decrease in revenues from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002,
$3,282,000 is attributable to the year long closure of the Grill Room restaurant
located in 2 World Financial Center, an office building adjacent to the World
Trade Center site. This restaurant was damaged in the September 11, 2001 attack
and reopened in early fiscal 2003. A $256,000 increase in sales is attributable
to the opening of the Saloon at the Neonopolis Center in downtown Las Vegas.

Other operating income, which consists of the sale of merchandise at various
restaurants, management fee income, door sales was $850,000 in fiscal 2004,
$679,000 in fiscal 2003 and $474,000 in fiscal 2002.

Costs and Expenses

Food and beverage cost of sales as a percentage of total revenue was 25.5% in
fiscal 2004, 24.7% in fiscal 2003 and 24.5% in fiscal 2002. Although this
expense as a percentage of total revenue increased from fiscal 2003 to 2004,
strong sales during fiscal 2004 allowed the Company the opportunity to create
relationships with new suppliers and increase the price of menu items offered to
its customers in specific locations where the Company believed consumer demand
has created some elasticity to offset increased food costs.


                                       15




<PAGE>

Total costs and expenses increased by $9,101,000, or 9.4%, from fiscal 2003 to
fiscal 2004. Increases in food costs, rent and payroll, as a result of the
increase in total revenues, contributed to this increase. Sales increases in
restaurants where the Company pays a percentage rent resulted in an increase in
percentage rent of $787,000 during fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003. Other
operating costs and expenses also increased in fiscal 2004 due to the increase
in total revenue and a one time charge of $270,000 used to pay for casino
entertainment tax liability. The Company had previously thought that certain of
its operations at the Venetian Hotel Resort Casino were exempt from casino
entertainment tax due to the fact that such operations were not on the casino
floor. As subsequent tax ruling by tax authorities determined that such
operations were subject to casino entertainment tax and the Company determined
to include such charge in other operating costs and expenses.

Total costs and expenses increased by $1,827,000, or 1.9%, from fiscal 2002 to
fiscal 2003. During the first quarter of fiscal 2002 rent concessions granted by
landlords in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 disaster were in place.
These concessions were not available during fiscal 2003 and as a result of this,
and other slight increases in rent levels, rent expense for fiscal 2003
increased by $291,000 when compared to fiscal 2002. Also, sales increases in
restaurants where the Company pays a percentage rent resulted in an increase in
percentage rent of $168,000 during fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002. During
fiscal 2003 advertising expenses increased by $623,000 over fiscal 2002 as a
result of increased advertising for the operations in Las Vegas. Maintenance
expenses increased by $548,000 during fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002. After
September 11, 2001 discretionary spending was sharply restricted. Though the
Company had continued to keep tight control over spending, maintenance of
restaurants has been performed when required and maintenance delayed during
fiscal 2002 has been completed.

Payroll expenses as a percentage of total revenues was 31.2% in fiscal 2004
compared to 32.3% in fiscal 2003 and 31.6% in fiscal 2002. Payroll expense was
$36,045,000, $33,176,000 and $32,084,000 in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. In fiscal 2003 and 2002, the Company had aggressively adapted its
cost structure in response to lower sales expectations following September 11th.
Due to the increase in sales during fiscal 2004, the Company had increased its
payroll expenses incrementally. The Company continually evaluates its payroll
expenses as they relate to sales.

No pre-opening expenses and early operating losses were incurred during fiscal
2004, 2003 or 2002. The Company did not open any new restaurants during fiscal
2003 and the Company received a construction and operating allowance from the
landlord for the Saloon at the Neonopolis Center at Freemont Street in downtown
Las Vegas, the one restaurant opened in fiscal 2002. The Company typically
incurs significant pre-opening expenses in connection with its new restaurants
that are expensed as incurred. Furthermore, it is not uncommon that such
restaurants experience operating losses during the early months of operation.

General and administrative expenses, as a percentage of total revenue, were 5.6%
in fiscal 2004, 6.5% in fiscal 2003 and 6.4% in fiscal 2002. The decrease in
these expenses as a percentage of total revenue during fiscal 2004 is primarily
due to increased total revenue during this period. General and administrative
expenses were adversely impacted by a $370,000 increase in casualty insurance
costs during fiscal 2002.

The Company managed two restaurants it did not own (The Saloon and El Rio
Grande) at October 2, 2004. The Company managed one restaurant it did not own
(El Rio Grande) at September 27, 2003 and September 28, 2002. Sales of El Rio
Grande, which are not included in consolidated sales, were $2,786,000 in fiscal
2004, $2,765,000 in fiscal 2003 and $2,973,000 in fiscal 2002. The Company's
lease of The Saloon is currently being converted into a management agreement,
effective as of August 22, 2004, whereby the Company will receive a management
fee of $7,000 per month, regardless of the results of operations of this
restaurant. The Company entered into agreements, during fiscal 2004, to manage
11 fast food restaurants located in the Hard Rock Casinos in Hollywood and
Tampa, Florida. Sales from these operations totaled $6,036,000 during the 2004
fiscal year.

Interest expense was $190,000 in fiscal 2004, $732,000 in fiscal 2003 and
$1,201,000 in fiscal 2002. The significant decreases during these periods was
due to lower outstanding borrowings on the Company's credit facility and the
benefit from rate decreases in the prime-borrowing rate. As of October 2, 2004,
the Company had no borrowings on its credit facility. Interest income was
$138,000 in fiscal 2004, $162,000 in fiscal 2003 and $133,000 in fiscal 2002.

Other income, which generally consists of purchasing service fees and other
income at various restaurants was $595,000, $973,000 and $461,000 for fiscal
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Other income was impacted during fiscal 2003
by the Company's receipt of $508,000 in World Trade Center Grants for four
restaurants located in downtown New York that were adversely impacted by the
September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.

Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes reflects Federal income taxes calculated on a
consolidated basis and state and local income taxes calculated by each New York
subsidiary on a non-consolidated basis. Most of the restaurants owned or managed
by the Company are owned or managed by a separate subsidiary.

For state and local income tax purposes, the losses incurred by a subsidiary may
only be used to offset that subsidiary's income, with the exception of the
restaurants operating in the District of Columbia. Accordingly, the Company's
overall effective tax rate has varied depending on the level of losses incurred
at individual subsidiaries. During fiscal 2002 the Company abandoned its
restaurant and food court operations at the Desert Passage, the retail complex
at the Aladdin Resort & Casino in Las Vegas. In fiscal 2002, the Company was
able to utilize the deferred tax asset created in fiscal 2001, by the impairment
of these operations. During the years ended September 27, 2003 and October 2,
2004, the Company decreased its allowance for the utilization of the deferred
tax asset arising from state and local operating loss carryforwards by $395,000
and $445,000 in such years based on the merger of certain unprofitable
subsidiaries into profitable ones.

The Company's overall effective tax rate in the future will be affected by
factors such as the level of losses incurred at the Company's New York
facilities, which cannot be consolidated for state and local tax purposes,
pre-tax income earned outside of New York City and the utilization of state and
local net operating loss carry forwards. Nevada has no state income tax and
other states in which the Company operates have income tax rates substantially
lower in comparison to New York. In order to utilize more effectively tax loss
carry forwards at restaurants that were unprofitable, the Company has merged
certain profitable subsidiaries with certain loss subsidiaries.

The Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1993 provides tax credits to the Company for
FICA taxes paid by the Company on tip income of restaurant service personnel.
The net benefit to the Company was $591,000 in fiscal 2004, $132,000 in fiscal
2003 and $755,000 in fiscal 2002.

During fiscal 2002, the Company and the Internal Revenue Service finalized the
adjustments to the Company's Federal income tax returns for fiscal years 1995
through 1998. The settlement did not have a material effect on the Company's
consolidated financial statements.

Liquidity and Sources of Capital

The Company's primary source of capital has been cash provided by operations and
funds available from its main bank, Bank Leumi USA. The Company from time to
time also utilizes equipment financing in connection with the construction of a
restaurant and seller financing in connection with the acquisition of a
restaurant. The Company utilizes capital primarily to fund the cost of
developing and opening new restaurants, acquiring existing restaurants owned by
others and remodeling existing restaurants owned by the Company.

The net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2004 of ($1,336,000) was
primarily used for the replacement of fixed assets at existing restaurants. The
net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2003 of ($1,434,000) was used
for the expansion of an existing restaurant in Las Vegas and for the replacement
of fixed assets at existing restaurants.

The net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2004 ($5,106,000), fiscal
2003 ($8,356,000) and fiscal 2002 ($8,072,000) was principally due to repayments
of long-term debt on the Company's main credit facility in excess of borrowings
on such facility.

The Company had a working capital surplus of $1,263,000 at October 2, 2004 as
compared to a working capital deficit of $4,802,000 at September 27, 2003. The
restaurant business does not require the maintenance of significant inventories
or receivables; thus the Company is able to operate with negative working
capital.

The Company's Revolving Credit and Term Loan Facility (the "Facility") with its
main bank (Bank Leumi USA), as amended in November 2001, December 2001, April
2002, and February 2003, included a $26,000,000 credit line to finance the
development and construction of new restaurants and for working capital purposes
at the Company's existing restaurants. On July 1, 2002, the Facility converted
into a term loan in the amount of $17,890,000 payable in 36 monthly installments
of approximately $497,000. Upon amendment in February 2003, the term loan was
converted into a revolving loan. The credit line was reduced to $11,500,000 on
June 29, 2003 and $8,500,000 on September 29, 2003 until the maturity date of
February 12, 2005. As of October 2, 2004, the Company had no borrowings on its
credit facility. The loan bears interest at 1/2% above the bank's prime rate.
The Facility also includes a $500,000 Letter of Credit Facility for use in lieu
of lease security deposits. The Company has delivered $354,000 in


                                       17




<PAGE>

irrevocable letters of credit on this Facility at October 2, 2004. The Company
generally is required to pay commissions of 1 1/2% per annum on outstanding
letters of credit.

The Company's subsidiaries each guaranteed the obligations of the Company under
the Facility and granted security interests in their respective assets as
collateral for such guarantees. In addition, the Company pledged stock of such
subsidiaries as security for obligations of the Company under such Facility.

The Facility includes restrictions relating to, among other things, indebtedness
for borrowed money, capital expenditures, mergers, sale of assets, dividends and
liens on the property of the Company. The Facility also requires the Company to
comply with certain financial covenants at the end of each quarter such as
minimum cash flow in relation to the Company's debt service requirements, ratio
of debt to equity, and the maintenance of minimum shareholders' equity.

During the year ended September 27, 2003, the Company violated covenants related
to a limitation on employee loans and maintaining minimum cash flow in relation
to the Company's debt service requirements. During the year ended October 2,
2004, the Company violated covenants related to a restriction on the payment of
dividends and maintaining minimum cash flow in relation to the Company's debt
service requirements. The Company received waivers from the bank for the
covenants it was not in compliance with, for the years ended September 27, 2003
and October 2, 2004 through December 31, 2004.

In April 2000, the Company borrowed $1,570,000 from its main bank at an interest
rate of 8.8% to refinance the purchase of various restaurant equipment at the
Venetian. The note which is payable in 60 equal monthly installments through May
2005, is secured by such restaurant equipment. At October 2, 2004 the Company
had $251,000 outstanding on this facility.

The Company entered into a sale and leaseback agreement with GE Capital for
$1,652,000 in November 2000 to refinance the purchase of various restaurant
equipment at its food and beverage facilities in a hotel and casino in Las
Vegas, Nevada. The lease bears interest at 8.65% per annum and is payable in 48
equal monthly installments of $32,000 until maturity in November 2004 at which
time the Company has an option to purchase the equipment for $519,000.
Alternatively, the Company can extend the lease for an additional 12 months at
the same monthly payment until maturity in November 2005 and repurchase the
equipment at such time for $165,000.

The Company originally accounted for this agreement as an operating lease and
did not record the assets or the lease liability in the financial statements.
During the year ended September 29, 2001, the Company recorded the entire amount
payable under the lease as a liability of $1,600,000 based on the anticipated
abandonment of the Aladdin operations. In 2002, the operations at the Aladdin
were abandoned and at October 2, 2004 $496,000 remained accrued in other current
liabilities representing future operating lease payments.

In September 2001, a subsidiary of the Company entered into a lease agreement
with World Entertainment Centers LLC regarding the leasing of premises at the
Neonopolis Center at Freemont Street for the restaurant Saloon. The Company
provided a lease guaranty ("Guaranty") to induce the landlord to enter into the
lease agreement. The Guaranty is for a term of two years from the date of the
opening of the Saloon, May 2002, and during the first year of the Guaranty was
in the amount of $350,000. Upon the first anniversary of the opening of the
Saloon, May 2003, the Guaranty was reduced to $175,000 and it expired in May
2004.

A quarterly cash dividend in the amount of $0.35 per share was declared and paid
beginning on November 1, 2004, resulting in a payment of $1,187,000 to
shareholders of record as of October 22, 2004. Prior to this, the Company has
not paid any cash dividends since its inception. The Company intends to continue
to pay such quarterly cash dividend for the foreseeable future.

Restaurant Expansion

The Company recently entered into agreements to operate a Gallagher's Steakhouse
restaurant and a separate bar, yet to be named, to be constructed in the Resorts
Atlantic City Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey.

Recent Restaurant Dispositions and Charges

In fiscal 2003, the Company determined that its restaurant, Lutece, located in
New York City, had been impaired by the events of September 11th and the
continued weakness in the economy. Based upon the sum of the future undiscounted
cash flows related to the Company's long-lived fixed assets at Lutece, the
Company determined that impairment had occurred. To estimate the fair value of
such long-lived fixed assets, for determining the impairment amount, the Company
used the expected present value of the future cash flows. The Company projected
continuing negative operating cash flow for the foreseeable future with no value
for subletting or assigning the lease for the premises. As a result, the Company
determined that there was no value to the long-lived fixed assets. The Company
had an investment of $667,000 in leasehold improvements, furniture fixtures and
equipment. The Company believed that these assets would have nominal value upon
disposal and recorded an impairment charge of $667,000 during fiscal 2003. Due
to continued weak sales, the Company closed Lutece during the second quarter of
2004. The Company recorded a net operating losses of $804,000 during the fiscal
year ended October 2, 2004 which is included in losses from discontinued
operations. The Company also incurred a one-time charge of $470,000 related to
pension plan contributions required in connection with the closing of Lutece
which is payable monthly over a nine year period beginning May 17, 2004 and
bears interest at a rate of 8% per annum.

On December 1, 2003, the Company sold a restaurant, Lorelei, for approximately
$850,000. The book value of inventory, fixed assets, intangible assets and
goodwill related to this entity was approximately $625,000. The Company recorded
a gain on the sale of approximately $225,000 during the first quarter of fiscal
2004 which is included in losses from discontinued operations. Net operating
losses of $145,000 were recorded in discontinued operations for fiscal 2004.
There were no additional expenses related to this restaurant during the fiscal
year ended October 2, 2004.

The Company's restaurant Ernie's, located on the upper west side of Manhattan,
opened in 1982. As a result of a steady decline in sales, the Company felt that
a new concept was needed at this location. The restaurant was closed June 16,
2003 and reopened in August 2003. Total conversion costs were approximately
$350,000. Sales at the new restaurant, La Rambla, failed to reach the level
sufficient to achieve the results the Company required. As a result, the Company
sold this restaurant on January 1, 2004 and realized a gain on the sale of this
restaurant of approximately $214,000. Net operating losses of $230,000 were
included in losses from discontinued operations for the fiscal year ended
October 2, 2004.

The Company's restaurant Jack Rose located on the west side of Manhattan has
experienced weak sales for several years. In addition, this restaurant did not
fit the Company's desired profile of being in a landmark destination location.
As a result, the Company sold this restaurant on February 23, 2004. The Company
realized a loss on the sale of this restaurant of $137,000 which was recorded
during the second quarter of fiscal 2004. The Company recorded net operating
losses of $148,000 during fiscal 2004 for this restaurant. These losses are
included in losses from discontinued operations.

The Company's restaurant America, located in New York City, has experienced
declining sales for several years. In March 2004, the Company entered into a new
lease for this restaurant at a significantly increased rent. The Company entered
into this lease with the belief that due to the location and the uniqueness of
the space the lease had value. During fiscal 2004 the Company identified a buyer
for this restaurant and is currently completing negotiations for its sale. The
carrying amount of the fixed assets held for sale was approximately $128,000 as
of October 2, 2004. Net income of $60,000 has been included in losses from
discontinued operations for fiscal 2004. The Company expects the sale of this
restaurant to be completed during the second quarter of fiscal 2005.

Critical Accounting Policies

Financial Reporting Release No. 60, published by the SEC, recommends that all
companies include a discussion of critical accounting policies used in the
preparation of their financial statements. The Company's significant accounting
policies are more fully described in Note 1 to the Company's consolidated
financial statements. While all these significant accounting policies impact its
financial condition and results of operations, the Company views certain of
these policies as critical. Policies determined to be critical are those
policies that have the most significant impact on the Company's consolidated
financial statements and require management to use a greater degree of judgment
and estimates. Actual results may differ from those estimates.

The Company believes that given current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely
that applying any other reasonable judgments or estimate methodologies would
cause a material effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations,
financial position or liquidity for the periods presented in this report.

Below are listed certain policies that management believes are critical:

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements requires the application of certain
accounting policies, which may require the Company to make estimates and
assumptions of future events. In the process of preparing its consolidated
financial statements, the Company estimates the appropriate carrying value of
certain assets and liabilities, which are not readily apparent from other
sources. The primary estimates underlying the Company's financial statements
include allowances for potential bad debts on accounts and notes receivable, the
useful lives and recoverability of its assets, such as property and intangibles,
fair values of financial instruments, the realizable value of its tax assets and
other matters. Management bases its estimates on certain assumptions, which they
believe are reasonable in the circumstances, and actual results could differ
from those estimates. Although management does not believe that any change in
those assumptions in the near term would have a material effect on the Company's
consolidated financial position or the results of operation, differences in
actual results could be material to the financial statements.

Long-Lived Assets

The Company annually assesses any impairment in value of long-lived assets to be
held and used. The Company evaluates the possibility of impairment by comparing
anticipated undiscounted cash flows to the carrying amount of the related
long-lived assets. If such cash flows are less than carrying value the Company
then reduces the asset to its fair value. Fair value is generally calculated
using discounted cash flows. Various factors such as sales growth and operating
margins and proceeds from a sale are part of this analysis. Future results could
differ from the Company's projections with a resulting adjustment to income in
such period.

Deferred Income Tax Valuation Allowance

The Company provides such allowance due to uncertainty that some of the deferred
tax amounts may not be realized. Certain items, such as state and local tax loss
carry forwards, are dependent on future earnings or the availability of tax
strategies. Future results could require an increase or decrease in the
valuation allowance and a resulting adjustment to income in such period.

Accounting for Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets


                                       20




<PAGE>

During 2001, the FASB issued FAS 142, which requires that for the Company,
effective September 28, 2002, goodwill, including the goodwill included in the
carrying value of investments accounted for using the equity method of
accounting, and certain other intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite
useful life, cease amortizing. FAS 142 requires that goodwill and certain
intangible assets be assessed for impairment using fair value measurement
techniques. Specifically, goodwill impairment is determined using a two-step
process. The first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify
potential impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit (the
Company is being treated as one reporting unit) with its net book value (or
carrying amount), including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit
exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not
impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary. If the
carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of
the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment
loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the
implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of
that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds
the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an
amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in
the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination.
That is, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets
and liabilities of that unit (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as
if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair
value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting
unit. The impairment test for other intangible assets consists of a comparison
of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. If the
carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment
loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.

Determining the fair value of the reporting unit under the first step of the
goodwill impairment test and determining the fair value of individual assets and
liabilities of the reporting unit (including unrecognized intangible assets)
under the second step of the goodwill impairment test is judgmental in nature
and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Similarly,
estimates and assumptions are used in determining the fair value of other
intangible assets. These estimates and assumptions could have a significant
impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the
magnitude of any such charge. To assist in the process of determining goodwill
impairment, the Company obtains appraisals from independent valuation firms. In
addition to the use of independent valuation firms, the Company performs
internal valuation analyses and considers other market information that is
publicly available. Estimates of fair value are primarily determined using
discounted cash flows and market comparisons and recent transactions. These
approaches use significant estimates and assumptions including projected future
cash flows (including timing), discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in
future cash flows, perpetual growth rate, determination of appropriate market
comparables and the determination of whether a premium or discount should be
applied to comparables. Based on the above policy, no impairment charge was
recorded upon adoption or during the fiscal years ended 2003 and 2004.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 123
(R), "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation." SFAS No. 123 (R) establishes
standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its
equity instruments for goods or services. This Statement focuses primarily on
accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in
share-based payment transactions. SFAS No. 123 (R) requires that the fair value
of such equity instruments be recognized as expense in the historical financial
statements as services are performed. Prior to SFAS No. 123 (R), only certain
pro forma disclosures of fair value were required. SFAS No. 123 (R) shall be
effective for public entities that do not file as small business issuers as of
the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after
June 15, 2005. The Company has not determined if the adoption of this new
accounting pronouncement is expected to have a material impact on the financial
statements of the Company for fiscal 2006.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Ark Restaurants Corp.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Ark Restaurants
Corp. and Subsidiaries as of October 2, 2004, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, shareholders' equity and cash flows for the year then
ended. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Ark
Restaurants Corp. and Subsidiaries as of October 2, 2004, and their consolidated
results of operations and cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

ARK RESTAURANTS CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEARS ENDED OCTOBER 2, 2004, SEPTEMBER 27, 2003 AND SEPTEMBER 28, 2002
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.   BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     Ark Restaurants Corp. and subsidiaries (the "Company") own and operate 22
     restaurants, 26 fast food concepts, catering operations and wholesale and
     retail bakeries. Nine restaurants are located in New York City, nine in Las
     Vegas, Nevada and four in Washington, D.C. The Las Vegas operations include
     three restaurants within the New York-New York Hotel & Casino Resort and
     operation of the resort's room service, banquet facilities, employee dining
     room and nine food court concepts. Four restaurants and bars are within the
     Venetian Casino Resort as well as four food court concepts; one restaurant
     is within the Forum Shops at Caesar's Shopping Center and one restaurant is
     in downtown Las Vegas at the Neonopolis Center. The Company also manages
     five fast food facilities in Tampa, Florida and eight fast food facilities
     in Hollywood, Florida, each at a Hard Rock Hotel and Casino owned by the
     Seminole Indian Tribe at these locations.

     Accounting Period -- The Company's fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest
     September 30. The fiscal year ended October 2, 2004 included 53 weeks. The
     fiscal years ended September 27, 2003, and September 28, 2002, included 52
     weeks.

     Significant Estimates -- In the process of preparing its consolidated
     financial statements, the Company estimates the appropriate carrying value
     of certain assets and liabilities which are not readily apparent from other
     sources. The primary estimates underlying the Company's financial
     statements include allowances for potential bad debts on long-term
     receivables, the useful lives and recoverability of its assets, such as
     property and intangibles, fair values of financial instruments, the
     realizable value of its tax assets and other matters. Management bases its
     estimates on certain assumptions, which they believe are reasonable in the
     circumstances, and while actual results could differ from those estimates,
     management does not believe that any change in those assumptions in the
     near term would have a material effect on the Company's consolidated
     financial statements.

     Principles of Consolidation -- The consolidated financial statements
     include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All
     significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
     consolidation.

     Cash Equivalents -- Cash equivalents include instruments with original
     maturities of three months or less.

     Accounts Receivable -- Accounts receivable is primarily composed of normal
     business receivables such as credit card receivables that are paid off in a
     short period of time. See Notes 16 and 17 for a discussion of related party
     receivables.

     Inventories -- Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in,
     first-out) or market, and consist of food and beverages, merchandise for
     sale and other supplies.


                                       F-7




<PAGE>

     Fixed Assets -- Leasehold improvements and furniture, fixtures and
     equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of furniture, fixtures and
     equipment (including equipment under capital leases) is computed using the
     straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective
     assets (three to seven years). Amortization of improvements to leased
     properties is computed using the straight-line method based upon the
     initial term of the applicable lease or the estimated useful life of the
     improvements, whichever is less, and ranges from 5 to 35 years.

     The Company includes in leasehold improvements in progress restaurants that
     are under construction. Once the projects have been completed the Company
     will begin amortizing the assets. Start-up costs incurred during the
     construction period of restaurants, including rental of premises, training
     and payroll, are expensed as incurred.

     The Company follows Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS")
     No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,
     which requires impairment losses to be recorded on long-lived assets used
     in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the
     undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less
     than the asset's carrying amount. In the evaluation of the fair value and
     future benefits of long-lived assets, the Company performs an analysis of
     the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows of the related
     long-lived assets. If the carrying value of the related asset exceeds the
     undiscounted cash flows, the carrying value is reduced to its fair value.
     Various factors including future sales growth and profit margins are
     included in this analysis. Management believes at this time that carrying
     values and useful lives continue to be appropriate.

     For the years ended October 2, 2004 and September 28, 2002, no impairment
     charges were deemed necessary. For the year ended September 27, 2003, an
     impairment charge of $667,000 was incurred on the restaurant Lutece (Note
     2).

     Intangible Assets and Goodwill -- As of September 29, 2002, the Company
     adopted the provisions for SFAS No. 142, Accounting for Goodwill and Other
     Intangible Assets, This statement requires that goodwill and intangible
     assets with indefinite lives no longer be amortized, but instead be tested
     for impairment at least annually and written down with a charge to
     operations when the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value. Prior
     to the adoption of SFAS No. 142, the Company amortized goodwill. The amount
     of such amortized goodwill was $3,515,000 as of September 28, 2002. In
     accordance with SFAS No. 142 the Company discontinued the amortization of
     goodwill effective September 29, 2002. Had the provisions of SFAS No. 142
     been in effect during the year ended September 28, 2002 a reduction of
     amortization expense in pretax income of $364,000 or an increase of $0.11
     in basic and diluted earnings per share would have been recorded. The
     Company has completed its annual impairment analysis as of October 2, 2004
     and has determined that there is no impairment of goodwill.

     Costs associated with acquiring leases and subleases, principally purchased
     leasehold rights, have been capitalized and are being amortized on the
     straight-line method based upon the initial terms of the applicable lease
     agreements, which range from 10 to 21 years.

     Covenants not to compete arising from restaurant acquisitions are amortized
     over the contractual period of five years.

     Amortization expense for intangible assets not including goodwill was
     $27,000, $15,000 and $39,000 for the years ended October 2, 2004, September
     27, 2003, and September 28, 2002, respectively.


                                       F-8




<PAGE>

     Other Assets -- Certain legal and bank commitment fees incurred in
     connection with the Company's Revolving Credit and Term Loan Facility, as
     discussed in Note 7, were capitalized as deferred financing fees and are
     being amortized over two years, the remaining term of the facility.

     Operating Lease Deferred Credit -- Several of the Company's operating
     leases contain predetermined increases in the rentals payable during the
     term of such leases. For these leases, the aggregate rental expense over
     the lease term is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease
     term. The excess of the expense charged to operations in any year and
     amounts payable under the leases during that year are recorded as a
     deferred credit. The deferred credit subsequently reverses over the lease
     term (Note 8).

     Occupancy Expenses -- Occupancy expenses include rent, rent taxes, real
     estate taxes, insurance and utility costs.

     Income Taxes -- Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and
     liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for
     future tax consequences attributable to the temporary differences between
     the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and
     their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
     Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
     expected to apply in the years in which those temporary differences are
     expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and
     liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that
     includes the enactment date. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation
     allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not
     that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

     Income Per Share of Common Stock -- Basic net income per share is computed
     in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS")
     No. 128, Earnings Per Share, and is calculated on the basis of the weighted
     average number of common shares outstanding during each period. Dilutive
     net income per share reflects the additional dilutive effect of potentially
     dilutive shares (principally those arising from the assumed exercise of
     stock options).

     Stock Options -- The Company accounts for its stock options granted to
     employees under the intrinsic value-based method for employee stock-based
     compensation and provides pro forma disclosure of net income and earnings
     per share as if the accounting provision of Statement of Financial
     Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
     ("SFAS No. 123") had been adopted. The Company generally does not grant
     options to outsiders.

     SFAS No. 123 requires the Company to disclose pro forma net income and pro
     forma earnings per share information for employee stock option grants to
     employees as if the fair-value method defined in SFAS No. 123 had been
     applied. The Company utilized the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to
     quantify the pro forma effects on net income and earnings per share of all
     options granted. There were no options granted during fiscal 2004 and 2003
     and no charges to operations for options issued to employees during fiscal
     2004, 2003 and 2002.

     In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148
     ("SFAS No. 148") and SFAS 123, the Company's pro forma option expense is
     computed using Black-Scholes option pricing model. To comply with SFAS 148,
     the Company is presenting the following table to illustrate the effect on
     the net income and income per share if it had applied the fair value
     recognition provisions of SFAS 123, as amended, to options granted under
     the stock-based employee compensation plan. For purposes of this pro forma
     disclosure, the estimated value of the options is amortized ratably to
     expense over the options' vesting periods.

     The weighted-average assumptions which were used for options granted in
     fiscal 2002 included a risk free interest rate of 4.25% and volatility of
     35%. An expected life of four years was used. No annual dividend yield was
     assumed. The weighted average grant date fair value of options granted and
     outstanding during fiscal 2002 was $2.05.

     Reclassifications -- Certain reclassifications of prior year balances have
     been made to conform with current year presentation.

2.   RECENT RESTAURANT DISPOSITIONS

     In fiscal 2003, the Company determined that its restaurant, Lutece, located
     in New York City, had been impaired by the events of September 11th and the
     continued weakness in the economy. Based upon the sum of the future
     undiscounted cash flows related to the Company's long-lived fixed assets at
     Lutece, the Company determined that impairment had occurred. To estimate
     the fair value of such long-lived fixed assets, for determining the
     impairment amount, the Company used the expected present value of the
     future cash flows. The Company projected continuing negative operating cash
     flow for the foreseeable future with no value for subletting or assigning
     the lease for the premises. As a result, the Company determined that there
     was no value to the long-lived fixed assets. The Company had an investment
     of $667,000 in leasehold improvements, furniture fixtures and equipment.
     The Company believed that these assets would have nominal value upon
     disposal and recorded an impairment charge of $667,000 during fiscal 2003.
     Due to continued weak sales, the Company closed Lutece during the second
     quarter of 2004. The Company recorded net operating losses of $804,000 for
     Lutece during the fiscal year ended October 2, 2004 which are included in
     losses from discontinued operations. In 2004 the Company also incurred a
     one-time charge of $470,000 related to pension plan contributions required
     in connection with the closing of Lutece which is payable monthly over a
     nine year period beginning May 17, 2004 and bears interest at a rate of 8%
     per annum.

     On December 1, 2003, the Company sold a restaurant, Lorelei, for
     approximately $850,000. The book value of inventory, fixed assets,
     intangible assets and goodwill related to this entity was approximately
     $625,000. The Company recorded a gain on the sale of approximately $225,000
     during the first quarter


                                       F-10




<PAGE>

     of fiscal 2004 which is included in losses from discontinued operations.
     Net operating losses of $145,000 were recorded in discontinued operations
     in fiscal 2004. There were no additional expenses related to this
     restaurant during the fiscal year ended October 2, 2004.

     The Company's restaurant Ernie's, located on the upper west side of
     Manhattan opened in 1982. As a result of a steady decline in sales, the
     Company felt that a new concept was needed at this location. The restaurant
     was closed June 16, 2003 and reopened in August 2003. Total conversion
     costs were approximately $350,000. Sales at the new restaurant, La Rambla,
     failed to reach the level sufficient to achieve the results the Company
     required. As a result, the Company sold this restaurant on January 1, 2004
     and realized a gain on the sale of this restaurant of approximately
     $214,000. Net operating losses of $230,000 were included in losses from
     discontinued operations for the fiscal year ended October 2, 2004.

          The Company's restaurant Jack Rose located on the west side of
     Manhattan has experienced weak sales for several years. In addition, this
     restaurant did not fit the Company's desired profile of being in a landmark
     destination location. As a result, the Company sold this restaurant on
     February 23, 2004. The Company realized a loss on the sale of this
     restaurant of $137,000 which was recorded during the second quarter of
     fiscal 2004. The Company recorded net operating losses of $148,000 during
     fiscal 2004 for this restaurant. These losses are included in losses from
     discontinued operations.

          The Company's restaurant America, located in New York City, has
     experienced declining sales for several years. In March 2004, the Company
     entered into a new lease for this restaurant at a significantly increased
     rent. The Company entered into this lease with the belief that due to the
     location and the uniqueness of the space the lease had value. During fiscal
     2004 the Company identified a buyer for this restaurant and is currently
     completing negotiations for its sale. The carrying amount of the net assets
     held for sale was approximately $128,000 as of October 2, 2004. Net income
     of $60,000 has been included in losses from discontinued operations for
     fiscal 2004. The Company expects the sale of this restaurant to be
     completed during the second quarter of fiscal 2005.

          In accordance with SFAS No. 144, all prior years included in the
     accompanying consolidated statements of operations and cash flows have been
     reclassified to separately show the results of operations and cash flows of
     these discontinued operations. Total revenues of these discontinued
     operations were $6,501,000, $13,860,000 and $14,968,000 in fiscal 2004,
     2003 and 2002, respectively.

     (a)  In December 1996, the Company sold a restaurant for $900,000. Cash of
          $50,000 was received on sale and the balance is due in installments
          through December 2006.

     (b)  In October 1997, the Company sold a restaurant for $1,750,000, of
          which $200,000 was paid in cash and the balance is due in monthly
          installments under the terms of two notes bearing interest at a rate
          of 7.5%. One note, with an initial principal balance of $400,000, was
          paid in 24 monthly installments of $19,000 through April 2000. The
          second note, with an initial principal balance of $1,150,000, will be
          paid in 104 monthly installments of $15,000 commencing May 2000 and
          ending December 2008. At December 2008, the then outstanding balance
          of $519,000 matures.

          The Company recognized a gain of approximately $585,000 in the fiscal
          year ended September 27, 2003 in connection with the sale of this
          restaurant. The gain recognized reflected the realization of a gain
          that had been deferred originally due to the length of the note and
          the substantial balance due upon maturity ($519,000). A review of the
          performance of this note and the security underlying it has lead
          management to conclude that the full amount will likely be collected
          and, accordingly, the note no longer requires a reserve. Consequently,
          the Company eliminated this reserve and included the amount in
          revenue, in other income, for the year ended September 27, 2003. As a
          result of the reclassification of discontinued operations this gain is
          included in losses from discontinued operations for fiscal 2003.

     (c)  In June 2000, the Company sold this restaurant for $438,000. Cash of
          $188,000 was received on sale and the balance was due in installments
          through June 2006. In February 2001, the buyer defaulted and the
          Company took possession of this restaurant and sold it to another
          party in June 2002. The total price was $270,000, cash of $145,000 was
          received on sale and the balance is due in installments through
          December 2007.

          The Company recognized a gain during the year ended September 28, 2002
          of $105,000, the net of funds received from the buyer and the
          outstanding $165,000 note which was written down on the default.

     The carrying value of the Company's long-term receivables approximates
     their current aggregate fair value.

          monthly installments of $32,439 inclusive of interest, until maturity
          in May 2005.


                                      F-14




<PAGE>

     (b)  As of October 2, 2004, the Company's Revolving Credit and Term Loan
          Facility (the "Facility") with its main bank (Bank Leumi USA),
          included a $8,500,000 credit line to finance the development and
          construction of new restaurants and for working capital purposes at
          the Company's existing restaurants. The credit line has a maturity
          date of February 12, 2005. The Company had no borrowings outstanding
          on the Facility at October 2, 2004. Borrowings on the Facility bear
          interest at 1/2% above the bank's prime rate. The Facility also
          includes a $500,000 letter of credit facility for use in lieu of lease
          security deposits. The Company had delivered $354,000 in irrevocable
          letters of credit on this Facility. The Company generally is required
          to pay commissions of 1 1/2% per annum on outstanding letters of
          credit.

          The Company's subsidiaries each guaranteed the obligations of the
          Company under the foregoing Facility and granted security interests in
          their respective assets as collateral for such guarantees. In
          addition, the Company pledged stock of such subsidiaries as security
          for obligations of the Company under such Facility.

          The Facility includes restrictions relating to, among other things,
          indebtedness for borrowed money, capital expenditures, mergers, sale
          of assets, dividends and liens on the property of the Company. The
          Facility also requires the Company to comply with certain financial
          covenants at the end of each quarter such as minimum cash flow in
          relation to the Company's debt service requirements, ratio of debt to
          equity, and the maintenance of minimum shareholders' equity. In
          December 2001 and April 2002, certain covenants in the Facility were
          modified for fiscal 2002 and beyond. The Company violated a covenant
          related to a limitation on cash flow during the quarter ended October
          2, 2004. The Company received a waiver through December 31, 2004 from
          Bank Leumi USA for the covenant with which it was not in compliance.
          The Company has historically received waivers for any covenant
          violation.

          In September 2001, a subsidiary of the Company entered into a lease
          agreement with World Entertainment Centers LLC regarding the leasing
          of premises at the Neonopolis Center at Freemont Street in Las Vegas,
          Nevada for the restaurant Saloon. The Company provided a lease
          guaranty ("Guaranty") to induce the landlord to enter into the lease
          agreement. The Guaranty was for a term of two years from the date of
          the opening of the Saloon, May 2002, and during the first year of the
          Guaranty was in the amount of $350,000. Upon the first anniversary of
          the opening of the Saloon, May 2003, the Guaranty was reduced to
          $175,000 and expired in May 2004.

8.   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

     Leases--The Company leases its restaurants, bar facilities, and
     administrative headquarters through its subsidiaries under terms expiring
     at various dates through 2025. Most of the leases provide for the payment
     of base rents plus real estate taxes, insurance and other expenses and, in
     certain instances, for the payment of a percentage of the restaurants'
     sales in excess of stipulated amounts at such facility.

     As of October 2, 2004, future minimum lease payments, net of sublease
     rentals, under noncancelable leases are as follows:

</TABLE>

     In connection with the leases included in the table above, the Company
     obtained and delivered irrevocable letters of credit in the aggregate
     amount of $354,000 as security deposits under such leases.

     Rent expense was $12,104,000, $11,027,000 and $10,737,000 during the fiscal
     years ended October 2, 2004, September 27, 2003 and September 28, 2002,
     respectively. Contingent rentals, included in rent expense, were
     $4,153,000, $3,366,000 and $3,198,000 for the fiscal years ended October 2,
     2004, September 27, 2003 and September 28, 2002, respectively.

     In August 2004, the Company entered into a lease agreement to operate a
     Gallagher's Steakhouse and separate bar, yet to be named, at the Resorts
     International Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey. The landlord
     has agreed to contribute up to $3,000,000 towards the construction of these
     facilities which the Company believes will be sufficient to complete
     construction. The restaurant and bar are scheduled to open in July 2005.
     The future minimum lease payments from these lease agreements are included
     in the above schedule.

     Legal Proceedings--In the ordinary course of its business, the Company is a
     party to various lawsuits arising from accidents at its restaurants and
     worker's compensation claims, which are generally handled by the Company's
     insurance carriers.

     The employment by the Company of management personnel, waiters, waitresses
     and kitchen staff at a number of different restaurants has resulted in the
     institution, from time to time, of litigation alleging violation by the
     Company of employment discrimination laws. The Company does not believe
     that any of such suits will have a materially adverse effect upon the
     Company's consolidated financial statements or operations.

     Several unfair labor practice charges were filed against the Company in
     1997 with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) with respect to the
     Company's Las Vegas subsidiary. The charges were heard in October 1997. At
     issue was whether the Company unlawfully terminated nine employees and
     disciplined six other employees allegedly in retaliation for their union
     activities. An Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) found that six employees were
     terminated unlawfully, three were discharged for valid reasons, four
     employees were disciplined lawfully and two employees were disciplined
     unlawfully. On appeal, the NLRB found that the Company lawfully disciplined
     five employees, and unlawfully disciplined one employee. The Company
     appealed the adverse rulings of the NLRB to the D.C. Circuit Court of
     Appeals. In July 2003, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the
     determinations of the NLRB. The Company offered to reinstate the employees
     during fiscal 2004 and they refused. The Company incurred no liability as a
     result.

12.  INCOME TAXES

     The provision for income taxes reflects Federal income taxes calculated on
     a consolidated basis and state and local income taxes calculated by each
     subsidiary on a nonconsolidated basis. For New York State and City income
     tax purposes, the losses incurred by a subsidiary may only be used to
     offset that subsidiary's income.

     The provision (benefit) for income taxes attributable to continuing and
     discontinued operations consists of the following:

     A valuation allowance for deferred taxes is required if, based on the
     evidence, it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets
     will not be realized. The Company believes that uncertainty exists with
     respect to future realization of certain operating loss carryforwards and
     operating lease deferred credits. Therefore, the Company provided a
     valuation allowance of $486,000 at October 2, 2004, $900,000 at September
     27, 2003 and $1,031,000 at September 28, 2002. The Company decreased its
     allowance for the utilization of the deferred tax asset arising from state
     and local operating loss carryforwards by $395,000 and $445,000 for the
     years ended October 2, 2004 and September 27, 2003,

     respectively, based on the merger of certain unprofitable subsidiaries into
     profitable ones. The Company has state operating loss carryforwards of
     $27,371,000, which expire in the years 2004 through 2018.

     During the fiscal year ended September 27, 2003, the Company and the
     Internal Revenue Service finalized the adjustments to the Company's Federal
     income tax returns for the fiscal years ended September 30, 1995 through
     October 3, 1998. The final adjustments primarily relate to: (i) legal and
     accounting expenses incurred in connection with new or acquired restaurants
     that the Internal Revenue Service asserts should have been capitalized and
     amortized rather than currently expensed and (ii) travel and meal expenses
     for which the Internal Revenue Service asserts the Company did not comply
     with certain record keeping requirements or the Internal Revenue Code.
     These settlements did not have a material effect on the Company's financial
     condition.
