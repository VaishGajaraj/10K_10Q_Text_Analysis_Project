</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Arkansas Best Corporation (the &#147;Company&#148;), a Delaware corporation, is a holding company engaged
through its subsidiaries primarily in motor carrier transportation operations. The principal
subsidiaries of the Company are ABF Freight System, Inc. (&#147;ABF&#148;) and FleetNet America, Inc.
(&#147;FleetNet&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Historical Background</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company was publicly owned from 1966 until 1988, when it was acquired in a leveraged buyout by
a corporation organized by Kelso &#038; Company, L.P. (&#147;Kelso&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In 1992, the Company completed a public offering of its Common Stock, par value $.01 (the &#147;Common
Stock&#148;). The Company also repurchased substantially all of the remaining shares of Common Stock
beneficially owned by Kelso, thus ending Kelso&#146;s investment in the Company.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In 1993, the Company completed a public offering of 1,495,000 shares of $2.875 Series&nbsp;A Cumulative
Convertible Exchangeable Preferred Stock (&#147;Preferred Stock&#148;). The Company&#146;s Preferred Stock was
traded on The Nasdaq National Market (&#147;Nasdaq&#148;) under the symbol &#147;ABFSP.&#148; On July&nbsp;10, 2000, the
Company purchased 105,000 shares of its Preferred Stock at $37.375 per share, for a total cost of
$3.9&nbsp;million. All of the shares purchased were retired. On August&nbsp;13, 2001, the Company announced
the call for redemption of the 1,390,000 shares of Preferred Stock that remained outstanding. At
the end of the extended redemption period on September&nbsp;14, 2001, 1,382,650 shares of the Preferred
Stock were converted to 3,511,439 shares of Common Stock. A total of 7,350 shares of Preferred
Stock were redeemed at the redemption price of $50.58 per share. The Company paid $0.4&nbsp;million to
the holders of these shares in redemption of their Preferred Stock. The Company delisted its
Preferred Stock trading on Nasdaq under the symbol &#147;ABFSP&#148; on September&nbsp;12, 2001, eliminating the
Company&#146;s annual dividend requirement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In August&nbsp;1995, pursuant to a tender offer, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company purchased the
outstanding shares of common stock of WorldWay Corporation (&#147;WorldWay&#148;), at a price of $11 per
share (the &#147;Acquisition&#148;). WorldWay was a publicly held company engaged through its subsidiaries in
motor carrier operations. The total purchase price of WorldWay amounted to approximately $76.0
million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In 1999, the Company acquired 2,457,000 shares of Treadco, Inc. common stock for $23.7&nbsp;million via
a cash tender offer pursuant to a definitive merger agreement. As a result of the transaction,
Treadco became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. On September&nbsp;13, 2000, Treadco entered
into a joint venture agreement with The Goodyear Tire &#038; Rubber Company (&#147;Goodyear&#148;) to contribute
its business to a new limited liability company called Wingfoot Commercial Tire Systems, LLC
(&#147;Wingfoot&#148;). On April&nbsp;28, 2003, the Company sold its 19.0% ownership interest in Wingfoot to
Goodyear for $71.3&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On August&nbsp;1, 2001, the Company sold the stock of G.I. Trucking Company, a wholly owned subsidiary
of the Company, for $40.5&nbsp;million to a company formed by the senior executives of G.I. Trucking
Company and Estes Express Lines.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">LTL carriers service shipping customers by transporting a wide variety of large and small shipments
to geographically dispersed destinations. Typically, shipments are picked up at customers&#146; places
of business and consolidated at a local terminal. Shipments are consolidated by destination for
transportation by intercity units to their destination cities or to distribution centers. At
distribution centers, shipments from various terminals can be reconsolidated for other distribution
centers or, more typically, local terminals. Once delivered to a local terminal, a shipment is
delivered to the customer by local trucks operating from the terminal. In some cases, when one
large shipment or a sufficient number of different shipments at one origin terminal are going to a
common destination, they can be combined to make a full trailer load. A trailer is then dispatched
to that destination without re-handling. In addition to its traditional LTL long-haul model, the
Company has implemented a regional network to facilitate next-day and second-day delivery in the
eastern two-thirds of the United States. Development and

regional network, which is known as the Regional Performance Model (&#147;RPM&#148;), is enabled by added
work-rule flexibility, strategically positioned freight exchange points and increased door capacity

and as a result, increases service reliability and provides customers a single source for their
national, inter-regional and regional transportation needs.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Competition, Pricing and Industry Factors</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The trucking industry is highly competitive. The Company&#146;s LTL motor carrier subsidiaries actively
compete for freight business with other national, regional and local motor carriers and, to a
lesser extent, with private carriage, freight forwarders, railroads and airlines. Competition is
based primarily on personal relationships, price and service. In general, most of the principal
motor carriers use similarly structured tariffs to rate less-than-truckload shipments. Competition
for freight revenue, however, has resulted in discounting which effectively reduces prices paid by
shippers. In an effort to maintain and improve its market share, the Company&#146;s LTL motor carrier
subsidiaries offer and negotiate various discounts. ABF charges a fuel surcharge based upon changes
in diesel fuel prices compared to a national index.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The trucking industry, including the Company&#146;s LTL motor carrier subsidiaries, is directly affected
by the state of the manufacturing and retail sectors of the North American economy. The trucking
industry faces rising costs including government regulations on safety, equipment design and
maintenance, driver utilization and fuel economy. The trucking industry is dependent upon the
availability of adequate fuel supplies. The Company has not experienced a lack of available fuel
but could be adversely impacted if a fuel shortage were to develop. In addition, seasonal
fluctuations also affect tonnage to be transported. Freight shipments, operating costs and earnings
also are affected adversely by inclement weather conditions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">ABF competes with nonunion and union LTL carriers. Competitors include Yellow Transportation and
Roadway Express, (operated by YRC Worldwide, Inc.), FedEx Freight (operated by FedEx Corporation),
UPS Freight (operated by UPS, Inc.), Con-Way, Inc., Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc. and Saia, Inc.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On August&nbsp;19, 2005, the U.S. Department of Transportation (&#147;DOT&#148;) issued new rules regulating work
and sleep schedules for commercial truck drivers. The new rules replaced Hours-of-Service
Regulations that were updated in 2003. The new rules, which were effective October&nbsp;1, 2005, reduced
the number of hours a driver can be on duty from 15 to 14 but increased the number of driving
hours, during that tour of duty, from 10 to 11. In addition, the rules require the rest period
between driving tours to be 10 hours as opposed to 8. The rules also provide for a &#147;restart&#148;
provision, which states that a driver can be on duty for 70 hours in 8&nbsp;days, but if the driver has
34 consecutive hours off duty for any reason, the driver &#147;restarts&#148; at zero hours. The operational
impact of these rules on ABF&#146;s over-the-road linehaul relay network has been modest and includes a
small decline in driver and equipment utilization, offset by the opportunity to further improve
transit times. The rules have limited impact on LTL carriers, such as ABF, whose pickup, linehaul
and delivery operations typically are performed by different drivers. Impacts on the truckload
industry have been more significant, including a decline in driver utilization and flexibility and
an exacerbation of a nationwide driver shortage. As a result, truckload carriers have increased
driver pay, raised customer prices and increased charges for stop-off and detention services,
making LTL carriers more competitive on many larger shipments.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Generally, claims exposure in the motor carrier industry consists of cargo loss and damage,
third-party casualty and workers&#146; compensation. The Company&#146;s motor carrier subsidiaries are
effectively self-insured for the first $1.0&nbsp;million of each cargo loss, $1.0&nbsp;million of each
workers&#146; compensation loss and generally $1.0&nbsp;million of each third-party casualty loss. The
Company maintains insurance which it believes is adequate to cover losses in excess of such
self-insured amounts. However, the Company has experienced situations where excess insurance
carriers have become insolvent (see Note P to the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements). The
Company pays premiums to state guaranty funds in states where it has workers&#146; compensation
self-insurance authority. In some of these self-insured states, depending on each state&#146;s rules,
the guaranty funds will pay excess claims if the insurer cannot due to insolvency. However, there
can be no certainty of the solvency of individual state guaranty funds (see Note P to the Company&#146;s
consolidated financial statements). The Company has been able to obtain what it believes to be
adequate coverage for 2007 and is not aware of problems in the foreseeable future which would
significantly impair its ability to obtain adequate coverage at market rates for its motor carrier
operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Since 2001, ABF has been subject to cargo security and transportation regulations issued by the
Transportation Security Administration. Since 2002, ABF has been subject to regulations issued by
the Department of Homeland Security. ABF is not able to accurately predict how past or future
events will affect government regulations and the transportation industry. ABF believes that any
additional security measures that may be required by future regulations could result in additional
costs; however, other carriers would be similarly affected.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Headquartered in Fort Smith, Arkansas, ABF is the largest subsidiary of the Company. ABF accounted
for 97.3% of the Company&#146;s consolidated revenues for 2006. ABF is one of North America&#146;s largest
LTL motor carriers and provides direct service to over 97% of the cities in the United States
having a population of 25,000 or more. ABF provides interstate and intrastate direct service to
more than 47,000 communities through 289 service centers in all 50 states, Canada and Puerto Rico.
Through relationships with trucking companies in Mexico, ABF provides motor carrier services to
customers in that country as well. ABF has been in continuous service since 1923. ABF was
incorporated in Delaware in 1982 and is the successor to Arkansas Motor Freight, a business
originally organized in 1935. Arkansas Motor Freight was the successor to a business originally
organized in 1923.

standard, expedited and guaranteed LTL services. General commodities include all freight except
hazardous waste, dangerous explosives, commodities of exceptionally high value and commodities in
bulk. ABF&#146;s shipments of general commodities differ from shipments of bulk raw materials, which are
commonly transported by railroad, pipeline and water carrier.

furniture, appliances, chemicals, nonbulk petroleum products, rubber, plastics, metal and metal
products, wood, glass, automotive parts, machinery and miscellaneous manufactured products. During
the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006, no single customer accounted for more than 3.0% of ABF&#146;s

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">At December&nbsp;31, 2006, ABF had a total of 12,235 active employees. Employee compensation and
related costs are the largest components of ABF&#146;s operating expenses. In 2006, such costs amounted
to 58.9% of ABF&#146;s revenues. Approximately 77% of ABF&#146;s employees are covered under a collective
bargaining agreement with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (&#147;IBT&#148;). On March&nbsp;28, 2003,
the IBT announced the ratification of its National Master Freight Agreement (the &#147;National
Agreement&#148;) with the Motor Freight Carriers Association (&#147;MFCA&#148;) by its membership. Carrier
members of MFCA, including ABF, ratified the agreement on the same date. Effective October&nbsp;1,
2005, the MFCA was dissolved and replaced by Trucking Management, Inc. (&#147;TMI&#148;). ABF is a member of
TMI. The collective bargaining agreement has a five-year term and was effective April&nbsp;1, 2003. The
agreement provides for annual contractual wage and benefit increases of approximately 3.2% &#150; 3.4%,
subject to wage rate cost-of-living adjustments. Under the terms of the National Agreement, ABF is
required to contribute to various multiemployer pension plans maintained for the benefit of its
employees who are members of the IBT. Amendments to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974 (&#147;ERISA&#148;), pursuant to the Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980 (the &#147;MPPA
Act&#148;), substantially expanded the potential liabilities of employers who participate in such
plans. Under ERISA, as amended by the MPPA Act, an employer who contributes to a multiemployer
pension plan and the members of such employer&#146;s controlled group are jointly and severally liable
for their proportionate share of the plan&#146;s unfunded liabilities in the event the employer ceases
to have an obligation to contribute to the plan or substantially reduces its contributions to the
plan (i.e., in the event of plan termination or withdrawal by the Company from the multiemployer
plans). See Note J to the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements for more specific
disclosures regarding the multiemployer plans. Negotiations on a new agreement to replace the
National Agreement are expected to begin prior to its expiration on March&nbsp;31, 2008, and among the
issues expected to be addressed are annual contractual wage and benefit increases, as well as
contributions to the various multiemployer benefit and pension plans.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Three of the largest LTL carriers are unionized and generally pay comparable amounts for wages and
benefits. Union companies typically have comparable wage costs and significantly higher fringe
benefit costs than non-union companies. The Company believes that union companies also experience
lower employee turnover and higher productivity compared to some nonunion firms. Due to its
national reputation, its working conditions and its wages and benefits, ABF has not historically
experienced any significant long-term difficulty in attracting or retaining qualified employees,
although short-term difficulties are encountered in certain situations.

restrictions on large trucks. Although many companies will be adversely affected by any slowdown in
the availability of freight transportation, the negative impact could affect our business

driving personnel than union carriers. However, we believe that we have lower turnover rates and
higher labor efficiency rates than some of our competitors. Our competitors could reduce their
freight rates to gain market share, especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy.
This could limit our ability to maintain or increase freight rates, maintain our operating margins
or grow tonnage levels.

expected to be generated from these service initiatives may be impacted by actions of our
competitors. Depending on the timing and level of revenues generated from these service
initiatives, our results of operations and cash flows may be negatively impacted.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>We depend heavily on the availability of fuel for our trucks. Fuel shortages, increases in fuel
costs and the inability to collect fuel surcharges or obtain sufficient fuel supplies could have a
material adverse effect on our operating results.</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Fuel prices have fluctuated significantly in recent years. However, consistent with industry
practice, we charge a fuel surcharge based on changes in diesel fuel prices compared to a national
index. Customer acceptance of the fuel surcharges has been good; however, we cannot be certain that
collection of fuel surcharges will continue in the future. Although fuel costs increased
significantly in recent years, increased revenues from diesel fuel surcharges more than offset
these higher diesel fuel costs. We have experienced cost increases in other operating costs as a
result of increased fuel prices. However, the total impact of higher energy prices on other
non-fuel-related expenses is difficult to ascertain. As diesel fuel prices decline, the fuel
surcharge and associated direct diesel fuel costs also decline by different degrees. Depending upon
the rates of these declines and the impact on costs in other fuel and energy-related areas,
operating margins could be negatively impacted. However, lower fuel surcharge levels may, over
time, improve ABF&#146;s ability to increase other elements of margin, since the total price is governed
by market
forces, although there can be no assurances in this regard. We do not have any long-term

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We have significant ongoing capital requirements. If we were not able to generate sufficient cash
from operations in the future, our growth could be limited, we could have to utilize our existing
financing arrangements to a greater extent or enter into additional leasing arrangements, or our
revenue equipment may have to be held for longer periods, which would result in increased
maintenance costs. If these situations occurred, there could be an adverse effect on our
profitability.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Increased prices for new revenue equipment and decreases in the value of used revenue equipment
could adversely affect our earnings and cash flows.</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Manufacturers have raised the prices of new equipment significantly, in part, to offset their costs
of compliance with new EPA tractor engine design requirements intended to reduce emissions. The
initial requirements took effect October&nbsp;1, 2002, and more restrictive EPA engine design
requirements became effective on January&nbsp;1, 2007. Further equipment price increases may result from
these requirements. If new equipment prices increase more than anticipated, we could incur higher
depreciation and rental expenses than anticipated. If we were unable to offset any such increases
in expenses with freight rate increases, our results of operations could be adversely affected. If
the market value of revenue equipment being used in our operations were to decrease, we could incur
impairment losses and our cash flows could be adversely affected.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>The engines used in our newer tractors are subject to new emissions-control regulations, which
could substantially increase operating expenses.</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Tractor engines that comply with the EPA emission-control design requirements that took effect on
January&nbsp;1, 2007 are generally less fuel-efficient and may result in increased maintenance costs
than engines in tractors manufactured before these requirements became effective. If we are unable
to offset resulting increases in fuel expenses or maintenance costs with higher freight rates, our
results of operations could be adversely affected.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Decreases in the availability of new tractors and trailers could have a material adverse effect on
our operating results.</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">From time to time, some tractor and trailer vendors have reduced their manufacturing output due,
for example, to lower demand for their products in economic downturns or a shortage of component
parts. As conditions changed, some of those vendors have had difficulty fulfilling any increased
demand for new equipment. Also, vendors must meet the new EPA emission-control design requirements
that took effect on January&nbsp;1, 2007, possibly leading to
tractor shortages. An inability to continue to obtain an adequate supply of new tractors or
trailers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

$1.0&nbsp;million for each cargo loss and generally $1.0&nbsp;million for each third-party casualty loss. For
medical benefits, we self-insure up to $150,000 per person, per claim year. We maintain insurance
for liabilities above the amounts of self-insurance to certain limits. If the frequency and/or
severity of claims increase, our operating results could be adversely affected. The timing of the
incurrence of these costs could significantly and adversely impact our operating results compared
to prior periods. In addition, if we were to lose our ability to self-insure for any significant
period of time, insurance costs could materially increase and we could experience difficulty in
obtaining adequate levels of insurance coverage in that event.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Various federal and state agencies exercise broad regulatory powers over the transportation
business, generally governing such activities as authorization to engage in motor carrier
operations, safety, insurance requirements and financial reporting. We could also become subject to
new or more restrictive regulations, such as regulations relating to fuel emissions, drivers&#146; hours
of service or ergonomics. Compliance with such regulations could substantially reduce equipment
productivity, and the costs of compliance could increase our operating expenses.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On August&nbsp;19, 2005, the DOT issued new rules regulating work and sleep schedules for commercial
truck drivers. The new rules replaced Hours-of-Service Regulations that were last updated in 2003.
The new rules, which were effective October&nbsp;1, 2005, have had a minimal impact upon our operations.
However, future changes in these rules could materially and adversely affect our operating
efficiency and increase costs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our drivers and dockworkers also must comply with the safety and fitness regulations promulgated by
the DOT, including those relating to drug and alcohol testing and hours of service. The

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Most of ABF&#146;s union employees are covered under a collective bargaining agreement with the IBT.
This agreement expires in March&nbsp;2008. Negotiations on a new agreement are expected to begin prior
to March&nbsp;2008. If an agreement is not reached before the expiration of the current agreement, we
could be faced with a union workforce disruption or stoppage and, as a result, our results of
operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We compete against both union and nonunion LTL carriers. Union companies typically have somewhat
higher wage costs and significantly higher fringe benefit costs than nonunion companies. Union
companies typically experience lower employee turnover and higher productivity compared to some
nonunion companies. Due to our national reputation, our working conditions and wages and benefits,
we have not historically experienced any significant long-term difficulty in attracting or
retaining qualified drivers, although short-term difficulties have been encountered in certain
situations, such as periods of significant increases in tonnage levels. Difficulty in attracting
and retaining qualified drivers or increases in compensation or fringe benefit costs could affect
our profitability and our ability to grow. If we were unable to continue to attract and retain
qualified drivers, we could incur higher driver recruiting expenses or a loss of business.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>We could be obligated to make significant payments to cover withdrawal liabilities to multiemployer
pension plans if we were to cease making our contractual monthly contributions to those plans. In
addition, if a plan were found to have a funding deficiency under federal tax law, we would be
required to make additional contributions to that plan to avoid excise taxes related to the funding
deficiency.</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Retirement and health care benefits for ABF&#146;s contractual employees are provided by a number of
multiemployer plans, under the provisions of the Taft-Hartley Act. The multiemployer pension plans
and their related trust funds are administered by trustees, an equal number of whom generally are
appointed by the IBT and certain management carrier organizations or other appointing authorities
for employer trustees as set forth in the fund&#146;s trust agreements. We are not directly involved in
the administration of the multiemployer pension plans or their related trust funds. We contribute
to these plans monthly based on the hours worked by our contractual employees, as specified in the
National Master Freight Agreement and other supporting supplemental agreements. Approximately 50%
of our contributions are made to the Central States Southeast and Southwest Area Pension Fund
(&#147;Central States&#148;). No amounts are required to be paid beyond our monthly contractual obligations
based on the hours worked by our employees, except as discussed below. Significant increases in
required contributions to the multiemployer plans could adversely impact our liquidity and results
of operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We have contingent liabilities for our share of the unfunded liabilities of each multiemployer
pension plan to which ABF contributes. Our contingent liability for a plan would become payable if
we were to withdraw from that plan. We have gathered data from the majority of these plans and
currently estimate our total contingent withdrawal liabilities for these pension plans to be
approximately $600 to $650&nbsp;million on a pre-tax basis. The increase over the prior year withdrawal
liability estimate primarily reflects changes in mortality assumptions used by the Central States
plan. Though the best information available to us was used in computing this estimate, it is
calculated with numerous assumptions, is not current and is continually changing. The funding
status of these plans also may be impacted by investment returns as well as the number of
participating employees, the number of employers who contribute and their related contribution
amounts and the number of employees or retirees participating in the plans who no longer have a
contributing employer. If we did incur withdrawal liabilities, those amounts would generally be
payable over a period of 10 to 15&nbsp;years.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Aside from the withdrawal liabilities, we would only have an obligation to pay an amount beyond
ABF&#146;s contractual obligations to these pension plans if we received official notification of a
funding deficiency. ABF has not received notification of a funding deficiency for any of the plans
to which it contributes. The amount of any
potential funding deficiency, if it were to materialize in the future, should be substantially less
than the full withdrawal liability for each pension plan.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In August&nbsp;2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the &#147;Act&#148;) became law. The Act mandates that
multiemployer plans that are below certain funding levels adopt a rehabilitation program to improve
the funding levels over a defined period of time. Based on currently available information, we
believe that a number of plans in which the Company participates, including Central States, may be
below the required funding levels when the Act becomes effective in 2008 and therefore would have
to adopt rehabilitation programs for future plan years. However, the funding levels of these
multiemployer plans in 2008 could vary from the current funding status. The Act preserves the
Internal Revenue Service ten-year extension, previously received by Central States, of the period
over which unfunded liabilities are amortized. Information to determine the actual impact the Act
will have on the Company is not available at this time.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Under the current IBT collective bargaining agreement, which extends through March&nbsp;31, 2008 as
described above, ABF is obligated to continue contributions to the multiemployer pension plans. We
intend to meet our obligations under the agreement. Contract negotiations for periods subsequent to
March&nbsp;31, 2008 are expected to begin later in 2007. The financial condition of the plans, the
effect of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 on the plans, and the methodology (including
participation in the plans) and level of ABF&#146;s funding required to provide retirement benefits for
its union employees, will all be significant matters to be addressed in the contract negotiations.
Because of uncertainties regarding these negotiations and the financial condition of the plans,
either changes in our funding methodologies as a result of the negotiations or continued
participation could have a material impact on our liquidity, financial condition and results of
operations.

business. These systems include our communications and data processing systems. Our information
systems are protected through physical and software safeguards. However, they are still vulnerable
to fire, storm, flood, power loss, telecommunications failures, physical or software break-ins and
similar events. We have a catastrophic disaster recovery plan and alternate processing capability,
which is designed so that critical data processes should be fully operational within 48 hours. We
have business interruption insurance, including, in certain circumstances, insurance against
terrorist attacks under the federal Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, which would offset losses
up to certain coverage limits in the event of a catastrophe. However, a significant system failure,
security breach, disruption by a virus or other damage could still interrupt or delay our
operations, damage our reputation and cause a loss of customers.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, the violation of which

materials and similar matters. We operate in industrial areas where truck terminals and other
industrial activities are located and where groundwater or other forms of environmental
contamination could occur. We also store fuel in underground tanks at some facilities. Our
operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or leakage, environmental damage and hazardous waste
disposal, among others. If we were involved in a spill or other accident involving hazardous
substances, or if we were found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, it could have
a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. If we should fail to comply with
applicable environmental regulations, we could be subject to substantial fines or penalties and to
civil and criminal liability.
