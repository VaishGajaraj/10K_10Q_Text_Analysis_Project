</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company was publicly owned from 1966 until 1988, when it was acquired in a leveraged buyout by
a corporation organized by Kelso &#038; Company, L.P. (&#147;Kelso&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In 1992, the Company completed a public offering of its Common Stock, par value $.01 (the &#147;Common

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In 1993, the Company completed a public offering of 1,495,000 shares of $2.875 Series&nbsp;A Cumulative
Convertible Exchangeable Preferred Stock (&#147;Preferred Stock&#148;). The Company&#146;s Preferred Stock was

Company purchased 105,000 shares of its Preferred Stock at $37.375 per share, for a total cost of
$3.9&nbsp;million. All of the shares purchased were retired. On August&nbsp;13, 2001, the Company announced

the end of the extended redemption period on September&nbsp;14, 2001, 1,382,650 shares of the Preferred
Stock were converted to 3,511,439 shares of Common Stock. The remaining 7,350 shares of Preferred

The Company delisted its Preferred Stock from trading on Nasdaq on September&nbsp;12, 2001.

outstanding shares of common stock of WorldWay Corporation (&#147;WorldWay&#148;), at a price of $11 per
share. WorldWay was a publicly held company engaged through its subsidiaries in
motor carrier operations. The purchase price of WorldWay totaled approximately $76.0&nbsp;million.

Treadco became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. On September&nbsp;13, 2000, Treadco entered
into a joint venture agreement with The Goodyear Tire &#038; Rubber Company (&#147;Goodyear&#148;) to contribute
its business to a new limited liability company called Wingfoot Commercial Tire Systems, LLC
(&#147;Wingfoot&#148;). On April&nbsp;28, 2003, the Company sold its 19.0% ownership interest in Wingfoot to
Goodyear for $71.3&nbsp;million.

&#147;ABF&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">LTL carriers service shipping customers by transporting a wide variety of large and small shipments
to geographically dispersed destinations. Typically, shipments are picked up at customers&#146; places
of business and consolidated at a local terminal. Shipments are consolidated by destination for
transportation by intercity units to their destination cities or to distribution centers. At
distribution centers, shipments from various terminals can be reconsolidated for other distribution
centers or, more typically, local terminals. Once delivered to a local terminal, a shipment is
delivered to the customer by local trucks operating from the terminal. In some cases, when one
large shipment or a sufficient number of different shipments at one origin terminal are going to a
common destination, they can be combined to make a full trailer load. A trailer is then dispatched
to that destination without rehandling. In addition to the traditional long-haul model, the Company
has implemented a regional network to facilitate its customers&#146; next-day and second-day delivery
needs. Development and expansion of the regional network required added labor flexibility,
strategically positioned freight exchange points and increased door capacity at a number of
key locations. Through a multi-phased program, ABF&#146;s regional
network now covers the eastern two-thirds of the United States. Marketing of the
regional initiative known as the Regional Performance Model (&#147;RPM&#148;) was initiated in August&nbsp;2006 in

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Competition, Pricing and Industry Factors</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The trucking industry is highly competitive. The Company&#146;s LTL motor carrier subsidiaries actively
compete for freight business with other national, regional and local motor carriers and, to a
lesser extent, with private carriage, freight forwarders, railroads and airlines. Competition is
based primarily on personal relationships, price and service. Competition for freight revenue,
however, has resulted in discounting which effectively reduces prices paid by shippers. In an
effort to maintain and improve its market share, the Company&#146;s LTL motor carrier subsidiaries offer
and negotiate various discounts. ABF charges a fuel surcharge based upon changes in diesel fuel
prices compared to a national index.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The trucking industry, including the Company&#146;s LTL motor carrier subsidiaries, is directly affected
by the state of the residential and commercial construction, manufacturing and retail sectors of
the North American economy. The trucking industry faces rising costs including government
regulations on safety, equipment design and maintenance, driver utilization and fuel economy. The
trucking industry is dependent upon the availability of adequate fuel supplies. The Company has not
experienced a lack of available fuel but could be adversely impacted if a fuel shortage were to
develop. In addition, seasonal fluctuations also affect tonnage to be transported. Freight
shipments, operating costs and earnings also are affected adversely by inclement weather
conditions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">ABF competes with nonunion and union LTL carriers. Competitors include YRC National Transportation
and YRC Regional Transportation, (operated by YRC Worldwide, Inc.); FedEx Freight and FedEx
National LTL (operated by FedEx Corporation); UPS Freight (operated by UPS, Inc.); Con-way, Inc.;
Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.; Saia, Inc. and Vitran Corporation, Inc.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In April&nbsp;2003, the U.S. Department of Transportation (&#147;DOT&#148;) announced rules regulating driving
time for commercial truck drivers. The rules, which were implemented in January&nbsp;2004, allow a
driver to be on duty for 14 hours and drive for 11 hours during that tour of duty and require a
10-hour rest period before driving. The rules also provide for a &#147;restart&#148; provision, which states
that a driver cannot drive after being on duty for 70 hours in 8&nbsp;days, but if the driver has 34
consecutive hours off duty for any reason, the driver &#147;restarts&#148; at zero hours. These rules have
been challenged in federal court, and future modifications to the rules, if any, may impact ABF&#146;s
operating practices. The operational impact of these rules on ABF&#146;s over-the-road linehaul relay
network has been to provide modest opportunity to increase driver and equipment utilization and
improve transit times. The rules also have allowed LTL carriers, such as ABF, to adjust their
over-the-road linehaul relay network to take advantage of the 11 hours of drive time during a tour
of duty. Impacts on the truckload industry have included a decline in driver utilization and
flexibility and, as a result, truckload carriers have increased charges for stop-off and detention
services, making LTL carriers somewhat more competitive on many larger shipments.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Generally, claims exposure in the motor carrier industry consists of cargo loss and damage,
third-party casualty and workers&#146; compensation. The Company&#146;s motor carrier subsidiaries are
effectively self-insured for the first $1.0&nbsp;million of each cargo loss, $1.0&nbsp;million of each
workers&#146; compensation loss and generally $1.0&nbsp;million of each third-party casualty loss. The
Company maintains insurance which it believes is adequate to cover losses in excess of such
self-insured amounts. However, the Company has experienced situations where excess insurance
carriers have become insolvent (see Note P to the consolidated financial statements in the
Company&#146;s 2007 Annual Report to Stockholders incorporated herein by reference). The Company pays
assessments and fees to state guaranty funds in states where it has workers&#146; compensation
self-insurance authority. In some of these states, depending on each state&#146;s rules, the guaranty
funds may pay excess claims if the insurer cannot due to insolvency. However, there can be no
certainty of the solvency of individual state guaranty funds (see Note P to the consolidated
financial statements in the Company&#146;s 2007 Annual Report to Stockholders incorporated herein by
reference). The Company has been able to obtain what it believes to be adequate coverage for 2008
and is not aware of problems in the foreseeable future which would significantly impair its ability
to obtain adequate coverage at market rates for its motor carrier operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Since 2001, ABF has been subject to cargo security and transportation regulations issued by the
Transportation Security Administration. Since 2002, ABF has been subject to regulations issued by
the Department of Homeland Security. ABF is not able to accurately predict how past or future
events will affect government regulations and the transportation industry. ABF believes that any
additional security measures that may be required by future regulations could result in additional
costs; however, other carriers would be similarly affected.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>ABF Freight System, Inc.</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Headquartered in Fort Smith, Arkansas, ABF is the largest subsidiary of the Company. ABF accounted
for 96.4% of the Company&#146;s consolidated revenues for 2007. ABF is one of North America&#146;s largest
LTL motor carriers and provides direct service to over 97% of the cities in the United States
having a population of 25,000 or more. ABF provides interstate and intrastate direct service to
more than 42,000 communities through 289 service centers in all 50 states, Canada and Puerto Rico.
Through relationships with trucking companies in Mexico, ABF provides motor carrier services to
customers in that country as well. ABF has been in continuous service since 1923. ABF was
incorporated in Delaware in 1982 and is the successor to Arkansas Motor Freight, a business
originally organized in 1935. Arkansas Motor Freight was the successor to a business originally
organized in 1923.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">ABF offers national, inter-regional and regional transportation of general commodities through
standard, expedited and guaranteed LTL services. General commodities include all freight except
hazardous waste, dangerous explosives, commodities of exceptionally high value and commodities in
bulk. ABF&#146;s shipments of general commodities differ from shipments of bulk raw materials, which are
commonly transported by railroad, truckload tank car, pipeline and water carrier.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">General commodities transported by ABF include, among other things, food, textiles, apparel,
furniture, appliances, chemicals, nonbulk petroleum products, rubber, plastics, metal and metal
products, wood, glass, automotive parts, machinery and miscellaneous manufactured products. During
the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007, no single customer accounted for more than 3.0% of ABF&#146;s
revenues, and the ten largest customers accounted for 8.7% of ABF&#146;s revenues.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">At December&nbsp;31, 2007, ABF had a total of 11,430 active employees. Employee compensation and related
costs are the largest components of ABF&#146;s operating expenses. In 2007, such costs amounted to 60.5%
of ABF&#146;s revenues. Approximately 76% of ABF&#146;s employees are covered under a collective bargaining
agreement with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (&#147;IBT&#148;). ABF&#146;s current five-year
agreement with the IBT expires on March&nbsp;31, 2008. During February&nbsp;2008, the Company announced that
the IBT has ratified a new five-year collective bargaining agreement with the Company. The new
agreement, which will be effective April&nbsp;1, 2008, provides for compounded annual contractual wage
and benefit increases of 3.8%, subject to wage rate cost-of-living adjustments. Under the terms of
the collective bargaining agreement, ABF is required to contribute to various multiemployer pension
plans maintained for the benefit of its employees who are members of the IBT. Amendments to the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (&#147;ERISA&#148;), pursuant to the Multiemployer Pension
Plan Amendments Act of 1980 (the &#147;MPPA Act&#148;), substantially expanded the potential liabilities of
employers who participate in such plans. Under ERISA, as amended by the MPPA Act, an employer who
contributes to a multiemployer pension plan and the members of such employer&#146;s controlled group are
jointly and severally liable for their proportionate share of the plan&#146;s unfunded vested
liabilities in the event the employer ceases to have an obligation to contribute to the plan or
substantially reduces its contributions to the plan (i.e., in the event of plan termination or
withdrawal by the Company from the multiemployer plans). See Note J to the consolidated financial
statements in the Company&#146;s 2007 Annual Report to Stockholders incorporated herein by reference,
for more specific disclosures regarding the multiemployer plans.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Three of the largest LTL carriers are unionized and generally pay comparable amounts for wages and
benefits. Union companies typically have comparable wage costs and significantly higher fringe
benefit costs than non-union companies. The Company believes that union companies also experience
lower employee turnover and higher productivity compared to some nonunion firms. Due to its
national reputation, its working conditions and its wages and benefits, ABF has not historically
experienced any significant long-term difficulty in attracting or retaining qualified employees,
although short-term difficulties have been encountered in certain situations.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Environmental and Other Government Regulations</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company is subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to,
among other things, contingency planning for spills of petroleum products and its disposal of waste
oil. In addition, the Company is subject to regulations dealing with underground fuel storage
tanks. The Company&#146;s subsidiaries store fuel for use in tractors and trucks in 71 underground tanks
located in 23 states. Maintenance of such tanks is regulated at the federal and, in some cases,
state levels. The Company believes that it is in substantial compliance with all such regulations.
The Company&#146;s underground storage tanks are required to have leak detection systems. The Company is
not aware of any leaks from such tanks that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on the Company.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company has received notices from the Environmental Protection Agency (&#147;EPA&#148;) and others that
it has been identified as a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response Compensation and Liability Act, or other federal or state environmental statutes, at
several hazardous waste sites. After investigating the Company&#146;s or its subsidiaries&#146; involvement
in waste disposal or waste generation at such sites, the Company has either agreed to de minimis
settlements (aggregating approximately $103,000 over the last ten years primarily at seven sites)
or believes its obligations, other than those specifically accrued for with respect to such sites,
would involve immaterial monetary liability, although there can be no assurances in this regard.

pay for our services. Customers encountering adverse economic conditions represent a greater
potential for uncollectible accounts receivable, and, as a result, we may be required to increase
our allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable. In addition, customers could reduce the
number of carriers they use by selecting so-called &#147;core carriers&#148; as approved transportation
service providers, and in some instances, we may not be selected.

not experienced a lack of available fuel but could be adversely impacted if a fuel shortage were to

based on changes in diesel fuel prices compared to a national index. The ABF fuel surcharge rate in
effect is available on the ABF Web site at <U>abf.com</U>. Although revenues from fuel surcharges
generally more than offset increases in direct diesel fuel costs; other operating costs have been,
and may continue to be, impacted by fluctuating fuel prices. The total impact of higher energy
prices on other nonfuel-related expenses is difficult to ascertain. ABF cannot predict, with
reasonable certainty, future fuel price fluctuations, the impact of higher energy prices on other
cost elements, recoverability of higher fuel costs through fuel surcharges, the effect of fuel surcharges on ABF&#146;s overall rate

different degrees. Depending upon the rates of these changes and the impact on costs in other fuel-
and energy-related areas, operating margins could be impacted. During 2007, the fuel surcharge
mechanism continued to have strong market acceptance among ABF customers. Whether fuel prices
fluctuate or remain constant, ABF&#146;s operating income may be adversely affected if competitive
pressures limit its ability to recover fuel surcharges. ABF&#146;s ability to recover future fuel
surcharges may be affected as a result. However, lower fuel surcharge levels may over time improve
ABF&#146;s ability to increase other elements of margin although there can be no assurances in this
regard. While the fuel surcharge is one of several components in ABF&#146;s overall rate structure, the
actual rate paid by customers is governed by market forces based on value provided to the customer.

for new equipment. Also, vendors must meet the EPA emission-control design requirements that took
effect on January&nbsp;1, 2007 and those that are scheduled to be effective in 2010. Some carriers may
seek to purchase large numbers of tractors with pre-2010 engines, which could lead to tractor

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In the event of the termination of a multiemployer pension plan or if we withdraw from a
multiemployer pension plan, we would have liabilities for our share of the unfunded vested
liabilities of such plan. ABF has no current intention of withdrawing from any multiemployer
pension plan. Based on December&nbsp;31, 2006, multiemployer pension plan information which is the most
recently available information, the estimate of ABF&#146;s contingent withdrawal liabilities for these
plans is approximately $800&nbsp;million to $850&nbsp;million, on a pre-tax basis. Though the best
information available to us was used in computing this estimate, it is calculated with numerous
assumptions, changes periodically and has not been verified by us or our independent pension
counsel.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In 2006, the Pension Protection Act (the &#147;PPA&#148;) became law and together with related regulations
established certain minimum funding requirements for multiemployer pension plans. The PPA mandates
that multiemployer plans that are below certain funding levels or that have projected funding
deficiencies adopt a funding improvement plan or a rehabilitation program to improve the funding
levels over a defined period of time. The Act also accelerates the timing of annual funding notices
and requires additional disclosures from certain multiemployer plans. Under the PPA, the funding
status of such plans is determined by a number of factors including: investment returns, changes in
member benefits, the number of participating employees, the number of employers who contribute and
their related contractual contributions and the number of employees or retirees participating in
the plan who no longer have a contributing employer. If any multiemployer pension plan fails to:
(i)&nbsp;meet minimum funding requirements; (ii)&nbsp;meet a required funding improvement or rehabilitation
plan required by the PPA for underfunded plans; (iii)&nbsp;obtain from the IRS certain changes to or
waivers of the requirements used by a particular plan to calculate funding levels; or, (iv)&nbsp;reduce
pension benefits to a level where the requirements are met, the PPA could impose additional
contribution requirements on ABF in the form of a surcharge of an additional five to ten percent.
However, under our new five-year collective bargaining agreement with the IBT, which will be
effective April&nbsp;1, 2008, any surcharges required by the Act will be included in the contractual
contribution rate and should not increase ABF&#146;s overall contribution obligation.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In July&nbsp;2007, the Teamsters National Freight Industry Negotiating Committee for the Central States
Pension Fund Supplemental Agreement reallocated $0.40 per hour of a previously negotiated $0.70
per hour rate increase for health and welfare to the Central States Pension Fund. This
reallocation will have a positive effect on the funded status of the Central States Pension Fund. In addition, as a result of a withdrawal by a large contributing employer, the Central
States Pension Fund received $6.1&nbsp;billion in cash in December&nbsp;2007, which should have a positive
effect on its near-term funded status.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Despite these events, based on currently available information, we believe that the Central States
Pension Fund and a number of other plans in which ABF participates will have to adopt either a
funding improvement plan or a rehabilitation program depending on their current funding status as
required by the PPA. However, the funding levels of these multiemployer plans in 2008 could vary
from the December&nbsp;31, 2006 funded status.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As previously mentioned, the highly competitive industry in which we operate could impact the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Various legal actions, the majority of which arise in the normal course of business, are pending.
None of these legal actions are expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s
financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. The Company maintains insurance against
certain risks arising out of the normal course of its business, subject to certain self-insured
retention limits. The Company has accruals for certain legal and environmental exposures.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On July&nbsp;30, 2007, Farm Water Technological Services, Inc., d/b/a Water Tech, and C.B.J.T., d/b/a
Agricultural Supply, on behalf of themselves and other plaintiffs, filed a putative class action
lawsuit against the Company and eleven other companies engaged in the LTL trucking business in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of California. This lawsuit alleges that
the carriers violated U.S. antitrust laws regarding fuel surcharges and seeks unspecified treble
damages allegedly sustained by class members, along with injunctive relief, attorney&#146;s fees and
costs of litigation. After the original suit was filed, other plaintiffs filed similar cases in
various courts across the country. Several of the parties, including
the Company, initiated proceedings with the United
States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (&#147;JPML&#148;) seeking to have the cases consolidated
and transferred to a single District Court for pretrial proceedings. On December&nbsp;20, 2007, the
United States JPML entered an order centralizing and transferring the pending lawsuits for pretrial
proceedings to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. This class
action litigation is in a preliminary stage and the Company cannot predict its outcome, as the
litigation process is inherently uncertain. If an adverse outcome were to occur, it could have a
material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s consolidated financial condition, cash flows and results
of operations. However, the Company believes that the allegations in this litigation are without
merit and intends to contest such allegations and defend itself vigorously.
