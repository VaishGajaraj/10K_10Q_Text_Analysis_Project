                                     PART I

Except for historical information contained herein, the following discussion
contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
Arkansas Best Corporation's (the "Company") actual results could differ
materially from those discussed herein. Factors that could cause or contribute
to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Item 1,
"Business."

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

(a) GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS

CORPORATE PROFILE

Arkansas Best Corporation (the "Company") is a diversified holding company
engaged through its subsidiaries primarily in motor carrier transportation
operations and intermodal transportation operations. Principal subsidiaries are
ABF Freight System, Inc. ("ABF"); Clipper Exxpress Company and related companies
("Clipper"); FleetNet America, LLC; and until August 1, 2001, G.I. Trucking
Company ("G.I. Trucking") (see Note S appearing on page 49 of the registrant's
Annual Report). The Company's operations included the truck tire retreading and
new tire sales operations of Treadco, Inc. ("Treadco") until October 31, 2000
(see Note R appearing on page 48 of the registrant's Annual Report).

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND

The Company was publicly owned from 1966 until 1988, when it was acquired in a
leveraged buyout by a corporation organized by Kelso & Company, L.P. ("Kelso").

In 1992, the Company completed a public offering of Common Stock, par value $.01
(the "Common Stock"). The Company also repurchased substantially all the
remaining shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by Kelso, thus ending
Kelso's investment in the Company.

In 1993, the Company completed a public offering of 1,495,000 shares of $2.875
Series A Cumulative Convertible Exchangeable Preferred Stock ("Preferred
Stock"). The Company's Preferred Stock traded on The Nasdaq National Market
("Nasdaq") under the symbol "ABFSP".

On July 10, 2000, the Company purchased 105,000 shares of its Preferred Stock at
$37.375 per share, for a total cost of $3.9 million. All of the shares purchased
were retired. As of December 31, 2000, the Company had outstanding 1,390,000
shares of Preferred Stock.

On August 13, 2001, the Company announced the call for redemption of its
Preferred Stock. As of August 10, 2001, 1,390,000 shares of Preferred Stock were
outstanding. At the end of the extended redemption period on September 14, 2001,
1,382,650 shares of the Preferred Stock were converted to 3,511,439 shares of
Common Stock. A total of 7,350 shares of Preferred Stock were redeemed at the
redemption price of $50.58 per share. The Company paid $0.4 million to the
holders of these shares in redemption of their Preferred Stock. The Company
delisted its preferred stock trading on Nasdaq under the symbol "ABFSP" on
September 12, 2001, eliminating the Company's annual dividend requirement.

In August 1995, pursuant to a tender offer, a wholly owned subsidiary of the
Company purchased the outstanding shares of common stock of WorldWay Corporation
("WorldWay"), at a price of $11 per share (the "Acquisition"). WorldWay was a
publicly held company engaged through its subsidiaries in motor carrier
operations. The total purchase price of WorldWay amounted to approximately $76.0
million.

ITEM 1. BUSINESS - continued

During the first half of 1999, the Company acquired 2,457,000 shares of Treadco
common stock for $23.7 million via a cash tender offer pursuant to a definitive
merger agreement. As a result of the transaction, Treadco became a wholly owned
subsidiary of the Company (see Note Q appearing on page 48 of the registrant's
Annual Report). On September 13, 2000, Treadco entered into an agreement with
The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company ("Goodyear") to contribute its business to a
new limited liability company called Wingfoot Commercial Tire Systems, LLC
("Wingfoot") (see Note R appearing on page 48 of the registrant's Annual
Report). The transaction closed on October 31, 2000.

On August 1, 2001, the Company sold the stock of G.I. Trucking for $40.5 million
in cash to a company formed by the senior executives of G.I. Trucking and Estes
Express Lines ("Estes") (see Note S appearing on page 49 of the registrant's
Annual Report).

(b) FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT INDUSTRY SEGMENTS

The response to this portion of Item 1 is included in "Note M - Operating
Segment Data" appearing on pages 42 through 44 of the registrant's Annual Report
to Stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2001, and is incorporated herein
by reference under Item 14.

(c) NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

GENERAL

During the periods being reported on, the Company operated in four defined
reportable operating segments: (1) ABF; (2) G.I. Trucking (which was sold on
August 1, 2001) (see Note S appearing on page 49 of the registrant's Annual
Report); (3) Clipper; and (4) Treadco (which was contributed to Wingfoot on
October 31, 2000) (see Note R appearing on page 48 of the registrant's Annual
Report). Note M to the Consolidated Financial Statements contains additional
information regarding the Company's operating segments and appears on pages 42
through 44 of the registrant's Annual Report to Stockholders for the year ended
December 31, 2001, and is incorporated herein by reference under Item 14.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

At December 31, 1998, the Company was engaged in international ocean freight
services through its subsidiary, CaroTrans International, Inc. ("Clipper
International"), a non-vessel operating common carrier (N.V.O.C.C.). On February
28, 1999, the Company completed a formal plan to exit its international ocean
freight N.V.O.C.C. services by disposing of the business and assets of Clipper
International. On April 17, 1999, the Company closed the sale of the business
and certain assets of Clipper International, including the trade name "CaroTrans
International, Inc." All of the assets have been liquidated by the Company.

EMPLOYEES

At December 31, 2001, the Company and its subsidiaries had a total of 11,865
employees of which approximately 73% are members of a labor union.

ITEM 1. BUSINESS - continued

MOTOR CARRIER OPERATIONS

LESS-THAN-TRUCKLOAD MOTOR CARRIER OPERATIONS

GENERAL

The Company's less-than-truckload ("LTL") motor carrier operations are conducted
through ABF, ABF Freight System (B.C.), Ltd. ("ABF-BC"), ABF Freight System
Canada, Ltd. ("ABF-Canada"), ABF Cartage, Inc. ("Cartage"), and Land-Marine
Cargo, Inc. ("Land-Marine") (collectively "ABF") and until August 1, 2001, G.I.
Trucking Company (see Note S appearing on page 49 of the registrant's Annual
Report).

LTL carriers offer services to shippers transporting a wide variety of large and
small shipments to geographically dispersed destinations. LTL carriers pick up
small shipments throughout the vicinity of a local terminal and consolidate them
at the terminal. Shipments are consolidated by destination for transportation by
intercity units to their destination cities or to distribution centers.
Shipments from various locations can be reconsolidated for transportation to
distant destinations, other distribution centers or local terminals. Once
delivered to a local terminal, a shipment is delivered to the customer by local
trucks operating from the terminal. In some cases, when a sufficient number of
different shipments at one origin terminal are going to a common destination,
they can be combined to make a full trailer load. A trailer is then dispatched
to that destination without the freight having to be rehandled.

COMPETITION, PRICING AND INDUSTRY FACTORS

The trucking industry is highly competitive. The Company's LTL motor carrier
subsidiaries actively compete for freight business with other national, regional
and local motor carriers and, to a lesser extent, with private carriage, freight
forwarders, railroads and airlines. Competition is based primarily on personal
relationships, price and service. In general, most of the principal motor
carriers use similar tariffs to rate interstate shipments. Competition for
freight revenue, however, has resulted in discounting which effectively reduces
prices paid by shippers. In an effort to maintain and improve its market share,
the Company's LTL motor carrier subsidiaries offer and negotiate various
discounts.

The trucking industry, including the Company's LTL motor carrier subsidiaries,
is directly affected by the state of the overall economy. The trucking industry
faces rising costs including government regulations on safety, maintenance and
fuel economy. In addition, seasonal fluctuations also affect tonnage to be
transported. Freight shipments, operating costs and earnings also are affected
adversely by inclement weather conditions.

INSURANCE AND SAFETY

Generally, claims exposure in the motor carrier industry consists of cargo loss
and damage, auto liability, property damage and bodily injury and workers'
compensation. The Company's motor carrier subsidiaries are effectively
self-insured for the first $100,000 of each cargo loss, $1,000,000 of each
workers' compensation loss and $200,000 of each general and auto liability loss,
plus an aggregate of $1,870,000 of auto liability losses between $200,000 and
$500,000. The Company maintains insurance adequate to cover losses in excess of
such amounts. However, the Company has experienced situations where excess
insurance carriers have become insolvent (see Note T appearing on page 49 of the
registrant's Annual Report). The Company pays premiums to state guaranty funds,
in states where it has workers' compensation self-insurance authority. In some
of these self-insured states, depending on each states rules, the guaranty funds
will pay excess claims if the insurer can't, due to insolvency. However, there
can be no certainty of the solvency of individual state guaranty funds. The
Company has been able to obtain adequate coverage for 2002 and is not aware of
problems in the foreseeable future which would significantly impair its ability
to obtain adequate coverage at market rates for its motor carrier operations.

ITEM 1. BUSINESS - continued

ABF FREIGHT SYSTEM, INC.

Headquartered in Fort Smith, Arkansas, ABF is the largest subsidiary of the
Company. ABF accounted for more than 84.0% of the Company's consolidated
revenues for 2001. ABF is one of North America's largest national LTL motor
carriers based on revenues for 2001 as reported to the U.S. Department of
Transportation ("D.O.T."). ABF provides direct service to over 98.6% of the
cities in the United States having a population of 25,000 or more. ABF provides
interstate and intrastate direct service to more than 40,000 points through 309
terminals in all 50 states, Canada and Puerto Rico. Through an alliance and
relationships with trucking companies in Mexico, ABF provides motor carrier
services to customers in that country as well. ABF was incorporated in Delaware
in 1982 and is the successor to Arkansas Motor Freight, a business originally
organized in 1935.

ABF offers long-haul, interstate, regional and intrastate transportation of
general commodities through LTL, assured services and expedited shipments.
General commodities include all freight except hazardous waste, dangerous
explosives, commodities of exceptionally high value, commodities in bulk and
those requiring special equipment. ABF's general commodities shipments differ
from shipments of bulk raw materials which are commonly transported by railroad,
pipeline and water carrier.

General commodities transported by ABF include, among other things, food,
textiles, apparel, furniture, appliances, chemicals, non-bulk petroleum
products, rubber, plastics, metal and metal products, wood, glass, automotive
parts, machinery and miscellaneous manufactured products. During the year ended
December 31, 2001, no single customer accounted for more than 3.0% of ABF's
revenues, and the ten largest customers accounted for less than 9.0% of ABF's
revenues.

EMPLOYEES

At December 31, 2001, ABF employed 11,267 persons. Employee compensation and
related costs are the largest components of ABF's operating expenses. In 2001,
such costs amounted to 65.6% of ABF's revenues. Approximately 77% of ABF's
employees are covered under a collective bargaining agreement with the
International Brotherhood of Teamsters ("IBT"). The IBT voted in favor of a new
labor contract on April 9, 1998. The contract was effective April 1, 1998, and
is for a five-year term. The contract provides for an average annual wage and
benefit increase of approximately 2.3% during its term, including a lump-sum
payment of $750 for the first contract year for all active employees who are IBT
members. Under the terms of the National Agreement, ABF is required to
contribute to various multiemployer pension plans maintained for the benefit of
its employees who are members of the IBT. Amendments to the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA") pursuant to the Multiemployer Pension Plan
Amendments Act of 1980 (the "MPPA Act") substantially expanded the potential
liabilities of employers who participate in such plans. Under ERISA, as amended
by the MPPA Act, an employer who contributes to a multiemployer pension plan and
the members of such employer's controlled group are jointly and severally liable
for their proportionate share of the plan's unfunded liabilities in the event
the employer ceases to have an obligation to contribute to the plan or
substantially reduces its contributions to the plan (i.e., in the event of plan
termination or withdrawal by the Company from the multiemployer plans). Although
the Company has no current information regarding its potential liability under
ERISA in the event it wholly or partially ceases to have an obligation to
contribute or substantially reduces its contributions to the multiemployer plans
to which it currently contributes, management believes that such liability would
be material. The Company has no intention of ceasing to contribute or of
substantially reducing its contributions to such multiemployer plans.

Four of the five largest LTL carriers are unionized and generally pay comparable
amounts for wages and benefits. Non-union companies typically pay employees less
than union companies. Due to its national reputation and its high pay scale, ABF
has not historically experienced any significant difficulty in attracting or
retaining qualified drivers.

ITEM 1. BUSINESS - continued

G.I. TRUCKING COMPANY

On August 1, 2001, the Company sold the stock of G.I. Trucking for $40.5 million
in cash to a company formed by the senior executives of G.I. Trucking and Estes
(see Note S appearing on page 49 of the registrant's Annual Report).

INTERMODAL OPERATIONS

GENERAL

The Company's intermodal transportation operations are conducted through
Clipper, headquartered in Lemont, Illinois. Clipper operates through two
business units: Clipper Freight Management ("CFM") and Clipper LTL, and offers
domestic intermodal freight services, utilizing a variety of transportation
modes including rail and over-the-road.

COMPETITION, PRICING AND INDUSTRY FACTORS

Clipper operates in highly competitive environments. Competition is based on the
most consistent transit times, freight rates, damage-free shipments and on-time
delivery of freight. Clipper competes with other intermodal transportation
operations, freight forwarders and railroads, as well as with other national and
regional LTL and truckload motor carrier operations. Intermodal transportation
operations are akin to motor carrier operations in terms of market conditions,
with revenues being weaker in the first quarter and stronger in the months of
September and October. Freight shipments, operating costs and earnings are also
affected by the state of the overall economy and inclement weather. The
reliability of rail service is also a critical component of Clipper's ability to
provide service to its customers.

CLIPPER

Clipper's revenues accounted for approximately 8.0% of consolidated revenues for
2001. During the year ended December 31, 2001, Clipper's largest customer
accounted for approximately 10.0% of Clipper's revenues.

CFM

CFM provides services through Clipper Express Company and Agricultural Express
of America, Inc. (d/b/a/ Clipper Controlled Logistics). CFM accounted for
approximately 71.0% of Clipper's revenues during 2001.

CFM provides an extensive list of transportation services such as intermodal and
truck brokerage, warehousing, consolidation, transloading, repacking, and other
ancillary services. As an intermodal marketing operation, CFM arranges for loads
to be picked up by a drayage company, tenders them to a railroad, and then
arranges for a drayage company to deliver the shipment on the other end of the
move. CFM's role in this process is to select the most cost-effective means to
provide quality service and to expedite movement of the loads at various
interface points to ensure seamless door-to-door transportation.

Clipper Controlled Logistics provides high quality, temperature-controlled
intermodal transportation service to fruit and produce brokers, growers,
shippers and receivers and supermarket chains, primarily from the West to the
Midwest, Canada, and the eastern United States. As of December 31, 2001, Clipper
Controlled Logistics owns or leases 594 temperature-controlled trailers that it
deploys in the seasonal fruit and vegetable markets. These markets are carefully
selected in order to take advantage of various seasonally high rates, which peak
at different times of the year. By focusing on the spot market for produce
transport, Clipper Controlled Logistics is able to generate, on average, a
higher revenue per load compared to standard temperature-controlled carriers
that pursue more stable year-round temperature-controlled freight. Clipper
Controlled Logistics' services also include transportation of non-produce loads
requiring protective services and leasing trailers during non-peak produce
seasons.

ITEM 1. BUSINESS - continued

CLIPPER LTL

Clipper LTL operates primarily through Clipper Exxpress Company ("Clipper
Exxpress"). Management believes Clipper Exxpress is one of the largest
intermodal consolidators and forwarders of LTL shipments in the United States.
Clipper LTL accounts for approximately 29.0% of Clipper's 2001 revenues.

Clipper LTL's collection and distribution network consists of 21 service centers
geographically dispersed throughout the United States. Clipper LTL's selection
of markets depends on size (lane density), availability of quality rail service
and truck line-haul service, length of haul and competitor profile. Traffic
moving between its ten most significant market pairs generates approximately
42.0% of Clipper's LTL revenue. A majority of Clipper's LTL revenue is derived
from long-haul, metro area-to-metro area transportation.

Although pickup and delivery and terminal handling is performed by independent
agents, Clipper LTL has an operations and customer service staff located at or
near many of its principal agents' terminals to monitor service levels and
provide an interface between customers and agents.

TREADCO, INC.

On September 13, 2000, Treadco entered into an agreement with Goodyear to form a
new limited liability company called Wingfoot Commercial Tire Systems, LLC (see
Note R appearing on page 48 of the registrant's Annual Report). The transaction
closed on October 31, 2000.

ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS

The Company is subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and
regulations relating to, among other things, contingency planning for spills of
petroleum products and its disposal of waste oil. In addition, the Company is
subject to significant regulations dealing with underground fuel storage tanks.
The Company's subsidiaries, or lessees, store fuel for use in tractors and
trucks in approximately 76 underground tanks located in 25 states. Maintenance
of such tanks is regulated at the federal and, in some cases, state levels. The
Company believes that it is in substantial compliance with all such regulations.
The Company is not aware of any leaks from such tanks that could reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company.

The Company has received notices from the EPA and others that it has been
identified as a potentially responsible party ("PRP") under the Comprehensive
Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act or other federal or state
environmental statutes at several hazardous waste sites. After investigating the
Company's or its subsidiaries' involvement in waste disposal or waste generation
at such sites, the Company has either agreed to de minimis settlements
(aggregating approximately $340,000 over the last 12 years), or believes its
obligations with respect to such sites would involve immaterial monetary
liability, although there can be no assurances in this regard.

As of December 31, 2001, the Company has accrued approximately $2.4 million to
provide for environmental-related liabilities. The Company's environmental
accrual is based on management's best estimate of the actual liability. The
Company's estimate is founded on management's experience in dealing with similar
environmental matters and on actual testing performed at some sites. Management
believes that the accrual is adequate to cover environmental liabilities based
on the present environmental regulations. Accruals for environmental liability
are included in the balance sheet as accrued expenses.
