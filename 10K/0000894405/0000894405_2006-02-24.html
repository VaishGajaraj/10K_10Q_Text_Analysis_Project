<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Historical Background</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company was publicly owned from 1966 until 1988, when it was acquired in a leveraged buyout by
a corporation organized by Kelso &#038; Company, L.P. (&#147;Kelso&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In 1992, the Company completed a public offering of Common Stock, par value $.01 (the &#147;Common
Stock&#148;). The Company also repurchased substantially all of the remaining shares of Common Stock
beneficially owned by Kelso, thus ending Kelso&#146;s investment in the Company.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In 1993, the Company completed a public offering of 1,495,000 shares of $2.875 Series&nbsp;A Cumulative
Convertible Exchangeable Preferred Stock (&#147;Preferred Stock&#148;). The Company&#146;s Preferred Stock was
traded on The Nasdaq National Market (&#147;Nasdaq&#148;) under the symbol &#147;ABFSP.&#148;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On July&nbsp;10, 2000, the Company purchased 105,000 shares of its Preferred Stock at $37.375 per share,
for a total cost of $3.9&nbsp;million. All of the shares purchased were retired.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On August&nbsp;13, 2001, the Company announced the call for redemption of its remaining Preferred Stock.
As of August&nbsp;10, 2001, 1,390,000 shares of Preferred Stock were outstanding. At the end of the
extended redemption period on September&nbsp;14, 2001, 1,382,650 shares of the Preferred Stock were
converted to 3,511,439 shares of Common Stock. A total of 7,350 shares of Preferred Stock were
redeemed at the redemption price of $50.58 per share. The Company paid $0.4&nbsp;million to the holders
of these shares in redemption of their Preferred Stock. The Company delisted its Preferred Stock
trading on Nasdaq under the symbol &#147;ABFSP&#148; on September&nbsp;12, 2001, eliminating the Company&#146;s annual
dividend requirement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In August&nbsp;1995, pursuant to a tender offer, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company purchased the
outstanding shares of common stock of WorldWay Corporation (&#147;WorldWay&#148;), at a price of $11 per
share (the &#147;Acquisition&#148;). WorldWay was a publicly held company engaged through its subsidiaries in
motor carrier operations. The total purchase price of WorldWay amounted to approximately $76.0
million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In 1999, the Company acquired 2,457,000 shares of Treadco, Inc. common stock for $23.7&nbsp;million via
a cash tender offer pursuant to a definitive merger agreement. As a result of the transaction,
Treadco became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. On September&nbsp;13, 2000, Treadco entered
into a joint venture agreement with The Goodyear Tire &#038; Rubber Company (&#147;Goodyear&#148;) to contribute
its business to a new limited liability company called Wingfoot Commercial Tire Systems, LLC
(&#147;Wingfoot&#148;). The transaction closed on October&nbsp;31, 2000.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On April&nbsp;28, 2003, the Company sold its 19.0% ownership interest in Wingfoot to Goodyear for a
cash price of $71.3&nbsp;million (see Note F to the Company&#146;s Consolidated Financial Statements,
incorporated herein by reference).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On August&nbsp;1, 2001, the Company sold the stock of G.I. Trucking Company (&#147;G.I. Trucking&#148;) for $40.5
million in cash to a company formed by the senior executives of G.I. Trucking and Estes Express
Lines (&#147;Estes&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On December&nbsp;31, 2003, Clipper closed the sale of all customer and vendor lists related to Clipper&#146;s
less-than-truckload (&#147;LTL&#148;) freight business to Hercules Forwarding, Inc. of Vernon, California,
for $2.7&nbsp;million in cash (see Note E). With this sale, Clipper exited the LTL business.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company&#146;s LTL motor carrier operations are conducted through ABF, ABF Freight System (B.C.),
Ltd. (&#147;ABF-BC&#148;), ABF Freight System Canada, Ltd. (&#147;ABF-Canada&#148;), ABF Cartage, Inc. (&#147;Cartage&#148;),
Land-Marine Cargo, Inc. (&#147;Land-Marine&#148;) and FreightValue, Inc. (&#147;FreightValue&#148;) (collectively
&#147;ABF&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">LTL carriers offer services to shippers, transporting a wide variety of large and small shipments
to geographically dispersed destinations. LTL carriers pick up shipments throughout the vicinity of
a local terminal and consolidate them at the terminal. Shipments are consolidated by destination
for transportation by intercity units to their destination cities or to distribution centers. At
distribution centers, shipments from various locations can be reconsolidated for other distribution
centers or, more typically, local terminals. Once delivered to a local terminal, a shipment is
delivered to the customer by local trucks operating from the terminal. In some cases, when one
large shipment or a sufficient number of different shipments at one origin terminal are going to a
common destination, they can be combined to make a full trailer load. A trailer is then dispatched
to that destination without rehandling.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The trucking industry is highly competitive. The Company&#146;s LTL motor carrier subsidiaries actively
compete for freight business with other national, regional and local motor carriers and, to a
lesser extent, with private carriage, freight forwarders, railroads and airlines. Competition is
based primarily on personal relationships, price and service. In general, most of the principal
motor carriers use similar tariffs to rate less-than-truckload shipments. Competition for freight
revenue, however, has resulted in discounting which effectively reduces prices paid by shippers. In
an effort to maintain and improve its market share, the Company&#146;s LTL motor carrier

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">subsidiaries offer and negotiate various discounts. ABF charges a fuel surcharge based upon changes
in diesel fuel prices compared to a national index.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The trucking industry, including the Company&#146;s LTL motor carrier subsidiaries, is directly affected
by the state of the overall U.S. economy. The trucking industry faces rising costs including
government regulations on safety, equipment design and maintenance, driver utilization and fuel
economy. The trucking industry is dependent upon the availability of adequate fuel supplies. The
Company has not experienced a lack of available fuel but could be adversely impacted if a fuel
shortage were to develop. In addition, seasonal fluctuations also affect tonnage to be transported.
Freight shipments, operating costs and earnings also are affected adversely by inclement weather
conditions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On August&nbsp;19, 2005, the U.S. Department of Transportation (&#147;DOT&#148;) issued new rules regulating work
and sleep schedules for commercial truck drivers. The new rules replaced Hours-of-Service
Regulations that were updated in 2003. The new rules, which were effective October&nbsp;1, 2005, are
similar to the rules announced in 2004. The 2004 rules reduced the number of hours a driver can be
on duty from 15 to 14 but increased the number of driving hours, during that tour of duty, from 10
to 11. In addition, the rules require the rest period between driving tours to be 10 hours as
opposed to 8. The rules also provide for a &#147;restart&#148; provision, which states that a driver can be
on duty for 70 hours in 8&nbsp;days, but if the driver has 34 consecutive hours off duty, for any
reason, he &#147;restarts&#148; at zero hours. The operational impact of these rules on ABF&#146;s over-the-road
linehaul relay network has been modest and includes a small decline in driver and equipment
utilization, offset by the opportunity to further improve transit times. The rules have limited
impact on LTL carriers, such as ABF, whose pickup, linehaul and delivery operations typically are
performed by different drivers. Impacts on the truckload industry have been more significant,
including a decline in driver utilization and flexibility and an exascerbation of a nationwide
driver shortage. As a result, truckload carriers have increased driver pay, raised customer prices
and increased charges for stop-off and detention services, making LTL carriers more competitive on
many larger shipments.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Insurance, Safety and Security</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Generally, claims exposure in the motor carrier industry consists of cargo loss and damage,
third-party casualty and workers&#146; compensation. The Company&#146;s motor carrier subsidiaries are
effectively self-insured for the first $500,000 of each cargo loss, $1,000,000 of each workers&#146;
compensation loss and $1,000,000 of each third-party casualty loss. The Company maintains insurance
which it believes is adequate to cover losses in excess of such self-insured amounts. However, the
Company has experienced situations where excess insurance carriers have become insolvent (see Note
R). The Company pays premiums to state guaranty funds in states where it has workers&#146; compensation
self-insurance authority. In some of these self-insured states, depending on each state&#146;s rules,
the guaranty funds will pay excess claims if the insurer cannot due to insolvency. However, there
can be no certainty of the solvency of individual state guaranty funds (see Note R). The Company
has been able to obtain what it believes to be adequate coverage for 2006 and is not aware of
problems in the foreseeable future which would significantly impair its ability to obtain adequate
coverage at market rates for its motor carrier operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Since 2001, ABF has been subject to cargo security and transportation regulations issued by the
Transportation Security Administration. Since 2002, ABF has been subject to regulations issued by
the Department of Homeland Security. ABF is not able to accurately predict how past or future
events will affect government regulations and the transportation industry. ABF believes that any
additional security measures that may be required by future regulations could result in additional
costs; however, other carriers would be similarly affected.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Headquartered in Fort Smith, Arkansas, ABF is the largest subsidiary of the Company. ABF accounted
for 91.9% of the Company&#146;s consolidated revenues for 2005. ABF is one of North America&#146;s largest
LTL motor carriers and provides direct service to over 97.0% of the cities in the United States
having a population of 25,000 or more. ABF provides interstate and intrastate direct service to
more than 47,000 communities through 287 service centers in all 50 states, Canada and Puerto Rico.
Through relationships with trucking companies in Mexico, ABF provides motor carrier services to
customers in that country as well. ABF has been in continuous service since 1923. ABF was
incorporated in Delaware in 1982 and is the successor to Arkansas Motor Freight, a business
originally organized in 1935. Arkansas Motor Freight was the successor to a business originally
organized in 1923.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">ABF offers national, interregional and regional transportation of general commodities through
standard, expedited and guaranteed LTL services. General commodities include all freight except
hazardous waste, dangerous explosives, commodities of exceptionally high value and commodities in
bulk. ABF&#146;s general commodities shipments differ from shipments of bulk raw materials, which are
commonly transported by railroad, pipeline and water carrier.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">General commodities transported by ABF include, among other things, food, textiles, apparel,
furniture, appliances, chemicals, nonbulk petroleum products, rubber, plastics, metal and metal
products, wood, glass, automotive parts, machinery and miscellaneous manufactured products. During
the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2005, no single customer accounted for more than 3.0% of ABF&#146;s

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">At December&nbsp;31, 2005, ABF had a total of 11,807 active employees. Employee compensation and
related costs are the largest components of ABF&#146;s operating expenses. In 2005, such costs amounted
to 58.9% of ABF&#146;s revenues. Approximately 77% of ABF&#146;s employees are covered under a collective
bargaining agreement with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (&#147;IBT&#148;). On March&nbsp;28, 2003,
the IBT announced the ratification of its National Master Freight Agreement with the Motor Freight
Carriers Association (&#147;MFCA&#148;) by its membership. Effective October&nbsp;1, 2005, the MFCA was dissolved
and replaced by Trucking Management, Inc. (&#147;TMI&#148;). ABF is a member of TMI. The agreement has a
five-year term and was effective April&nbsp;1, 2003. The agreement provides for annual contractual wage
and benefit increases of approximately 3.2% &#150; 3.4%. Under the terms of the National Agreement, ABF
is required to contribute to various multiemployer pension plans maintained for the benefit of its
employees who are members of the IBT. Amendments to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974 (&#147;ERISA&#148;), pursuant to the Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980 (the &#147;MPPA
Act&#148;), substantially expanded the potential liabilities of employers who participate in such
plans. Under ERISA, as amended by the MPPA Act, an employer who contributes to a multiemployer
pension plan and the members of such employer&#146;s controlled group are jointly and severally liable
for their proportionate share of the plan&#146;s unfunded liabilities in the event the employer ceases
to have an obligation to contribute to the plan or substantially reduces its contributions to the
plan (i.e., in the event of plan termination or withdrawal by the Company from the multiemployer
plans). See Note L for more specific disclosures regarding the multiemployer plans.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company is subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to,
among other things, contingency planning for spills of petroleum products and its disposal of waste
oil. In addition, the Company is subject to regulations dealing with underground fuel storage
tanks. The Company&#146;s subsidiaries store fuel for use in tractors and trucks in 72 underground tanks
located in 23 states. Maintenance of such tanks is regulated at the federal and, in some cases,
state levels. The Company believes that it is in substantial compliance with all such regulations.
The Company&#146;s underground storage tanks are required to have leak detection systems. The Company is
not aware of any leaks from such tanks that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on the Company.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company has received notices from the Environmental Protection Agency (&#147;EPA&#148;) and others that
it has been identified as a potentially responsible party (&#147;PRP&#148;) under the Comprehensive
Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act, or other federal or state environmental
statutes, at several hazardous waste sites. After investigating the Company&#146;s or its subsidiaries&#146;
involvement in waste disposal or waste generation at such sites, the Company has either agreed to
de minimis settlements (aggregating approximately $123,000 over the last 10&nbsp;years primarily at
seven sites) or believes its obligations, other than those specifically accrued for, with respect
to such sites, would involve immaterial monetary liability, although there can be no assurances in
this regard.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">As of December&nbsp;31, 2005 and 2004, the Company had accrued approximately $1.5&nbsp;million and $3.3
million, respectively, to provide for environmental-related liabilities. See Note S regarding the
sale of properties that were being leased to G.I. Trucking and G.I. Trucking&#146;s assumption of
environmental liabilities as a result of the sale. The Company&#146;s environmental accrual is based on
management&#146;s best estimate of the liability. The Company&#146;s estimate is founded on management&#146;s
experience in dealing with similar environmental matters and on actual testing performed at some
sites. Management believes that the accrual is adequate to cover environmental liabilities based on
the present environmental regulations. It is anticipated that the resolution of the Company&#146;s
environmental matters could take place over several years. Accruals for environmental liability are

consolidation, transloading, repacking and other ancillary services. As an intermodal marketing
operation, Clipper arranges for loads to be picked up by a drayage company, tenders them to a
railroad, and then arranges for a drayage company to deliver the shipment on the other end of the
move. Clipper&#146;s role in this process is to select the most cost-effective means to provide quality
service and to expedite movement of the loads at various interface points to ensure seamless
door-to-door transportation.

fruit and produce brokers, growers, shippers and receivers and supermarket chains, primarily from
the West to the Midwest, Canada and the eastern United States. As of December&nbsp;31, 2005, Clipper
owned 563 temperature-controlled trailers that it deployed in the seasonal fruit and vegetable
markets. These markets are carefully selected in order to take advantage of various seasonally high
rates, which peak at different times of the year. By focusing on the spot market for produce
transport, Clipper is able to generate, on average, a higher revenue per load compared to standard
temperature-controlled carriers that pursue more stable year-round temperature-controlled freight.
Clipper services also include transportation of nonproduce loads requiring protective services and
leasing trailers during nonpeak produce seasons.

transit times, freight rates, damage-free shipments and on-time delivery of freight. Clipper
competes with other intermodal transportation operations, freight forwarders and railroads.
Intermodal transportation revenues are weaker in the first quarter and stronger during the months
of June through October. Freight shipments, operating costs and earnings are also affected by the
state of the overall U.S. economy and inclement weather. Clipper&#146;s margins are impacted by the
amount of rail rebates it receives from rail service providers. The amount of rail rebates Clipper
receives is, in part, impacted by its rail volumes. The reliability of rail service is also a
critical component of Clipper&#146;s ability to provide service to its customers.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Since the terrorist attacks on the United States, federal, state and municipal authorities have
implemented and are implementing various security measures, including checkpoints and travel
restrictions on large trucks. Although many companies will be adversely affected by any slowdown in
the availability of freight transportation, the negative impact could affect our business
disproportionately. For example, we offer specialized services that guarantee on-time delivery. If
the new security measures disrupt the timing of deliveries, we could fail to meet the needs of our
customers or could incur increased costs in order to do so.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>We operate in a highly competitive industry and our business could suffer if our operating
subsidiaries were unable to adequately address downward pricing pressures and other factors that
could adversely affect their ability to compete with other companies.</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Numerous competitive factors could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability. These
factors include:
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We compete with many other LTL carriers of varying sizes, including both union and nonunion LTL
carriers and, to a lesser extent, with truckload carriers and railroads.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our nonunion competitors have a lower fringe benefit cost structure for their freight-handling and
driving personnel than union carriers. However, we have lower turnover rates and higher labor
efficiency rates than some of our competitors. Our competitors could reduce their freight rates to
gain market share, especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy. This could limit
our ability to maintain or increase freight rates, maintain our operating margins or grow tonnage
levels.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The trend toward consolidation in the transportation industry could continue to create larger LTL
carriers with greater financial resources and other competitive advantages relating to their size.
We could experience some difficulty if the remaining LTL carriers, in fact, have a competitive
advantage because of their size.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>We depend heavily on the availability of fuel for our trucks. Fuel shortages, increases in fuel
costs and the inability to collect fuel surcharges or obtain sufficient fuel supplies could have a
material adverse effect on our operating results.</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Fuel prices have fluctuated significantly in recent years. However, consistent with industry
practice, we charge a fuel surcharge based on changes in diesel fuel prices compared to a national
index. Customer acceptance of the fuel surcharges has been good; however, we cannot be certain that
collection of fuel surcharges will continue in the future. Although fuel costs increased
significantly during 2005, higher revenues from diesel fuel surcharges more than offset these
higher diesel fuel costs. We have experienced cost increases in other operating costs as a result
of increased fuel prices. However, the total impact of higher energy prices on other,
non-fuel-related expenses is difficult to ascertain. During the fourth quarter of 2005, diesel fuel
prices declined. If diesel fuel prices decline, the amount by which higher revenues from fuel
surcharges exceed higher diesel fuel costs will decline. We do not have any long-term fuel purchase
contracts and have not entered into any hedging arrangements to protect against fuel price
increases. Volatile fuel prices will continue to impact us.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>We depend on transportation provided by rail services and a discontinuance of this service could
adversely affect our operations.</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In 2005, ABF&#146;s rail utilization was 16.6% of total miles and 82.8% of Clipper&#146;s shipments moved on
the rail. If a discontinuance in transportation services from the rail service providers occurred,
we could be faced with business interruptions that could cause us to fail to meet the needs of our
customers. As a result, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>We have significant ongoing capital requirements that could affect profitability if we were unable
to generate sufficient cash from operations.</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We have significant ongoing capital requirements. If we were not able to generate sufficient cash
from operations in the future, our growth could be limited, we could have to utilize our existing
financing arrangements to a greater extent or enter into additional leasing arrangements, or our
revenue equipment may have to be held for longer periods, which would result in increased
maintenance costs. If these situations occurred, there could be an adverse effect on our
profitability.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Increased prices for new revenue equipment and decreases in the value of used revenue equipment
could adversely affect our earnings and cash flows.</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Manufacturers have raised the prices of new equipment significantly, in part to offset their costs
of compliance with new EPA tractor engine design requirements intended to reduce emissions. The
initial requirements took effect October&nbsp;1, 2002, and more restrictive EPA engine design
requirements will take effect in 2007. Further equipment price increases may result from the
implementation of the 2007 requirements. If new equipment prices increase more than anticipated, we
could incur higher depreciation and rental expenses than anticipated. If we were unable to offset
any such increases in expenses with freight rate increases, our results of operations could be
adversely affected. If the market value of revenue equipment being used in our operations were to
decrease, we could incur impairment losses and our cash flows could be adversely affected.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>The engines used in our newer tractors are subject to new emissions-control regulations, which
could substantially increase operating expenses.</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Tractor engines that comply with the EPA emission-control design requirements that took effect on
October&nbsp;1, 2002 are generally less fuel-efficient than engines in tractors manufactured before
October&nbsp;2002. Compliance with the more stringent EPA requirements that will take effect in 2007
could result in further declines in fuel economy and increased maintenance costs. If we were unable
to offset resulting increases in fuel expenses or maintenance costs with higher freight rates, our
results of operations could be adversely affected.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Decreases in the availability of new tractors and trailers could have a material adverse effect on
our operating results.</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">From time to time, some tractor and trailer vendors have reduced their manufacturing output due,
for example, to lower demand for their products in economic downturns or a shortage of component
parts. As conditions changed, some of those vendors have had difficulty fulfilling any increased
demand for new equipment. Also, vendors will have to introduce new engines meeting the more
restrictive EPA emissions standards in 2007, and some carriers may seek to purchase large numbers
of tractors with pre-2007 engines, possibly leading to shortages. An inability to continue to
obtain an adequate supply of new tractors or trailers could have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations and financial condition.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our self-insurance retention levels are currently $1.0&nbsp;million for each workers&#146; compensation loss,
$500,000 for each cargo loss and generally $1.0&nbsp;million for each third-party casualty loss. For
medical benefits, we self-insure up to $150,000 per person, per claim year. We maintain insurance
for liabilities above the amounts of self-insurance to certain limits. If the frequency and/or
severity of claims increases, our operating results could be adversely affected. The timing of the
incurrence of these costs could significantly and adversely impact our operating results compared
to prior periods. In addition, if we were to lose our ability to self-insure for any significant
period of time, insurance costs could materially increase and we could experience difficulty in
obtaining adequate levels of insurance coverage in that event.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Increased insurance premium costs could have an adverse effect on our operating results.</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In the last several years, insurance carriers have increased premiums for many companies, including
transportation companies. We could experience additional increases in our insurance premiums in the
future. If our insurance or claims expenses increased and we were unable to offset the increase
with higher freight rates, our earnings could be adversely affected.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>We operate in a highly regulated industry, and costs of compliance with, or liability for
violations of, existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operating
results.</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Various federal and state agencies exercise broad powers over the transportation business,
generally governing such activities as authorization to engage in motor carrier operations, safety,
insurance requirements and financial reporting. We could also become subject to new or more
restrictive regulations, such as regulations relating to fuel emissions, drivers&#146; hours of service
or ergonomics. Compliance with such regulations could substantially reduce equipment productivity,
and the costs of compliance could increase our operating expenses.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On August&nbsp;19, 2005, the DOT issued new rules regulating work and sleep schedules for commercial
truck drivers. The new rules replaced Hours-of-Service Regulations that were last updated in 2003.
The new rules, which were effective October&nbsp;1, 2005, have had a minimal impact upon our operations.
However, future changes in these rules could materially and adversely affect our operating
efficiency and increase costs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Our drivers and dockworkers also must comply with the safety and fitness regulations promulgated by
the DOT, including those relating to drug and alcohol testing and hours of service. The
Transportation Security Administration of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has adopted
regulations that will require all drivers who carry hazardous materials to undergo background
checks by the Federal Bureau of Investigation when they obtain or renew their licenses.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Failures to comply with DOT safety regulations or downgrades in our safety rating could have a
material adverse impact on our operations or financial condition. A downgrade in our safety rating
could cause us to lose the ability to self-insure. The loss of our ability to self-insure for any
significant period of time could materially increase insurance costs. In addition, we could
experience difficulty in obtaining adequate levels of coverage in that event.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Increases in license and registration fees could also have an adverse effect on our operating
results.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>We depend on our employees to support our operating business and future growth opportunities. If
our relationship with our employees were to deteriorate, we could be faced with labor disruptions
or stoppages, which could have a material adverse affect on our business and reduce our operating
results and place us at a disadvantage relative to nonunion competitors.</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">ABF&#146;s union employees are covered under a collective bargaining agreement with the IBT. This
agreement expires in March&nbsp;2008 when the agreement will be renegotiated. If an agreement is not
reached, we could be faced with a union workforce disruption or stoppage and, as a result, our
results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We compete against both union and nonunion LTL carriers. Union companies typically have somewhat
higher wage costs and significantly higher fringe benefit costs than nonunion companies. Union
companies typically experience lower employee turnover and higher productivity compared to some
nonunion companies. Due to our national reputation, our working conditions and wages and benefits,
we have not historically experienced any significant long-term difficulty in attracting or
retaining qualified drivers, although short-term difficulties have been encountered in certain
situations, such as periods of significant increases in tonnage levels. Difficulty in attracting
and retaining qualified drivers or increases in compensation or fringe benefit costs could affect
our profitability and our ability to grow. If we were unable to continue to attract and retain
qualified drivers, we could incur higher driver recruiting, compensation and fringe benefit
expenses.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>We could be obligated to pay significant additional contributions for our withdrawal liabilities to
multiemployer pension plans if we were to cease making our contractual monthly contributions to
those plans. In addition, if a plan were found to have a funding deficiency under federal tax law,
we would be required to make additional contributions to that plan.</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Retirement and health care benefits for ABF&#146;s contractual employees are provided by a number of
multiemployer plans, under the provisions of the Taft-Hartley Act. The multiemployer pension plans
and their related trust funds are administered by trustees, who generally are appointed equally by
the IBT and certain management carrier organizations. We are not directly involved in the
administration of the multiemployer pension plans or their related trust funds. We contribute to
these plans monthly based on the hours worked by our contractual employees, as specified in the
National Master Freight Agreement and other supporting supplemental agreements. Approximately 50%
of our contributions are made to the Central States Southeast and Southwest Area Pension Fund. No
amounts are required to be paid beyond our monthly contractual obligations based on the hours
worked by our employees, except as discussed below.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We have contingent liabilities for our share of the unfunded liabilities of each multiemployer
pension plan to which ABF contributes. Our contingent liability for a plan would be triggered if we
were to withdraw from that plan. We have no current intention of withdrawing from any of the plans.
We have gathered data from the majority of these plans and currently estimate our total contingent
withdrawal liabilities for these pension plans to be approximately $500&nbsp;million, on a pre-tax
basis. Though the best information available to us was used in computing this estimate, it is
calculated with numerous assumptions, is not current and is continually changing. If we did incur
withdrawal liabilities, those amounts would generally be payable over a period of 10 to 15&nbsp;years.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Aside from the withdrawal liabilities, we would only have an obligation to pay an amount beyond
ABF&#146;s contractual obligations to these pension plans if it received official notification of a
funding deficiency. The amount of any potential funding deficiency, if it were to materialize in
the future, should be substantially less than the full withdrawal liability for each pension plan.

similar events. We have a catastrophic disaster recovery plan and a fully redundant alternate
processing capability, which is designed so that critical data processes should be fully
operational within 48 hours. We have business interruption insurance, including, in certain
circumstances, insurance against terrorist attacks under the federal Terrorism Risk Insurance Act
of 2002, which would offset losses up to certain coverage limits in the event of a catastrophe.
However, a significant system failure, security breach or other damage could still interrupt or

operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or leakage, environmental damage and hazardous waste
disposal, among others. If we were involved in a spill or other accident involving hazardous
