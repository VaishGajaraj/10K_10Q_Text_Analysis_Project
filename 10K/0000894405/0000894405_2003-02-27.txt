Except for historical information contained herein, the following discussion
contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
Arkansas Best Corporation's actual results could differ materially from those
discussed herein. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences
include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Item 1, "Business."

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

(a)   GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS

CORPORATE PROFILE

Arkansas Best Corporation (the "Company") is a diversified holding company
engaged through its subsidiaries primarily in motor carrier transportation
operations and intermodal transportation operations. Principal subsidiaries are
ABF Freight System, Inc. ("ABF"); Clipper Exxpress Company and related companies
("Clipper"); FleetNet America, LLC ("FleetNet"); and until August 1, 2001, G.I.
Trucking Company ("G.I. Trucking") (see Note Q appearing on page 50 of the
registrant's Annual Report). The Company's operations included the truck tire
retreading and new tire sales operations of Treadco, Inc. ("Treadco") until
October 31, 2000 (see Note P appearing on page 50 of the registrant's Annual
Report).

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND

The Company was publicly owned from 1966 until 1988, when it was acquired in a
leveraged buyout by a corporation organized by Kelso & Company, L.P. ("Kelso").

In 1992, the Company completed a public offering of Common Stock, par value $.01
(the "Common Stock"). The Company also repurchased substantially all the
remaining shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by Kelso, thus ending
Kelso's investment in the Company.

In 1993, the Company completed a public offering of 1,495,000 shares of $2.875
Series A Cumulative Convertible Exchangeable Preferred Stock ("Preferred
Stock"). The Company's Preferred Stock is traded on The Nasdaq National Market
("Nasdaq") under the symbol "ABFSP."

On July 10, 2000, the Company purchased 105,000 shares of its Preferred Stock at
$37.375 per share, for a total cost of $3.9 million. All of the shares purchased
were retired. As of December 31, 2000, the Company had outstanding 1,390,000
shares of Preferred Stock.

On August 13, 2001, the Company announced the call for redemption of its
Preferred Stock. As of August 10, 2001, 1,390,000 shares of Preferred Stock were
outstanding. At the end of the extended redemption period on September 14, 2001,
1,382,650 shares of the Preferred Stock were converted to 3,511,439 shares of
Common Stock. A total of 7,350 shares of Preferred Stock were redeemed at the
redemption price of $50.58 per share. The Company paid $0.4 million to the
holders of these shares in redemption of their Preferred Stock. The Company
delisted its Preferred Stock trading on Nasdaq under the symbol "ABFSP" on
September 12, 2001, eliminating the Company's annual dividend requirement.

In August 1995, pursuant to a tender offer, a wholly owned subsidiary of the
Company purchased the outstanding shares of common stock of WorldWay Corporation
("WorldWay"), at a price of $11 per share (the "Acquisition"). WorldWay was a
publicly held company engaged through its subsidiaries in motor carrier
operations. The total purchase price of WorldWay amounted to approximately $76.0
million.


                                       3
<PAGE>
ITEM 1. BUSINESS - continued

During the first half of 1999, the Company acquired 2,457,000 shares of Treadco
common stock for $23.7 million via a cash tender offer pursuant to a definitive
merger agreement. As a result of the transaction, Treadco became a wholly owned
subsidiary of the Company. On September 13, 2000, Treadco entered into an
agreement with The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company ("Goodyear") to contribute its
business to a new limited liability company called Wingfoot Commercial Tire
Systems, LLC ("Wingfoot") (see Note P appearing on page 50 of the registrant's
Annual Report). The transaction closed on October 31, 2000.

On August 1, 2001, the Company sold the stock of G.I. Trucking for $40.5 million
in cash to a company formed by the senior executives of G.I. Trucking and Estes
Express Lines ("Estes") (see Note Q appearing on page 50 of the registrant's
Annual Report).

(b)   FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT INDUSTRY SEGMENTS

The response to this portion of Item 1 is included in "Note L - Operating
Segment Data" appearing on pages 44 through 46 of the registrant's Annual Report
to Stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2002, and is incorporated herein
by reference under Item 15.

(c)   NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

GENERAL

During the periods being reported on, the Company operated in four defined
reportable operating segments: (1) ABF; (2) G.I. Trucking (which was sold on
August 1, 2001) (see Note Q appearing on page 50 of the registrant's Annual
Report); (3) Clipper; and (4) Treadco (which was contributed to Wingfoot on
October 31, 2000) (see Note P appearing on page 50 of the registrant's Annual
Report). Note L to the Consolidated Financial Statements contains additional
information regarding the Company's operating segments and appears on pages 44
through 46 of the registrant's Annual Report to Stockholders for the year ended
December 31, 2002, and is incorporated herein by reference under Item 15.

EMPLOYEES

At December 31, 2002, the Company and its subsidiaries had a total of 12,216
employees of which approximately 74% are members of a labor union.

MOTOR CARRIER OPERATIONS

LESS-THAN-TRUCKLOAD MOTOR CARRIER OPERATIONS

GENERAL

The Company's less-than-truckload ("LTL") motor carrier operations are conducted
through ABF, ABF Freight System (B.C.), Ltd. ("ABF-BC"), ABF Freight System
Canada, Ltd. ("ABF-Canada"), ABF Cartage, Inc. ("Cartage"), Land-Marine Cargo,
Inc. ("Land-Marine"), FreightValue, Inc. ("FreightValue") and ABF Freight System
de Mexico, Inc. ("ABF-Mexico") (collectively "ABF") and until August 1, 2001,
G.I. Trucking Company (see Note Q appearing on page 50 of the registrant's
Annual Report).

LTL carriers offer services to shippers, transporting a wide variety of large
and small shipments to geographically dispersed destinations. LTL carriers pick
up small shipments throughout the vicinity of a local terminal and consolidate
them at the terminal. Shipments are consolidated by destination for
transportation by intercity units to their destination cities or to distribution
centers. Shipments from various locations can be reconsolidated for
transportation to distant destinations, other distribution centers or local
terminals. Once delivered to a local


                                       4
<PAGE>
ITEM 1. BUSINESS - continued

terminal, a shipment is delivered to the customer by local trucks operating from
the terminal. In some cases, when a sufficient number of different shipments at
one origin terminal are going to a common destination, they can be combined to
make a full trailer load. A trailer is then dispatched to that destination
without the freight having to be rehandled.

COMPETITION, PRICING AND INDUSTRY FACTORS

The trucking industry is highly competitive. The Company's LTL motor carrier
subsidiaries actively compete for freight business with other national, regional
and local motor carriers and, to a lesser extent, with private carriage, freight
forwarders, railroads and airlines. Competition is based primarily on personal
relationships, price and service. In general, most of the principal motor
carriers use similar tariffs to rate interstate shipments. Competition for
freight revenue, however, has resulted in discounting which effectively reduces
prices paid by shippers. In an effort to maintain and improve its market share,
the Company's LTL motor carrier subsidiaries offer and negotiate various
discounts.

One of ABF's major competitors, Consolidated Freightways Corporation ("CF"),
filed for bankruptcy protection and ceased operations in early September 2002.
CF's operations were estimated to be two times the size of ABF's. The closing of
CF resulted in a capacity reduction within the LTL trucking industry and, as a
result, the competitive pricing environment strengthened in stability.

The trucking industry, including the Company's LTL motor carrier subsidiaries,
is directly affected by the state of the overall economy. The trucking industry
faces rising costs including government regulations on safety, maintenance and
fuel economy. The trucking industry is dependent upon the availability of
adequate fuel supplies. The Company has not experienced a lack of available fuel
but could be adversely impacted if a fuel shortage were to develop. In addition,
seasonal fluctuations also affect tonnage to be transported. Freight shipments,
operating costs and earnings also are affected adversely by inclement weather
conditions.

INSURANCE AND SAFETY

Generally, claims exposure in the motor carrier industry consists of cargo loss
and damage, third-party casualty and workers' compensation. The Company's motor
carrier subsidiaries are effectively self-insured for the first $150,000 of each
cargo loss, $1,000,000 of each workers' compensation loss and $1,000,000 of each
third-party casualty loss. The Company maintains insurance which it believes is
adequate to cover losses in excess of such self-insured amounts. However, the
Company has experienced situations where excess insurance carriers have become
insolvent (see Note R appearing on page 51 of the registrant's Annual Report).
The Company pays premiums to state guaranty funds in states where it has
workers' compensation self-insurance authority. In some of these self-insured
states, depending on each state's rules, the guaranty funds will pay excess
claims if the insurer cannot, due to insolvency. However, there can be no
certainty of the solvency of individual state guaranty funds. The Company has
been able to obtain what it believes to be adequate coverage for 2003 and is not
aware of problems in the foreseeable future which would significantly impair its
ability to obtain adequate coverage at market rates for its motor carrier
operations.

ABF FREIGHT SYSTEM, INC.

Headquartered in Fort Smith, Arkansas, ABF is the largest subsidiary of the
Company. ABF accounted for approximately 90.0% of the Company's consolidated
revenues for 2002. ABF is one of North America's largest LTL motor carriers,
based on revenues for 2002 as reported to the U.S. Department of Transportation
("D.O.T."). ABF provides direct service to over 98.6% of the cities in the
United States having a population of 25,000 or more. ABF provides interstate and
intrastate direct service to more than 40,000 points through 302 terminals in
all 50 states, Canada and Puerto Rico. Through an alliance and relationships
with trucking companies in Mexico, ABF provides motor carrier services to
customers in that country as well. ABF has been in continuous service since
1923. ABF was incorporated in Delaware in 1982 and is the successor to Arkansas
Motor Freight, a


                                       5
<PAGE>
ITEM 1. BUSINESS - continued

business originally organized in 1935. Arkansas Motor Freight was the successor
to a business originally organized in 1923.

ABF offers national and regional transportation of general commodities through
standard, expedited and guaranteed LTL services. General commodities include all
freight except hazardous waste, dangerous explosives, commodities of
exceptionally high value, commodities in bulk and those requiring special
equipment. ABF's general commodities shipments differ from shipments of bulk raw
materials which are commonly transported by railroad, pipeline and water
carrier.

General commodities transported by ABF include, among other things, food,
textiles, apparel, furniture, appliances, chemicals, non-bulk petroleum
products, rubber, plastics, metal and metal products, wood, glass, automotive
parts, machinery and miscellaneous manufactured products. During the year ended
December 31, 2002, no single customer accounted for more than 3.0% of ABF's
revenues, and the ten largest customers accounted for less than 10.0% of ABF's
revenues.

EMPLOYEES

At December 31, 2002, ABF employed 11,630 persons. Employee compensation and
related costs are the largest components of ABF's operating expenses. In 2002,
such costs amounted to 66.2% of ABF's revenues. Approximately 77% of ABF's
employees are covered under a collective bargaining agreement with the
International Brotherhood of Teamsters ("IBT"). The Company's current five-year
agreement with the IBT expires on March 31, 2003. On February 6, 2003, the
Company announced that a tentative new five-year collective bargaining agreement
had been reached, subject to ratification by the freight members of the IBT. The
agreement provides for annual contractual wage and benefit increases of
approximately 3.2% - 3.4%. The effective date of the proposed new agreement is
April 1, 2003. Under the terms of the National Agreement, ABF is required to
contribute to various multiemployer pension plans maintained for the benefit of
its employees who are members of the IBT. Amendments to the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA") pursuant to the Multiemployer Pension Plan
Amendments Act of 1980 (the "MPPA Act") substantially expanded the potential
liabilities of employers who participate in such plans. Under ERISA, as amended
by the MPPA Act, an employer who contributes to a multiemployer pension plan and
the members of such employer's controlled group are jointly and severally liable
for their proportionate share of the plan's unfunded liabilities in the event
the employer ceases to have an obligation to contribute to the plan or
substantially reduces its contributions to the plan (i.e., in the event of plan
termination or withdrawal by the Company from the multiemployer plans). Although
the Company has no current information regarding its potential liability under
ERISA in the event it wholly or partially ceases to have an obligation to
contribute or substantially reduces its contributions to the multiemployer plans
to which it currently contributes, management believes that such liability would
be material. The Company has no intention of ceasing to contribute or of
substantially reducing its contributions to such multiemployer plans.

Many of the largest LTL carriers are unionized and generally pay comparable
amounts for wages and benefits. Union companies typically have somewhat higher
wage costs and significantly higher fringe benefit costs than non-union
companies. Due to its national reputation and its high pay scale, ABF has not
historically experienced any significant difficulty in attracting or retaining
qualified drivers.

G.I. TRUCKING COMPANY

On August 1, 2001, the Company sold the stock of G.I. Trucking for $40.5 million
in cash to a company formed by the senior executives of G.I. Trucking and Estes
(see Note Q appearing on page 50 of the registrant's Annual Report).

ITEM 1. BUSINESS - continued

INTERMODAL OPERATIONS

GENERAL

The Company's intermodal transportation operations are conducted through
Clipper, headquartered in Lemont, Illinois. Clipper operates through two
business units: Clipper Freight Management ("CFM") and Clipper LTL, and offers
domestic intermodal freight services, utilizing a variety of transportation
modes including rail and over-the-road.

COMPETITION, PRICING AND INDUSTRY FACTORS

Clipper operates in highly competitive environments. Competition is based on the
most consistent transit times, freight rates, damage-free shipments and on-time
delivery of freight. Clipper competes with other intermodal transportation
operations, freight forwarders and railroads, as well as with other national and
regional LTL and truckload motor carrier operations. Intermodal transportation
operations are akin to motor carrier operations in terms of market conditions,
with revenues being weaker in the first quarter and stronger during the months
of June through October. Freight shipments, operating costs and earnings are
also affected by the state of the overall economy and inclement weather. The
reliability of rail service is also a critical component of Clipper's ability to
provide service to its customers.

CLIPPER

Clipper's revenues accounted for approximately 8.0% of consolidated revenues for
2002. During the year ended December 31, 2002, Clipper's largest customer
accounted for approximately 11.5% of Clipper's revenues.

CFM

CFM provides services through Clipper Exxpress Company ("Clipper Exxpress") and
Agricultural Express of America, Inc. (d/b/a/ Clipper Controlled Logistics). CFM
accounted for approximately 71.0% of Clipper's revenues during 2002.

CFM provides an extensive list of transportation services such as intermodal and
truck brokerage, warehousing, consolidation, transloading, repacking, and other
ancillary services. As an intermodal marketing operation, CFM arranges for loads
to be picked up by a drayage company, tenders them to a railroad, and then
arranges for a drayage company to deliver the shipment on the other end of the
move. CFM's role in this process is to select the most cost-effective means to
provide quality service and to expedite movement of the loads at various
interface points to ensure seamless door-to-door transportation.

Clipper Controlled Logistics provides high quality, temperature-controlled
intermodal transportation service to fruit and produce brokers, growers,
shippers and receivers and supermarket chains, primarily from the West to the
Midwest, Canada, and the eastern United States. As of December 31, 2002, Clipper
Controlled Logistics owned or leased 506 temperature-controlled trailers that it
deployed in the seasonal fruit and vegetable markets. These markets are
carefully selected in order to take advantage of various seasonally high rates,
which peak at different times of the year. By focusing on the spot market for
produce transport, Clipper Controlled Logistics is able to generate, on average,
a higher revenue per load compared to standard temperature-controlled carriers
that pursue more stable year-round temperature-controlled freight. Clipper
Controlled Logistics' services also include transportation of non-produce loads
requiring protective services and leasing trailers during non-peak produce
seasons.

<PAGE>
ITEM 1. BUSINESS - continued

CLIPPER LTL

Clipper LTL operates primarily through Clipper Exxpress. Management believes
Clipper Exxpress is one of the largest intermodal consolidators and forwarders
of LTL shipments in the United States. Clipper LTL accounted for approximately
29.0% of Clipper's 2002 revenues.

Clipper LTL's collection and distribution network consists of 21 locations
geographically dispersed throughout the United States. Clipper LTL's selection
of markets depends on size (lane density), availability of quality rail service
and truck line-haul service, length of haul and competitor profile. Traffic
moving between its ten most significant market pairs generates approximately
41.0% of Clipper's LTL revenue. A majority of Clipper's LTL revenue is derived
from long-haul, metro area-to-metro area transportation.

Although pickup and delivery and terminal handling is performed by independent
agents, Clipper LTL has an operations and customer service staff located at or
near many of its principal agents' terminals to monitor service levels and
provide an interface between customers and agents.

TREADCO, INC.

On September 13, 2000, Treadco entered into an agreement with Goodyear to form a
new limited liability company called Wingfoot Commercial Tire Systems, LLC (see
Note P appearing on page 50 of the registrant's Annual Report). The transaction
closed on October 31, 2000.

ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS

The Company is subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and
regulations relating to, among other things, contingency planning for spills of
petroleum products and its disposal of waste oil. In addition, the Company is
subject to significant regulations dealing with underground fuel storage tanks.
The Company's subsidiaries, or lessees, store fuel for use in tractors and
trucks in approximately 77 underground tanks located in 26 states. Maintenance
of such tanks is regulated at the federal and, in some cases, state levels. The
Company believes that it is in substantial compliance with all such regulations.
The Company's underground tanks are required to have leak detection systems. The
Company is not aware of any leaks from such tanks that could reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company.

The Company has received notices from the EPA and others that it has been
identified as a potentially responsible party ("PRP") under the Comprehensive
Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act or other federal or state
environmental statutes at several hazardous waste sites. After investigating the
Company's or its subsidiaries' involvement in waste disposal or waste generation
at such sites, the Company has either agreed to de minimis settlements
(aggregating approximately $195,000 over the last 10 years, primarily at seven
sites), or believes its obligations with respect to such sites would involve
immaterial monetary liability, although there can be no assurances in this
regard.

As of December 31, 2002, the Company had accrued approximately $2.7 million to
provide for environmental-related liabilities. The Company's environmental
accrual is based on management's best estimate of the actual liability. The
Company's estimate is founded on management's experience in dealing with similar
environmental matters and on actual testing performed at some sites. Management
believes that the accrual is adequate to cover environmental liabilities based
on the present environmental regulations. Accruals for environmental liability
are included in the balance sheet as accrued expenses.

      (a) all significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal
      controls which could adversely affect the Registrant's ability to record,
      process, summarize and report financial data and have identified for the

      (b) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
      employees who have a significant role in the Registrant's internal
      controls; and

6.    The Registrant's other certifying officers and I have indicated in this
      annual report whether there were significant changes in internal controls
      or in other factors that could significantly affect internal controls
      subsequent to the date of our most recent evaluation, including any
      corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material
      weaknesses.
