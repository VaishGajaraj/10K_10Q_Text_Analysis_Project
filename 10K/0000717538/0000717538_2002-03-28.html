<p><strong>Cautionary Statement under Federal Securities Laws</strong>: The information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K
contains statements that are not historical in nature but rather are based on management's beliefs, assumptions,
expectations, estimates and projections about the future.  These statements are "forward-looking statements" within the
meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and involve a degree of uncertainty and
attendant risk.  Words such as "expects," "believes," "anticipates," "estimates" and variations of such words and similar
expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements.  Some of these statements, such as those included
in the interest rate sensitivity analysis in section 7A, below, entitled "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk," are merely presentations of what future performance or changes in future performance would look like based on
hypothetical assumptions and on simulation models.  Others are based on management's general perceptions of market
conditions and trends in activity, both locally and nationally, as well as current management strategies for future operations
and development.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>A. GENERAL</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Arrow Financial Corporation (the "Company"), a New York corporation, was incorporated on March 21, 1983 and is registered as a bank
holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956.  The Company owns two nationally chartered banks in
New York,  Glens Falls National Bank and Trust Company, Glens Falls, New York ("GFNB"), and Saratoga National Bank and Trust
Company, Saratoga Springs, New York ("SNB"), as well as five non-bank subsidiaries, the operations of which were not significant.  The
Company owns directly or indirectly all voting stock of all its subsidiaries.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The business of the Company consists primarily of the ownership, supervision and control of its bank subsidiaries.  The Company provides
its subsidiaries with various advisory and administrative services and coordinates the general policies and operation of the subsidiary
banks.  There were 385 full-time equivalent employees of the Company and the subsidiary banks at December 31, 2001.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Company offers a full range of commercial and consumer financial products.  The subsidiary banks' deposit base consists of deposits
derived principally from the communities which the banks serve.  The banks target their lending activities to consumers and small and
mid-sized companies in the banks' immediate geographic areas.  Through its banks' trust departments, the Company provides retirement
planning, trust and estate administration services for individuals and pension, profit-sharing and employee benefit plan administration for
corporations.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>B. LENDING ACTIVITIES</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Company, through its subsidiary banks engages in a wide range of lending activities, including commercial and industrial lending
primarily to small and mid-sized companies; mortgage lending for residential and commercial properties; and consumer installment and
home equity financing.  The Company also maintains an active indirect lending program through its sponsorship of dealer programs, under
which it purchases dealer paper from  automobile and other dealers meeting pre-established specifications.  Historically, the Company
has sold a portion of its residential real estate loan originations into the secondary market, primarily to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corporation (Freddie Mac) and state housing agencies, while retaining the servicing rights.  Loan sales into the secondary market have
diminished in the past several years, however, as the Company has sought to increase its own portfolio.  During 2001, the Company
securitized $30.2 million of residential real estate loans.  This involved the sale of the mortgage loans and the concurrent purchase of
Freddie Mac guaranteed mortgage-backed securities, with the sold loans representing the underlying collateral.  In addition to interest
earned on loans, the Company receives facility fees for various types of commercial and industrial credits, and commitment fees for
extension of letters of credit and certain types of loans.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Generally, the Company continues to implement conservative lending strategies and policies that are intended to protect the quality of the
loan portfolio.  These include stringent underwriting and collateral control procedures and credit review systems through which intensive
reviews are conducted.  It is the Company's policy to discontinue the accrual of interest on loans when the payment of interest and/or
principal is due and unpaid for a designated period (generally 90 days) or when the likelihood of repayment is, in the opinion of
management, uncertain (see Part II, Item 7.C.II.b., "Risk Elements").  Income on such loans is thereafter recognized only upon receipt.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Company lends primarily to borrowers within its geographic area.  The loan portfolio does not include any foreign loans or any
significant risk concentrations except as described in Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.
The Company does not participate in loan syndications, either as originator or as a participant.  The portfolio, in general, is fully
collateralized, and many commercial loans are further secured by personal guarantees.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In 2000, the Company formed a subsidiary, North Country Investment Advisers, Inc., which is an investment adviser registered with the
U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission. NCIA advises two SEC-registered mutual funds, the North Country Intermediate Bond Fund
and the North Country Equity Growth Fund.  Currently, the investors in these funds consist primarily of individual, corporate and institutional
trust customers of the Company, but both funds intend to seek a broader distribution of fund shares in forthcoming periods, involving,
among other things, retail marketing initiatives.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In 2001, the Company established a subsidiary insurance agency, NC Financial Services, Inc., which is licensed by the State of New York
to sell various insurance products, including life insurance, fixed annuities and long-term health care products.  The agency is
headquartered in Warrensburg, New York.  It is expected that the agency ultimately will operate throughout the Company's service area
from multiple Company locations.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>C. SUPERVISION AND REGULATION</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The following generally describes the regulation to which the Company and its affiliates are subject.  Bank holding companies and banks
are extensively regulated under both federal and state law.  To the extent that the following information summarizes statutory or regulatory
provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular laws and regulations.  Any change in applicable law or regulation may
have a material effect on the business and prospects of the Company.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Company is a registered bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (BHC Act) and is subject
to regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve Board).  Additionally, as a "bank holding
company" under New York State Law, the Company is subject to regulation by the New York State Banking Department.  The two
subsidiary banks are both nationally chartered banks and are subject to supervision and examination by the Office of the Comptroller of
the Currency ("OCC"). The banks are members of the Federal Reserve System and the deposits of each subsidiary bank are insured by
the Bank Insurance Fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") up to $100,000 per depositor.  The BHC Act generally
prohibits the Company from engaging, directly or indirectly, in activities  other than banking, activities closely related to banking, and certain
other financial activities.  Under the BHC Act, a bank holding company must obtain Federal Reserve Board approval before acquiring,
directly or indirectly,  5% or more of the voting shares of another bank or bank holding company (unless it already owns a majority of such
shares).  Bank holding companies are able to acquire banks or other bank holding companies located in all 50 states, and 48 of the 50
states permit banks headquartered in other states to branch into their states although in some cases only by acquisition of or merger with
existing banks in such states.  As a result of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, bank holding companies are now permitted to affiliate with a
much broader array of other financial institutions than was previously permitted, including insurance companies, investment banks and
merchant banks.  See Item 1.F., "Legislative Developments."

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>During 1997 and 1998, banking regulators promulgated guidelines compelling financial institutions to take special measures to ensure that
their computer applications would operate properly for all dates after December 31, 1999.  The Company experienced no material computer
problems related to year 2000 preparedness.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>An important area of banking regulation is the establishment by federal regulators of minimum capitalization standards.  The Federal
Reserve Board has adopted various "capital adequacy guidelines" for its use in the examination and supervision of bank holding
companies.  The risk-based capital guidelines assign risk weightings to all assets and certain off-balance sheet items and establish an 8%
minimum ratio of qualified total capital to the aggregate dollar amount of risk-weighted assets (which is almost always less than the dollar
amount of such assets without risk weighting).  At least half of total capital must consist of "Tier 1" capital, which comprises common equity,
retained earnings and a limited amount of permanent preferred stock, less goodwill.  Up to half of total capital may consist of so-called "Tier
2" capital, comprising a limited amount of subordinated debt, other preferred stock, certain other instruments and a limited amount of the
allowance for loan losses. The Federal Reserve Board's other important guideline for measuring a bank holding company's capital is the
leverage ratio standard, which establishes minimum limits on the ratio of a bank holding company's "Tier 1" capital to total tangible assets
(not risk-weighted).  For top-rated holding companies, the minimum leverage ratio is 3%, but lower-rated companies may be required to
meet substantially greater minimum ratios.  The subsidiary banks are subject to similar capital requirements adopted by their primary
federal regulators.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Under applicable law, federal banking regulators are required to take prompt corrective action with respect to depository institutions that
do not meet minimum capital requirements.  The regulators have established five capital classifications for banking institutions, the highest
being "well capitalized."   Under regulations adopted by the federal bank regulators, a banking institution is considered "well capitalized"
if it has a total risk-adjusted capital ratio of 10% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-adjusted capital ratio of 6% or greater and a leverage ratio of 5%
or greater and is not subject to any regulatory order or written directive regarding capital maintenance.  The Company and each of its
subsidiary banks currently qualify as "well capitalized."  The year-end 2001 capital ratios of the Company and its subsidiary banks are set
forth in Part II, Item 7.E. "Capital Resources and Dividends."

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>A holding company's ability to pay dividends or repurchase its outstanding stock, as well as its ability to expand its business through
acquisitions of additional banking organizations or non-bank companies, may be restricted if capital falls below these minimum
capitalization standards or other informal capital guidelines that the regulators may apply from time to time to specific banking
organizations.  In addition to these potential regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends, the Company and its subsidiary banks'
ability to pay dividends is subject to various restrictions under applicable corporate laws.  The ability of the Company and the banks to pay
dividends in the future is, and is expected to continue to be, influenced by regulatory policies, capital guidelines and applicable law.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In cases where banking regulators have significant concerns regarding the financial condition, assets or operations of a bank or bank
holding company, the regulators may take enforcement action or impose enforcement orders, formal or informal, against the organization.
Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is now, or has been within the past year, subject to any formal or informal regulatory
enforcement action or order.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>As the insurer of deposits, the FDIC levies assessments on the Company's banking subsidiaries, based on insured deposit levels.  Since
1996, the premium paid to the FDIC by the best-rated banks (including the Company's subsidiary banks) has been a flat charge of $2
thousand per year, plus an assessment on deposits equal to the rate being paid on deposits by SAIF insured thrift institutions of equivalent
risk classification.  This additional SAIF related assessment amount to an additional 2.120 cents per $100 of insured deposits at year-end
2000 and 1.820 at year-end 2001.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>D. COMPETITION</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Company faces intense competition in all markets it serves.  Traditional competitors are other local commercial banks, savings banks,
savings and loan institutions and credit unions, as well as local offices of major regional and money center banks.  Also, non-banking
financial organizations, such as consumer finance companies, insurance companies, securities firms, money market and mutual funds
and credit card companies offer substantive equivalents of transaction accounts  and various loan and financial products, even though
these non-banking organizations are not subject to the same regulatory restrictions and capital requirements that apply to the Company
and its subsidiary banks.  As a result of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, such non-banking financial organizations now may be in a position
not only to offer comparable products to those offered by the Company, but actually to establish, acquire or affiliate with commercial banks
themselves.

<p><strong>F. LEGISLATIVE DEVELOPMENTS</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In November 1999, Congress enacted the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ("GLBA"), which permitted bank holding companies to engage in a wider
range of financial activities.  Under GLBA for example, bank holding companies may underwrite all types of insurance and annuity products
and all types of securities products and mutual funds, and may engage in merchant banking activities.  Bank holding companies that wish
to engage in these or other newly-permitted financial activities generally must do so through separate "financial" subsidiaries and may
themselves be required to register (and qualify to register) as so-called "financial holding companies."  A bank holding company that does
not register as a financial holding company will remain a bank holding company subject to substantially the same regulatory restrictions
and permitted activities as applied to bank holding companies prior to the GLBA.  The Company has not yet elected to become a "financial
holding company" but continues to evaluate the opportunities provided by the GLBA.  Under the new law, all financial institutions are subject
to more stringent  customer privacy regulations.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In 1995, the federal bank regulatory authorities promulgated a set of revised regulations addressing the responsibilities of banking
organizations under the Community Reinvestment Act ("CRA").  The revised regulations place additional emphasis on the actual experience
of a bank in making loans in low- and moderate-income areas within its service area as a key determinant in evaluation of the bank's
compliance with the statute.  As in the prior regulations, bank regulators are authorized to bring enforcement actions against banks under
the CRA only in the context of bank expansion or acquisition transactions.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The FDIC levies assessments on various deposit obligations of the Company's banking subsidiaries.  Since 1996, the premium paid by
the best-rated banks (including the Company's subsidiary banks) has been a flat charge of $2 thousand per year. Also in that year,
Congress enacted the Deposit Insurance Funds Act, under which deposits insured by the Bank Insurance Fund ("BIF"), such as the
deposits of the Company's banks, are subject to assessment for payment on bond obligations financing the FDIC's Savings Association
Insurance Fund ("SAIF") at a rate 1/5 the rate paid on deposits by SAIF-insured thrift institutions.  Accordingly, the deposits of the
Company's banks were assessed an additional 1.160 cents per $100 of insured deposits in 1999, 1.220 cents per $100 of insured deposits
in 1998 and an additional 1.256 cents in 1997.  Beginning in 2000, the BIF and SAIF rates were equalized.  For institutions with the lowest
risk classification (including the Company) the BIF rate increased to 2.120 and the SAIF rate decreased from 5.800 to 2.120.  The rate is
adjusted quarterly, depending on the need of the fund.  At December 31, 2001 the rate had decreased to 1.820 cents per $100 of insured
deposits.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Various federal bills that would significantly affect banks are introduced in Congress from time to time.  The Company cannot estimate the
likelihood of any currently pending banking bills being enacted into law, or the ultimate effect that any such potential legislation, if enacted,
would have upon its financial condition or operations.

the three-year period ended December 31, 2001 and the financial condition of the Company as of December 31, 2001 and

<p><strong>A. OVERVIEW</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>Summary of 2001 Financial Results</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Company reported net income of $15.8 million for 2001 compared to net income of $13.7 million for 2000 and $12.9
million for 1999.  As indicated in the following table "Summary of Core Earnings," net income from each year was impacted
by non-core items, although in none of the years was the overall impact of such items material.  Net income, on a core basis,
increased $2.1 million, or 15.2%, from 2000 to 2001 after increasing $620 thousand, or 4.8%, from 1999 to 2000.  Diluted
earnings per share (stated on a core basis) increased $.25, or 14.2%, from 2000 to 2001 and $.17, or 10.7%, from 1999 to
2000.  The following analysis adjusts net income for non-core items to provide a comparative presentation of the Company's
"core" earnings.  Also presented are cash diluted earnings per share, which adds-back to core net income the amortization
of goodwill, net of tax, associated with prior period branch purchases.

<p>At December 31, 2001, the Company's tangible book value per share (shareholders' equity reduced by intangible assets
including goodwill, mortgage servicing rights and intangible pension plan assets) amounted to $10.69, an increase of $1.51,
or 16.4%, from year-end 2000.  The increase was primarily attributable to retained earnings and net unrealized gains, net
of tax, on securities available-for-sale during 2001, offset in part by periodic repurchases of the Company's common stock.
As of the last trading day of 2001, the average of the Company's bid and asked stock price was $29.40, resulting in a trading
multiple of 2.75 to tangible book value.

<p>The Board of Directors increased the quarterly cash dividend twice in 2001, to $.23 per share by the fourth quarter.  Total
cash dividends (as adjusted) were $.87 for 2001, compared to $.76 for 2000, an increase of $.11, or 14.5%.

<p>Nonperforming loans amounted to $3.4 million at December 31, 2001, an increase of $1.4 million from the prior year-end.
Total charged-off loans (net of recoveries) for 2001 were $1.3 million, as compared to $528 thousand for the prior year.   At
year-end 2001, the allowance for loan losses, at $9.7 million, represented a coverage ratio (allowance as a percentage of
nonperforming loans) of 283%.  The coverage ratio at the prior year-end was 425%.

<p><strong>Sale of Credit Card Portfolio and Servicing Business in 2000</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Prior to 2000, the Company serviced its own credit card portfolio as well as the credit card portfolios for several smaller
financial institutions.  In 2000, the Company determined that it would no longer engage in the consumer credit card servicing
business and that it would sell the business as well as its existing consumer credit card balances to MBNA America Bank,
N.A., an organization widely recognized as an industry leader.  The decision to discontinue this activity was driven by the
fact that the consumer credit card business, including both card issuance and account servicing, has increasingly become
a commodity operation that requires great scale.   Management also expected that its credit card customers would receive
a broader array of account benefits and services under MBNA's programs after the sale, and such has been the case.  The
sale, which generated a one-time nonrecurring net gain of $825 ($488 net of tax), was completed in the third quarter of 2000.
The Company continues to manage its merchant credit card and debit card programs.

<p><strong>B. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The following analysis of net interest income, the provision for loan losses, noninterest income, noninterest expense and
income taxes, highlights the factors that are primarily responsible for the Company's results of operations for 2001 and the
prior two years.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>I. NET INTEREST INCOME (Tax-equivalent Basis)

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Net interest income represents the difference between interest and dividends earned on loans, securities and other earning
assets and interest paid on deposits and other sources of funds.  Changes in net interest income result from changes in the
level and mix of earning assets and sources of funds (volume) and changes in the yields earned and interest rates paid
(rate).  Net interest margin is the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets.  Net interest income may also be
described as the product of earning assets and the net interest margin.

<p>The change in net interest income due to changes in rate in 2001 was an increase of $3.7 million, as the cost of deposits
and other funds decreased at a faster rate than the yield on interest-bearing assets.  This contrasts sharply with the
Company's experience in 2000, when the change in net interest income due to changes in rate was a decrease of $2.7
million, as the decrease in yields on interest-bearing assets outstripped the decrease in rates paid on deposits and other
funds.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The following items have a major impact on changes in net interest income due to rate:  general interest rate changes, the
ratio of the Company's rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities (interest rate sensitivity gap) during periods of interest
rate changes and the level of nonperforming loans.  The Federal Reserve Board attempts to influence prevailing federal
funds and prime interest rates and sets changes to the Federal Reserve Bank discount rate.  The following chart presents
recent changes:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Company's net interest income, for the past several years, has been very sensitive to changes in interest rates.  As
indicated in the table above, prevailing interest rates economy-wide began to increase in the second half of 1999 through
the second half of 2000.  This marked a turnaround from a long period of flat or slowly-declining prevailing interest rates.
The 1999 rate hikes had a moderate impact on the Company's financial results for 1999, which continued to show decreases
from prior periods in the average rate earned on earning assets and the average rate paid on earning liabilities, as well as
the Company's net interest spread and net interest margin.  However, the full impact of rising rates was the primary cause
of the Company's decrease in net interest income due to rates in 2000.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In the first quarter of 2001, the Federal Reserve Board reversed direction and began decreasing short-term interest rates
rapidly and significantly in response to perceived weakening in the economy.  By early December 2001, the total decrease
in prevailing short-term interest rates for the year was 475 basis points.  As a result, the Company experienced a decrease
in the cost of deposits in all quarters of 2001, and expects that this trend will continue, for a short period, as maturing time
deposits reprice at lower rates.  Although decreases in deposit rates began to be experienced in the first quarter of 2001,
the Company did not experience a decrease in the average yield in its loan portfolio until the second quarter of 2001.  See
the "Loan Portfolio" section in the discussion of "Financial Condition" later on in this Report, for a more complete analysis
of yield trends in the loan portfolio.

<p>Any further rate decreases may have a limited impact on the Company's deposit rates, both because further decreases in
deposit rates may accelerate disintermediation out of the Company's deposits and because rates on several of the
Company's deposit products, such as savings and NOW accounts, are already priced at such low levels that further
decreases in rates may not be practical or sustainable.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The net interest margin for 2001 was 4.41%, an increase of 40 basis points from the 4.01% margin for 2000.  The net interest
spread between the two years increased by 44 basis points.  These significant increases in margin and spread were
attributable to the fact that during a period of decreasing market rates the Company's paying liabilities repriced downward
at a faster rate than its earning assets.  In turn, a major factor influencing this development was the relocation of a significant
dollar amount of maturing time deposits into other lower cost deposit accounts, a relocation that, in many instances
accompanies falling interest rates and often proves temporary.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In both rising and falling rate environments, the Company faces significant competitive pricing pressures in its marketplace
for both deposits and loans, and thus ultimately both assets and liabilities may be expected to reprice proportionately in
response market rates.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The net interest margin for 2000 was 4.01%, a decrease of 30 basis points from the 4.31% margin for 1999.  The net interest
spread between the two years decreased by 34 basis points.  The decrease in margin and spread was attributable to three
main factors: (i) Generally, 2000 was a period of rising interest rates, and the cost of the Company's paying liabilities
increased at a faster rate than the yield on the Company's earning assets.  (ii) The Company continued to experience a shift
in the components of its source of funds from lower cost sources (e.g., traditional bank deposit products, including demand
deposits) to higher cost sources (e.g., Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings).  (iii) Throughout the year, the yield curve for
investment securities remained atypically flat (the normal slope of the yield curve is caused by higher yields for instruments
with longer maturities), which prevented management from obtaining a higher average yield on repriced assets.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>A discussion of the impact on net interest income resulting from changes in interest rates vis a vis the repricing patterns of
the Company's earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities is included later in this report under Item 7A, "Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk."

<p>In general, changes in the volume of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities will result in corresponding changes in
net interest income.  That is, as assets and liabilities increase, so will net interest income.  However, changes due to volume
can be enhanced or restricted by shifts within the relative mix of earning assets or interest-bearing liabilities between
instruments of different rates.  The change in net interest income due to changes in volume was an increase of $3.5 million
in 2001 and  an increase of $3.3 million in 2000.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>During 2001, average earning assets increased $73.3 million, an increase of 7.4%.  Average paying liabilities grew at a
somewhat slower pace, increasing by $48.1 million, or 5.7%.  The combined effect was to increase net interest income by
approximately 8.7%, before giving effect to the positive impact on net interest income resulting from the change in interest
rates discussed in the previous section.

<p>The Company experienced its growth in average earning assets principally within the loan portfolio.  During 2001, the
Company securitized approximately $30 million of residential real estate loan balances and retained ownership of the
resulting mortgage-backed securities for the purpose of providing additional liquidity and collateral for pledging purposes.
Without the securitization, increases in loan balances would have represented over 70% of the increase in average earning
assets between the two years.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The fastest growing segment of the loan portfolio for several years preceding 2001 was indirect consumer loans, which are
primarily auto loans financed through local dealerships from whom the Company acquires the dealer paper.  While this
segment still represents the largest portion of the loan portfolio, the outstanding balances of indirect loans remained little
changed at year-end 2001 from year-end 2000.  During 2001, adjusted for dispositions of loans through securitizations,
residential real estate loans increased $32.8 million, or 15.5%.  Commercial loans increased by $21.3 million, or 17.4%,
representing the other area of significant growth within the loan portfolio.

<p>

<p>The Company's growth in average paying liabilities in 2001 was experienced both in traditional banking deposit products,
which increased by $26.6 million, or 3.1%, from year-end 2000 to year-end 2001, and in borrowings, which increased by
$29.8 million, or 35.0%, from year-end 2000 to year-end 2001.   The increase in deposit balances during 2001 was generated
by the Company's pre-existing branch network.  No branches were added or acquired in 2001.  The primary source of new
borrowings by the Company in 2001 was advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) (see Note 10 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>During 2000, average earning assets increased $83.3 million, an increase of 9.2%.  Average paying liabilities grew at a
somewhat faster pace, increasing by $80.5 million, or 10.5%.  The combined effect was to increase net interest income by
approximately 8.5%, before giving effect to the negative impact on net interest income resulting from the change in interest
rates discussed in the previous section.  Even this latter negative effect did not outweigh the positive effect of increased size,
however.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Company experienced its growth in average earning assets during 2000 principally within the loan portfolio, which
increased $97.3 million, or 16.2%.  The fastest growing segment of the portfolio was indirect consumer loans.  Average
indirect loans increased $72.1 million, or 33.5%, from 1999 to 2000.  The average balance of commercial loans increased
$17.4 million, or 17.0%, during the year.  The Company also experienced growth in the average balance of residential real
estate loans of $8.1 million, or 4.1%, from 1999 to 2000.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>While the Company experienced most of its growth in average paying liabilities from traditional banking deposit products,
which increased by $51.4 million, or 7.6%, from 1999 to 2000, the greatest percentage growth in liabilities occurred in FHLB
borrowings which increased by $24.6 million, or  48.2%, above the average level in the prior year.  The negative impact on
margins resulting from this shift in liabilities from lower to higher cost was discussed in the previous section of this Report,
"Change in Net Interest Income Due to Rates."  The increase in deposit balances during 2000 occurred in the Company's
existing branch network, with the only physical expansion during 2000 being the addition of a drive-up office in the
Ticonderoga market.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Increases in the volume of loans and deposits, as well as yields and costs by type,  are discussed later in this report under
Item 7.C. "Financial Condition."

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>II. PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Management considers its accounting policy relating to the allowance for loan losses to be a critical accounting policy given
the inherent uncertainty involved in evaluating the level of the allowance required to cover credit losses inherent in the loan
portfolio, and the material effect that such judgments can have on the Company's results of operations.  See Note 1 to the
consolidated financial statements, as well as the discussion below, for a description of the Company's policy with respect
to estimating the level of the allowance for loan losses.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Through the provision for loan losses, an allowance (reserve) is maintained for estimated loan losses.  Actual loan losses
are charged against this allowance when loans are deemed uncollectible.  In evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for
loan losses, management considers various risk factors influencing asset quality.  The analysis is performed on a loan by
loan basis for impaired and large balance loans, and by portfolio type for smaller balance homogeneous loans. This analysis
is based on judgments and estimates and may change in response to economic developments or other conditions that may
influence borrowers' financial conditions or prospects.

<p>The determination of actual provisions for loan losses on an ongoing basis is largely influenced by the prevailing level of
nonperforming loans, the level of loans actually charged-off against the allowance for loan losses during the prior periods,
contemporary changes in the mix and volume of loan categories within the loan portfolio and overall changes in the size of
the portfolio.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The provision for loan losses was $2.3 million for 2001, an increase of $818 thousand, or 55.6%, from 2000. The increase
from 2000 reflected increases in net charge-offs and nonperforming loans as well as an increase in total loans outstanding.


<p>During 2001, loan losses charged against the allowance, net of recoveries, were $1.3 million, an increase of $768 thousand,
or 145%, from the prior year amount.  During the second quarter of 2001, the Company charged-off $512 thousand on one
commercial loan.  Management believes that the factors leading to this charge-off are unique and isolated and are not
indicative of any emerging pattern of increasing charge-offs above historical levels.  However, if the current economic
recession continues or worsens, management anticipates that net charge-offs will exceed the levels experienced in recent
years.  Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding was .17% for 2001.  The provision for loan losses, as
a percentage of average loans outstanding was .31% for 2001.  Net charge-offs, on an annualized basis,  for the Company's
peer group at September 30, 2001 was .26% of average loans, or 52.9% higher than the Company's ratio.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>At December 31, 2001, nonperforming loans amounted to $3.4 million, an increase of $1.4 million, or 67.3%, from the
balance at year-end 2000.  The increase is primarily attributable to two commercial loans, totaling $1.6 million, which were
placed on nonaccrual status during the fourth quarter of 2001.  The allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2001, includes
a specific reserve of $800 thousand for these two loans.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>At December 31, 2001, the allowance for loan losses was $9.7 million, or 1.29%, of total loans, as compared to $8.7 million,
or 1.19% of total loans at December 31, 2000.  The allowance for loan losses represented 283% of the amount of
nonperforming loans at that date.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The provision for loan losses was $1.5 million for 2000, an increase of $47 thousand, or 3.3%, from 1999.  At December 31,
2000, nonperforming loans amounted to $2.1 million, essentially unchanged from the balance at December 31, 1999.  At
December 31, 2000, the allowance for loan losses was $8.7 million, or 1.19%, of total loans.  The allowance for loan losses
represented 425% of the amount of nonperforming loans at that date.  During 2000, loan losses charged against the
allowance, net of recoveries, were $528 thousand, or .08%, of average loans for the period, an increase of $146 thousand,
or 38%, from the prior year amount.  The principal reason for the increase in net loan losses in 2000 as compared with 1999
was a recovery of $315 thousand in the 1999 period related to the final repayment of a large commercial loan.  Excluding
the large recovery, net loan losses for 1999 represented .12% of average loans.  The provision for loan losses charged to
expense for 2000 was $1.5 million, or .21%, of average loans for the period.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The provision for loan losses was $1.4 million for 1999, an increase of $38 thousand, or 2.7%, from 1998.  As in the case
of the slightly increased provision for 2000, the increased provision in 1999 reflected a shift in the mix of loan categories
within the loan portfolio to loans characterized by slightly greater risk, as opposed to any increase in nonperforming loans
or gross charge-offs, both of which decreased in 1999 compared to 1998 levels.  At December 31, 1999, nonperforming
loans amounted to $2.1 million, a decrease of 28.4% from the balance at December 31, 1998.  The decrease was primarily
attributable to one large commercial loan, originally placed on nonaccrual status during 1997, which was fully repaid in 1999.
At December 31, 1999, the allowance for loan losses was $7.8 million, or 1.19% of total loans.  The allowance for loan losses
represented 371% of the amount of nonperforming loans at that date.  During 1999, loan losses charged against the
allowance, net of recoveries, were $382 thousand, or .06%, of average loans for the period.  The principal reason for the
decrease in net loan losses was a recovery in 1999 of $315 thousand related to the final repayment of the large commercial
loan cited above.  Excluding the large recovery, net loan losses for 1999 were .12% of average loans.  The provision for loan
losses charged to expense for 1999 was $1.4 million, or .24%, of average loans for the period.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The quality of the Company's loan portfolio remains strong and, to date, has not been negatively affected either by the loan
growth experienced in recent periods or by the recent weakening in the national and regional economy.  At period-end, the
ratio of nonperforming loans (loans 90 days or more and accruing interest plus nonaccrual loans) as a percentage of total
loans was .46% for the Company.  The September 30, 2001 ratio for the Company's peer group was .79%.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>While management believes that the 2001 year-end allowance was adequate under the circumstances, there can be no
assurances that future economic or financial developments, including general interest rate increases or a slowdown in the
economy, might not lead to increased provisions to the allowance or a higher incidence of loan charge-offs.

<p>III. OTHER INCOME

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The majority of other (i.e., noninterest) income constitutes fee income from services, principally fees and commissions from
fiduciary services, deposit account service charges, computer processing fees to correspondents and other "core" or
recurring fee income.  Net gains or losses on the sale of securities available-for-sale is another category of other income.

<p>Total other income increased $330 thousand, or 3.2%, from 2000 to 2001.  Without regard to net securities transactions and
the net gain on the sale of the credit card portfolio, total other income was $10.3 million for 2001 and $10.0 million for 2000,
an increase of $365 thousand, or 3.7%.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>For 2001, income from fiduciary activities increased $378 thousand, or 10.3%, from 2000.  The increase was in large part
attributable to an increase in the number of trust accounts under administration and investment management.   At year-end
2001, the market value of assets under trust administration and investment management amounted to $699.0 million, a
decrease of $46.1 million, or 6.2%, from year-end 2000.  The decrease in the market value of assets under trust
administration and investment management principally reflects the general decline in the equity market conditions during
2001.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Income from fiduciary activities includes income from funds under investment management in the Company-advised North
Country Funds, which include the North Country Equity Growth Fund (NCEGX) and the North Country Intermediate Bond
Fund (NCBDX).  These funds reached a market value of $82.5 million at December 31, 2001.  The funds were introduced
in March 2001, and are advised by the Company's subsidiary, North Country Investment Advisors, Inc.  Currently, the funds
consist almost entirely of qualified employee benefit plan accounts.  The Company expects that the funds will be offered on
a retail basis at some point in the future.  The funds also include accounts for the Company's pension plan, with a market
value of $12.0 million at December 31, 2001.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Fees for other services to customers include deposit service charges, credit card merchant processing fees, safe deposit
box fees and loan servicing fees.  These fees amounted to $5.3 million in 2001, an increase of $80 thousand, or 1.5%, from
2000.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>During 2001, the Company realized net securities gains of $195 thousand on the sale of $13.5 million from its available-for-sale portfolio.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In the past, the primary component of other operating income was fees earned on servicing credit card portfolios for
correspondent banks.  With the sale of the credit card portfolio at the end of the third quarter of 2000, the Company also
discontinued servicing credit card portfolios for most of its correspondent banks.  Thus, income from servicing credit card
portfolios decreased significantly between the two years, falling to  $224 thousand in 2001 from $486 thousand in 2000.
Beginning in 2002, the Company will discontinue servicing the remainder of the correspondent banks' portfolios.  Other
operating income also includes net gains on the sale of loans and other real estate owned, if any, as well as other
miscellaneous revenues.  For 2001, other operating income decreased $93 thousand, or 8.8%.  Disregarding the credit card
servicing component, other operating income actually increased by $169 thousand, or 29.6%.  The increase was primarily
attributable to data processing servicing fee income received from one upstate New York bank.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Total other income increased $811 thousand, or 8.6%, from 1999 to 2000.  Without regard to net securities transactions and
one-time nonrecurring items, total other income was $10.0 million for 2000 and $9.1 million for 1999, an increase of $860
thousand, or 9.5%.

<p>For 2000, income from fiduciary activities increased $398 thousand, or 12.1%, from 1999.  The increase was in large part
attributable to an increase in both the number of trust accounts and total assets under administration.   At year-end 2000,
trust assets under administration amounted to $734.7 million, an increase of $37.7 million, or 5.4%, from year-end 1999.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Fees for other services to customers include deposit service charges, credit card merchant processing fees, safe deposit
box fees and loan servicing fees.  These fees amounted to $5.2 million in 2000, an increase of $423 thousand, or 8.8%, from
1999.  The increase in 2000 was primarily attributable to three areas: (i) increased fee income from processing merchant
credit card transactions, (ii) increased service charges on deposit accounts, and (iii) increased brokerage fee income.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>During 2000, the Company realized net securities losses of $595 thousand on the sale of $47.1 million from its available-for-sale portfolio.  In the third quarter of 2000, the Company restructured a portion of its securities available-for-sale portfolio.
During that quarter, the Company sold $47.0 million of securities with a weighted average yield of 6.22% at a net loss of $601
thousand reflecting general price declines in the debt market during a period of rising rates.  The Company reinvested a
substantial portion of the proceeds in $35.2 million of securities with a weighted average yield of 7.16%.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The sale of the credit card portfolio in 2000 was discussed in the Overview at the beginning of Item 7.

<p>In the past, the primary component of other operating income was fees earned on servicing credit card portfolios for
correspondent banks.  With the sale of the credit card portfolio at the end of the third quarter of 2000, the Company also
discontinued servicing credit card portfolios for most of its correspondent banks.  Income from servicing credit card portfolios
amounted to $486 thousand (for nine months) in 2000 and $504 thousand for a full year in 1999.   For 2000, other operating
income decreased $244 thousand, or 18.8%.  Only a small part of this decrease was attributable to the discontinuation of
servicing correspondents' credit card portfolios.  As discussed above, the discontinuation of this business had a much greater
negative effect on other operating income in 2001 (although this income reduction was offset by corresponding decreases
in related expense).   Most of the decrease in other operating income between 1999 and 2000 was attributable to a
nonrecurring event in the 1999 period, which was an award from a federally funded program to encourage lending in
designated economically deprived areas.  On a recurring basis, other operating income increased $39 thousand, or 3.8%,
from 1999 to 2000.  The increase was primarily attributable to a gain on the sale of other real estate owned and increased
Canadian exchange fee income.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>One comparative measure of operating expenses for financial institutions is the efficiency ratio.  The ratio is calculated as
the ratio of other expense to the sum of tax equivalent net interest income and other income.  Excluded from the components
are goodwill amortization and any non-recurring items.  For 2001, the efficiency ratio for the Company was 51.7%.  The
Federal Reserve Bank's "Bank Holding Company Peer Report" does not exclude goodwill amortization.  On that basis, the
Company's ratio was 53.4%, which compares favorably to the year-to-date ratio for the Company's peer group of 61.3% as
of September 30, 2001.

<p>Salaries and employee benefits increased $1.6 million, or 10.5%, from 2000 to 2001.    Salaries increased  $655 thousand,
or 5.8%, from 2000 to 2001.  The increase was attributable to normal merit pay increases, as well as to the hiring of
additional employees in 2001 principally to staff the new West Avenue office of Saratoga National Bank and Trust Company
in Saratoga Springs, New York, and the Company's new insurance agency subsidiary.  Employee benefits increased $986
thousand, or 22.5% during the period. In 2001, all categories of employee benefits experienced increases from 2000,
including $184 thousand for pension plan expenses, $263 thousand related to health and similar benefit plans and $476
thousand related to incentive compensation plans.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Occupancy expense increased $270 thousand, or 13.7%, from 2000 to 2001. Most of the increase was attributable to
increased costs in building maintenance and insurance.  Furniture and equipment expense decreased slightly by $4
thousand, or 0.2%, from 2000 to 2001.  Other operating expense increased $1.1 million, or 14.0%, from 2000 to 2001.  Areas
of other expense experiencing the greatest increases were advertising ($141 thousand), supplies ($156 thousand), legal and
other professional fees ($162 thousand) and the cost of third party computer processing for trust operations ($429 thousand).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Amortization of goodwill is a component of other operating expense.  Currently, the FASB has stated that the unidentifiable
intangible asset acquired in the acquisition of a bank or thrift (including acquisitions of branches), where the fair value of the
liabilities assumed exceeds the fair value of the assets acquired,  should continue to be accounted for under SFAS No. 72,
"Accounting for Certain Acquisitions of Banking or Thrift Institutions."  Under SFAS No. 72, all of the intangible assets
associated with branch acquisitions recorded on the Company's consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2001 would
continue to be amortized, as in prior periods.  The FASB has announced that additional research will be performed to decide
whether unidentifiable intangible assets recorded under SFAS No. 72 should instead be accounted for using the non-amortization approach specified for goodwill under SFAS No. 142.  However, issuance of a final opinion with respect to this
matter is not presently expected until the fourth quarter of 2002.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Other expense for 2000 amounted to $27.6 million, an increase of $284 thousand, or 1.0%, from 1999.  All components of
other expense were impacted to some extent by the third quarter sale of the credit card portfolio and winding down the
operations of the credit card department, which generally served to keep the overall increase in other expense to a minimal
level.  The two senior employees of the credit card department retired at the end of 2000.  Most of the other employees were
redeployed in other areas of the Company's operations to replace retiring or departing employees in those areas.  Most other
operating expenses associated with the credit card department were discontinued effective upon the sale.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Salaries and employee benefits increased $432 thousand, or 2.8%, from 1999 to 2000.   Employee benefits increased $66
thousand, or 1.5% during the period.  Salaries increased  $366 thousand, or 3.4%, from 1999 to 2000.  Most of the increase
was attributable to normal merit pay increases.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Occupancy expense increased $148 thousand, or 8.1%, from 1999 to 2000. Most of the increase was attributable to
maintenance and depreciation expense on capital improvements at the six branches acquired from Fleet in 1997, as well
as the new drive-up branch in Ticonderoga.  Furniture and equipment expense increased slightly by $31 thousand, or 1.3%,
from 1999 to 2000.  Other operating expense decreased $327 thousand, or 4.2%, from 1999 to 2000.  The decrease was
attributable to an item of nonrecurring expense in 1999.  On a recurring basis, other operating expense was essentially
unchanged from 1999.

<p>Investment securities are classified as held-to-maturity, trading, or available-for-sale, depending on the purposes for which
such securities were acquired and are being held.  Securities held-to-maturity are debt securities that the Company has both
the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity; such securities are stated at amortized cost.  Debt and equity securities that
are bought and held principally for the purpose of sale in the near term are classified as trading securities and are reported
at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings.  Debt and equity securities not classified as either held-to-maturity or trading securities are classified as available-for-sale and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and

<p>The yields on debt securities shown in the table above are calculated by dividing annual interest, including accretion of
discounts and amortization of premiums, by the amortized cost of the securities at December 31, 2001.  Yields on obligations
of states and municipalities exempt from federal taxation were computed on a fully tax-equivalent basis using a marginal
tax rate of 35%.  Dividend earnings derived from equity securities were adjusted to reflect applicable federal income tax
exclusions.

<p>At December 31, 2001 and 2000, the weighted average maturity was 4.2 and 4.5 years, respectively, for debt securities in
the available-for-sale portfolio.  At December 31, 2001, the net unrealized gain on securities available-for-sale amounted
to $2.7 million.  The net unrealized gain or loss, net of tax on such securities, is reflected in accumulated other
comprehensive income/loss.  The net unrealized gain at December 31, 2001 represents a $2.9 million increase in net
unrealized gain  since December 31, 2000 and is primarily attributable to falling interest rates during 2001.

<p>In the four years prior to 2001, the Company experienced strong growth in the area of indirect loans.  Indirect loans are
almost entirely auto vehicle acquisition loans to consumers financed through local dealerships where, by prior arrangement,
the Company acquires the dealer paper. In 2001, however, this sector of the portfolio remained flat, as the balance at year-end 2001 was essentially unchanged from December 31, 2000.  As a percentage of total loans, indirect loans equalled 42%
for both years.  During 2001, normal amortization and prepayments offset new originations, each amounting to approximately
$146 million, or 46% of the outstanding balances.  Prepayments accelerated in 2001 as manufacturers offered attractive
incentives during the fall of 2001.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Residential real estate loans represented the second largest segment at year-end 2001, at 34% of total loans.  This segment
decreased $5.5 million, or 2.1%, from the prior year-end. Originations exceeded repayments by approximately $25 million,
however, the portfolio declined slightly due to the $30 million in loan securitizations cited earlier in this report.  The loans
securitized in 2001 were not sold, but were transferred to the Company's securities available-for-sale portfolio.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In 2001, for the third year in a row, the Company experienced significant growth in commercial and commercial real estate
loans outstanding.  At December 31, 2001 these loans had increased $22.4 million, or 17.1%, over year-end 2000 levels.
These loans represented 21% of total loans outstanding, increasing from 18% at year-end 2000.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>During 2000, as in the preceding four years, the Company experienced strong growth in the area of indirect loans.
Compared to year-end 1999, these loans had increased $57.8 million at year-end 2000, or 22.5%, and represented the
largest segment of the Company's loan portfolio, constituting 42% of total  loans.  Residential real estate loans, the second
largest segment at year-end 2000, at 36% of total loans, increased $12.7 million, or 5.0%, from the prior year-end.  The
Company also experienced growth in its commercial and commercial real estate loans outstanding.  At December 31, 2000
these loans had increased $17.9 million, or 15.8%, over year-end 1999 levels.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>During 1999, the Company experienced strong growth in the area of indirect automobile loans.  Compared to year-end 1998,
these loans increased $78 million, or 43.6%, and became the largest segment of the Company's loan portfolio, contributing
39% of total  loans.  Residential real estate loans, the second largest segment at 39% of total loans at year-end 1999,
increased $14 million, or 6.0%, from the prior year-end.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">

<p>In general, management expects the Company's yield on its loan portfolio will be impacted by actions the Federal Reserve
Board takes from time to time affecting prevailing interest rates.  There is a time lag, however, between the Federal
Reserve's changes in prevailing rates and the impact of those changes on the Company's loan portfolio.  As discussed above
in this Report in the section entitled "Changes in Net Interest Income Due to Rate," prevailing interest rates, after increasing
steadily throughout 2000, decreased steadily in 2001 in response to the Federal Reserve Board's sizable rate-cutting actions
during all four quarters of 2001.  The yield on the Company's loan portfolio has been and will continue to be affected by these
rate changes, although the decrease in average yields on loans and other earning assets has lagged behind the decrease
in average rates paid on deposits.  Nevertheless, loan yields did generally begin to fall over the second half of 2001.  Many
of the loans in the commercial portfolio have variable rates tied to prime or U.S. Treasury indices.   Additionally, there is a
significant amount of cash flow from normal amortization and prepayments in all loan categories, and this cash flow reprices
at current rates as new loans are generated at the lower current yields.

<p>The following table indicates the respective maturities and repricing structure of the Company's commercial, financial and
agricultural loans and its real estate - construction loans at December 31, 2001.  For purposes of determining relevant
maturities, loans are assumed to mature at (but not before) their scheduled repayment dates as required by contractual
terms.  Demand loans and overdrafts are included in the "Within 1 Year" maturity category.  All of the real estate -
construction loans are for single family houses where the Company has made a commitment for permanent financing.

<p>COMMITMENTS AND LINES OF CREDIT

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Letters of credit represent extensions of credit granted in the normal course of business which are not reflected in the
financial statements because the commitments were not yet funded.  As of December 31, 2001, the total contingent liability
for standby letters of credit amounted to $1.2 million.  In addition to these instruments, the Company has issued lines of credit
to customers, including home equity lines of credit, commitments for residential and commercial construction loans and other
personal and commercial lines of credit, which also may be unfunded or only partially funded from time to time.  Commercial
lines, generally issued for a period of one year, are usually extended to provide for the working capital requirements of the
borrower.  At December 31, 2001, the Company had outstanding unfunded loan commitments in the aggregate amount of
approximately $108.7 million.

<p>NONACCRUAL, PAST DUE AND RESTRUCTURED LOANS

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Company designates loans as nonaccrual when the payment of interest and/or principal is due and unpaid for a
designated period (generally 90 days) or when the likelihood of the full repayment of principal and interest is, in the opinion
of management, uncertain.  Under the Uniform Retail Credit Classification and Account Management Policy, established by
banking regulators, closed-end loans must generally be charged-off when 120 days past due.  Open-end credits and
residential real estate loans should be charged-off when 180 days past due.  Commercial loans are evaluated for charge-off
on a loan-by-loan basis.  There were no material commitments to lend additional funds on outstanding nonaccrual loans at
December 31, 2001.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest, as identified in the following table, are those loans which were
contractually past due 90 days or more but because of expected repayments, were still accruing interest.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>SFAS No. 114 requires that all impaired loans, except for large groups of smaller-balance homogeneous loans, be measured
based on (I) the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, (II) the loan's
observable market price or (III) the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.  The Company applies the
provisions of SFAS No. 114 to all impaired commercial and commercial real estate loans over $250,000, and to all
restructured loans.  Reserves for losses for the remaining smaller-balance loans are evaluated under SFAS No. 5.  Under
the provisions of SFAS No. 114, the Company determines impairment for collateralized loans based on fair value of the
collateral less estimated cost to sell.  For other loans, impairment is determined by comparing the recorded value of the loan
to the present value of the expected cash flows, discounted at the loan's effective interest rate.  The Company determines
the interest income recognition method on a loan by loan basis.  Based upon the borrowers' payment histories and cash flow
projections, interest recognition methods include full accrual, cash basis and cost recovery.

<p>At December 31, 2001, two commercial loans were considered impaired loans under SFAS No. 114 with a recorded
investment of $1.6 million, an allowance for loan losses of $800 thousand and a net carrying amount of $800 thousand.
These loans were included in nonaccrual loans in the schedule of nonperforming loans above. There were no impaired loans
at December 31, 2000 or 1999 within the scope of  SFAS No. 114.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>At December 31, 2001, nonperforming loans amounted to $3.4 million, an increase of $1.4 million, or 67.3%, from the
balance at year-end 2000.  The increase was attributable to two commercial loans, totaling $1.6 million, which were placed
on nonaccrual status during the fourth quarter of 2001.  The allowance for loan losses, at December 31, 2001, included a
specific reserve of $800 thousand for these two loans.  Total nonperforming loans, at year-end 2001, represented .46% of
period-end loans, an increase from .28% at year-end 2000.  The ratio of nonperforming loans to average loans for the
Company's peer group at September 30, 2001 was .79%, or 71.7% higher than the Company's ratio at December 31, 2001.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>During 2001 income recognized on year-end balances of nonaccrual loans was $189 thousand.  Income that would have
been recognized during that period on nonaccrual loans if all such had been current in accordance with their original terms
and had been outstanding throughout the period (or since origination if held for part of the period) was $258 thousand.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>At December 31, 2000, nonaccrual loans amounted to $1.8 million, a decrease of $33 thousand from December 31, 1999.
Loans past due 90 or more days and still accruing interest amounted to $298 thousand at December 31, 2000, a decrease
of $9 thousand from December 31, 1999.  Total nonperforming loans, at year-end 2000, represented .28% of period-end
loans, a decrease from .32% at year-end 1999.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>During 2000 income recognized on year-end balances of nonaccrual loans was $75 thousand.  Income that would have been
recognized during that period on nonaccrual loans if all such had been current in accordance with their original terms and
had been outstanding throughout the period (or since origination if held for part of the period) was $176 thousand.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>At December 31, 1999, nonaccrual loans amounted to $1.8 million, a decrease of $480 thousand from December 31, 1998.
The decrease was primarily attributable to one large commercial loan which was originally placed on nonaccrual status
during 1997 and the final portion of which was repaid in 1999.  Loans past due 90 or more days and still accruing interest
amounted to $307 thousand at December 31, 1999, a decrease of $350 thousand from December 31, 1998.  Total
nonperforming loans at year-end 1999 represented .32% of period-end loans, a decrease from .54% at year-end 1998.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>During 1999 income recognized on year-end balances of nonaccrual loans was $120 thousand.  Income that would have
been recognized during that period on nonaccrual loans if all such had been current in accordance with their original terms
and had been outstanding throughout the period (or since origination if held for part of the period) was $171 thousand.

<p>POTENTIAL PROBLEM LOANS

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>On at least a quarterly basis, the Company applies an internal credit quality rating system to commercial loans that are either
past due or fully performing loans which may exhibit certain characteristics that could reflect a potential weakness.  Loans
are placed on nonaccrual status when the likely amount of future principal and interest payments are expected to be less
than the contractual amounts, even if such loans are not 90 days past due.  Because of this approach toward placing
commercial loans on nonaccrual status, the Company normally does not identify any significant number of potential  problem
loans in its portfolio that do not otherwise meet one of the classifications discussed above (e.g., nonaccrual, troubled debt
restructurings).  At year-end 2001, the Company had identified only one credit that, although still accruing interest, exhibited
such significant weakness as to warrant mention as a potential problem.  A portion of this commercial credit, totaling $850
thousand, had been placed on nonaccrual status, while the remaining amount of the credit, totaling $2.4 million, was
identified as a potential problem loan.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The balance of other non-current loans to which interest income was being accrued (i.e. loans 30-89 days past due as
defined in bank regulatory agency guidance) totaled $6.4 million at December 31, 2001 and represented 0.85% of loans
outstanding at that date.  These non-current loans were composed of approximately $4.8 million of consumer loans,
principally indirect motor vehicle loans, $1.1 million of residential real estate loans and commercial loans of $.5 million.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The overall level of the Company's performing loans which demonstrate characteristics of potential weakness from time to
time is for the most part dependent on economic conditions in northeastern New York State.  In general, the economy in the
Company's geographic market area was relatively strong in the 1997-2000 period.  As the country slid into a mild recession
in 2001, the economic downturn was not as severe in northeastern New York State.  In the "Capital District" in and around
Albany and north of the Capital District, in the Company's principal service areas, unemployment remained below the national
average, although the total number of jobs decreased slightly over the past year.  Unemployment remains above the national
average in Essex County, near the Canadian border, even though the total number employed increased slightly.

<p>Other real estate owned (OREO) consists of real property acquired in foreclosure.  OREO is carried at the lower of (i) fair
value less estimated cost to sell or (ii) the recorded investment in the loan at the date of foreclosure, or cost.  The Company
establishes allowances for OREO losses.  The allowances are established and monitored on a property by property basis
and reflect management's ongoing estimate of the difference between the property's estimated fair value less costs to sell
and cost, when the estimated fair value less costs to sell is less than cost.  For all periods, all OREO was held for sale.

<p>III. SUMMARY OF LOAN LOSS EXPERIENCE

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Company monitors credit quality through a continuous review of the entire loan portfolio.  All significant loans (primarily
commercial and commercial real estate loans) are reviewed at least semi-annually, and those under special supervision are
reviewed at least quarterly.  Additionally, regulatory examiners perform periodic examinations of the Company's loan
portfolios and report on these examinations to management. The boards of directors of the Company's subsidiary banks,
upon recommendations from management, determine the extent of charge-offs and have the final decision-making
responsibility in authorizing charge-offs.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Through the provision for loan losses, an allowance (reserve) is maintained for estimated loan losses.  Actual loan losses
are charged against this allowance when they are identified.  In evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses,
management considers various risk factors influencing asset quality.  The analysis is performed on a loan by loan basis for
impaired and large balance loans, and by portfolio type for smaller balance homogeneous loans. This analysis is based on
judgments and estimates and may change in response to economic developments or other conditions that may influence
borrowers' economic outlook and financial condition and prospects.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In addition to conclusions regarding the adequacy of the allowance, the provision for loan losses is influenced by the level
of nonperforming loans, by the level of loans actually charged-off against the allowance during prior periods and the change
in the mix of loan categories within the loan portfolio.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The table in Part II, Item 7.B.II. "Provision for Loan Losses and Allowance for Loan Losses" presents a summary of the
activity in the Company's allowance for loan losses.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>ALLOCATION OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The allowance for loan losses is a general allowance applicable to losses inherent in the loan portfolio.  For internal operating
purposes, the allowance is not allocated among loan categories.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In the following table, the allowance has been allocated among the loan categories indicated solely for purposes of complying
with disclosure requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission.  However, this allocation should not be interpreted
as a projection of (I) likely sources of future charge-offs, (II) likely proportional distribution of future charge-offs among loan
categories or (III) likely amounts of future charge-offs.  Since management regards the allowance as a general balance and
has assigned unallocated values to categories in the table solely for purposes of compliance with the disclosure
requirements, the amounts presented do not represent the total balance available to absorb future charge-offs that might
occur within the designated categories.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>On a quarterly basis, management risk-classifies delinquent or problem loans (except for consumer installment loans and
residential real estate loans) as special mention, substandard, doubtful or loss.  Reserves are assigned to all loans by either
a specific allocation, a risk-classified loss percentage or by a percentage applied to individual categories of loans.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Subject to the qualifications noted above, an allocation of the allowance for loan losses by principal classification and the
proportion of the related loan balance is presented below as of December 31 for each of the years indicated.

<p>The Company typically experiences seasonally high balances in the first and last quarters of the year due to the cyclicality
of municipal deposits which typically are included in time deposits of $100,000 or more.  In comparing average deposits for
the fourth quarters of 2001 and 2000, balances increased $26.6 million, or 3.1%.  All categories of non-maturity deposits
increased between the two quarters.  As is typical in falling rate environments, many depositors placed maturing time
deposits in non-maturity deposits during the third and fourth quarters of 2001, presumably as a temporary investment until
rates start to rise again.  This was also true for the Company's municipal depositors who also maintained high balances in
NOW accounts at year-end 2001 compared to year-end 2000.  The total quarterly average balances as a percentage of total
deposits are illustrated in the table below.

<p>In general, rates paid by the Company on its various types of deposit accounts are influenced by the rates being offered or
paid by its competitors, which themselves are influenced by prevailing interest rates in the economy as impacted from time
to time by the actions of the Federal Reserve Board.  There typically is a time lag between the Federal Reserve's actions
undertaken to influence rates and the actual repricing of deposit liabilities by the Company, but the lag is shorter in duration
than the lag for loans and other earning assets.  As a result of the eleven rate decreases by the Federal Reserve Board
beginning early in January 2001, the Company experienced a decrease in the cost of deposits in each of the quarters in
2001.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If, as many believe, the Federal Reserve Board concludes that the 2001 recession is over and the Board initiates no further
rate decreases, the Company may experience some further limited decreases in time deposit rates, but continuing decreases
in loan yields may be somewhat greater and may occur over a longer period of time. This may lead to downward pressures
on both net interest income and net interest margin.

<p><strong>D. LIQUIDITY</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Liquidity is measured by the ability of the Company to raise cash when it needs it at a reasonable cost.  The Company must
be capable of meeting expected and unexpected obligations to its customers at any time.   Given the uncertain nature of
customer demands as well as the need to maximize earnings, the Company must have available reasonably priced sources
of funds, on- and off-balance sheet, that can be accessed quickly in time of need.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Securities available-for-sale represent a primary source of balance sheet cash flow.  Certain investment securities are
selected at purchase as available-for-sale based on their marketability and collateral value, as well as their yield and maturity.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In addition to liquidity arising from balance sheet cash flows, the Company has supplemented liquidity with additional off-balance sheet sources such as credit lines with the Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB").  The Company has established
overnight and 30 day term lines of credit with the FHLB each in the amount of $56.6 million at December 31, 2001.  There
were no advances under either line at December 31, 2001.  If advanced, such lines of credit are collateralized by mortgage-backed securities, loans and FHLB stock.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In addition, the Company has in place modest borrowing facilities from correspondent banks and also has identified
wholesale and retail repurchase agreements and brokered certificates of deposit as appropriate off-balance sheet sources
of funding.  Also, the Company's lead bank has established a borrowing facility with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York,
pledging certain consumer loans as collateral for potential "discount window" advances.  At December 31, 2001, the amount
available under this facility was $124.4 million.  There were no advances outstanding at December 31, 2001.  The Company
measures and monitors its basic liquidity as a ratio of liquid assets to short-term liabilities, both with and without the
availability of borrowing arrangements.  Based on the level of cash flows from the Company's investment securities portfolio,
particularly mortgage-backed securities, and loans, a stable core deposit base and significant borrowing capacity, the
Company believes that liquidity is sufficient to meet any reasonably likely events or occurrences.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>E. CAPITAL RESOURCES AND DIVIDENDS</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Shareholders' equity was $91.5 million at December 31, 2001, an increase of $10.7 million, or 13.3%, from the prior year-end.  The increase in shareholders' equity during 2001 primarily reflected $9.2 million of retained earnings and an increase
of $1.8 million related to net unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, on securities available-for-sale, partially offset by $1.8
million of periodic repurchases of the Company's common stock.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In December 1999, the Company, through a newly-formed subsidiary business trust, privately placed $5 million in capital
securities with several institutional investors.  The securities have certain features that make them an alternative funding
vehicle and the proceeds qualify as regulatory capital under the capital adequacy guidelines discussed below.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The maintenance of appropriate capital levels is a management priority.  Overall capital adequacy is monitored on an
ongoing basis by management and reviewed regularly by the Board of Directors.  The Company's principal capital planning
goal is to provide an adequate return to shareholders while retaining a sufficient base to provide for future expansion and
comply with all regulatory standards.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>One set of regulatory capital guidelines applicable to the Company and the subsidiary banks are the so-called risk-based
capital measures.  Under these measures, as established by federal bank regulators, the minimum ratio of "Tier 1" capital
to risk-weighted assets is 4.0% and the minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets is 8.0%.  For the Company,
Tier 1 capital is comprised of shareholders' equity and capital securities issued by the Company's subsidiary business trust
less intangible assets.  Total capital, for this risk-based capital standard, includes Tier 1 capital plus other qualifying
regulatory capital, including a portion of the Company's allowance for loan losses.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In addition to the risk-based capital measures, the federal bank regulatory agencies require banks and bank holding
companies to satisfy another capital guideline, the Tier 1 leverage ratio (Tier 1 capital to quarterly average assets less
intangible assets).  The minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio is 3.0% for the most highly rated institutions.  The guidelines provide
that other institutions should maintain a Tier 1 leverage ratio that is at least 1.0% to 2.0% higher than the 3.0% minimum level
for top-rated institutions.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The table below sets forth the capital ratios of the Company and its subsidiary banks as of December 31, 2001:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>At December 31, 2001, the Company and both of its subsidiary banks exceeded the minimum capital ratios established by
these guidelines, and qualified as "well-capitalized", the highest category, in the capital classification scheme set by federal
bank regulatory agencies (see the further discussion under "Supervision and Regulation" in Part I, Item C. of this report).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The principal source of funds for the payment of shareholder dividends by the Company has been dividends declared and
paid to the Company by its bank subsidiaries.  There are various legal and regulatory limitations applicable to the payment
of dividends to the Company by its subsidiaries as well as the payment of dividends by the Company to its shareholders.
As of December 31, 2001, under this statutory limitation, the maximum amount that could have been paid by the bank
subsidiaries to the Company, without special regulatory approval, was approximately $19.2 million.  The ability of the
Company and the banks to pay dividends in the future is, and is expected to continue to be influenced by regulatory policies,
capital guidelines and applicable laws.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>See Part II, Item 5 "Market for the Registrant's Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters" for a recent history of the
Company's cash dividend payments.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>F. FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Company reported net income of $4.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2001, an increase of $794 thousand, or 22.3%,
from the fourth quarter of 2000.  Diluted earnings per common share for the respective quarters was $.56 and $.46,
respectively.  The increase in earnings was primarily attributable to a $2.9 million increase in net interest income, offset in
part by an increase of $1.2 million in non-interest expense. The factors contributing to the quarter-to-quarter increase in net
income and changes in financial condition are included with the discussion of the year-to-year changes in this report.

<p><u>Item 7A</u>:  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In addition to credit risk in the Company's loan portfolio and liquidity risk, discussed earlier, the Company's business activities
also generate market risk.  Market risk is the possibility that changes in future market rates or prices will make the Company's
position less valuable.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The ongoing monitoring and management of risk is an important component of the Company's asset/liability management
process which is governed by policies that are reviewed and approved annually by the Board of Directors.  The Board of
Directors delegates responsibility for carrying out asset/liability oversight and control to management's Asset/Liability
Committee ("ALCO").  In this capacity ALCO develops guidelines and strategies impacting the Company's asset/liability
profile based upon estimated market risk sensitivity, policy limits and overall market interest rate levels and trends.  The
Company does not make use of derivatives, such as interest rate swaps, in its risk management process.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Interest rate risk is the most significant market risk affecting the Company.  Interest rate risk is the exposure of the
Company's net interest income to changes in interest rates. Interest rate risk is directly related to the different maturities and
repricing characteristics of interest-bearing assets and liabilities, as well as to prepayment risks for mortgage-related assets,
early withdrawal of time deposits, and the fact that the speed and magnitude of responses to interest rate changes varies
by product.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The ALCO utilizes the results of a detailed and dynamic simulation model to quantify the estimated exposure of net interest
income to sustained interest rate changes.  While ALCO routinely monitors simulated net interest income sensitivity over
a rolling two-year horizon, it also utilizes additional tools to monitor potential longer-term interest rate risk.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The simulation model captures the impact of changing interest rates on the interest income received and interest expense
paid on all interest-sensitive assets and liabilities reflected on the Company's consolidated balance sheet.  This sensitivity
analysis is compared to ALCO policy limits which specify a maximum tolerance level for net interest income exposure over
a one year horizon, assuming no balance sheet growth and a 200 basis point upward and downward shift in interest rates,
where interest-bearing assets and liabilities reprice at their earliest possible repricing date.  A parallel and pro rata shift in
rates over a 12 month period is assumed.  Applying the simulation model analysis as of December 31, 2001, a 200 basis
point increase in interest rates demonstrated a 2.48% decrease in net interest income, and a 200 basis point decrease in
interest rates demonstrated a 0.85% increase in net interest income.  These amounts were within the Company's ALCO
policy limits.  Basically, the inverse relationship between changes in prevailing rates and net interest income reflects the fact
that the Company's liabilities and sources of funds reprice more quickly than its earning assets.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a Company forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative
of expected operating results.  As noted elsewhere in this Report, the Federal Reserve Board took certain actions throughout
 2001 to decrease the prevailing interest rates, after a 12-18 month period of increasing interest rates.  Management believes
it likely that rates will begin to rise later in 2002.  Although management believes that the increase in prevailing interest rates
will have a negative impact on net interest margin and net interest income, it is not able to predict with certainty what the
magnitude of that effect would be.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The hypothetical estimates underlying the sensitivity analysis are based upon numerous assumptions including: the nature
and timing of interest rate levels including yield curve shape, prepayments on loans and securities, deposit decay rates,
pricing decisions on loans and deposits, reinvestment/replacement of asset and liability cash flows, and others.  While
assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions, management cannot make any
assurance as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how customer preferences or competitor influences
might change.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Also, as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis, actual results will differ due to:
prepayment/refinancing levels likely deviating from those assumed, the varying impact of interest rate changes on caps or
floors on adjustable rate assets, the potential effect of changing debt service levels on customers with adjustable rate loans,
depositor early withdrawals and product preference changes, unanticipated shifts in the yield curve and other
internal/external variables.  Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that ALCO might take in responding
to or anticipating changes in interest rates.

<p>	The accompanying consolidated financial statements of Arrow Financial Corporation and subsidiaries are the
responsibility of management, and have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America.  These statements necessarily include some amounts that are based on best judgments and
estimates.  Other financial information in the annual report is consistent with that in the consolidated financial statements.

<p>	Management is responsible for maintaining a system of internal accounting control.  The purpose of the system
is to provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded in accordance with management's authorization, that
assets are safeguarded against loss or unauthorized use, and that underlying financial records support the preparation of
financial statements.  The system includes written policies and procedures, selection of qualified personnel, appropriate
segregation of responsibilities, and the ongoing internal audit function.

<p>	The independent auditors conduct an annual audit of the Company's consolidated financial statements to enable
them to express an opinion as to the fair presentation of the statements.  In connection with the audit, the independent
auditors consider internal control, to the extent they consider necessary to determine the nature, timing and extent of their
auditing procedures.  The Company also has an internal auditor who reports directly to the Audit Committee of the Board
of Directors, whose members are all non-employee directors.  The Audit Committee meets with management, the internal
auditor and the independent auditors in conjunction with its review of matters relating to the consolidated financial
statements.  The independent auditors and the internal auditor meet with and have complete access to the Audit Committee

<p>	We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

<p><strong>NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>NOTE  1:	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (In Thousands)</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Arrow Financial Corporation (the "Company") is a bank holding company organized in 1983 under the laws of New
York and registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956.  The accounting and reporting policies of Arrow Financial
Corporation and its subsidiaries conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and
general practices within the banking industry in all material respects.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>	Principles of Consolidation</strong> - The financial statements of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries are
consolidated and all material intercompany transactions have been eliminated.  In the "Parent Company Only" financial
statements in Note 24, the investment in wholly owned subsidiaries is carried under the equity method of accounting.  When
necessary, prior years' consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform with the current financial statement
presentation.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong>Cash and Cash Equivalents</strong> - Cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows include
the following items:  cash at branches, due from bank balances, cash items in the process of collection and federal funds sold.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>	Securities</strong> - Securities reported as held-to-maturity are those debt securities which the Company has both the
positive intent and ability to hold to maturity and are stated at amortized cost.  Securities available-for-sale are reported at fair
value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, net of taxes.  Realized
gains and losses are based upon the amortized cost of the specific security sold.  The cost of securities is adjusted for
amortization of premium and accretion of discount, which is calculated on an effective interest rate method.

<p>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>	Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses</strong> - Interest income on loans is accrued and credited to income based upon
the principal amount outstanding.  Loan fees and costs, where material, are deferred and amortized as an adjustment to yield
over the lives of the loans originated.

<p>	The allowance for loan losses is maintained by charges to operations based upon management's evaluation of
the loan portfolio, current economic conditions, past loan losses and other factors.  In management's opinion, the balance is
sufficient to provide for probable loan losses.  While management uses available information to recognize losses on loans,
future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions in the Company's market area.
In addition, various Federal and State regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, review the
Company's allowance for loan losses.  Such agencies may require the Company to recognize additions to the allowance in
future periods, based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination which may not
be currently available to management.

<p>	The Company accounts for impaired loans under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 114,
"Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan."  SFAS No. 114, as amended, requires that impaired loans, except for large
groups of smaller-balance homogeneous loans, be measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows
discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, the loan's observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan
is collateral dependent.  The Company applies the provisions of SFAS No. 114 to all impaired commercial and commercial
real estate loans over $250, and to all loans restructured subsequent to the adoption of SFAS No. 114.  Allowances for loan
losses for the remaining loans are evaluated under SFAS No. 5.  Under the provisions of SFAS No. 114, the Company
determines impairment for collateralized loans based on fair value of the collateral less estimated cost to sell.  For other loans,
impairment is determined by comparing the recorded investment in the loan to the present value of the expected cash flows,
discounted at the loan's effective interest rate.  The Company determines the interest income recognition method on a loan-by-loan basis.  Based upon the borrowers' payment histories and cash flow projections, interest recognition methods include full
accrual, cash basis and cost recovery.

<p>

<p>	<strong>Other Real Estate Owned and Repossessed Assets</strong> - Real estate acquired by foreclosure and assets acquired
by repossession are recorded at the lower of the recorded investment in the loan or the fair value of the property less estimated
costs to sell.  Subsequent declines in fair value, after transfer to other real estate owned and repossessed assets, are
recognized through a valuation allowance.  Such declines in fair value along with related operating expenses to administer such
properties are charged directly to operating expense.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>NOTE 1:	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>	Premises and Equipment</strong> - Premises and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and
amortization.  Depreciation and amortization included in operating expenses are computed largely on the straight-line method.
The provision is based on the estimated useful lives of the assets and, in the case of leasehold improvements, amortization
is computed over the terms of the respective leases or their estimated useful lives, whichever is shorter.  Gains or losses on
disposition are reflected in earnings.

<p>

<p>	<strong>Income Taxes</strong> - The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method required by SFAS
No. 109. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between
the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.  Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates
is recognized in income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date.  The Company's policy is that deferred
tax assets are reduced by a valuation reserve if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some
or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong>Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets</strong> -  In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets."  SFAS No. 142 requires that goodwill and intangible assets with
indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized, but instead be tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the
provisions of SFAS No. 142.  SFAS No. 142 also requires that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over
their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values, and reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS
No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets" (which superseded SFAS No. 121).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Currently, the FASB has stated that the unidentifiable intangible asset acquired in the acquisition of a bank or thrift
(including acquisitions of branches), where the fair value of the liabilities assumed exceeds the fair value of the assets
acquired,  should continue to be accounted for under SFAS No. 72, "Accounting for Certain Acquisitions of Banking or Thrift
Institutions."  Under SFAS No. 72, all of the intangible assets associated with branch acquisitions recorded on the Company's
consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2001 would continue to be amortized, as in prior periods.  The FASB has
announced that additional research will be performed to decide whether unidentifiable intangible assets recorded under SFAS
No. 72 should instead be accounted for using the non-amortization approach specified for goodwill under SFAS No. 142.
However, issuance of a final opinion with respect to this matter is not presently expected until the fourth quarter of 2002.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Intangible assets related to the acquisition of branches, and the related amortization, are included in other assets
and other noninterest expense, respectively.  These intangible assets, which are being amortized on a straight-line basis over
15 years, amounted to $9,431 and $10,356 at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.  The related amortization expense
totaled $925 in each of 2001, 2000 and 1999.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong>Pension and Postretirement Benefits - </strong> The Company maintains a non-contributory, defined benefit pension plan
covering substantially all employees, as well as a supplemental pension plan covering certain executive officers selected by
the Board of Directors. The costs of these plans, based on actuarial computations of current and future  benefits for employees,
are charged to current operating expenses. The  Company also provides certain post-retirement medical, dental and life
insurance benefits to substantially all employees and retirees. The cost of post-retirement benefits other than pensions is
recognized on an accrual  basis as employees perform services to earn the benefits.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong>Stock-Based Compensation Plans -</strong>  The Company accounts for its stock option plans in accordance with the
provisions of Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25, "Accounting  for Stock Issued to Employees," and related
Interpretations.  Accordingly, compensation expense is recognized only if the exercise price of a fixed stock option  is less than
the fair value of the underlying stock at the grant date.  SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," allows
entities to continue to apply the provisions of APB Opinion No. 25 but requires pro forma disclosures of net income and
earnings per share as if  the fair-value-based method defined in SFAS No. 123 had been applied.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>NOTE  1:	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>	Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase - </strong>In securities repurchase agreements, the Company receives
cash from a counterparty in exchange for the transfer of securities to a third party custodian's account that explicitly recognizes
the Company's interest in the securities.  These agreements are accounted for by the Company as secured financing
transactions since it maintains effective control over the transferred securities and meets other criteria for such accounting as
specified in SFAS No. 140.  Accordingly, the cash proceeds are recorded as borrowed funds and the underlying securities
continue to be carried in the Company's securities available-for-sale portfolio.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong>Earnings Per Share ("EPS")</strong> - Basic EPS excludes dilution and is computed by dividing income available to
common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.  Diluted EPS reflects
the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into
common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the entity (such as the
Company's stock options), computed using the treasury stock method.  Unallocated common shares held by the Company's
Employee Stock Ownership Plan are not included in the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for either
the basic or diluted EPS calculation.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>	Financial Instruments</strong> -  The Company is a party to certain financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, such
as:  commercial lines of credit, construction lines of credit, overdraft protection, home equity lines of credit and standby letters
of credit.  The Company's policy is to record such instruments when funded.  Fair value estimates are made at a specific point
in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument.  These estimates do not reflect
any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the Company's entire holdings of a particular
financial instrument.  Because no market exists for a significant portion of the Company's financial instruments, fair value
estimates are based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, risk characteristics
of various financial instruments, and other factors.  These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and
matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision.  Changes in assumptions could significantly
affect the estimates.

<p>	Fair value estimates are based on existing on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments without attempting to
estimate the value of anticipated future business and the value of assets and liabilities that are not considered financial
instruments.  For example, the Company has a substantial trust department that contributes net fee income annually.  The
value of trust department customer relationships is not considered a financial instrument, and therefore this value has not been
incorporated into the fair value estimates.  Other significant assets and liabilities that are not considered financial assets or
liabilities include deferred taxes, premises and equipment, the value of low-cost long-term core deposits and goodwill.  In
addition, the tax ramifications related to the realization of the unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair
value estimates and have not been considered in any of the estimates.

<p>	The carrying amount of the following short-term assets and liabilities is a reasonable estimate of fair value: cash
and due from banks, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, demand deposits, savings, N.O.W. and money market
deposits, other short-term borrowings, accrued interest receivable and accrued interest payable.  The fair value estimates of
other on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments, as well as the method of arriving at fair value estimates, are included
in the related footnotes and summarized in Note 23.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong>Segment Reporting -</strong> Management evaluates the operations of the Company based solely on one business
segment - commercial banking, which constitutes the Company's only segment for financial reporting purposes.  The Company
operates primarily in northern New York State in Warren, Washington, Saratoga, Essex and Clinton counties and surrounding
areas.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong>Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities </strong>- In June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS  No. 133, "Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative
instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities.  As permitted by
SFAS No. 133, the Company chose to early adopt the Statement, as amended, in the first quarter of 1999.  At the time of
adoption, the Company elected to reclassify certain securities previously classified as held-to-maturity to available-for-sale,
as allowed under SFAS No. 133.  The net unrealized holding gains on the securities transferred of $177 thousand (pre-tax)
was recorded as a transition adjustment in other comprehensive income ($105 thousand after tax).   As of December 31, 2001
and 2000, and during 2001, 2000 and 1999, the Company had no derivative instruments within the meaning of SFAS No. 133.

<p><strong>NOTE  1:	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong>Use of Estimates</strong> - Management of the Company has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to
the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities to prepare these consolidated
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Actual results
could differ from those estimates.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>NOTE  2:	CASH AND DUE FROM BANKS (In Thousands)</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	The bank subsidiaries are required to maintain certain reserves of vault cash and/or deposits with the Federal
Reserve Bank.  The total amount of the required reserve at December 31, 2001 and 2000 was approximately $11,459 and
$10,484, respectively.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>NOTE  3:	SECURITIES (In Thousands)</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	The fair value of  securities, except certain state and municipal securities, is estimated based on published prices
or bid quotations received from securities dealers.  The fair value of certain state and municipal securities is not readily
available through market sources, so fair value estimates are based on the discounted contractual cash flows using estimated
market discount rates that reflect the credit and interest rate risk inherent in the instrument, or for short-term securities, the
carrying amount.

<p>	A summary of the amortized costs and the approximate fair values of securities at December 31, 2001 and 2000

<p>	The carrying amount of net loans at December 31, 2001 and 2000 was $745,404 and $727,042, respectively.  The
estimated fair value of net loans at December 31, 2001 and 2000 was $764,179 and $724,988, respectively.

<p>	Fair values are estimated for portfolios of loans with similar financial characteristics.  Loans are segregated by type
such as commercial, commercial real estate, residential mortgage, indirect and other consumer loans.  Each loan category
is further segmented into fixed and adjustable rate interest terms and by performing and nonperforming categories.

<p>	The fair value of performing loans is calculated by discounting scheduled cash flows through the estimated maturity
using estimated market discount rates that reflect the credit and interest rate risk inherent in the loan.  The estimate of maturity
is based on historical experience with repayments for each loan classification, modified, as required, by an estimate of the
effect of current economic and lending conditions.   Fair value for nonperforming loans is based on recent external appraisals.
If appraisals are not available, estimated cash flows are discounted using a rate commensurate with the risk associated with
the estimated cash flows.  Assumptions regarding credit risk, cash flows and discount rates are judgmentally determined using
available market information and specific borrower information.

<p>	Certain executive officers and directors, including their immediate families and organizations in which they are
principals of the company or affiliates, have various loan, deposit and other transactions with the Company.  Such transactions
are on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable
transactions with others.  The amount of such related party loans was $10,637 at December 31, 2001 and $8,379 at December
31, 2000.  During 2001, the amount of new loans and renewals extended to such related parties was $31,465 and the total
of loan repayments was $29,207.

<p>	The Company has pledged certain loans secured by one-to-four family residential mortgages under a blanket
collateral agreement to secure borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank (see Note 10).  As of December 31, 2001, the
amount of such pledged loans amounted to $176,196.

<p>	The Company has sold certain residential mortgage loans to the secondary market and has retained the related
servicing rights.  At December 31, 2001 and 2000, the carrying amount of the Company's mortgage servicing rights amounted
to $2 and $10, respectively.  There was no valuation reserve for mortgage servicing rights at December 31, 2001 and 2000,
as fair value approximated carrying value.  The amount of loans serviced for others was $9,449 and $6,880 at December 31,
2001 and 2000, respectively.

<p>	The Company designates certain loans as nonaccrual and suspends the accrual of interest and the amortization
of net deferred fees or costs when payment of interest and/or principal is due and unpaid for a period of, generally, ninety days
or the likelihood of repayment is uncertain in the opinion of management.  The following table presents information concerning

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	The Company has established overnight and 30 day term lines of credit with the FHLB each in the amount of
$56,592.  If advanced, such lines of credit will be collateralized by mortgage-backed securities, loans and FHLB stock.
Participation in the FHLB program requires an investment in FHLB stock.  The investment in FHLB stock, included in Securities
Available-for-Sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, amounted to $6,250 and $5,240 at December 31, 2001 and 2000,

These advances have a set final maturity, but are callable by the FHLB at certain dates beginning no earlier than one year from
the issuance date.  If the advances are called, the Company may elect to have the funds replaced by the FHLB at the then
prevailing market rate of interest.  The borrowings are secured by mortgage loans and/or mortgage-backed securities.  The

<p><strong>NOTE 11:	GUARANTEED PREFERRED BENEFICIAL INTERESTS IN COPORATION'S JUNIOR SUBORDINATED</strong>

<p><strong>	     DEBENTURES</strong> <strong>(In Thousands)</strong>

<p>

<p>	       On November 22, 1999, the Company established Arrow Capital Trust I (the "Trust") which is a statutory
business trust formed under Delaware law upon filing a certificate of trust with the Delaware Secretary of State.  The Trust
exists for the exclusive purposes of (i) issuing and selling 30 year guaranteed preferred beneficial interests in the Corporation's
junior subordinated debentures ("capital securities") in the aggregate amount of $5.0 million at a fixed rate of 9.50%, (ii) using
the proceeds from the sale of the capital securities to acquire the junior subordinated debentures issued by the Company and
(iii) engaging in only those other activities necessary, advisable or incidental thereto.  The junior subordinated debentures are
the sole assets of the Trust and, accordingly, payments under the corporation obligated junior debentures are the sole revenue
of the Trust.  All of the common securities of the Trust are owned by the Company.  The Company has used the net proceeds
from the sale of the capital securities for general corporate purposes.  The capital securities, with associated expense that is
tax deductible, qualify as Tier I capital under regulatory definitions.  The Company's primary source of funds to pay interest
on the debentures owed to the Trust are current dividends from its subsidiary banks.  Accordingly, the Company's ability to
service the debentures is dependent upon the continued ability of the subsidiary banks to pay dividends to the Company.  Since
the capital securities are classified as debt for financial statement purposes, the expense associated with the capital securities
is recorded as interest expense in the consolidated statements of income.  The carrying amount of these capital securities was
$5,000 at both December 31, 2001 and 2000.  The estimated fair value was $5,798 and $5,830 at December 31, 2001 and
2000, respectively.  The fair value of these capital securities is estimated based on the discounted value of contractual cash
flows.  The discount rate is estimated using the current published yield on seasoned BAA corporate debt securities.

<p><strong>NOTE  14:	REGULATORY MATTERS (Dollars in Thousands)</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	In the normal course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries operate under certain regulatory restrictions,
such as the extent and structure of covered intercompany borrowings and maintenance of reserve requirement balances.

<p>	The principal source of the funds for the payment of shareholder dividends by the Company has been from
dividends declared and paid to the Company by its bank subsidiaries.  As of December 31, 2001, the maximum amount that
could have been paid by subsidiary banks to the Company, without prior regulatory approval, was approximately $19,242.

<p>	Under current Federal Reserve regulations, the Company is prohibited from borrowing from the subsidiary banks
unless such borrowings are secured by specific obligations.  Additionally, the maximum of any such borrowing is limited to
10% of an affiliate's capital and surplus.

<p>	The Company and its subsidiary banks are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by
the federal banking agencies.  Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory--and possibly
additional discretionary--actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on an institution's
financial statements.  Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the
Company and its subsidiary banks must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets,
liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices.  Capital amounts and
classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors.

<p><strong>NOTE  14:	REGULATORY MATTERS (Continued)</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Company and its
subsidiary banks to maintain minimum capital amounts and ratios (set forth in the table below) of total and Tier I capital (as
defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined), and of Tier I capital (as defined) to average assets (as
defined).  Management believes, as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, that the Company and both subsidiary banks meet
all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject.

<p>	As of December 31, 2001, the Company and both subsidiary banks qualified as well capitalized under the
regulatory framework for prompt corrective action.  To be categorized as well capitalized, the Company and its subsidiary
banks must maintain minimum total risk-based, Tier I risk-based, and Tier I leverage ratios as set forth in the table below.
There are no conditions or events that management believes have changed the Company's or its subsidiary banks'
categories.

<p>	The Company's ("Arrow") and its subsidiary banks', Glens Falls National Bank and Trust Company ("Glens Falls
National") and Saratoga National Bank and Trust Company ("Saratoga National"), actual capital amounts and ratios are

<p><strong>NOTE  15:	RETIREMENT PLANS (Dollars in Thousands)</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	The Company sponsors qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit
plans for its employees.  The Company maintains a non-contributory pension plan which covers substantially all employees.
Benefits are based on years of service and the participants' final compensation (as defined).  The funding policy is to
contribute the maximum amount that can be deducted for federal income tax purposes.  The Company also maintains a
supplemental non-qualified unfunded retirement plan to provide eligible employees of the Company and its subsidiaries with
benefits in excess of qualified plan limits imposed by federal tax law.

<p>	The Company has multiple non-pension postretirement benefit plans.  The health care, dental and life insurance
plans are contributory, with participants' contributions adjusted annually.  The health care plan provides for automatic
increases of Company contributions each year based on the increase in inflation, up to a maximum of 5%.  The Company's
policy is to fund the cost of postretirement benefits in amounts determined at the discretion of management.

<p>	The following tables provide a reconciliation of the changes in the plans' benefit obligations (projected benefit
obligation for pension benefits and accumulated benefit obligation for postretirement benefits) and fair value of the plans'
assets during the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, and a reconciliation of the funded status to the net amount
recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31 of both years:

$2,880 at December 31, 2000.  There are no plan assets in the non-qualified plan.  The pre-tax increase (decrease) to other
comprehensive income or loss arising from the change in the additional minimum pension liability related to the non-qualified
pension plan was $(50) for 2001, $4 for 2000 and $(28) for 1999.

<p>	The qualified pension plan's assets are primarily comprised of short-term funds and U.S. Treasury obligations,
high grade corporate bonds and marketable equity securities.  At December 31, 2001 and 2000, plan assets included 87 and
120 shares, respectively, of Arrow Financial Corporation common stock with a market value of $2,542 and $2,208,

capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for fiscal year 2001.  The rate was assumed to decrease gradually
to 5.5% for fiscal year 2005 and remain at that level thereafter.  For measurement purposes at December 31, 2001, a 9.5%
annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for fiscal year 2001.  The rate
was assumed to decrease gradually to 5.0% for fiscal year 2010 and remain at that level thereafter.  A 14.0% annual rate
of increase in the per capita cost of covered prescription drug benefits was assumed for fiscal year 2001, decreasing
gradually to 5.0% for fiscal year 2010 and remaining at that level thereafter.  For measurement purposes, a 6.75% annual

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	The Company maintains an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP).  Substantially all employees of the
Company and its subsidiaries are eligible to participate upon satisfaction of applicable service requirements.  The ESOP
borrowed $105, $464 and $853 in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, from one of the Company's subsidiary banks to
purchase outstanding shares of the Company's common stock.  The notes require the Company to contribute at least an
amount necessary for the ESOP to discharge its current obligations which include principal and interest payments on the
notes. The Company's ESOP expense amounted to $756, $421 and $524 in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  As the debt
is repaid, shares are released from collateral based on the proportion of debt paid to total debt outstanding for the year and
allocated to active employees.

<p>	Shares pledged as collateral are reported as unallocated ESOP shares in shareholders' equity.  As shares are
released from collateral, the Company reports compensation expense equal to the current average market price of the
shares, and the shares become outstanding for earnings per share computations.  The ESOP shares as of December 31,
2001 were as follows:

<p>	Through July 31, 2000, the Company sponsored an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) where the Company
matched up to 20% of employee purchases of Company common stock under the plan, subject to certain limitations.
Substantially all employees of the Company and its subsidiaries were eligible to participate upon satisfaction of applicable
service requirements.  The aggregate cost of the ESPP as reflected in the Company's consolidated financial statements was
$54 and $96 in 2000 and 1999, respectively.  A new ESPP became effective August 1, 2000.  Under this plan, employees
may purchase shares of the Company's common stock, up to $24 annually, at a discount to the prevailing market price
(currently a 15% discount).  Under the new ESPP, shares are issued by the Company without a charge to earnings.
Substantially all employees of the Company and its subsidiaries are eligible to participate upon satisfaction of applicable
service requirements.

<p>	The Company also sponsors a Short-Term Incentive Award Plan for senior management and a Profit Sharing
Plan for substantially all employees.  The combined cost of these plans was $621, $480 and $462 for 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>NOTE  17:	STOCK OPTION PLANS (In Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Amounts)</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	The Company has established fixed Incentive Stock Option and Non-qualified Stock Option Plans.  At December
31, 2001, approximately 307,000 shares remained available for grant under these plans.  Options may be granted at a price
no less than the greater of the par value or fair market value of such shares on the date on which such option is granted, and
generally expire ten years from the date of grant.  The options usually vest over a four year period.

<p>	Stock Appreciation Rights, which were granted in tandem with certain non-qualified options, entitle the holder
of an option to surrender the unexercised option, or any part thereof and receive in exchange a payment in cash representing
the difference between the base value and the fair market value of the common stock of the Company.

<p>	The Company applies APB Opinion No. 25 and related Interpretations in accounting for its plans.  Accordingly,
no compensation cost has been recognized for its stock option plans, excluding the cost recognized for certain stock
appreciation rights which were granted in prior years.  SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," requires
companies not using a fair value based method of accounting for employee stock options or similar plans, to provide pro
forma disclosure of net income and earnings per share as if that method of accounting had been applied.  The fair value of
each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions used for grants in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively: dividend yields of 3.30%, 4.00% and 3.80%;
expected volatility of 25.4%, 23.1% and 21.0%; risk free interest rates of 4.50%, 5.43% and 6.13%; and expected lives of
7.0 years for each year.  The effects of applying SFAS No. 123 on the pro forma net income may not be representative of
the effects on pro forma net income for future years.  Pro forma disclosures for the Company for the years ended December
31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 are as follows:

<p><strong>NOTE  18:	SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	In 1997, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted a shareholder rights plan.  The plan provides for the
distribution of one preferred stock purchase right for each outstanding share of common stock of the Company.  Each right
entitles the holder, following the occurrence of certain events, to purchase a unit consisting of one-hundredth of a share of
Series 1 Junior Participating Preferred Stock, at a purchase price of $49.45 (adjusted for stock dividends and stock splits)
per unit, subject to adjustment.  The rights will not be exercisable or transferable apart from the common stock except under
certain circumstances in which a person or group of affiliated persons acquires, or commences a tender offer to acquire, 20%
or more of the Company's common stock.  Rights held by such an acquiring person or persons may thereafter become void.
Under certain circumstances a right may become a right to purchase common stock or assets of the Company or common
stock of an acquiring corporation at a substantial discount.  Under certain circumstances, the Company may redeem the
rights at $.01 per right.  The rights will expire in April 2007 unless earlier redeemed or exchanged by the Company.

unrealized gains on securities available-for-sale at December 31, 2001, and a deferred tax asset of $79 relating to net
unrealized losses on securities available-for-sale at December 31, 2000.  In addition, the Company had a deferred tax asset
relating to recognized minimum pension liabilities of $59 and $40 at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
Management believes that the realization of the recognized net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2001 and 2000 is more
likely than not, based on existing loss carryback ability, available tax planning strategies and expectations as to future taxable
income.  Accordingly, there was no valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2001 and 2000.

<p><strong>NOTE 22:	FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES </strong>

<p><strong>		(In Thousands)</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	The Company is party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to
meet the financing needs of its customers.  These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, standby letters
of credit and loans sold with recourse.  Commitments to extend credit include home equity lines of credit, commitments for
residential and commercial construction loans and other personal and commercial lines of credit.  Those instruments involve,
to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance
sheets.  The contract or notional amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of the involvement the Company has in
particular classes of financial instruments.

<p>	The Company's exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial
instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual notional amount
of those instruments.  The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as
it does for on-balance sheet instruments.

<p>	Commitments to extend credit were $111,703 and $79,889 at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.  These
commitments are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the
contract.  Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a
fee.  Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do
not necessarily represent future cash requirements.  The Company evaluates each customer's creditworthiness on a
case-by-case basis.  Home equity lines of credit are secured by residential real estate.  Construction lines of credit are
secured by underlying real estate.  For other lines of credit, the amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the
Company upon extension of credit, is based on management's credit evaluation of the counterparty.  Collateral held varies,
but may include accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment, and income-producing commercial properties.
Most of the commitments are variable rate instruments.

<p>	Standby letters of credit were $1,231 and $1,485 at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.  Standby letters
of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party.
The credit risk involved in issuing standby letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities
to customers.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>NOTE 22:	FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES </strong>

<p><strong>		(Continued)</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Under SFAS No. 107 the fair value of commitments to extend credit is determined by estimating the fees to enter
into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms and present creditworthiness of the counterparties, and for
fixed rate loan commitments, the difference between the current and committed interest rates.  The fair value of standby
letters of credit is based on the fees currently charged for similar agreements or the cost to terminate the arrangement with
the counterparties.  The Company provides several types of commercial lines of credit and standby letters of credit to its
commercial customers.  The pricing of these services is not isolated as the Company considers the customer's complete
deposit and borrowing relationship in pricing individual products and services.  The commitments to extend credit also include
commitments under home equity lines of credit, for which the Company charges no fee.  The carrying value and fair value
of commitments to extend credit are not material and the Company does not expect to incur any material loss as a result of
these commitments.

<p>	In the normal course of business, the Company and its subsidiary banks become involved in a variety of routine
legal proceedings including so-called "lender liability" claims, in which borrowers allege that they have suffered loss as a
result of inappropriate actions taken by lending banks.  At present, there are no legal proceedings pending or threatened
which, in the opinion of management and counsel, would result in a material loss to the Company.

<p><strong>NOTE 25:	CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>			Most of the Company's loans are with customers in northern New York.  Although the loan portfolios of the
subsidiary banks are well diversified, tourism has a substantial impact on the northern New York economy.  The
commitments to extend credit are fairly consistent with the distribution of loans presented in Note 4.  Generally, the loans
are secured by assets and are expected to be repaid from cash flow or the sale of selected assets of the borrowers.  The
Company evaluates each customer's creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis.  The amount of collateral obtained, if
deemed necessary by the Company upon extension of credit, is based upon management's credit evaluation of the
counterparty.  The nature of the collateral varies with the type of loan and may include:  residential real estate, cash and
securities, inventory, accounts receivable, property, plant and equipment, income producing commercial properties and
automobiles.
