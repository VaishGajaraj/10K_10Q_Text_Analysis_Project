<p><strong>A. GENERAL</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Arrow Financial Corporation (the "Company"), a New York corporation, was incorporated on March 21, 1983 and is registered
as a bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956.  The Company owns two
nationally chartered banks in New York,  Glens Falls National Bank and Trust Company, Glens Falls, New York ("GFNB"),
and Saratoga National Bank and Trust Company, Saratoga Springs, New York ("SNB"), as well as five non-bank subsidiaries,
the operations of which are not significant.  The Company owns directly or indirectly all voting stock of all its subsidiaries.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Company offers a full range of commercial and consumer financial products.  The subsidiary banks' deposit base
consists of deposits derived principally from the communities which the banks serve.  The banks target their lending activities
to consumers and small and mid-sized companies in the banks' immediate geographic areas.  Through its banks' trust
departments, the Company provides retirement planning, trust and estate administration services for individuals and pension,
profit-sharing and employee benefit plan administration for corporations.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>B. LENDING ACTIVITIES</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Company, through its subsidiary banks engages in a wide range of lending activities, including commercial and industrial
lending primarily to small and mid-sized companies; mortgage lending for residential and commercial properties; and
consumer installment and home equity financing.  The Company also maintains an active indirect lending program through
its sponsorship of dealer programs, under which it purchases dealer paper from  automobile and other dealers meeting pre-established specifications.  Historically, the Company has sold a portion of its residential real estate loan originations into
the secondary market, primarily to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) and state housing agencies,
while retaining the servicing rights.  Loan sales into the secondary market have diminished in the past several years,
however, as the Company has sought to increase its own portfolio.  During 2001, the Company securitized $30.2 million of
residential real estate loans.  This involved the sale of the mortgage loans and the concurrent purchase of Freddie Mac
guaranteed mortgage-backed securities, with the sold loans representing the underlying collateral.  In addition to interest
earned on loans, the Company receives facility fees for various types of commercial and industrial credits, and commitment
fees for extension of letters of credit and certain types of loans.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Generally, the Company continues to implement conservative lending strategies and policies that are intended to protect the
quality of the loan portfolio.  These include stringent underwriting and collateral control procedures and credit review systems
through which intensive reviews are conducted.  It is the Company's policy to discontinue the accrual of interest on loans
when the payment of interest and/or principal is due and unpaid for a designated period (generally 90 days) or when the
likelihood of repayment is, in the opinion of management, uncertain (see Part II, Item 7.C.II.b., "Risk Elements").  Income
on such loans is thereafter recognized only upon receipt.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Company lends primarily to borrowers within its geographic area.  The loan portfolio does not include any foreign loans
or any significant risk concentrations except as described in Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item
8 of this report.  The Company does not participate in loan syndications, either as originator or as a participant.  The portfolio,
in general, is fully collateralized, and many commercial loans are further secured by personal guarantees.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In 2000, the Company formed a subsidiary, North Country Investment Advisers, Inc., which is an investment adviser
registered with the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission. NCIA advises two SEC-registered mutual funds, the North
Country Intermediate Bond Fund and the North Country Equity Growth Fund.  Currently, the investors in these funds consist
primarily of individual, corporate and institutional trust customers of the Company, but both funds intend to seek a broader
distribution of fund shares in forthcoming periods, involving, among other things, retail marketing initiatives.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In 2001, the Company established a subsidiary insurance agency, NC Financial Services, Inc., which is licensed by the State
of New York to sell various insurance products, including life insurance, fixed annuities and long-term health care products.
The agency is headquartered in Warrensburg, New York.  It is expected that the agency ultimately will operate throughout
the Company's service area from multiple Company locations.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>C. SUPERVISION AND REGULATION</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The following generally describes the regulation to which the Company and its affiliates are subject.  Bank holding companies
and banks are extensively regulated under both federal and state law.  To the extent that the following information
summarizes statutory or regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular laws and regulations.
Any change in applicable law or regulation may have a material effect on the business and prospects of the Company.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Company is a registered bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (BHC
Act) and is subject to regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve Board).
Additionally, as a "bank holding company" under New York state law, the Company is subject to regulation by the New York
State Banking Department.  The two subsidiary banks are both nationally chartered banks and are subject to supervision
and examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC"). The banks are members of the Federal Reserve
System and the deposits of each subsidiary bank are insured by the Bank Insurance Fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation ("FDIC") up to $100,000 per depositor.  The BHC Act generally prohibits the Company from engaging, directly
or indirectly, in activities  other than banking, activities closely related to banking, and certain other financial activities.  Under
the BHC Act, a bank holding company must obtain Federal Reserve Board approval before acquiring, directly or indirectly,
5% or more of the voting shares of another bank or bank holding company (unless it already owns a majority of such shares).
Bank holding companies are able to acquire banks or other bank holding companies located in all 50 states, and 48 of the
50 states permit banks headquartered in other states to branch into their states, although in some cases only by acquisition
of existing banks in such states.  As a result of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, bank holding companies are now permitted to
affiliate with a much broader array of other financial institutions than was previously permitted, including insurance
companies, investment banks and merchant banks.  See Item 1.F., "Legislative Developments."

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>An important area of banking regulation is the establishment by federal regulators of minimum capitalization standards.  The
Federal Reserve Board has adopted various "capital adequacy guidelines" for its use in the examination and supervision
of bank holding companies.  The risk-based capital guidelines assign risk weightings to all assets and certain off-balance
sheet items and establish an 8% minimum ratio of qualified total capital to the aggregate dollar amount of risk-weighted
assets (which is almost always less than the dollar amount of such assets without risk weighting).  At least half of total capital
must consist of "Tier 1" capital, which comprises common equity, retained earnings and a limited amount of permanent
preferred stock, less goodwill.  Up to half of total capital may consist of so-called "Tier 2" capital, comprising a limited amount
of subordinated debt, other preferred stock, certain other instruments and a limited amount of the allowance for loan losses.
The Federal Reserve Board's other important guideline for measuring a bank holding company's capital is the leverage ratio
standard, which establishes minimum limits on the ratio of a bank holding company's "Tier 1" capital to total tangible assets
(not risk-weighted).  For top-rated holding companies, the minimum leverage ratio is 3%, but lower-rated companies may
be required to meet substantially greater minimum ratios.  The subsidiary banks are subject to similar capital requirements
adopted by their primary federal regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Under applicable law, federal banking regulators are required to take prompt corrective action with respect to depository
institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements.  The regulators have established five capital classifications for
banking institutions, the highest being "well capitalized."   Under regulations adopted by the federal bank regulators, a
banking institution is considered "well capitalized" if it has a total risk-adjusted capital ratio of 10% or greater, a Tier 1
risk-adjusted capital ratio of 6% or greater and a leverage ratio of 5% or greater and is not subject to any regulatory order
or written directive regarding capital maintenance.  The Company and each of its subsidiary banks currently qualify as "well
capitalized."  The year-end 2002 capital ratios of the Company and its subsidiary banks are set forth in Part II, Item 7.E.
"Capital Resources and Dividends."

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>A holding company's ability to pay dividends or repurchase its outstanding stock, as well as its ability to expand its business
through acquisitions of additional banking organizations or permitted non-bank companies, may be restricted if capital falls
below these minimum capitalization standards or other informal capital guidelines that the regulators may apply from time
to time to specific banking organizations.  In addition to these potential regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends,
the Company and its subsidiary banks' ability to pay dividends is subject to various restrictions under applicable corporate
laws.  The ability of the Company and the banks to pay dividends in the future is, and is expected to continue to be,
influenced by regulatory policies, capital guidelines and applicable law.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In cases where banking regulators have significant concerns regarding the financial condition, assets or operations of a bank
or bank holding company, the regulators may take enforcement action or impose enforcement orders, formal or informal,
against the organization.  Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is now, or has been within the past year, subject
to any formal or informal regulatory enforcement action or order.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>D. COMPETITION</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Company faces intense competition in all markets it serves.  Traditional competitors are other local commercial banks,
savings banks, savings and loan institutions and credit unions, as well as local offices of major regional and money center
banks.  Also, non-banking financial organizations, such as consumer finance companies, insurance companies, securities
firms, money market and mutual funds and credit card companies offer substantive equivalents of transaction accounts  and
various loan and financial products, even though these non-banking organizations are not subject to the same regulatory
restrictions and capital requirements that apply to the Company and its subsidiary banks.  As a result of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (discussed further in Part I.1.F., below), such non-banking financial organizations now may be in a position not only
to offer comparable products to those offered by the Company, but actually to establish, acquire or affiliate with commercial
banks themselves.

<p><strong>F. LEGISLATIVE DEVELOPMENTS</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Sarbanes-Oxley Act (the "Act"), signed into law on July 30, 2002, adopted a wide range of measures applicable to
publicly-traded companies.  Generally, the Act seeks to improve the quality of financial reporting of these companies,
strengthen the independence of their auditors, and compel them to adopt good corporate governance practices.  The Act
places substantial additional duties on directors, officers, auditors and attorneys of public companies.  Among other specific
measures, the Act requires that chief executive officers and chief financial officers certify periodically to the SEC regarding
the accuracy of the company's financial statements and the integrity of its internal controls.  The Act also accelerates insiders'
reporting obligations for transactions in company securities, restricts certain executive officer and director transactions,
imposes new obligations on corporate audit committees, and provides for enhanced review of company filings by the SEC.
As part of the general effort to improve public company auditing, the Act placed limits on consulting services that may be
performed by a company's independent auditors and creates a public company accounting oversight board, which will set
auditing standards, inspect registered public accounting firms, and possess enforcement powers, subject to oversight by the
SEC.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In November 1999, Congress enacted the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ("GLBA"), which permitted bank holding companies to
engage in a wider range of financial activities.  Under GLBA for example, bank holding companies may underwrite all types
of insurance and annuity products and all types of securities products and mutual funds, and may engage in merchant
banking activities.  Bank holding companies that wish to engage in these or other newly-permitted financial activities
generally must do so through separate "financial" subsidiaries and may themselves be required to register (and qualify to
register) as so-called "financial holding companies."  A bank holding company that does not register as a financial holding
company will remain a bank holding company subject to substantially the same regulatory restrictions and permitted activities
as applied to bank holding companies prior to GLBA (See Part I.1.C., "Supervision and Regulations," above).  The Company
has not yet elected to become a "financial holding company" but continues to evaluate the opportunities provided by GLBA.
Under GLBA, as well as the Fair Credit Reporting Act amendment of 1996, all financial institutions have become subject to
more stringent customer privacy regulations.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In 1995, the federal bank regulatory authorities promulgated a set of revised regulations addressing the responsibilities of
banking organizations under the Community Reinvestment Act ("CRA").  The revised regulations place additional emphasis
on the actual experience of a bank in making loans in low- and moderate-income areas within its service area as a key
determinant in evaluation of the bank's compliance with the statute.  As in the prior regulations, bank regulators are
authorized to bring enforcement actions against banks under the CRA only in the context of bank expansion or acquisition
transactions.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The FDIC levies assessments on various deposit obligations of the Company's banking subsidiaries.  Since 1996, the
premium paid by the best-rated banks (including the Company's subsidiary banks) has been a flat charge of $2 thousand
per year. Also in that year, Congress enacted the Deposit Insurance Funds Act, under which deposits insured by the Bank
Insurance Fund ("BIF"), such as the deposits of the Company's banks, are subject to assessment for payment on bond
obligations financing the FDIC's Savings Association Insurance Fund ("SAIF") at a rate 1/5 the rate paid on deposits by SAIF-insured thrift institutions.  Accordingly, the deposits of the Company's banks were assessed an additional 1.160 cents per
$100 of insured deposits in 1999, 1.220 cents per $100 of insured deposits in 1998 and an additional 1.256 cents in 1997.
Beginning in 2000, the BIF and SAIF rates were equalized.  For institutions with the lowest risk classification (including the
Company) the BIF rate increased to 2.120 and the SAIF rate decreased from 5.800 to 2.120.  The rate is adjusted quarterly,
depending on the need of the fund.  At December 31, 2002 the rate had decreased to 1.680 cents per $100 of insured
deposits.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Various federal bills that would significantly affect banks are introduced in Congress from time to time.  The Company cannot
estimate the likelihood of any currently pending banking bills being enacted into law, or the ultimate effect that any such
potential legislation, if enacted, would have upon its financial condition or operations.

<p>These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks and uncertainties that are difficult to
quantify or, in some cases, to identify.  In the case of all forward-looking statements, actual outcomes and results may differ
materially from what the statements predict or forecast.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, unexpected changes in economic
and market conditions, including unanticipated fluctuations in interest rates; new developments in state and federal
regulation; enhanced competition from unforeseen sources; new emerging technologies; unexpected loss of key personnel;
and similar risks inherent in banking operations or business generally.  Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance
on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof.  The Company undertakes no obligation to
revise or update these forward-looking statements to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>Critical Accounting Policies: </strong> In order to prepare the Company's consolidated financial statements in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, management was required to make estimates and
assumptions that affected the amounts reported in these statements.  There are uncertainties inherent in making these
estimates and assumptions which could materially affect the results of operations and financial position.  Management
considers the allowance for loan losses and liabilities for retirement plans to be critical accounting policies.  The adequacy
of the allowance for loan losses is sensitive to changes in current economic conditions that may make it difficult for borrowers
to meet their contractual obligations.  A severe downward trend in the economy, regional or national, may require the
Company to increase the allowance for loan losses resulting in a negative impact on its results of operations and financial
condition.  The Company has a variety of pension and retirement plans.  Liabilities under these plans rely on estimates of
future salary increases, numbers of employees and employee retention, discount rates and long-term rates of investment
return.  Changes in these assumptions due to changes in the financial markets, the economy or the Company's own
operations may result in material changes to the Company's results of operations and financial condition.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The following discussion and analysis focuses on and reviews the Company's results of operations for each of the years in
the three-year period ended December 31, 2002 and the financial condition of the Company as of December 31, 2002 and
2001.  The discussion below should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and other financial data
presented elsewhere herein.

<p><strong>A. OVERVIEW</strong>

<p><strong>Summary of 2002 Financial Results</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Company reported net income of $18.9 million for 2002 an increase of $3.1 million, or 19.5%, compared to net income
of $15.8 million for 2001.  Diluted earnings per share increased $.38, or 19.6%, from 2001 to 2002 and $.25, or 14.8%, from
2000 to 2001.  The increase in net income between 2001 and 2002 was primarily attributable to an 11.0% increase in net
interest income between the two years, itself attributable primarily to a comparable increase in average earning assets.

<p><sup>1</sup> <strong>Amortization</strong> of goodwill was discontinued, effective January 1, 2002, upon the adoption of SFAS No. 147.

<p><sup>2</sup> <strong>Core Diluted Earnings Per Share</strong> excludes gains/losses on securities and OREO transactions and one-time material non-recurring items of income and

<p>   expense.  The amounts necessary to reconcile reported net income to core net income for 2002, 2001 and 2000 include (net of tax): securities

<p>   gains (losses) ($60, $116 and $(352)), OREO transactions ($14, $61 and $17), non-recurring other income of $158 in 2002, gain on the sale of credit card

<p>    loans of $488 in 2000 and non-recurring other expense of $51 in 2000.

<p><sup>3</sup> <strong>Net Interest Margin</strong> is the ratio of tax-equivalent net interest income to average earning assets.

<p><sup>4</sup> The <strong>Efficiency Ratio</strong> is the ratio of noninterest expense less goodwill and other intangible asset amortization to the sum of tax-

<p>   equivalent net interest income and other income less net securities gains or losses.

<p><sup>5</sup> <strong>Tangible Book Value</strong> is calculated based on total equity less intangible assets, including goodwill associated with prior

<p>   branch acquisitions.

<p><strong>Peer Group Comparisons: </strong>At certain points in the ensuing discussion and analysis, the Company's performance is
compared with that of its peer group of financial institutions.  Peer data has been obtained from the Federal Reserve Board's
"Bank Holding Company Performance Report."  Unless otherwise specifically stated, the Company's peer group is comprised
of the group of 166 domestic bank holding companies with $1 to $3 billion in total consolidated assets.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>At December 31, 2002, the Company's tangible book value per share (calculated based on shareholders' equity reduced
by intangible assets including goodwill, mortgage servicing rights and intangible pension plan assets) amounted to $11.56,
an increase of $1.39, or 13.7%, from year-end 2001.  The increase was primarily attributable to retained earnings and net
unrealized gains, net of tax, on securities available-for-sale during 2002, offset in part by periodic repurchases of the
Company's common stock.  As of the last trading day of 2002, the average of the Company's bid and asked stock price was
$30.80, resulting in a trading multiple of 2.66 to tangible book value.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Board of Directors increased the quarterly cash dividend twice in 2002, to $.25 per share by the fourth quarter.  Total
cash dividends (as adjusted) were $.95 for 2002, compared to $.83 for 2001, an increase of $.12 or 14.5%.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Nonperforming loans amounted to $2.6 million at December 31, 2002, a decrease of $876 thousand from the prior year-end.
Loans charged-off (net of recoveries) against the allowance for loan losses  were $815 thousand for 2002, as compared to
$1.3 million for the prior year.   At year-end 2002, the allowance for loan losses, at $11.2 million, represented a coverage
ratio to total loans of 1.38%, as compared to 1.29% at the prior year-end.

<p><strong>Sale of Credit Card Portfolio and Servicing Business in 2000</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Prior to 2000, the Company serviced its own credit card portfolio as well as the credit card portfolios for several smaller
financial institutions.  In 2000, the Company determined that it would no longer engage in the consumer credit card servicing
business and that it would sell the business as well as its existing consumer credit card balances to MBNA America Bank,
N.A., an organization widely recognized as an industry leader.  The decision to discontinue this activity was driven by the
fact that the consumer credit card business, including both card issuance and account servicing, has increasingly become
a commodity operation that requires great scale.   Management also expected that its credit card customers would receive
a broader array of account benefits and services under MBNA's programs after the sale, and such has been the case.  The
sale, which resulted in a net gain of $825 ($488 net of tax), was completed in the third quarter of 2000.  The Company
continues to manage its merchant credit card and debit card programs.

<p><strong>B. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The following analysis of net interest income, the provision for loan losses, noninterest income, noninterest expense and
income taxes, highlights the factors that are primarily responsible for the Company's results of operations for 2002 and the
prior two years.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>I. NET INTEREST INCOME (Tax-equivalent Basis)

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Net interest income represents the difference between interest and dividends earned on loans, securities and other earning
assets and interest paid on deposits and other sources of funds.  Changes in net interest income result from changes in the
level and mix of earning assets and sources of funds (volume) and changes in the yields earned and interest rates paid
(rate).  Net interest margin is the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets.  Net interest income may also be
described as the product of average earning assets and the net interest margin.

<p>Of the $5.2 million increase in net interest income in 2002 over the prior year, $4.7 million was attributable to increased
volume of earning assets and only $406 thousand to rate change (i.e., the fact that the cost of deposits and other funds
decreased at a faster rate than the yield on earning assets).  This contrasted with the prior year, when rate changes
generated a $3.7 million increase in net interest income out of a total increase of $7.2 million.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The following items have a major impact on changes in net interest income due to rate:  general interest rate changes, the
ratio of the Company's rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities (interest rate sensitivity gap) during periods of interest
rate changes and the level of nonperforming loans.  The Federal Reserve Board attempts to influence prevailing federal
funds and prime interest rates and sets changes to the Federal Reserve Bank discount rate.  The following chart presents
rate changes in recent years:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Company's net interest income, for the past several years, has been very sensitive to changes in interest rates.  As
indicated in the table above, prevailing interest rates economy-wide began to increase in the second half of 1999 through
the second half of 2000.  This marked a turnaround from a long period of flat or slowly-declining prevailing interest rates.
The 1999 rate hikes had a moderate negative impact on the Company's financial results for 1999, which continued to show
decreases from prior periods in the average rate earned on earning assets and the average rate paid on earning liabilities,
as well as decreases in the Company's net interest spread and net interest margin.  However, the full and negative impact
of rising rates was felt in 2000, when the decrease in net interest income due to rates was significant.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In the first quarter of 2001, the Federal Reserve Board reversed direction and began decreasing short-term interest rates
rapidly and significantly in response to perceived weakening in the economy.  By December 2001, the total decrease in
prevailing short-term interest rates for the year was 475 basis points.  After eleven months with no rate changes, the Federal
Reserve Board decreased rates another 50 basis points in November 2002.  As a result, the Company experienced a
decrease in the cost of deposits in all quarters of 2001 and 2002.  Although decreases in deposit rates began to be
experienced in the first quarter of 2001, the Company did not experience a decrease in the average yield in its loan portfolio
until the second quarter of 2001.  Since that time, yields on the loan portfolio have decreased each successive quarter in
2001 and 2002, as well.  See the "Loan Portfolio" section in the discussion of "Financial Condition" later on in this Report,
for a more complete analysis of yield trends in the loan portfolio.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>When the Federal Reserve Board decreased short-term interest rates by 50 basis points in November 2002, this decrease
had a limited impact on the Company's deposit rates, because rates on several of the Company's deposit products, such
as savings and NOW accounts, were already priced at such low levels that a 50 basis point decrease in rates was not
practical or sustainable, although the Company did lower rates to a much smaller extent on certain non-maturity deposit
products.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Most important, the decreasing rate environment had a positive impact on net interest income during 2001 and 2002, as net
interest margins increased both years.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The net interest margin for 2002 was 4.50%, an increase of 9 basis points from the 4.41% margin for 2001.  The net interest
spread between the two years increased by 26 basis points.  These increases in margin and spread were attributable to the
fact that during a period of decreasing market rates the Company's paying liabilities repriced downward at a faster rate than
its earning assets.  In turn, a major factor influencing this development was the relocation of a significant dollar amount of
maturing time deposits into other lower cost deposit accounts, a relocation that often accompanies falling interest rates but
also often proves temporary.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In both rising and falling rate environments, the Company faces significant competitive pricing pressures in its marketplace
for both deposits and loans, and thus ultimately both assets and liabilities may be expected to reprice proportionately in
response to changes in market rates.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The net interest margin for 2001 was 4.41%, an increase of 40 basis points from the 4.01% margin for 2000.  The net interest
spread between the two years increased by 44 basis points.  As in 2002, these significant increases in margin and spread
were attributable to the fact that during a period of decreasing market rates the Company's paying liabilities repriced
downward at a faster rate than its earning assets.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>A discussion of the impact on net interest income resulting from changes in interest rates vis a vis the repricing patterns of
the Company's earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities is included later in this report under Item 7A, "Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk."

<p>In general, changes in the volume of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities will result in corresponding changes in
net interest income.  That is, as assets and liabilities increase, so will net interest income.  However, changes due to volume
can be enhanced or restricted by shifts within the relative mix of earning assets or interest-bearing liabilities between
instruments of different rates.  The change in net interest income due to changes in volume was an increase of $4.7 million
in 2002 and  an increase of $3.5 million in 2001.

<p>During 2002, average earning assets increased $92.3 million, an increase of 8.7%.  Average paying liabilities grew at a
somewhat slower pace, increasing by $72.4 million, or 8.1%.  The combined effect of these changes in volume was to
increase net interest income by approximately 10.0%, before giving effect to the 1.0% positive impact on net interest income
resulting from the change in interest rates discussed in the previous section.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>During 2002, the Company experienced its growth in average earning assets primarily within the investment portfolio (which
accounted for approximately 71% of the increase) and secondarily within the loan portfolio (approximately 29%). While it
is the intention of the Company ultimately to invest the greatest portion of its earning assets into high quality loans, most of
the increase in the sources of funds from December 31, 2001 to December 31, 2002 was redeployed, at least for the present,
into the investment securities portfolio.  As reported on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, the cash flow received
from the maturities and calls of securities in the available-for-sale portfolio amounted to $91.3 million for 2002.  Most of these
cash flows are from the monthly amortization of mortgage-backed securities.  Among other needs, this cash flow is available
to fund loan growth or for redeployment in the available-for-sale portfolio.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The fastest growing segment of the loan portfolio for several years preceding 2001 was indirect consumer loans, which are
primarily auto loans financed through local dealerships from whom the Company acquires the dealer paper.  While this
segment still represents the largest portion of the loan portfolio, the outstanding balances of indirect loans remained little
changed at year-end 2002 from year-end 2001 and 2000.   For 2002, the average balances of indirect loans were actually
$12.4 million below the average balances for 2001, as the portfolio experienced a net decrease prior to recovering in the
fourth quarter of 2002.  The increase in the average loan balances from 2001 to 2002 was attributable to the residential real
estate ($25.3 million) and the commercial loan ($17.9 million) portfolios.

<p>

<p>The Company's $72.4 million growth in average paying liabilities in 2002 was experienced primarily in traditional banking
deposit products, which increased by $52.4 million, or 7.1%, from year-end 2001 to year-end 2002, and secondarily in
Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) borrowings, which increased by $15.2 million, or 13.2%, from year-end 2001 to year-end
2002.  The increase in deposit balances during 2002 was generated by the Company's pre-existing branch network, although
the Company's Saratoga National Bank and Trust Company franchise did open its third branch (the second branch in
Saratoga Springs) at the beginning of 2002.  No other branches were added or acquired in 2002.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>During 2001, average earning assets increased $73.3 million, an increase of 7.4%.  Average paying liabilities grew at a
somewhat slower pace, increasing by $48.1 million, or 5.7%.  The combined effect was to increase net interest income by
approximately 8.7%, before giving effect to the positive impact on net interest income resulting from the change in interest
rates discussed in the previous section.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In 2001 (unlike in 2002) the Company experienced its growth in average earning assets principally within the loan portfolio.
During 2001, the Company securitized approximately $30 million of residential real estate loan balances and retained
ownership of the resulting mortgage-backed securities for the purpose of providing additional liquidity and collateral for
pledging purposes.  Without the securitization, increases in loan balances would have represented over 70% of the increase
in average earning assets between the two years.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The outstanding balances of indirect consumer loans remained little changed at year-end 2001 from year-end 2000.  During
2001, adjusted for reductions of loans through securitizations, residential real estate loans increased $32.8 million, or 15.5%.
Commercial loans increased by $21.3 million, or 17.4%, representing the other area of significant growth within the loan
portfolio.

<p>

<p>The Company's growth in average paying liabilities in 2001 was experienced both in traditional banking deposit products,
which increased by $26.6 million, or 3.1%, from year-end 2000 to year-end 2001, and in borrowings, which increased by
$29.8 million, or 35.0%, from year-end 2000 to year-end 2001.   The increase in deposit balances during 2001 was generated
by the Company's pre-existing branch network.  No branches were added or acquired in 2001.  The primary source of new
borrowings by the Company in 2001 was advances from the FHLB (see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
in Part II, Item 8 of this report).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Increases in the volume of loans and deposits, as well as yields and costs by type,  are discussed later in this report under
Item 7.C. "Financial Condition."

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>II. PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Management considers its accounting policy relating to the allowance for loan losses to be a critical accounting policy given
the inherent uncertainty involved in evaluating the level of the allowance required to cover credit losses inherent in the loan
portfolio, and the material effect that such judgments can have on the Company's results of operations.  See Note 1 to the
consolidated financial statements, as well as the discussion below, for a description of the Company's policy with respect
to estimating the level of the allowance for loan losses.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Through the provision for loan losses, an allowance (reserve) is maintained for estimated loan losses.  Actual loan losses
are charged against this allowance when loans are deemed uncollectible.  In evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for
loan losses, management considers various risk factors influencing asset quality.  The analysis is performed on a loan by
loan basis for impaired and large balance loans, and by portfolio type for smaller balance homogeneous loans. This analysis
is based on judgments and estimates and may change in response to economic developments or other conditions that may
influence borrowers' financial conditions or prospects.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The determination of actual provisions for loan losses on an ongoing basis is largely influenced by the prevailing level of
nonperforming loans, the level of loans actually charged-off against the allowance for loan losses during the prior periods,
contemporary changes in the mix and volume of loan categories within the loan portfolio and overall changes in the size of
the portfolio.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The quality of the Company's loan portfolio remains strong and, to date, has not been negatively affected either by the loan
growth experienced in recent periods or by the recent weakening in the national and regional economy.  At period-end, the
ratio of nonperforming loans (loans 90 days or more and accruing interest plus nonaccrual loans) as a percentage of total
loans was .32% for the Company.  The September 30, 2002 ratio for the Company's peer group was .77%.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>While management believes that the 2002 year-end allowance was adequate under the circumstances, there can be no
assurances that future economic or financial developments, including general interest rate increases or a slowdown in the
economy, might not lead to increased provisions to the allowance or a higher incidence of loan charge-offs.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The provision for loan losses was $2.3 million for 2002, virtually unchanged from 2001.  During 2002, loan losses charged
against the allowance, net of recoveries, were $815 thousand, a decrease of $481 thousand, or 37.1%, from the 2001
amount.  During the second quarter of 2001, the Company charged-off $512 thousand on one commercial loan.
Disregarding this item, net charge-offs for 2002 increased by $31 thousand, or 4.0%, over 2001.   Net charge-offs as a
percentage of average loans outstanding was .11% for 2002.  Net charge-offs, on an annualized basis,  for the Company's
peer group at September 30, 2002 was .27% of average loans, or 145.5% higher than the Company's ratio. If the current
economic recession continues or worsens, management anticipates that net charge-offs will exceed the levels experienced
in recent years.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>At December 31, 2002, nonperforming loans amounted to $2.6 million, a decrease of $876 thousand, or 25.5%, from the
balance at year-end 2001.  The decrease was primarily attributable to one $749 thousand commercial loan that was
designated as nonperforming at year-end 2001, which was paid-off in full by the borrower during December 2002.  While
nonperforming loans and net loans charged-off improved in 2002, as compared to 2001, the continued growth in the loan
portfolio resulted in the 2002 provision for loan losses remaining consistent with 2001.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>At December 31, 2002, the allowance for loan losses was $9.7 million, or 1.38%, of total loans, as compared to $8.7 million,
or 1.29% of total loans at December 31, 2001.  The allowance for loan losses represented 437% of the amount of
nonperforming loans at December 31, 2002, as compared to 283% of nonperforming loans at December 31, 2001.

<p>

<p>During 2001, loan losses charged against the allowance, net of recoveries, were $1.3 million, an increase of $768 thousand,
or 145%, from the prior year amount.  During the second quarter of 2001, the Company charged-off $512 thousand on one
commercial loan.  Management believes that the factors that led to this charge-off were unique and isolated and are not
indicative of any emerging pattern of increasing charge-offs above historical levels.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding was .17% for 2001.  The provision for loan losses, as a
percentage of average loans outstanding was .31% for 2001.  Net charge-offs, on an annualized basis,  for the Company's
peer group at September 30, 2001 was .26% of average loans, or 52.9% higher than the Company's ratio.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>At December 31, 2001, nonperforming loans amounted to $3.4 million, an increase of $1.4 million, or 67.3%, from the
balance at year-end 2000.  The increase was primarily attributable to two commercial loans, totaling $1.6 million, which were
placed on nonaccrual status during the fourth quarter of 2001.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The provision for loan losses was $1.5 million for 2000, an increase of $47 thousand, or 3.3%, from 1999.  At December 31,
2000, nonperforming loans amounted to $2.1 million, essentially unchanged from the balance at December 31, 1999.  At
December 31, 2000, the allowance for loan losses was $8.7 million, or 1.19% of total loans.  The allowance for loan losses
represented 425% of the amount of nonperforming loans at that date.  During 2000, loan losses charged against the
allowance, net of recoveries, were $528 thousand, or .08%, of average loans for the period, an increase of $146 thousand,
or 38%, from the prior year amount.  The principal reason for the increase in net loan losses in 2000 as compared with 1999
was a recovery of $315 thousand in the 1999 period related to the final repayment of a large commercial loan.  Excluding
the large recovery, net loan losses for 1999 would have exceeded those for 2000, and would have represented .12% of
average loans.  The provision for loan losses charged to expense for 2000 was $1.5 million, or .21%, of average loans for
the period.

<p>Total other income increased $794 thousand, or 7.5%, from 2001 to 2002.  Without regard to net securities transactions, total
other income was $11.2 million for 2002 and $10.3 million for 2001, an increase of $889 thousand, or 8.6%.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>For 2002, income from fiduciary activities decreased $196 thousand, or 4.8%, from 2001.    At year-end 2002, the market
value of assets under trust administration and investment management amounted to $620.4 million, a decrease of $78.5
million, or 11.2%, from year-end 2001.  The decrease in the market value of assets under trust administration and investment
management principally reflected the general decline in the equity markets during 2002, which more than offset the increase
in number of accounts under administration during the year.  Fiduciary account fees, in general, are tied to the value of
assets under administration.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Income from fiduciary activities includes income from funds under investment management in the Company-advised North
Country Funds, which include the North Country Equity Growth Fund (NCEGX) and the North Country Intermediate Bond
Fund (NCBDX).  On a combined basis, these funds reached a market value of $84.8 million at December 31, 2002.  The
funds were introduced in March 2001, and are advised by the Company's subsidiary, North Country Investment Advisors,
Inc.  Currently, the funds are owned almost entirely by qualified employee benefit plan accounts.  The Company began to
offer these funds on a retail basis through its branches during 2002.  Included as an investor in the funds is  the Company's
pension plan, which owns shares in the funds with a market value of $13.6 million at December 31, 2002.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Fees for other services to customers include deposit account service charges, credit card and debit card merchant
processing fees, safe deposit box fees and loan servicing fees.  These fees amounted to $6.2 million in 2002, an increase
of $887 thousand, or 16.7%, from 2001.  Over half of the increase was attributable to increases in deposit service charges.
An increase in credit card and debit card merchant processing fees also made a significant contribution to the total increase
in fees for other services to customers.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>During 2002, the Company realized net securities gains of $100 thousand on the sale of $40.8 million from its available-for-sale portfolio.  The primary purpose of the sales were to restructure the maturity profile of the investment portfolio.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Other operating income includes net gains on the sale of loans and other real estate owned, if any, as well as other
miscellaneous revenues.  For 2002, other operating income increased $198 thousand, or 20.6%.   The increase was primarily
attributable to an increase in data processing servicing fee income received from one upstate New York bank and a one-time
benefit from the demutualization of an insurance company for the Company's group employee insurance trust.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>From 2000 to 2001, total other income increased $330 thousand, or 3.2%.  Without regard to net securities transactions and
the net gain on the sale of the credit card portfolio, total other income was $10.3 million for 2001 and $10.0 million for 2000,
an increase of $365 thousand, or 3.7%.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>For 2001, income from fiduciary activities increased $378 thousand, or 10.3%, from 2000.  The increase was in large part
attributable to an increase in the number of trust accounts under administration and investment management which more
than offset the general decline in the equity markets and consequent negative impact on the value of assets under
administration.   At year-end 2001, the market value of assets under trust administration and investment management
amounted to $699.0 million, a decrease of $46.1 million, or 6.2%, from year-end 2000.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Fees for other services to customers include deposit account service charges, credit card and debit card merchant
processing fees, safe deposit box fees and loan servicing fees.  These fees amounted to $5.3 million in 2001, an increase
of $80 thousand, or 1.5%, from 2000.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>During 2001, the Company realized net securities gains of $195 thousand on the sale of $13.5 million from its available-for-sale portfolio.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In the past, the primary component of other operating income was fees earned on servicing credit card portfolios for
correspondent banks.  With the sale of the credit card portfolio at the end of the third quarter of 2000, the Company also
discontinued servicing credit card portfolios for most of its correspondent banks.  Thus, income from servicing credit card
portfolios decreased significantly between the two years, falling to  $224 thousand in 2001 from $486 thousand in 2000.
Beginning in 2002, the Company discontinued servicing the remainder of the correspondent banks' portfolios.  The loss in
income resulting from this discontinuation of business was accompanied by similar reductions in expense also attributable
to this discontinuation.  Other operating income also includes net gains on the sale of loans and other real estate owned,
as well as other miscellaneous revenues.  For 2001, other operating income decreased $93 thousand, or 8.8%.  Disregarding
the credit card servicing component, other operating income actually increased by $169 thousand, or 29.6%.  The increase
was primarily attributable to data processing servicing fee income received from one upstate New York bank.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Other expense for 2002 amounted to $31.4 million, an increase of $853 thousand, or 2.8%, from 2001.  This comparison
was significantly affected by a change in accounting principles between the two periods.  The significant change was the
discontinuance in 2002 of goodwill amortization upon the adoption of SFAS No. 147, retroactive to January 1, 2002.  Goodwill
amortization for 2001 was $907 thousand, but was $0 for 2002.  Disregarding goodwill amortization, the increase in other
expense between the two years would have been substantially higher, specifically, $1.8 million, or a 5.8% increase.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>One comparative measure of operating expenses for financial institutions is the efficiency ratio.  The efficiency ratio (a ratio
where lower is better) is calculated as the ratio of other expense to the sum of tax equivalent net interest income and other
income.  Excluded from the calculation are goodwill amortization and any net securities gains or losses.  For 2002, the
efficiency ratio for the Company was 49.5%, an improvement from the 2001 ratio of 51.6%.  The Company's 2002 ratio also
compares favorably to the year-to-date ratio for the Company's peer group of 59.2% as of September 30, 2002.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Salaries and employee benefits increased $1.6 million, or 9.4%, from 2001 to 2002.  Salaries increased  $785 thousand, or
6.6%, from 2001 to 2002.  The increase was attributable to normal merit pay increases, as well as to the hiring of additional
employees late in 2001 principally to staff the new West Avenue office of Saratoga National Bank and Trust Company in
Saratoga Springs, New York, and the Company's new insurance agency subsidiary.  Employee benefits increased $840
thousand, or 15.7% during the period. In 2002, all categories of employee benefits experienced increases from 2001, except
incentive compensation, which decreased slightly.  The most significant increase to employee benefits was an increase in
expenses for the Company's defined benefit pension plan.  During 2002, the Company adopted a "cash balance" plan for
all new employees.  Current employees were offered the opportunity to switch to the "cash balance" plan or to remain with
the prior plan, under which retirement benefits are calculated on a "final pay" formula. Over 90% of current employees elected
to switch to the cash balance plan.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Occupancy expense increased $82 thousand, or 3.6%, from 2001 to 2002. Most of the increase was attributable to increased
costs of insurance and real estate taxes.  Furniture and equipment expense decreased slightly by $22 thousand, or 0.9%,
from 2001 to 2002.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Other operating expense increased $75 thousand, or 1.0%, from 2001 to 2002, without considering goodwill amortization,
which was included in other operating expense in 2001 but not in 2002 due to a change in accounting principles, as
discussed above.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In 2001, other expense amounted to $30.5 million, an increase of $3.0 million, or 10.7%, from 2000.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Salaries and employee benefits increased $1.6 million, or 10.5%, from 2000 to 2001.    Salaries increased  $655 thousand,
or 5.8%, between the periods.  The increase was attributable to normal merit pay increases, as well as to the hiring of
additional employees.  Employee benefits increased $986 thousand, or 22.5% during the period. In 2001, all categories of
employee benefits experienced increases from 2000, including $184 thousand for pension plan expenses, $263 thousand
related to health and similar benefit plans and $476 thousand related to incentive compensation plans.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Occupancy expense increased $270 thousand, or 13.7%, from 2000 to 2001. Most of the increase was attributable to
increased costs in building maintenance and insurance.  Furniture and equipment expense decreased slightly by $4
thousand, or 0.2%, from 2000 to 2001.  Other operating expense increased $1.1 million, or 14.0%, from 2000 to 2001.  Areas
of other expense experiencing the greatest increases were advertising ($141 thousand), supplies ($156 thousand), legal and
other professional fees ($162 thousand) and the cost of third party computer processing for trust operations ($429 thousand).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Investment securities are classified as held-to-maturity, trading, or available-for-sale, depending on the purposes for which
such securities were acquired and are being held.  Securities held-to-maturity are debt securities that the Company has both
the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity; such securities are stated at amortized cost.  Debt and equity securities that
are bought and held principally for the purpose of sale in the near term are classified as trading securities and are reported

<p>Other mortgage-backed securities principally consisted of agency mortgage pass-through securities.  Pass-through securities
provide to the investor monthly portions of principal and interest pursuant to the contractual obligations of the underlying
mortgages.  Collateralized mortgage obligations ("CMOs") separate the repayments into two or more components (tranches),
where each tranche has a separate estimated life and yield.  The Company's practice is to purchase pass-through securities
and collateralized mortgage obligations guaranteed by federal agencies and tranches of CMOs with shorter maturities.
Included in corporate and other debt securities are highly rated corporate bonds and commercial paper.  Approximately $8.7
million, or 90.3%, of mutual funds and equity securities are required holdings of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and
the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York stock.

<p>The following table sets forth the maturities of the Company's securities available-for-sale portfolio as of December 31, 2002.
CMO's and other mortgage-backed securities are included in the table based on their expected average lives.  Mutual funds
and equity securities, which have no stated maturity, are included in the after 10 year category.

<p>The yields on debt securities shown in the table above are calculated by dividing annual interest, including accretion of
discounts and amortization of premiums, by the amortized cost of the securities at December 31, 2002.  Yields on obligations
of states and municipalities exempt from federal taxation were computed on a fully tax-equivalent basis using a marginal
tax rate of 35%.  Dividend earnings derived from equity securities were adjusted to reflect applicable federal income tax
exclusions.

<p>At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the weighted average maturity was 2.8 and 4.2 years, respectively, for debt securities in
the available-for-sale portfolio.  At December 31, 2002, the net unrealized gain on securities available-for-sale amounted
to $6.6 million.  The net unrealized gain or loss on such securities, net of tax, is reflected in accumulated other
comprehensive income/loss.  The net unrealized gain at December 31, 2002 represents a $3.8 million increase since
December 31, 2001 and is primarily attributable to the increased fair value of the debt securities portfolios resulting from
falling interest rates during 2002.

<p><strong><u>Indirect Loans</strong></u>: At year-end 2002, indirect loans remained the largest segment of the loan portfolio. Indirect loans are almost
entirely auto vehicle acquisition loans to consumers financed through local dealerships where, by prior arrangement, the
Company acquires the dealer paper.  In the years prior to 2001, the Company experienced strong growth in these loans.
Throughout 2001 and 2002, however, this sector of the portfolio remained flat, and the balance at year-end 2002 was
essentially unchanged from December 31, 2000.  As a percentage of total loans, indirect loans fell from 42% at December
31, 2001 to 39% at the end of 2002.  During 2002, normal amortization and prepayments offset new originations of indirect
loans, as each amounted to approximately $150 million, or 48% of the outstanding balances.  Prepayments accelerated in
the fall of 2001 and continued at a pace exceeding historical levels throughout 2002 as manufacturers offered attractive
financing alternatives.  During 2000 and 1999, indirect loans increased significantly, both in total and as a percentage of the
loan portfolio.  In 2000, these loans increased $57.8 million, or 22.5%, and in 1999, these loans increased $78 million, or
43.6%.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><u><strong>Residential Real Estate Loans</strong>:</u> Residential real estate loans represented the second largest segment at year-end 2002,
at 36% of total loans.  Residential real estate loans increased $35 million during the year as originations of $95 million were
offset by normal amortization, refinancings and prepayments.  During 2001 residential real estate loans decreased $5.5
million, or 2.1%, from the prior year-end.  Originations exceeded repayments by approximately $25 million, but the portfolio
amount declined due to the $30 million in loan securitizations cited earlier in this report.  In effect, the securitized loans were
not sold but merely transferred to the Company's securities available-for-sale portfolio.  In 2000, residential real estate loans
increased $12.7 million, or 5.0% and in 1999, this segment increased by $14 million, or 6.0%.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong><u>Commercial and Commercial Real Estate Loans:</u></strong> In 2002, for the fourth year in a row, the Company experienced
significant growth in commercial and commercial real estate loans outstanding.  At December 31, 2002 these loans had
increased by $20.0 million, or 13.0%, over year-end 2001 levels, and represented 22% of total loans outstanding, increasing
from 21% at year-end 2001.  During 2001, commercial and commercial real estate loans increased by $22.4 million, or
17.1%.  In 2000 and 1999, respectively, these loans increased by $17.9 million and $18.7 million, representing increases
of 15% and 19.8%, respectively.

<p>In general, management expects the Company's yield on its loan portfolio will be impacted by actions the Federal Reserve
Board takes from time to time affecting prevailing interest rates.  There is a time lag, however, between the Federal
Reserve's changes in prevailing rates and the impact of those changes on the Company's loan portfolio.  As discussed above
in this Report in the section entitled "Changes in Net Interest Income Due to Rate," prevailing interest rates, after increasing
steadily throughout 2000, decreased steadily in 2001 and 2002 in response to the Federal Reserve Board's sizable rate-cutting actions during all four quarters of 2001 and in November 2002.  The yield on the Company's loan portfolio has been
and will continue to be affected by these rate changes, although the decrease in average yields on loans and other earning
assets has lagged behind the decrease in average rates paid on deposits.  Loan yields began to fall over the second half
of 2001 and in all quarters of 2002.  Many of the loans in the commercial portfolio have variable rates tied to prime or U.S.
Treasury indices.   Additionally, there is a significant amount of cash flow from normal amortization and prepayments in all
loan categories, and this cash flow reprices at current rates as new loans are generated at the lower current yields.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The following table indicates the respective maturities and repricing structure of the Company's commercial, financial and
agricultural loans and its real estate - construction loans at December 31, 2002.  For purposes of determining relevant
maturities, loans are assumed to mature at (but not before) their scheduled repayment dates as required by contractual
terms.  Demand loans and overdrafts are included in the "Within 1 Year" maturity category.  All of the real estate -
construction loans are for single family houses where the Company has made a commitment for permanent financing.

<p>COMMITMENTS AND LINES OF CREDIT

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Letters of credit represent extensions of credit granted in the normal course of business which are not reflected in the
financial statements because the commitments were not funded at period-end.  As of December 31, 2002, the total
contingent liability for standby letters of credit amounted to $2.1 million.  In addition to these instruments, the Company has
issued lines of credit to customers, including home equity lines of credit, commitments for residential and commercial
construction loans and other personal and commercial lines of credit, which also may be unfunded or only partially funded
from time to time.  Commercial lines, generally issued for a period of one year, are usually extended to provide for the
working capital requirements of the borrower.  At December 31, 2002, the Company had outstanding unfunded loan
commitments in the aggregate amount of approximately $128.6 million.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>b. RISK ELEMENTS

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>NONACCRUAL, PAST DUE AND RESTRUCTURED LOANS

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Company designates loans as nonaccrual when the payment of interest and/or principal is due and unpaid for a
designated period (generally 90 days) or when the likelihood of the full repayment of principal and interest is, in the opinion
of management, uncertain.  Under the Uniform Retail Credit Classification and Account Management Policy, established by
banking regulators, fixed-maturity consumer loans must generally be charged-off no later than when 120 days past due.
Open-end credits and residential real estate loans should be charged-off no later than when 180 days past due.  Commercial
loans are evaluated for charge-off on a loan-by-loan basis.  There were no material commitments to lend additional funds
on outstanding nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2002.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest, as identified in the table presented earlier in Part II, Item 7.B.II.,
labeled "SUMMARY OF THE ALLOWANCE AND PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES," are those loans which were
contractually past due 90 days or more but because of expected repayments, were still accruing interest.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>SFAS No. 114 requires that all impaired loans, except for large groups of smaller-balance homogeneous loans, be measured
based on (I) the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, (II) the loan's
observable market price or (III) the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.  The Company applies the
provisions of SFAS No. 114 to all impaired commercial and commercial real estate loans over $250,000, and to all
restructured loans.  Allowances for losses for the remaining smaller-balance loans are evaluated under SFAS No. 5.  Under
the provisions of SFAS No. 114, the Company determines impairment for collateralized loans based on fair value of the
collateral less estimated cost to sell.  For other loans, impairment is determined by comparing the recorded value of the loan
to the present value of the expected cash flows, discounted at the loan's effective interest rate.  The Company determines
the interest income recognition method for impaired loans on a loan by loan basis.  Based upon the borrowers' payment
histories and cash flow projections, interest recognition methods include full accrual or cash basis.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>At December 31, 2002 one commercial loan was considered impaired under SFAS No. 114 with a recorded investment of
$319 thousand, an allowance for loan losses of $160 thousand and a net carrying amount of $159 thousand.  This loan was
included in nonaccrual loans in the schedule of nonperforming loans.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>At December 31, 2002, nonperforming loans amounted to $2.6 million, a decrease of $876 thousand, or 25.5%, from the
balance at year-end 2001.  The decrease was primarily attributable to one $749 thousand commercial loan designated
nonperforming at year-end 2001, which was paid-off by the borrower during December 2002.  Total nonperforming loans
at year-end 2002 represented .32% of period-end loans, a decrease from .46% at year-end 2001.  The ratio of nonperforming
loans to average loans for the Company's peer group at September 30, 2002 was .77%, or 140.6% higher than the
Company's ratio at December 31, 2002.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>During 2002 income recognized on year-end balances of nonaccrual loans was $110 thousand.  Income that would have
been recognized during that period on nonaccrual loans if all such had been current in accordance with their original terms
and had been outstanding throughout the period (or since origination if held for part of the period) was $215 thousand.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>At December 31, 2001, two commercial loans were considered impaired loans under SFAS No. 114 with a recorded
investment of $1.6 million, an allowance for loan losses of $800 thousand and a net carrying amount of $800 thousand.
These loans were included in nonaccrual loans in the schedule of nonperforming loans above. There were no impaired loans
at December 31, 2000 or 1999 within the scope of  SFAS No. 114.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>At December 31, 2001, nonperforming loans amounted to $3.4 million, an increase of $1.4 million, or 67.3%, from the
balance at year-end 2000.  The increase was attributable to the two impaired commercial loans described in the preceding
paragraph, which were placed on nonaccrual status during the fourth quarter of 2001.  The allowance for loan losses, at
December 31, 2001, included specific impairment allowances of $800 thousand for these two loans.  Total nonperforming
loans at year-end 2001 represented .46% of period-end loans, an increase from .28% at year-end 2000.  The ratio of
nonperforming loans to average loans for the Company's peer group at September 30, 2001 was .79%, or 71.7% higher than
the Company's ratio at December 31, 2001.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>During 2001 income recognized on year-end balances of nonaccrual loans was $189 thousand.  Income that would have
been recognized during that period on nonaccrual loans if all such had been current in accordance with their original terms
and had been outstanding throughout the period (or since origination if held for part of the period) was $258 thousand.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>At December 31, 2000, nonaccrual loans amounted to $1.8 million, a decrease of $33 thousand from December 31, 1999.
Loans past due 90 or more days and still accruing interest amounted to $298 thousand at December 31, 2000, a decrease
of $9 thousand from December 31, 1999.  Total nonperforming loans at year-end 2000 represented .28% of period-end
loans, a decrease from .32% at year-end 1999.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>During 2000 income recognized on year-end balances of nonaccrual loans was $75 thousand.  Income that would have been
recognized during that period on nonaccrual loans if all such had been current in accordance with their original terms and
had been outstanding throughout the period (or since origination if held for part of the period) was $176 thousand.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>POTENTIAL PROBLEM LOANS

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>On at least a quarterly basis, the Company applies an internal credit quality rating system to commercial loans that are either
past due or fully performing loans which may exhibit certain characteristics that could reflect a potential weakness.  Loans
are placed on nonaccrual status when the likely amount of future principal and interest payments are expected to be less
than the contractual amounts, even if such loans are not 90 days past due.  Because of this approach toward placing
commercial loans on nonaccrual status, the Company normally does not identify any significant number of potential  problem
loans in its portfolio that do not otherwise meet one of the classifications discussed above (e.g., nonaccrual, troubled debt
restructurings).  At year-end 2002, the Company had identified only one credit that, although still accruing interest, exhibited
such significant weakness as to warrant mention as a potential problem.  A portion of this commercial credit, totaling $319
thousand, had been placed on nonaccrual status, while the remaining amount of the credit, totaling $2.0 million, was
identified as a potential problem loan, but continues to accrue interest.  This same loan was identified as a potential problem
loan at December 31, 2001, when the amount of the loan on nonaccrual status was $850 thousand.  The balance was
reduced during 2002 by cash payments from the borrower.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Late in the first quarter of 2003, a commercial borrower announced plans to discontinue its principal and, potentially, all
aspects of its business operation.  The borrower is currently indebted to the Company's lead bank in the aggregate amount
of $2.322 million through three separate loans.  Two loans totaling $1.831 million are essentially fully collateralized by high
grade, liquid, marketable securities.  These two loans are further collateralized by a blanket lien on equipment and various
other assets.  A third loan with a current balance of $491 thousand is secured by commercial real estate having an estimated
market value significantly in excess of the loan balance.  All loans contain cross-collateralization provisions.  There are no
commitments to extend additional credit to the borrower. Consequently, the Company believes that its risk of credit loss to
this borrower, at this time, is very limited.  The Company is closely monitoring the matter and is in regular communication
with management of the borrower.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The balance of other non-current loans to which interest income was being accrued (i.e. loans 30-89 days past due as
defined in bank regulatory agency guidance) totaled $5.7 million at December 31, 2002 and represented 0.71% of loans
outstanding at that date, as compared to approximately $5.3 million, or 0.70% of loans at December 31, 2001.  These non-current loans were composed of approximately $4.7 million of consumer loans, principally indirect motor vehicle loans, $649
thousand of residential real estate loans and commercial loans of $392 thousand.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The overall level of the Company's performing loans which demonstrate characteristics of potential weakness from time to
time is for the most part dependent on economic conditions in northeastern New York State.  In general, the economy in the
Company's geographic market area was relatively strong in the 1997-2000 period.  As the country slid into a mild recession
in 2001 and continued throughout 2002, the economic downturn was not as severe in northeastern New York State.  In the
"Capital District" in and around Albany and in the area north of the Capital District, which are the Company's principal service
areas, unemployment remained below the national average.  The unemployment rate has been at or above the national
average in Essex County, near the Canadian border, during 2002.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>LOAN CONCENTRATIONS

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The loan portfolio is well diversified.  There are no concentrations of credit that exceed 10% of the portfolio, other than the
general categories reported in the preceding Section II.a. of this report.  For further discussion, see Note 26 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.

<p>OTHER REAL ESTATE OWNED AND REPOSSESSED ASSETS

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Other real estate owned (OREO) consists of real property acquired in foreclosure.  OREO is carried at the lower of (i) fair
value less estimated cost to sell or (ii) the recorded investment in the loan at the date of foreclosure, or cost.  The Company
establishes allowances for OREO losses.  The allowances are established and monitored on a property by property basis
and reflect management's ongoing estimate of the property's estimated fair value less costs to sell (when such amount is
less than cost).  For all periods, all OREO was held for sale.  Repossessed assets consist  almost entirely of automobiles.

<p>III. SUMMARY OF LOAN LOSS EXPERIENCE

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Company monitors credit quality through a continuous review of the entire loan portfolio.  All significant loans (primarily
commercial and commercial real estate loans) are reviewed at least semi-annually, and those under special supervision are
reviewed at least quarterly.  Additionally, regulatory examiners perform periodic examinations of the Company's loan
portfolios and report on these examinations to management. The boards of directors of the Company's subsidiary banks,
upon recommendations from management, determine the extent of charge-offs and have the final decision-making
responsibility in authorizing charge-offs.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Through the provision for loan losses, an allowance (reserve) is maintained for probable loan losses.  Actual loan losses are
charged against this allowance when they are identified.  In evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses,
management considers various risk factors influencing asset quality.  The analysis is performed on a loan by loan basis for
impaired and large balance loans, and by portfolio type for smaller balance homogeneous loans. This analysis is based on
judgments and estimates and may change in response to economic developments or other conditions that may influence
borrowers' economic outlook and financial condition and prospects.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In addition to conclusions regarding the adequacy of the allowance, the provision for loan losses is influenced by the total
size of the loan portfolio, the level of nonperforming loans, by the level of loans actually charged-off against the allowance
during prior periods and the change in the mix of loan categories within the loan portfolio.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The table in Part II, Item 7.B.II. "Provision for Loan Losses and Allowance for Loan Losses" presents a summary of the
activity in the Company's allowance for loan losses.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>ALLOCATION OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The allowance for loan losses is a general allowance applicable to losses inherent in the loan portfolio.  For internal operating
purposes, the allowance is not allocated among loan categories.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In the following table, the allowance has been allocated among the loan categories indicated solely for purposes of complying
with disclosure requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission.  However, this allocation should not be interpreted
as a projection of (I) likely sources of future charge-offs, (II) likely proportional distribution of future charge-offs among loan
categories or (III) likely amounts of future charge-offs.  Since management regards the allowance as a general balance and
has assigned unallocated values to categories in the table solely for purposes of compliance with the disclosure
requirements, the amounts presented do not represent the total balance available to absorb future charge-offs that might
occur within the designated categories.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>On a quarterly basis, management risk-classifies delinquent or problem loans in the commercial, commercial real estate and
real estate construction portfolios as special mention, substandard, doubtful or loss.  Reserves are assigned to all loans by
either a specific allocation, a risk-classified loss percentage or by a percentage applied to individual categories of loans.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Subject to the qualifications noted above, an allocation of the allowance for loan losses by principal classification and the
proportion of the related loan balance is presented below as of December 31 for each of the years indicated.

<p>The Company typically experiences seasonally high balances in the first and last quarters of the year due to the cyclicality
of municipal deposits which typically are included in time deposits of $100,000 or more.  In comparing average deposits for
the fourth quarters of 2002 and 2001, balances increased $78.7 million, or 8.8%.  All categories of non-maturity deposits
increased between the two comparative quarters.  As is typical in falling rate environments, many depositors placed maturing
time deposits in non-maturity deposits during the third and fourth quarters of 2001 and into 2002 as well, presumably as a
temporary investment until rates start to rise again.  This was also true for the Company's municipal depositors who also
maintained high balances in NOW accounts at both year-end 2001 and 2002.  The most significant change in deposit mix
in 2002 was the substantial decrease in time deposits of $100,000 or more, both as a percentage of the portfolio and in
absolute terms.  The total quarterly average balances as a percentage of total deposits are illustrated in the table below.

<p>In general, rates paid by the Company on its various types of deposit accounts are influenced by the rates being offered or
paid by its competitors, which themselves are influenced by prevailing interest rates in the economy as impacted from time
to time by the actions of the Federal Reserve Board.  There typically is a time lag between the Federal Reserve's actions
undertaken to influence rates and the actual repricing of deposit liabilities by the Company, but the lag is shorter in duration
than the lag for loans and other earning assets.  As a result of the eleven rate decreases in 2001 by the Federal Reserve
Board and an additional decrease in November 2002, the Company experienced a decrease in the cost of deposits in each
of the quarters in 2001 and 2002.  The cost of deposits during the fourth quarter of 2002 was at its lowest point in many
years.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If, as many believe, the economy will take several months or longer to recover, the Company may continue to experience
downward pressures on its net interest spread and net interest margin.

<p><strong>D. LIQUIDITY</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Liquidity is measured by the ability of the Company to raise cash when it needs it at a reasonable cost.  The Company must
be capable of meeting expected and unexpected obligations to its customers at any time.   Given the uncertain nature of
customer demands as well as the need to maximize earnings, the Company must have available reasonably priced sources
of funds, on- and off-balance sheet, that can be accessed quickly in time of need.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Securities available-for-sale represent a primary source of balance sheet cash flow.  Certain investment securities are
selected at purchase as available-for-sale based on their marketability and collateral value, as well as their yield and maturity.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In addition to liquidity arising from balance sheet cash flows, the Company has supplemented liquidity with additional off-balance sheet sources such as credit lines with the Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB").  The Company has established
overnight and 30 day term lines of credit with the FHLB each in the amount of $56.6 million at December 31, 2002.  There
were no advances under either line at December 31, 2002.  If advanced, such lines of credit are collateralized by mortgage-backed securities, loans and FHLB stock.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In addition, the Company has in place modest borrowing facilities from correspondent banks and also has identified
wholesale and retail repurchase agreements and brokered certificates of deposit as appropriate off-balance sheet sources
of funding.  Also, the Company's lead bank has established a borrowing facility with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York,
pledging certain consumer loans as collateral for potential "discount window" advances.  At December 31, 2002, the amount
available under this facility was $123.2 million.  There were no advances outstanding at December 31, 2002.  The Company
measures and monitors its basic liquidity as a ratio of liquid assets to short-term liabilities, both with and without the
availability of borrowing arrangements.  Based on the level of cash flows from the Company's investment securities portfolio,
particularly mortgage-backed securities, and from maturing loans in its portfolio, the Company's stable core deposit base
and its significant borrowing capacity, the Company believes that liquidity is sufficient to meet any reasonably likely events
or occurrences.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>E. CAPITAL RESOURCES AND DIVIDENDS</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Shareholders' equity was $101.4 million at December 31, 2002, an increase of $9.9 million, or 10.8%, from the prior year-end.  The increase in shareholders' equity during 2002 primarily reflected $11.4 million of retained earnings and an increase
of $2.3 million related to net unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, on securities available-for-sale, partially offset by $5.2
million of periodic repurchases of the Company's common stock.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In December 1999, the Company, through a newly-formed subsidiary business trust, privately placed $5 million in capital
securities with several institutional investors.  The securities, which are listed as "Guaranteed Preferred Beneficial Interests
in Corporation's Junior Subordinated Debentures" in the Company's consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2002,
have certain features that make them an alternative funding vehicle and the proceeds qualify as regulatory capital under the
capital adequacy guidelines discussed below.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The maintenance of appropriate capital levels is a management priority.  Overall capital adequacy is monitored on an
ongoing basis by management and reviewed regularly by the Board of Directors.  The Company's principal capital planning
goal is to provide an adequate return to shareholders while retaining a sufficient base to provide for future expansion and
comply with all regulatory standards.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>One set of regulatory capital guidelines applicable to the Company and the subsidiary banks are the so-called risk-based
capital measures.  Under these measures, as established by federal bank regulators, the minimum ratio of "Tier 1" capital
to risk-weighted assets is 4.0% and the minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets is 8.0%.  For the Company,
Tier 1 capital is comprised of shareholders' equity and capital securities issued by the Company's subsidiary, a statutory
business trust (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements) less intangible assets.  Total capital, for this risk-based
capital standard, includes Tier 1 capital plus other qualifying regulatory capital, including a portion of the Company's
allowance for loan losses.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In addition to the risk-based capital measures, the federal bank regulatory agencies require banks and bank holding
companies to satisfy another capital guideline, the Tier 1 leverage ratio (Tier 1 capital to quarterly average assets less
intangible assets).  The minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio is 3.0% for the most highly rated institutions.  The guidelines provide
that other institutions should maintain a Tier 1 leverage ratio that is at least 1.0% to 2.0% higher than the 3.0% minimum level
for top-rated institutions.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The table below sets forth the capital ratios of the Company and its subsidiary banks as of December 31, 2002:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>At December 31, 2002, the Company and both of its subsidiary banks exceeded the minimum capital ratios established by
these guidelines, and qualified as "well-capitalized", the highest category, in the capital classification scheme set by federal
bank regulatory agencies (see the further discussion under "Supervision and Regulation" in Part I.1.C. of this report).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The principal source of funds for the payment of shareholder dividends by the Company has been dividends declared and
paid to the Company by its bank subsidiaries.  There are various legal and regulatory limitations applicable to the payment
of dividends to the Company by its subsidiaries as well as the payment of dividends by the Company to its shareholders.
As of December 31, 2002, under this statutory limitation, the maximum amount that could have been paid by the bank
subsidiaries to the Company, without special regulatory approval, was approximately $23.7 million.  The ability of the
Company and the banks to pay dividends in the future is and will to continue to be influenced by regulatory policies, capital
guidelines and applicable laws.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">

Company's cash dividend payments.

<p><strong>F. FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The Company reported net income of $4.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2002, an increase of $415 thousand, or 9.5%, from
the fourth quarter of 2001.  Diluted earnings per common share for the fourth quarter of 2002 was $.59, a $.06 increase, or
11.3%, over the $.53 amount for the fourth quarter of 2001.  The increase in earnings was primarily attributable to a $145
thousand increase in net interest income, a $324 thousand reduction in the provision for loan losses, $173 thousand from
a recovery related to the Company's former Vermont operations and the discontinuance of goodwill amortization in 2002
(versus $227 thousand of amortization expense in the 2001 quarter). The factors contributing to the quarter-to-quarter
increase in net income and changes in financial condition are included with the discussion of the year-to-year changes in
this report.

<p><u>Item 7A</u>:  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>In addition to credit risk in the Company's loan portfolio and liquidity risk, discussed earlier, the Company's business activities
also generate market risk.  Market risk is the possibility that changes in future market rates or prices will make the Company's
position less valuable.  The ongoing monitoring and management of risk is an important component of the Company's
asset/liability management process which is governed by policies that are reviewed and approved annually by the Board of
Directors.  The Board of Directors delegates responsibility for carrying out asset/liability oversight and control to
management's Asset/Liability Committee ("ALCO").  In this capacity ALCO develops guidelines and strategies impacting the
Company's asset/liability profile based upon estimated market risk sensitivity, policy limits and overall market interest rate
levels and trends.  The Company does not make use of derivatives, such as interest rate swaps, in its risk management
process.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Interest rate risk is the most significant market risk affecting the Company.  Interest rate risk is the exposure of the
Company's net interest income to changes in interest rates. Interest rate risk is directly related to the different maturities and
repricing characteristics of interest-bearing assets and liabilities, as well as to prepayment risks for mortgage-related assets,
early withdrawal of time deposits, and the fact that the speed and magnitude of responses to interest rate changes varies
by product.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The ALCO utilizes the results of a detailed and dynamic simulation model to quantify the estimated exposure of net interest
income to sustained interest rate changes.  While ALCO routinely monitors simulated net interest income sensitivity over
a rolling two-year horizon, it also utilizes additional tools to monitor potential longer-term interest rate risk.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The simulation model captures the impact of changing interest rates on the interest income received and interest expense
paid on all interest-sensitive assets and liabilities reflected on the Company's consolidated balance sheet.  This sensitivity
analysis is compared to ALCO policy limits which specify a maximum tolerance level for net interest income exposure over
a one year horizon, assuming no balance sheet growth and a 200 basis point upward and downward shift in interest rates,
where interest-bearing assets and liabilities reprice at their earliest possible repricing date.  However, due to the low level
of interest rates at December 31, 2002, the downward shift was calculated using a 100 basis point shift in interest rates.  A
parallel and pro rata shift in rates over a 12 month period is assumed.  Applying the simulation model analysis as of
December 31, 2002, a 200 basis point increase in interest rates demonstrated a 1.77% decrease in net interest income, and
a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates demonstrated a 0.46% increase in net interest income.  These amounts were
within the Company's ALCO policy limits.  Basically, the inverse relationship between changes in prevailing rates and net
interest income reflects the fact that the Company's liabilities and sources of funds generally reprice more quickly than its
earning assets.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a Company forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative
of expected operating results.  As noted elsewhere in this Report, the Federal Reserve Board took certain actions throughout
2001 and again at the end of 2002 to decrease prevailing short-term interest rates, after a 12-18 month period of increasing
interest rates.  Management believes it likely that rates will begin to rise later in 2003 and in 2004.  Management believes
that an extended period of flat interest rates will continue to have a negative impact on net interest margin as asset repricing
continues downward while deposit repricing abates, and that an increase in prevailing interest rates will have a short-term
negative impact on net interest margin and net interest income as well.  Management is not able to predict with certainty what
the magnitude of these effects would be.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The hypothetical estimates underlying the sensitivity analysis are based upon numerous assumptions including: the nature
and timing of interest rate levels including yield curve shape, prepayments on loans and securities, deposit decay rates,
pricing decisions on loans and deposits, reinvestment/replacement of asset and liability cash flows, and others.  While
assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions, management cannot make any
assurance as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how customer preferences or competitor influences
might change.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Also, as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis, actual results will differ due to:
prepayment/refinancing levels likely deviating from those assumed, the varying impact of interest rate changes on caps or
floors on adjustable rate assets, the potential effect of changing debt service levels on customers with adjustable rate loans,
depositor early withdrawals and product preference changes, unanticipated shifts in the yield curve and other
internal/external variables.  Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that ALCO might take in responding
to or anticipating changes in interest rates.

<p><strong>NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>NOTE  1:	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (In Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts)</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Arrow Financial Corporation (the "Company") is a bank holding company organized in 1983 under the laws of New
York and registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956.  The accounting and reporting policies of Arrow Financial
Corporation and its subsidiaries conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and
general practices within the banking industry in all material respects.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>	Principles of Consolidation</strong> - The financial statements of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries are
consolidated and all material intercompany transactions have been eliminated.  In the "Parent Company Only" financial
statements in Note 25, the investment in wholly owned subsidiaries is carried under the equity method of accounting.  When
necessary, prior years' consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform with the current financial statement
presentation.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong>Cash and Cash Equivalents</strong> - Cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows include
the following items:  cash at branches, due from bank balances, cash items in the process of collection and federal funds sold.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>	Securities</strong> - Management determines the appropriate classification of securities at the time of purchase.  Securities
reported as held-to-maturity are those debt securities which the Company has both the positive intent and ability to hold to
maturity and are stated at amortized cost.  Securities available-for-sale are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and
losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, net of taxes.  Realized gains and losses are based upon
the amortized cost of the specific security sold.  Any unrealized losses on securities which reflect a decline in value which is
other than temporary are charged to income.  The cost of securities is adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of
discount, which is calculated on an effective interest rate method.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>	Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses</strong> - Interest income on loans is accrued and credited to income based upon
the principal amount outstanding.  Loan fees and costs directly associated with loan originations, where material, are deferred
and amortized as an adjustment to yield over the lives of the loans originated.

<p>	Loans are placed on nonaccrual status either due to the delinquency status of principal and/or interest (generally
90 days) or a judgment by management that the full repayment of principal and interest is unlikely.

<p>	The allowance for loan losses is maintained by charges to operations based upon management's evaluation of
the loan portfolio, current economic conditions, past loan losses and other factors.  In management's opinion, the balance is
sufficient to provide for probable loan losses.  While management uses available information to recognize losses on loans,
future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions in the Company's market area.
In addition, various Federal and State regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, review the
Company's allowance for loan losses.  Such agencies may require the Company to recognize additions to the allowance in
future periods, based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination which may not
be currently available to management.

<p>	The Company accounts for impaired loans under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 114,
"Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan."  SFAS No. 114, as amended, requires that impaired loans, except for large
groups of smaller-balance homogeneous loans, be measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows
discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, the loan's observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan
is collateral dependent.  If the measurement of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan, an
impairment reserve is recognized as part of the allowance for loan losses.  The Company applies the provisions of SFAS No.
114 to all impaired commercial and commercial real estate loans over $250, and to all loans restructured subsequent to the
adoption of SFAS No. 114.  Allowances for loan losses for the remaining loans are recognized in accordance with SFAS No.
5.  Under the provisions of SFAS No. 114, the Company determines impairment for collateralized loans based on fair value
of the collateral less estimated costs to sell.  For other loans, impairment is determined by comparing the recorded investment
in the loan to the present value of the expected cash flows, discounted at the loan's effective interest rate.  The Company
determines the interest income recognition method on a loan-by-loan basis.  Based upon the borrowers' payment histories and
cash flow projections, interest recognition methods include full accrual or cash basis.

<p>

<p>	<strong>Other Real Estate Owned and Repossessed Assets</strong> - Real estate acquired by foreclosure and assets acquired
by repossession are recorded at the lower of the recorded investment in the loan or the fair value of the property less estimated
costs to sell.  Subsequent declines in fair value, after transfer to other real estate owned and repossessed assets, are
recognized through a valuation allowance.  Such declines in fair value along with related operating expenses to administer such
properties or assets are charged directly to operating expense.

<p><strong>NOTE 1:	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>	Premises and Equipment</strong> - Premises and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and
amortization.  Depreciation and amortization included in operating expenses are computed largely on the straight-line method.
The provision is based on the estimated useful lives of the assets and, in the case of leasehold improvements, amortization
is computed over the terms of the respective leases or their estimated useful lives, whichever is shorter.  Gains or losses on
disposition are reflected in earnings.

<p>

<p>	<strong>Income Taxes</strong> - The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method required by SFAS
No. 109. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between
the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.  Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates
is recognized in income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date.  The Company's policy is that deferred
tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that
some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong>Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets</strong> - The Company adopted SFAS No. 147, "Acquisitions of Certain Financial
Institutions," during the quarter ended September 30, 2002.  SFAS No. 147 affects the accounting for an unidentifiable
intangible asset acquired in the acquisition of a bank or thrift (including acquisitions of branches), where the fair value of the
liabilities assumed exceeded the fair value of the assets acquired.  Under SFAS No. 147, if such a transaction met the criteria
for a business combination, the carrying amount of the unidentifiable intangible asset is reclassified to goodwill (reclassified
goodwill) as of the date SFAS No. 142 was applied in its entirety, which for the Company was January 1, 2002.  The carrying
amounts of any recognized intangible assets that meet the recognition criteria of SFAS No. 141 that have been included in the
amount reported as an unidentifiable intangible asset, and for which separate accounting records have been maintained,
should be accounted for apart from the unidentifiable intangible asset and should not be reclassified to goodwill.  The
reclassified goodwill should be accounted for and reported prospectively as goodwill under SFAS No. 142, for which
amortization is not required, but which must be evaluated annually for impairment.  Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 147,
effective January 1, 2002, the Company's unidentifiable intangible asset was being amortized over 15 years on a straight-line
basis.

<p>	Management concluded that the acquisition of branches that gave rise to the unidentifiable intangible asset was
a business combination under SFAS No. 147, and therefore ceased amortizing the reclassified goodwill retroactive to January
1, 2002.  The carrying amount of the unidentifiable intangible asset related to the branch acquisitions and reclassified as
goodwill was $9,297 as of January 1, 2002.

<p>	The carrying amounts of recognized intangible assets that meet the recognition criteria of SFAS No. 141 and for
which separate accounting records have been maintained, primarily core deposit intangibles, have been included in the
consolidated balance sheet as Other Intangible Assets, Net.  Core deposit intangibles are being amortized on a straight-line
basis over a period of 15 years.

<p>	SFAS No. 147 required the Company to complete, by December 31, 2002, the transitional impairment testing for
the reclassified goodwill as of January 1, 2002, under the guidance provided in SFAS No. 142.  Based on the transitional
impairment test performed by management, the reclassified goodwill was not impaired as of January 1, 2002.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong>Pension and Postretirement Benefits - </strong> The Company maintains a non-contributory, defined benefit pension plan
covering substantially all employees, as well as a supplemental pension plan covering certain executive officers selected by
the Board of Directors. The costs of these plans, based on actuarial computations of current and future  benefits for employees,
are charged to current operating expenses. The  Company also provides certain post-retirement medical, dental and life
insurance benefits to substantially all employees and retirees. The cost of post-retirement benefits other than pensions is
recognized on an accrual  basis as employees perform services to earn the benefits.

<p><strong>NOTE 1:	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong>Stock-Based Compensation Plans -</strong> The Company has two stock-based compensation plans, which are
described more fully in Notes 17 and 18.  The Company accounts for those plans under the recognition and measurement
principles of APB Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and related Interpretations.  No stock-based
employee compensation cost is reflected in net income (other than for certain stock appreciation rights granted in 1992 and
earlier, all of which have been exercised as of December 31, 2002), as all options granted under those plans have an exercise
price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant.  However, options granted do generally
impact diluted earnings per share by increasing the weighted average diluted shares outstanding and thereby decreasing
diluted earnings per share as compared to basic earnings per share.  See also Note 14.

<p>	The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the Company had applied the fair
value recognition provisions of FASB Statement No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," to stock-based
employee compensation.

<p>	The weighted-average fair value of options granted during 2002, 2001 and 2000 was $7.61, $6.32 and $3.56,
respectively.  The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model
with the following weighted-average assumptions used for grants in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively: dividend yields of
3.24%, 3.30% and 4.00%; expected volatility of 27.5%, 25.4% and 23.1%; risk free interest rates of 3.13%, 4.50% and 5.43%;
and expected lives of 7.0 years for each year.  The effects of applying SFAS No. 123 on the pro forma net income may not
be representative of the effects on pro forma net income for future years.  As reported in Note 17, the Company sponsors an
Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) with a 15% discount.  Under SFAS No. 123, the ESPP is considered compensatory
and the entire discount is considered to be compensation expense in the pro forma disclosures.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>	Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase - </strong>In securities repurchase agreements, the Company receives
cash from a counterparty in exchange for the transfer of securities to a third party custodian's account that explicitly recognizes
the Company's interest in the securities.  These agreements are accounted for by the Company as secured financing
transactions since it maintains effective control over the transferred securities and meets other criteria for such accounting as
specified in SFAS No. 140.  Accordingly, the cash proceeds are recorded as borrowed funds and the underlying securities
continue to be carried in the Company's securities available-for-sale portfolio.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong>Earnings Per Share ("EPS")</strong> - Basic EPS excludes dilution and is computed by dividing income available to
common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.  Diluted EPS reflects
the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into
common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the entity (such as the
Company's stock options), computed using the treasury stock method.  Unallocated common shares held by the Company's
Employee Stock Ownership Plan are not included in the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for either
the basic or diluted EPS calculation.

<p><strong>NOTE 1:	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>	Financial Instruments</strong> -  The Company is a party to certain financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, such
as:  commercial lines of credit, construction lines of credit, overdraft protection, home equity lines of credit and standby letters
of credit.  The Company's policy is to record such instruments when funded.  Fair value estimates are made at a specific point
in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument.  These estimates do not reflect
any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the Company's entire holdings of a particular
financial instrument.  Because no market exists for a significant portion of the Company's financial instruments, fair value
estimates are based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, risk characteristics
of various financial instruments, and other factors.  These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and
matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision.  Changes in assumptions could significantly
affect the estimates.

<p>	Fair value estimates are based on existing on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments without attempting to
estimate the value of anticipated future business and the value of assets and liabilities that are not considered financial
instruments.  For example, the Company has a substantial trust department that contributes net fee income annually.  The
value of trust department customer relationships is not considered a financial instrument, and therefore this value has not been
incorporated into the fair value estimates.  Other significant assets and liabilities that are not considered financial assets or
liabilities include deferred taxes, premises and equipment, the value of low-cost long-term core deposits and goodwill.  In
addition, the tax ramifications related to the realization of the unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair
value estimates and have not been considered in any of the estimates.

<p>	The carrying amount of the following short-term assets and liabilities is a reasonable estimate of fair value: cash
and due from banks, federal funds sold and purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, demand deposits,
savings, N.O.W. and money market deposits, other short-term borrowings, accrued interest receivable and accrued interest
payable.  The fair value estimates of other on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments, as well as the method of arriving
at fair value estimates, are included in the related footnotes and summarized in Note 24.  As of December 31, 2002 and 2001,
and during 2002, 2001 and 2000, the Company had no derivative instruments within the meaning of SFAS No. 133,
"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong>Trust Assets and Fiduciary Income</strong> - Assets held by the Company in a fiduciary or agency capacity for its
customers are not included in the consolidated balance sheets since these assets are not assets of the Company.  Income
from fiduciary activities is reported on the accrual basis.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong>Segment Reporting -</strong> Management evaluates the operations of the Company based solely on one business
segment - commercial banking, which constitutes the Company's only segment for financial reporting purposes.  The Company
operates primarily in northern New York State in Warren, Washington, Saratoga, Essex and Clinton counties and surrounding
areas.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<strong>Management's Use of Estimates</strong> -The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	A material estimate that is particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term is the allowance for loan
losses.  In connection with the determination of the allowance for loan losses, management obtains appraisals for properties.
The allowance for loan losses is management's best estimate of probable loan losses incurred as of the balance sheet date.
While management uses available information to recognize losses on loans, future adjustments to the allowance for loan
losses may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions.  In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral
part of their examination process, periodically review the Company's allowance for loan losses.  Such agencies may require
the Company to recognize adjustments to the allowance for loan losses based on their judgments about information available
to them at the time of their examination, which may not be currently available to management.

<p><strong>NOTE  2:	CASH AND DUE FROM BANKS (In Thousands)</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	The bank subsidiaries are required to maintain certain reserves of vault cash and/or deposits with the Federal
Reserve Bank.  The total amount of the required reserve at December 31, 2002 and 2001 was approximately $13,085 and
$11,459, respectively.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>NOTE  3:	SECURITIES (In Thousands)</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	The fair value of  securities, except certain state and municipal securities, is estimated based on published prices
or bid quotations received from securities dealers.  The fair value of certain state and municipal securities is not readily
available through market sources, so fair value estimates are based on the discounted contractual cash flows using estimated
market discount rates that reflect the credit and interest rate risk inherent in the instrument, or for short-term securities, the
carrying amount.

<p>	The carrying amount of net loans at December 31, 2002 and 2001 was $800,099 and $745,404, respectively.  The
estimated fair value of net loans at December 31, 2002 and 2001 was $824,827 and $764,179, respectively.

<p>	Fair values are estimated for portfolios of loans with similar financial characteristics.  Loans are segregated by type
such as commercial, commercial real estate, residential mortgage, indirect and other consumer loans.  Each loan category
is further segmented into fixed and adjustable rate interest terms and by performing and nonperforming categories.

<p>	The fair value of performing loans is calculated by discounting scheduled cash flows through the estimated maturity
using estimated market discount rates that reflect the credit and interest rate risk inherent in the loan.  The estimate of maturity
is based on historical experience with repayments for each loan classification, modified, as required, by an estimate of the
effect of current economic and lending conditions.   Fair value for nonperforming loans is generally based on recent external
appraisals.  If appraisals are not available, estimated cash flows are discounted using a rate commensurate with the risk
associated with the estimated cash flows.  Assumptions regarding credit risk, cash flows and discount rates are judgmentally
determined using available market information and specific borrower information.

<p>	Certain executive officers and directors, including their immediate families and organizations in which they are
principals of the company or affiliates, have various loan, deposit and other transactions with the Company.  Such transactions
are on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable
transactions with others.  The amount of such related party loans was $8,141 at December 31, 2002 and $10,080 at December
31, 2001.  During 2002, the amount of new loans and renewals extended to such related parties was $1,808 and the total of
loan repayments was $3,747.

<p>	The Company has pledged certain loans secured by one-to-four family residential mortgages under a blanket
collateral agreement to secure borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank (see Note 11).  As of December 31, 2002, the
amount of such pledged loans amounted to $173,189.

<p>	The Company designates certain loans as nonaccrual and suspends the accrual of interest and the amortization
of net deferred fees or costs when payment of interest and/or principal is due and unpaid for a period of, generally, ninety days
or the likelihood of repayment is uncertain in the opinion of management.  The following table presents information concerning

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	The Company has established overnight and 30 day term lines of credit with the FHLB each in the amount of
$56,592.  If advanced, such lines of credit will be collateralized by mortgage-backed securities, loans and FHLB stock.
Participation in the FHLB program requires an investment in FHLB stock.  The investment in FHLB stock, included in Securities
Available-for-Sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, amounted to $8,025 and $6,250 at December 31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively.  The Company also borrows longer term funds from the FHLB.  Some are in the form of "convertible advances."
These advances have a set final maturity, but are callable by the FHLB at certain dates beginning no earlier than one year from
the issuance date.  If the advances are called, the Company may elect to have the funds replaced by the FHLB at the then
prevailing market rate of interest.  The borrowings are secured by mortgage loans and/or mortgage-backed securities.  The
total amount of assets pledged to the FHLB for borrowing arrangements at December 31, 2002 and 2001 amounted to
$181,214 and $188,446, respectively.  The table below presents information applicable to FHLB advances as of December

<p><strong>NOTE 12:	GUARANTEED PREFERRED BENEFICIAL INTERESTS IN CORPORATION'S JUNIOR SUBORDINATED</strong>

<p><strong>	     DEBENTURES</strong> <strong>(In Thousands)</strong>

<p>

<p>	       On November 22, 1999, the Company established Arrow Capital Trust I (the "Trust") which is a statutory
business trust formed under Delaware law upon filing a certificate of trust with the Delaware Secretary of State.  The Trust
exists for the exclusive purposes of (i) issuing and selling 30 year guaranteed preferred beneficial interests in the Corporation's
junior subordinated debentures ("capital securities") in the aggregate amount of $5,000 at a fixed rate of 9.50%, (ii) using the
proceeds from the sale of the capital securities to acquire the junior subordinated debentures issued by the Company and (iii)
engaging in only those other activities necessary, advisable or incidental thereto.  The junior subordinated debentures are the
sole assets of the Trust and, accordingly, payments under the corporation obligated junior debentures are the sole revenue
of the Trust.  All of the common securities of the Trust are owned by the Company.  The Company has used the net proceeds
from the sale of the capital securities for general corporate purposes.  The capital securities, with associated expense that is
tax deductible, qualify as Tier I capital under regulatory definitions.

<p><strong>NOTE 12:	GUARANTEED PREFERRED BENEFICIAL INTERESTS IN CORPORATION'S JUNIOR SUBORDINATED</strong>

<p><strong>	     DEBENTURES</strong> <strong>(Continued)</strong>

<p>

<p>The Company's primary source of funds to pay interest on the debentures owed to the Trust are current dividends from its
subsidiary banks.  Accordingly, the Company's ability to service the debentures is dependent upon the continued ability of the
subsidiary banks to pay dividends to the Company.  Since the capital securities are classified as debt for financial statement
purposes, the expense associated with the capital securities is recorded as interest expense in the consolidated statements
of income.  The carrying amount of these capital securities was $5,000 at both December 31, 2002 and 2001.  The estimated
fair value was $6,127 and $5,798 at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.  The fair value of these capital securities is
estimated based on the discounted value of contractual cash flows.  The discount rate is estimated using the current published
yield on seasoned BAA corporate debt securities.

<p><strong>NOTE  15:	REGULATORY MATTERS (Dollars in Thousands)</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	In the normal course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries operate under certain regulatory restrictions,
such as the extent and structure of covered intercompany borrowings and maintenance of reserve requirement balances.

<p>	The principal source of the funds for the payment of shareholder dividends by the Company has been from
dividends declared and paid to the Company by its bank subsidiaries.  As of December 31, 2002, the maximum amount that
could have been paid by subsidiary banks to the Company, without prior regulatory approval, was approximately $23,675.

<p>	Under current Federal Reserve regulations, the Company is prohibited from borrowing from the subsidiary banks
unless such borrowings are secured by specific obligations.  Additionally, the maximum of any such borrowing is limited to
10% of an affiliate's capital and surplus.

<p>	The Company and its subsidiary banks are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by
the federal banking agencies.  Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory--and possibly
additional discretionary--actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on an institution's
financial statements.  Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the
Company and its subsidiary banks must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets,
liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices.  Capital amounts and
classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors.

<p>	Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Company and its
subsidiary banks to maintain minimum capital amounts and ratios (set forth in the table below) of total and Tier I capital (as
defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined), and of Tier I capital (as defined) to average assets (as
defined).  Management believes, as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, that the Company and both subsidiary banks meet
all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject.

<p>	As of December 31, 2002, the Company and both subsidiary banks qualified as well capitalized under the
regulatory framework for prompt corrective action.  To be categorized as well capitalized, the Company and its subsidiary
banks must maintain minimum total risk-based, Tier I risk-based, and Tier I leverage ratios as set forth in the table below.
There are no conditions or events that management believes have changed the Company's or its subsidiary banks'
categories.

<p>	The Company's ("Arrow") and its subsidiary banks', Glens Falls National Bank and Trust Company ("Glens Falls
National") and Saratoga National Bank and Trust Company ("Saratoga National"), actual capital amounts and ratios are
presented in the table below as of December 31, 2002 and 2001:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	The Company sponsors qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit
plans for its employees.  The Company maintains a non-contributory pension plan which covers substantially all employees.
Effective December 1, 2002, all active participants in the qualified defined benefit pension plan were given a one-time
irrevocable election to continue participating in the traditional plan design, for which benefits were based on years of service
and the participant's final compensation (as defined), or to begin participating in the new cash balance plan design.  All
employees who become participants in the plan after December 1, 2002 will automatically participate in the cash balance
plan design.  The interest credits under the cash balance plan are based on the 30-year U.S. Treasury rate.  The service
credits under the cash balance plan are equal to 6.0% for employees who become participants on or after January 1, 2003.
For employees in the plan prior to January 1, 2003, the service credits are scaled based on the age of the participant, and
range from 6.0% to 12.0%.  The funding policy is to contribute the maximum amount that can be deducted for federal income
tax purposes.  The Company also maintains a supplemental non-qualified unfunded retirement plan to provide eligible
employees of the Company and its subsidiaries with benefits in excess of qualified plan limits imposed by federal tax law.

<p>	The Company has multiple non-pension postretirement benefit plans.  The health care, dental and life insurance
plans are contributory, with participants' contributions adjusted annually.  The health care plan provides for automatic
increases of Company contributions each year based on the increase in inflation, up to a maximum of 5%.  The Company's
policy is to fund the cost of postretirement benefits in amounts determined at the discretion of management.

<p>	The following tables provide a reconciliation of the changes in the plans' benefit obligations (projected benefit
obligation for pension benefits and accumulated benefit obligation for postretirement benefits) and fair value of the plans'
assets during the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, and a reconciliation of the funded status to the net amount
recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31 of both years:

<p>	As a result of those employees who elected to convert to the cash balance plan from the qualified defined benefit
pension plan (as described above), there was a reduction of $2,570 in the projected benefit obligation during 2002.  A portion
of this prior service credit was used to offset the outstanding balances of previously established prior service costs which
were attributable to a similar participant group (i.e. active participants) totaling $178.  The remaining net prior service credit
attributable to the conversion will be amortized over the average expected future service period of all active participants who
were affected by the amendment to the plan (approximately 15.6 years).

was assumed for fiscal year 2002.  The rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 5.0% for fiscal year 2010 and remain

assumed for fiscal year 2002, decreasing gradually to 5.0% for fiscal year 2010 and remaining at that level thereafter. A

<p>	The Company maintains an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP).  Substantially all employees of the
Company and its subsidiaries are eligible to participate upon satisfaction of applicable service requirements.  The ESOP
borrowed $105 and $464 in 2001 and 2000, respectively, from one of the Company's subsidiary banks to purchase
outstanding shares of the Company's common stock.  The notes require the Company to contribute at least an amount
necessary for the ESOP to discharge its current obligations which include principal and interest payments on the notes. The
Company's ESOP expense amounted to $700, $756 and $421 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.  As the debt is repaid,
shares are released from collateral based on the proportion of debt paid to total debt outstanding for the year and allocated
to active employees.

<p>	Shares pledged as collateral are reported as unallocated ESOP shares in shareholders' equity.  As shares are
released from collateral, the Company reports compensation expense equal to the current average market price of the
shares, and the shares become outstanding for earnings per share computations.  The ESOP shares as of December 31,
2002 were as follows:

Substantially all employees of the Company and its subsidiaries were eligible to participate upon satisfaction of applicable
service requirements.  The aggregate cost of the ESPP as reflected in the Company's consolidated financial statements was
$54 in 2000.  A new ESPP became effective August 1, 2000.  Under this plan, employees may purchase shares of the
Company's common stock, up to $24 annually, at a discount to the prevailing market price (currently a 15% discount).  Under
the new ESPP, shares are issued by the Company without a charge to earnings in accordance with APB Opinion No. 25.
Substantially all employees of the Company and its subsidiaries are eligible to participate upon satisfaction of applicable

<p><strong>NOTE  19:	SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	In 1997, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted a shareholder rights plan.  The plan provides for the
distribution of one preferred stock purchase right for each outstanding share of common stock of the Company.  Each right
entitles the holder, following the occurrence of certain events, to purchase a unit consisting of one-hundredth of a share of
Series 1 Junior Participating Preferred Stock, at a purchase price of $47.10 (adjusted for stock dividends and stock splits)
per unit, subject to adjustment.  The rights will not be exercisable or transferable apart from the common stock except under
certain circumstances in which a person or group of affiliated persons acquires, or commences a tender offer to acquire, 20%
or more of the Company's common stock.  Rights held by such an acquiring person or persons may thereafter become void.
Under certain circumstances a right may become a right to purchase common stock or assets of the Company or common
stock of an acquiring corporation at a substantial discount.  Under certain circumstances, the Company may redeem the
rights at $.01 per right.  The rights will expire in April 2007 unless earlier redeemed or exchanged by the Company.

<p><strong>NOTE 23:	FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES </strong>

<p><strong>		(In Thousands)</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	The Company is party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to
meet the financing needs of its customers.  These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, standby letters
of credit and loans sold with recourse.  Commitments to extend credit include home equity lines of credit, commitments for
residential and commercial construction loans and other personal and commercial lines of credit.  Those instruments involve,
to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance
sheets.  The contract or notional amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of the involvement the Company has in
particular classes of financial instruments.

<p>	The Company's exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial
instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual notional amount
of those instruments.  The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as
it does for on-balance sheet instruments.

<p>	Commitments to extend credit were $128,611 and $111,703 at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
These commitments are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in
the contract.  Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of
a fee.  Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do
not necessarily represent future cash requirements.  The Company evaluates each customer's creditworthiness on a
case-by-case basis.  Home equity lines of credit are secured by residential real estate.  Construction lines of credit are
secured by underlying real estate.  For other lines of credit, the amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the
Company upon extension of credit, is based on management's credit evaluation of the counterparty.  Collateral held varies,
but may include accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment, and income-producing commercial properties.
Most of the commitments are variable rate instruments.

<p>	In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 45 (FIN No. 45), "Guarantor's Accounting and
Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others; an Interpretation of FASB
Statements No. 5, 57, and 107 and rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34."  FIN No. 45 requires certain new disclosures
and potential liability-recognition for the fair value at issuance of guarantees that fall within its scope.  Under FIN No. 45, the
Company does not issue any guarantees that would require liability-recognition or disclosure, other than its standby letters
of credit.

<p>	The Company has issued conditional commitments in the form of standby letters of credit to guarantee payment
on behalf of a customer and guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party.  Standby letters of credit generally
arise in connection with lending relationships. The credit risk involved in issuing these instruments is essentially the same
as that involved in extending loans to customers. Contingent obligations under standby letters of credit totaled $2,062 and
$1,231 at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, and represent the maximum potential future payments the Company
could be required to make.  Typically, these instruments have terms of 12 months or less and expire unused; therefore, the
total amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.   Each customer is evaluated individually for
creditworthiness under the same underwriting standards used for commitments to extend credit and on-balance sheet
instruments.  Company policies governing loan collateral apply to standby letters of credit at the time of credit extension.
Loan-to-value ratios will generally range from 50% for movable assets, such as inventory, to 100% for liquid assets, such
as bank CD's.  The carrying amount and fair value of the Company's standby letters of credit at December 31, 2002 and 2001
were insignificant.  The fair value of standby letters of credit is based on the fees currently charged for similar agreements
or the cost to terminate the arrangement with the counterparties.

<p><strong>NOTE 23:	FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES </strong>

<p><strong>		(Continued)</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Under SFAS No. 107 the fair value of commitments to extend credit is determined by estimating the fees to enter
into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms and present creditworthiness of the counterparties, and for
fixed rate loan commitments, the difference between the current and committed interest rates.  The Company provides
several types of commercial lines of credit and standby letters of credit to its commercial customers.  The pricing of these
services is not isolated as the Company considers the customer's complete deposit and borrowing relationship in pricing
individual products and services.  The commitments to extend credit also include commitments under home equity lines of
credit, for which the Company charges no fee.  The carrying value and fair value of commitments to extend credit are not
material and the Company does not expect to incur any material loss as a result of these commitments.

<p>	In the normal course of business, the Company and its subsidiary banks become involved in a variety of routine
legal proceedings including so-called "lender liability" claims, in which borrowers allege that they have suffered loss as a
result of inappropriate actions taken by lending banks.  At present, there are no legal proceedings pending or threatened
which, in the opinion of management and counsel, would result in a material loss to the Company.

<p><strong>NOTE 26:	CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>			Most of the Company's loans are with customers in northern New York.  Although the loan portfolios of the
subsidiary banks are well diversified, tourism has a substantial impact on the northern New York economy.  The
commitments to extend credit are fairly consistent with the distribution of loans presented in Note 4.  Generally, the loans
are secured by assets and are expected to be repaid from cash flow or the sale of selected assets of the borrowers.  The
Company evaluates each customer's creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis.  The amount of collateral obtained, if
deemed necessary by the Company upon extension of credit, is based upon management's credit evaluation of the
counterparty.  The nature of the collateral varies with the type of loan and may include:  residential real estate, cash and
securities, inventory, accounts receivable, property, plant and equipment, income producing commercial properties and
automobiles.

<p><strong>SUMMARY OF QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA (Unaudited)</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	The following quarterly financial information for 2002 and 2001 is unaudited, but, in the opinion of management, fairly
presents the results of the Company.  The results for the first and second quarters of 2002 have been adjusted from the
amounts originally reported by the Company to reflect the adoption of SFAS No. 147, which was issued by the FASB in
October 2002 (See Notes 1 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements).  Earnings per share amounts have also been
adjusted for the 2002 five percent stock dividend.

<p>	<u>Directors' Stock Plan</u>.   The Directors' Stock Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors in 1999.  It provides for the
issuance to directors of the Company and its subsidiaries of shares of the Company's common stock.  The shares constitute
part of their compensation for service as directors.  The number of shares granted each year to each eligible director is fixed
in advance by vote of the full Board of Directors.  The total number of shares authorized for issuance under the Plan, as
adjusted, is 8,269 shares.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	<u>Employee Stock Purchase Plan</u>.  The Employee Stock Purchase Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors in 2000.
It provides for sale to directors, officers, employees and certain retirees of shares of the Company's common stock at a
discount from the market value of the stock on date of purchase.  Participants purchase shares through automatic
withholding by the Company from their paychecks or, in the case of directors or retirees, automatic deduction from bank
deposit accounts.  The current discount on shares acquired under the Plan is 15%, with the discount level to be set from time
to time by the full Board.  The maximum and minimum participation levels are $2,000 and $5, respectively, per participant
per month.  The discounted price only applies to the first $1,000 of a participant's monthly contribution; after that threshold
is reached, shares are purchased at market price.  The total number of shares authorized to be sold under the Plan, as
adjusted, is 551,250 shares.

<p>Senior management maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to
be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods provided
in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.  In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, senior management has recognized that
any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of
achieving the desired control objectives, and therefore has been required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit
relationship of possible controls and procedures.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Senior management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the
design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13(a)-14(c) under the Exchange Act) as
of a date within 90 days prior to the filing date of this Report.  Based upon that evaluation, senior management, including
the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective
on that date.  Further, there have been no significant changes made in our internal controls or other factors that could
significantly affect these internal controls subsequent to the date of the most recent evaluation performed by the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.
