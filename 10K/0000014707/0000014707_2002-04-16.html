<p><b><u>PART I</u></b></center>

<p><b><u>ITEM 1 - BUSINESS</u></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company, founded in 1878
and incorporated in 1913, operates in the footwear industry. In 1999, the
Company changed its name from Brown Group, Inc., to Brown Shoe Company,
Inc. Current activities include the operation of retail shoe stores and
the sourcing and marketing of footwear for women, men and children. During
2001, categories of footwear sales were approximately 59% women's, 27%
men's and 14% children's. This composition has remained relatively constant
over the past few years. Approximately 71% of 2001 footwear sales were
made at retail compared to 73% in 2000 and 70% in 1999. See Note 6 of Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements on page 35 of the Annual Report to
Shareholders for the year ended February 2, 2002, which is incorporated
herein by reference, for additional information regarding the Company's
business segments.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2001, the Company launched
a set of initiatives that are expected to improve the performance of the
Company. These initiatives include the closing of 97 underperforming domestic
Naturalizer Retail stores, optimizing the investment in inventory at the
Famous Footwear division, installing a new management team at Famous Footwear,
and implementing a Shared Services platform in the Company's information
systems, finance and human resources functions. In the fourth quarter of
2001, a charge was taken to implement these initiatives along with the
costs associated with other nonrecurring events including the costs of
calling and restructuring its debt.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company's business is
seasonal in nature due to consumer spending patterns, with higher back-to-school,
Easter and Christmas holiday season sales. Traditionally, the third fiscal
quarter accounts for a substantial portion of the Company's operating earnings
for the year.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company has approximately
11,500 full and part-time employees. Approximately 100 employees engaged
in the warehousing of footwear in the United States are employed under
a union contract, which will expire in September 2002. In Canada, the Company
employs approximately 330 factory and warehouse employees under union contracts,
which expire in October 2002 and October 2003.
<p><u>Retail Operations</u>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company's retail operations
at February 2, 2002 included 1,376 retail shoe stores in the United States
and Canada operating primarily under the Famous Footwear, Factory Brand
Shoes, Warehouse Shoes, Supermarket of Shoes, Naturalizer and F.X. LaSalle
names. A portion of the retail sales includes Company-owned and licensed
brand names.

<hr ALIGN=RIGHT SIZE=3 NOSHADE WIDTH="100%">
<p><b><u>ITEM 1 - BUSINESS</u> (Continued)</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In retail sales of footwear,
the Company competes in a highly fragmented market with many organizations
operating retail shoe stores and departments. Competitors include local,
regional and national shoe store chains, department stores, discount stores
and numerous independent retail operators of various sizes. Quality, customer
service, store location, merchandise selection, advertising and pricing
are important components of retail competition.
<p><i>Famous Footwear</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Famous Footwear, with 920
stores at the end of fiscal 2001, is America's largest chain selling branded
value-priced footwear for the entire family. Founded over 30 years ago,
Famous Footwear was purchased by the Company in 1981 as a 32-store chain,
and now also operates under such names as Factory Brand Shoes, Warehouse
Shoes and Supermarket of Shoes.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Famous Footwear stores feature
a wide selection of brand-name, value-priced athletic, casual and dress
shoes for the entire family. Brands carried include, among others, Nike,
Skechers, New Balance, Reebok, adidas, Rockport, Vans, Connie, K-Swiss,
Naturalizer and Westies.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Famous Footwear stores are
located in strip and power strip shopping centers as well as outlet malls
and regional malls in all 50 states, Puerto Rico and Guam. The breakdown
by venue is as follows at the end of fiscal 2001.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The stores open at the end
of fiscal 2001 averaged approximately 6,500 square feet. Those stores open
at the end of fiscal 2000 averaged approximately 5,900 square feet. Total
square footage was 5.9 million at the end of fiscal 2001 compared to 5.5
million at the end of fiscal 2000. The increase in total square footage
and in the average store size reflects the Company's initiative to reposition
a portion of Famous Footwear's real estate portfolio by moving from 5,000
- 6,000 square foot stores to 8,000-12,000 square foot stores in high traffic,
power strip shopping centers. The Company believes that the larger store
format in power strip shopping centers will become highly productive as
this venue provides the best opportunity to showcase and display the wide
variety of brands available at Famous Footwear. At the end of fiscal 2001,
the chain had 129 of these larger stores open. Plans are to open an additional
50 larger stores in fiscal 2002, while closing a like number of smaller
stores.

<hr ALIGN=RIGHT SIZE=3 NOSHADE WIDTH="100%">
<p><b><u>ITEM 1 - BUSINESS</u> (Continued)</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Famous Footwear has developed
store model stocks which reflect consumer demand, historical brand preferences,
styles and sizes. These inventory models are adjusted based upon store
location and promotional opportunities. The Company's in-store point-of-sale
systems provide detailed sales transaction data to the headquarters in
Madison, Wisconsin for daily analysis and update of the perpetual inventory
systems, which leads to replenishment of model stocks. These systems also
are used for training employees and communications between the stores and
headquarters.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fiscal 2001, the Company
embarked upon an initiative entitled IMPACT (Improved Performance and Competitive
Transformation), which is focused on reengineering the Famous Footwear
buying, merchandising and allocation functions. New processes were instituted,
and new talent was recruited to embrace a new way of delivering the freshest,
most popular brands and styles to its customers. This process starts with
increased testing to identify emerging styles. As a result of this greater
testing and knowledge, orders are being placed much closer to the selling
season. The goal of this initiative is to have the right shoes for our
customers, significantly increase inventory turns, and achieve a $75 million
reduction in base inventories by 2004. In order to accelerate the implementation
of this initiative and achieve greater "freshness and velocity" in its
inventory, a pretax charge of $16 million was recorded in the fourth quarter
of fiscal 2001 to allow deep price reductions in clearing prior season
merchandise. As a result of the early stage of this program, Famous Footwear's
inventories were $30 million lower at the end of fiscal 2001 than at the
same time a year earlier.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With two distribution centers
located in Sun Prairie, Wisconsin and Lebanon, Tennessee, Famous Footwear's
distribution systems allow for merchandise to be delivered to each store
weekly. In addition to the delivery of new styles and current promotional
items, these systems provide item replenishment of the prior week's sales
and, in some cases, redistribution of product to stores demonstrating the
greatest item sell-through from stores with lower sell-through.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Famous Footwear's marketing
program includes newspaper, radio and television advertising, in-store
signage and database marketing, all of which are designed to further develop
and reinforce the Famous Footwear concept with the consumer. Marketing
and advertising programs are tailored on a region-by-region basis to reach
target customers. The Company utilizes a database marketing program, which
targets and rewards frequent customers. In addition, the timing of certain
advertising campaigns corresponds to regional differences such as the important
back-to-school season, which begins at various times throughout the country.
In fiscal 2001, management spent approximately $31 million to communicate
Famous Footwear's philosophy: delivering to the customer the best value
on quality, branded footwear.

<p><b><u>ITEM 1 - BUSINESS</u> (Continued)</b>
<p><i>Naturalizer</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company's Naturalizer
stores are showcases for the Company's flagship brand of women's shoes.
The Company operates 296 Naturalizer stores in the United States and 144
stores in Canada. Of the total 440 stores, 365 are located in regional
malls and average approximately 1,200 square feet in size, and 75 are located
in outlet malls and average approximately 2,600 square feet in size. Total
square footage at the end of fiscal 2001 was approximately 640,000.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These stores are designed
and merchandised to appeal to the Naturalizer customer who is style- and
comfort-conscious and who seeks quality and value in her footwear selections.
In addition, the Company has repositioned its styles to focus on a younger,
more active woman. The Naturalizer stores offer a selection of women's
footwear styles, including dress, casual and athletic shoes, primarily
under the Naturalizer brand. The Naturalizer brand is one of North America's
leading women's footwear brands, providing stylish, comfortable and quality
footwear in a variety of patterns and sizes. Retail price points are typically
between $50 and $60 per pair.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fiscal 2001, the Company
opened 26 stores and closed 51. Of the 51 closed, 24 were part of the initiative
announced near the end of fiscal 2001 to close 97 underperforming stores
in the United States. The remaining closings are expected to occur primarily
in the first half of fiscal 2002. These closings are expected to significantly
improve this division's operating performance in fiscal 2003. Fiscal 2002's
results will reflect the operating losses of these stores until they are
closed. The Company is planning to open 15-20 new stores in 2002.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marketing programs for the
Naturalizer stores have complemented the Company's Naturalizer brand advertising,
building on the brand's consumer recognition and reinforcing the brand's
added focus on style, comfort and quality. The Company utilizes a database
marketing program, which targets and rewards frequent customers.
<p><i>F.X. LaSalle</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company operates 16 F.X.
LaSalle retail stores, primarily in the Montreal, Canada market that sell
better-grade men's and women's branded and private label footwear. This
footwear, primarily imported from Italy, retails at price points ranging
from $100 to $250. These stores average approximately 2,100 square feet.

<p><i>E-Commerce</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In late 2000, the Company
purchased a majority interest in Shoes.com, Inc., an existing e-tailing
company. Using the Company's existing inventory, distribution network and
information systems, the Shoes.com site was relaunched as a multi-brand
footwear site in Spring 2001. In addition, a FamousFootwear.com site was
launched at the same time, which operates as a Famous Footwear e-tailing
store. These sites offer footwear and accessories to men, women and children
that are purchased from outside suppliers and certain merchandise that
is sold in Famous Footwear stores.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company also operates
an e-tailing site, Naturalizer.com, which offers substantially the same
product selection to consumers as the Company's domestic Naturalizer retail
stores. This site functions as a retail outlet for the online consumer
and serves as another brand building vehicle for Naturalizer.
<p><u>Wholesale Operations</u>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company's Wholesale operation
designs and markets branded, licensed and private label dress, casual and
athletic footwear for women, men and children at a variety of price points
to approximately 2,200 retailers, including department stores, mass merchandisers,
chains and independent retailers throughout the United States and Canada.
The division is a resource for many of the nation's largest retailers,
including Wal-Mart, Payless ShoeSource, The May Company, Federated, Dillard's,
Nordstrom, Saks, Target, Sears and Famous Footwear, as well as The Bay,
Sears and Wal-Mart in Canada. The vast majority of the division's customers
also sell shoes bought from competing footwear suppliers.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fiscal 2001 the division
provided its customers with approximately 67 million pairs of shoes. Substantially
all of this footwear was imported through the Company's International division,
except for those pairs produced at two company-owned manufacturing facilities
in Canada.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wholesale orders for shoes
are solicited by the Company's sales force throughout the year. The sales
force is generally responsible for managing the Company's relationships
with its wholesale customers. Orders placed as a result of these sales
efforts are taken before the shoes are sourced with delivery generally
within three to four months thereafter. Footwear is sold to wholesale customers
on both a first-cost and landed basis. First-cost sales are those in which
the Company obtains title to footwear from its overseas suppliers and typically
relinquishes title to customers at a designated overseas port. Landed sales
are those in which the Company obtains title to the footwear from its overseas
suppliers and maintains title until the footwear is inside the United States
borders. Certain high-volume styles, particularly in the Naturalizer and
LifeStride lines, are inventoried to allow prompt shipment on reorders.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to orders placed
through the Company's sales force, the Wholesale division provides its
retail customers the ability to directly check inventory of all wholesale
product in Brown Shoe's distribution centers, place orders, and track expected
product arrivals over its Internet site. Over 800 retailers utilize this
e-commerce tool. In addition, the Company also provides these retailers
with its "E-direct" system that allows them to sell out-of-stock product,
with Brown Shoe Company then shipping the product directly to the consumer's
home.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Major brand names owned by
the Company include Naturalizer, LifeStride, Buster Brown, Airstep, Connie
and Brown Shoe. Each of the Company's brands is targeted to a specific
customer segment representing different styles and taste levels at different
price points.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Introduced in 1927, Naturalizer
is one of the nation's leading women's footwear brands and is the Company's
flagship brand. Naturalizer products emphasize style, quality, value, comfort
and fit with classic, relevant and up-to-date styling. This brand is sold
in department stores, independent shoe stores and in the Company's Naturalizer
retail stores.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LifeStride is a leading entry-level
price point, women's brand in department stores offering contemporary styling.

<p><b><u>ITEM 1 - BUSINESS</u> (Continued)</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Buster Brown brand of
children's footwear includes Buster Brown "classic" footwear offered to
department stores and independent retailers including The May Company and
Famous Footwear. The Company is capitalizing on the strength and recognition
of the Buster Brown brand by marketing licensed and branded children's
footwear under the Buster Brown &amp; Co. umbrella. These products are
sold to mass merchandisers including Wal-Mart, Payless ShoeSource and Target.
Licensed products include Barbie, Mary-Kate and Ashley, Spider-Man, Bob
the Builder and Dragon Tales. The Buster Brown &amp; Co. umbrella provides
customers with the comfort and assurance that these licensed products contain
the quality that they are accustomed to receiving from Buster Brown shoes.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to the above
mentioned children's licenses, the Company has a long-term license agreement,
which is renewable through 2014, to market the Dr. Scholl's brand of affordable
casual and work shoes for women and men both in the United States and Canada.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2001, the Company's Wholesale
division launched a collection of women's shoes - Carlos by Carlos Santana
- to major department stores. This footwear is being marketed under a license
agreement with famous guitarist Carlos Santana.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company continually seeks
and evaluates new license opportunities and has the license to sell Star
Wars footwear for the next movie, scheduled for release in fiscal 2002.
The Company also recently has entered into a license agreement for the
HOT KISS label for junior footwear to complement the apparel line with
the same name.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Products sold under license
agreements, which are generally for an initial term of two or three years
and subject to renewal, were responsible for approximately 5%, 6% and 8%
of consolidated sales in fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company continues to
build on and take advantage of the heritage and consumer recognition of
its traditional brands. Marketing teams are responsible for the development
and implementation of marketing programs for each brand, both for the Company
and its retail customers. In fiscal 2001, the division invested approximately
$18 million in advertising and marketing support primarily for its Naturalizer
and LifeStride brands. The Company continually focuses on enhancing the
effectiveness of these marketing efforts through market research, product
development and marketing communications.

<p><b><u>ITEM 1 - BUSINESS</u> (Continued)</b>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At April 6, 2002,
the Company's wholesale operations had a backlog of unfilled orders of
approximately $142 million compared to $150 million on April 7, 2001. Within
these totals, the unfilled order position for Naturalizer product is up
approximately 11% while orders from the Company's mass merchandiser customers
are lower. Most orders are for delivery within the next 90-120 days, and
although orders are subject to cancellation, the Company has not experienced
significant cancellations in the past. The backlog at a particular time
is affected by a number of factors, including seasonality, the continuing
trend among customers to reduce the lead time on their orders and the timing
of licensed product releases such as movies or sporting events. Accordingly,
a comparison of backlog from period to period is not necessarily meaningful
and may not be indicative of eventual actual shipments.
<p><i>Brown Shoe International</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Brown Shoe International
division sources substantially all of the footwear globally for the Company's
Wholesale division and the Naturalizer Retail division, and a portion of
the footwear sold by Famous Footwear. The division, which in 2001 sourced
66.8 million pairs of shoes, has developed a global sourcing capability
through its relationships with approximately 100 third-party independent
footwear manufacturers. Management attributes its ability to achieve consistent
quality, competitive prices and on-time delivery to the breadth of its
established relationships.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company currently maintains
sourcing offices in Hong Kong, China, Brazil, Indonesia, Italy, Taiwan
and Mexico. This structure enables the Company to source footwear at various
price levels from significant shoe manufacturing regions of the world.
In 2001, more than three-fourths of the footwear sourced by Brown Shoe
was from manufacturing facilities in China. The Company has the ability
to shift sourcing to alternative countries, over time, based upon trade
conditions, economic advantages, production capabilities and other factors,
if conditions warrant. The following table provides an overview of the
Company's foreign sourcing in 2001:

<p><b><u>ITEM 1 - BUSINESS</u> (Continued)</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company monitors the
quality of the components of its footwear products prior to production
and inspects prototypes of each footwear product before production runs
are commenced. The Company also performs random in-line quality control
checks during production and before footwear leaves the manufacturing facility.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company maintains separate
design teams for each of its brands which are responsible for the creation
and development of new product styles. The Company's designers monitor
trends in apparel and footwear fashion and work closely with retailers
to identify consumer footwear preferences. From a design center in Florence,
Italy, the Company captures European influences like heel shapes and fabrics
before appearing at retail. The design center is electronically linked
to the Company's line builders in the United States who blend them with
the latest U.S. fashion trends. When a new style is created, the Company's
designers work closely with independent footwear manufacturers to translate
their designs into new footwear styles.
<p><u>Risk Factors</u>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Certain statements herein
and in the documents incorporated herein by reference as well as statements
made by the Company from time to time contain forward-looking statements
within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
Actual results could differ materially. The considerations listed below
represent certain important factors the Company believes could cause such
results to differ. These considerations are not intended to represent a
complete list of the general or specific risks that may affect the Company.
It should be recognized that other risks (including those discussed in
the Management's Discussion and Analysis section of the Annual Report to
Shareholders) may be significant, presently or in the future, and the risks
set forth below may affect the Company to a greater extent than indicated.
<p><i>Competition and Changes in Consumer Preferences</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Competition is intense in
the footwear industry. Certain of the Company's competitors are larger
and have substantially greater resources than the Company. The Company's
success depends upon its ability to remain competitive in the areas of
style, price and quality, among others, and in part on its ability to anticipate
and respond to changing merchandise and fashion trends and consumer preferences
and demands in a timely manner.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, consumer preferences
and purchasing patterns may be influenced by consumers' disposable income.
Consequently, the success of the Company's operations may depend to a significant
extent upon a number of factors affecting disposable income, including
general economic conditions and factors such as employment, business conditions,
consumer confidence, interest rates and taxation.
<center>

<hr ALIGN=RIGHT SIZE=3 NOSHADE WIDTH="100%">
<p><b><u>ITEM 1 - BUSINESS</u> (Continued)</b>
<p><i>Reliance on Foreign Sources of Production</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company relies entirely
on broad-based foreign sourcing for its footwear products. The Company
sources footwear products from independent third-party manufacturing facilities
located in China and Brazil, and to a lesser extent from Indonesia, Italy,
Mexico, Taiwan and two Company-owned manufacturing facilities in Canada.
Typically, the Company is a major customer of these third-party manufacturing
facilities. The Company believes its relationships with such third-party
manufacturing facilities provide it with a competitive advantage; thus
the Company's future results will partly depend on maintaining its close
working relationships with its principal manufacturers.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company relies heavily
on independent third-party manufacturing facilities, primarily located
in China. Historically, the trade relationship between the United States
and China has not had a material adverse effect on the Company's business,
financial condition or results of operations. There have been, however,
and may in the future be, threats to the trade relationships between the
United States and China, including past and future threats by the United
States to limit trade relations with China. There can be no assurance the
trade relationship between the United States and China will not worsen,
and if it does worsen, there can be no assurance the Company's business,
financial condition or results of operations will not be materially adversely
affected thereby. Further, the Company cannot predict the effect that changes
in the economic and political conditions in China could have on the economics
of doing business with Chinese manufacturers. Although the Company believes
it could find alternative manufacturing sources for those products it currently
sources from China through its existing relationships with independent
third-party manufacturing facilities in other countries, the loss of a
substantial portion of its Chinese manufacturing capacity would have a
material adverse effect on the Company.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As is common in the industry,
the Company does not have any long-term contracts with its independent
third-party foreign manufacturers. There can be no assurance the Company
will not experience difficulties with such manufacturers, including reduction
in the availability of production capacity, failure to meet production
deadlines, or increases in manufacturing costs. Foreign manufacturing is
subject to a number of risks, including work stoppages, transportation
delays and interruptions, political instability, expropriation, nationalization,
foreign currency fluctuations, changing economic conditions, the imposition
of tariffs, import and export controls and other non-tariff barriers and
changes in governmental policies.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, the Company's products
depend on the availability of leather. Any significant shortage of quantities
or increases in leather costs could have a material adverse effect on the
Company's business and results of operations.
<center>
<p>11</center>

<hr ALIGN=RIGHT SIZE=3 NOSHADE WIDTH="100%">
<p><b><u>ITEM 1 - BUSINESS</u> (Continued)</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the Company purchases
products from certain foreign manufacturers in United States dollars and
otherwise engages in foreign currency hedging transactions, there can be
no assurance the Company will not experience foreign currency losses. The
Company cannot predict whether additional United States or foreign customs
quotas, duties, taxes or other changes or restrictions will be imposed
upon the importation of non-domestically produced products in the future
or what effect such actions could have on its business, financial condition
or results of operations.
<p><i>Customer Concentration</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The customers of the Company's
wholesaling business include department stores and mass merchandisers.
Several of the Company's customers control more than one department store
and/or mass merchandiser chain. While the Company believes purchasing decisions
in many cases are made independently by each department store or mass merchandiser
chain under such common ownership, a decision by the controlling owner
of a group of department stores and/or mass merchandisers, or any other
significant customer, to decrease the amount of footwear products purchased
from the Company could have a material adverse effect on the Company's
business, financial condition or results of operations.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, the retail industry
has periodically experienced consolidation and other ownership changes,
and in the future the Company's wholesale customers may consolidate, restructure,
reorganize or realign, any of which could decrease the number of stores
that carry the Company's products.
<p><i>Intellectual Property Risks</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The success of the Company's
Wholesale division has to date been due, in part, to the Company's ability
to attract licensors which have strong, well-recognized characters and
trademarks. The Company's license agreements are generally for an initial
term of two to three years, subject to renewal, but even where the Company
has longer term licenses or has an option to renew a license, such license
is dependent upon the Company's achieving certain results in marketing
the licensed material. While the Company believes its relationships with
its existing licensors are good and it believes it will be able to renew
its existing licenses and obtain new licenses in the future, there can
be no assurance the Company will be able to renew its current licenses
or obtain new licenses to replace lost licenses. In addition, certain of
the Company's license agreements are not exclusive and new or existing
competitors may obtain similar licenses.
<center>
<p>12</center>

<hr ALIGN=RIGHT SIZE=3 NOSHADE WIDTH="100%">
<p><b><u>ITEM 1 - BUSINESS</u> (Continued)</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company believes that
its trademarks and tradenames are important to its business and are generally
sufficient to permit it to carry on its business as presently conducted
and planned. The Company cannot, however, know whether it will be able
to secure protection for its intellectual property in the future or if
that protection will be adequate for future operations. Further, the Company
faces the risk of ineffective protection of intellectual property rights
in jurisdictions where it sources and distributes its products. The Company
also cannot be certain that its activities do not infringe on the proprietary
rights of others. If the Company is compelled to prosecute infringing parties,
defend its intellectual property, or defend itself from intellectual property
claims made by others, it may face significant expenses and liability.
<p><i>Dependence on Major Branded Suppliers</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company's Famous Footwear
retail business purchases a substantial portion of its footwear products
from major branded suppliers. While the Company believes its relationship
with its existing suppliers is good, the loss of any of its major suppliers
could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial
condition or results of operations. As is common in the industry, the Company
does not have any long-term contracts with its suppliers. In addition,
the success of the Company's financial performance is dependent on the
ability of Famous Footwear to obtain product from its suppliers on a timely
basis and on acceptable terms.
<p><i>Project IMPACT</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2001, the Company announced
it launched a set of initiatives under the name IMPACT (Improved Performance
and Competitive Transformation). Such initiatives are intended to transform
the Company over time and to improve its earnings. The IMPACT initiatives
eventually will touch every part of the Company. IMPACT initially focused
on the implementation of new merchandising initiatives at Famous Footwear;
the closing of 97 underperforming Naturalizer Retail stores; and the elimination
of redundant infrastructure by developing a Shared Services operating model,
which will allow the Company to improve the efficiency of its information
systems, human resources and finance functions. In connection with these
initiatives, the Company took an after-tax, nonrecurring charge of approximately
$32 million ($1.84 per share) in the fourth quarter of 2001. The Company
announced that it anticipates the after-tax savings, resulting from IMPACT,
will grow from approximately $13 million in 2003 to $22 million in 2005,
or from $0.70 to $1.20 per share.
<center>
<p>13</center>

<hr ALIGN=RIGHT SIZE=3 NOSHADE WIDTH="100%">
<p><b><u>ITEM 1 - BUSINESS</u> (Continued)</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company's successful
implementation of the IMPACT initiatives is subject to a number of risks,
including the retention of certain key personnel through critical phases
of the projects, the ability of the merchandise teams to utilize the new
merchandising and inventory systems, and higher than anticipated costs
associated with the closing of the Naturalizer Retail stores. Whenever
an organization undergoes a transformation, such as moving to a Shared
Services platform, there is a risk of interruption or decrease in service
levels. If the Company experiences difficulties with the implementation
of the IMPACT initiatives, the actual savings resulting from such initiatives
may be materially lower than anticipated.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><u>ITEM 2 - PROPERTIES</u></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company owns its principal
executive, sales and administrative offices in Clayton (St. Louis), Missouri.
The Famous Footwear division operates from a leased office building in
Madison, Wisconsin. The Canadian wholesale division operates from an owned
office building in Perth, Ontario, and the retail division from leased
office space in Laval, Quebec.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of the Company's wholesale
footwear is processed through two company-owned distribution centers in
Sikeston, Missouri and Fredericktown, Missouri, with 720,000 and 465,000
square feet, respectively. The Company also owns and operates two manufacturing
facilities and a 150,000 square-foot distribution facility in Ontario,
Canada. A leased sales office and showroom is maintained in New York City.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company's retail footwear
operations are conducted throughout the United States and Canada and involve
the operation of 1,376 shoe stores, including 160 in Canada. All store
locations are leased, with approximately half having renewal options. Famous
Footwear operates a leased 750,000 square foot distribution center, including
a mezzanine level, in Sun Prairie, Wisconsin, and a leased 800,000 square
foot distribution center, including mezzanine levels, in Lebanon, Tennessee.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><u>ITEM 3 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</u></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company is involved in
legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business.
In the opinion of management, after consulting with legal counsel, the
outcome of such proceedings and litigation currently pending will not have
a materially adverse effect on the Company's results of operations or financial
position.
<center>
<p>14</center>

<hr ALIGN=RIGHT SIZE=3 NOSHADE WIDTH="100%">
<p><b><u>ITEM 3 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</u> (Continued)</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company is involved in
environmental remediation and ongoing compliance activities at several
sites. The Company is remediating a residential area adjacent to owned
property in Colorado, under the oversight of Colorado authorities. This
residential area has been affected by types of solvents previously used
at the facility. The Company is also remediating the owned property. In
fiscal 2000, a class-action lawsuit was filed in Colorado state court against
the Company related to this site. In December 2001, the court denied the
plaintiffs' motion for class certification and ordered the individual plaintiffs
to proceed with the case. The plaintiffs have asked the court to reconsider
its ruling. The Company does not believe the ultimate outcome of this lawsuit
will have a materially adverse effect on its results of operations or financial
condition. During fiscal 2001 and 2000, the Company incurred charges of
$1.4 million and $3.0 million, respectively, related to this site.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company has completed
its remediation efforts at its closed New York tannery and two associated
landfills. In 1995, state environmental authorities reclassified the status
of these sites as being properly closed and requiring only continued maintenance
and monitoring over the next 22 years.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, various federal
and state authorities have identified the Company as a potentially responsible
party for remediation at certain landfills from the sale or disposal of
solvents and other by-products from the closed tannery and shoe manufacturing
facilities.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on information currently
available, the Company had an accrued liability of $4.1 million, as of
February 2, 2002, to complete the clean up at all sites. The ultimate cost
may vary.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the Company currently
does not operate domestic manufacturing facilities, prior operations included
numerous manufacturing and other facilities for which the Company may have
responsibility under various environmental laws for the remediation of
conditions that may be identified in the future.
