<p><b><u>PART I</u></b></center>

<p><b><u>ITEM 1 - BUSINESS</u></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company, founded in 1878
and incorporated in 1913, operates in the footwear industry. In 1999, the
Company changed its name from Brown Group, Inc., to Brown Shoe Company,
Inc. Current activities include the operation of retail shoe stores and
the sourcing and marketing of footwear for women, men and children. The
Company's business is seasonal in nature due to consumer spending patterns,
with higher back-to-school, Easter and Christmas holiday season sales.
Traditionally, the third fiscal quarter accounts for a substantial portion
of the Company's earnings for the year.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During 2002, categories of
footwear sales were approximately 59% women's, 27% men's and 14% children's.
This composition has remained relatively constant over the past few years.
Approximately 69% of 2002 footwear sales were made at retail compared to
71% in 2001 and 73% in 2000. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements on page 40 of the Annual Report to Shareholders for the year
ended February 1, 2003, which is incorporated herein by reference, for
additional information regarding the Company's business segments.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2001, the Company launched
a set of initiatives to improve the performance of the Company. These initiatives
included the closing of 97 under-performing domestic Naturalizer Retail
stores, optimizing the investment in inventory at the Famous Footwear division,
installing a new management team at Famous Footwear, and consolidating
the Company's divisional information systems, finance and human resources
functions into a Shared Services platform. In the fourth quarter of 2001,
a charge was taken to implement these initiatives along with the costs
associated with other nonrecurring events, including the costs of calling
and restructuring certain of its debt. In fiscal 2002, the Company substantially
completed each of these initiatives. In the case of closing Naturalizer
stores, the number of stores closing under this program was increased to
106, and the total closing costs were less than originally anticipated.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company has approximately
12,000 full-time and part-time employees. Approximately 120 employees engaged
in the warehousing of footwear in the United States are employed under
a union contract, which will expire in September 2005. In Canada, the Company
employs approximately 275 factory and warehouse employees under a union
contract, which expires in October 2003.
<p><b><u>Retail Operations</u></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company's retail operations
at February 1, 2003 included 1,307 retail shoe stores in the United States
and Canada, operating primarily under the Famous Footwear, Naturalizer
and F.X. LaSalle names.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A summary of retail footwear
stores operated by the Company at the end of each of the last three fiscal
years is as follows:

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With many organizations operating
retail shoe stores and departments, the Company competes in a highly fragmented
market. Competitors include local, regional and national shoe store chains,
department stores, discount stores and numerous independent retail operators
of various sizes. Quality, customer service, store location, merchandise
selection, advertising and pricing are important components of retail competition.
<p><i>Famous Footwear</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Famous Footwear, with 918
stores at the end of fiscal 2002, is America's largest chain selling branded
value-priced footwear for the entire family. Famous Footwear was purchased
by the Company in 1981 as a 32-store chain, and now also operates under
such names as Factory Brand Shoes, Warehouse Shoes and Supermarket of Shoes.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Famous Footwear stores feature
a wide selection of brand-name, value-priced athletic, casual and dress
shoes for the entire family. Brands carried include, among others, Skechers,
Nike, New Balance, Reebok, adidas, Naturalizer, Aerosoles, K-Swiss, Connie,
Rockport, Vans, LifeStride and Buster Brown.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Famous Footwear stores are
located in strip and power strip shopping centers as well as outlet malls

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The stores open at the end
of fiscal 2002 averaged approximately 6,700 square feet compared to an
average of 6,500 square feet for stores open at the end of fiscal 2001.
Total square footage was 6.2 million at the end of fiscal 2002 compared
to 5.9 million at the end of fiscal 2001. The increase in total square
footage, and in the average store size, reflects the Company's initiative
to reposition a portion of Famous Footwear's real estate portfolio by moving
from 5,000 - 6,000 square foot stores to 8,000-10,000 square foot stores
in high traffic, power strip shopping centers. The Company believes the
larger store format in power strip shopping centers have the potential
to become highly productive, as this venue provides the best opportunity
to showcase and display the wide variety of brands available at Famous
Footwear. At the end of fiscal 2002, the chain had 175 of these larger
stores open. Plans are to open an approximately 55 stores in fiscal 2003,
while closing approximately 85 stores.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sales per square foot were
$177 in fiscal 2002, which is down 3.3% from $183 in fiscal 2001. This
decrease reflects the same-store sales decline of 1.3% in fiscal 2002 and
lower productivity per square foot in the new stores opened.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Famous Footwear relies on
allocation systems and processes to optimize store level merchandise mix
through a combination of allocation criteria, store specific customer profiles
and inventory need algorithms. The Company's in-store point-of-sale systems
provide detailed sales transaction data to the main office in Madison,
Wisconsin for daily analysis and update of the perpetual inventory and
product allocation systems. These systems also are used for training employees
and communications between the stores and the main office.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fiscal 2001, the Company
embarked upon an initiative entitled IMPACT (Improved Performance and Competitive
Transformation), which focused on reengineering the Famous Footwear buying,
merchandising and allocation functions. New processes were instituted,
and new talent was recruited to embrace a new way of delivering the freshest,
most popular brands and styles to customers. This process starts with increased
testing to identify emerging styles. As a result of this greater testing
and knowledge, orders are being placed closer to the selling season and
product is flowed through distribution centers and stores in smaller quantities
and in more frequent intervals. The goal of this initiative is to have
the right shoes for our customers, significantly increase inventory turns,
and achieve a reduction in base inventories. In order to accelerate the
implementation of this initiative and achieve greater "freshness and velocity"
in its inventory, a pretax charge of $16 million was recorded in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2001 to allow deep price reductions in clearing prior
season merchandise.

<hr ALIGN=RIGHT SIZE=3 NOSHADE WIDTH="100%">
<p><b><u>ITEM 1 - BUSINESS</u> (Continued)</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fiscal 2002, the objectives
of this initiative were achieved. The prior season merchandise was almost
completely liquidated, the aging of the inventory was significantly improved
compared to the end of fiscal 2001, inventory turns were improved, and
customers purchased more current season merchandise, which led to higher
gross profit rates. Reductions in the base level of inventories have been
achieved. At the end of fiscal 2002, inventories per square foot of retail
space have been reduced 21% over the past 24 months.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With two distribution centers,
located in Sun Prairie, Wisconsin and Lebanon, Tennessee, Famous Footwear's
distribution systems allow for merchandise to be delivered to each store
weekly.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Famous Footwear's marketing
program includes newspaper, radio and television advertising, in-store
signage and database marketing, all of which are designed to further develop
and reinforce the Famous Footwear concept with the consumer. Marketing
and advertising programs are tailored on a region-by-region basis to reach
target customers. The Company utilizes a database marketing program, which
targets and rewards frequent customers. In addition, the timing of certain
advertising campaigns corresponds to regional differences such as the important
back-to-school season, which begins at various times throughout the country.
In fiscal 2002, management spent approximately $33 million to communicate
Famous Footwear's philosophy: delivering to the customer the best value
on quality, branded footwear.
<p><i>Naturalizer</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company's Naturalizer
stores are showcases for the Company's flagship brand of women's shoes.
These stores are designed and merchandised to appeal to the Naturalizer
customer who is style- and comfort-conscious and who seeks quality and
value in her footwear selections. In addition, the Company has repositioned
its styles to focus on a younger, more active woman. The Naturalizer stores
offer a selection of women's footwear styles, including dress, casual,
boots and sandals, primarily under the Naturalizer brand. The Naturalizer
brand is one of North America's leading women's footwear brands, providing
stylish, comfortable and quality footwear in a variety of patterns and
sizes. Retail price points are typically between $50 and $60 per pair.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company operates 217
Naturalizer stores in the United States and 156 stores in Canada. Of the
total 373 stores, 308 are located in regional malls and average approximately
1,200 square feet in size, and 65 are located in outlet malls and average
approximately 2,600 square feet in size. Total square footage at the end
of fiscal 2002 was 548,000 compared to 642,000 in fiscal 2001. Sales per
square foot were $301 in fiscal 2002 compared to $288 in fiscal 2001.

<p><b><u>ITEM 1 - BUSINESS</u> (Continued)</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fiscal 2002, the Company
opened 22 stores and closed 89. The large number of closures was part of
the initiative announced near the end of fiscal 2001 to close 97 under-performing
stores in the United States. This was subsequently increased to 106 stores.
Twenty-four stores under this program were closed in the latter part of
fiscal 2001. These closings are expected to significantly improve this
division's operating performance in fiscal 2003. The Company is planning
to open approximately five new stores and close approximately ten stores
in 2003.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marketing programs for the
Naturalizer stores have complemented the Company's Naturalizer brand advertising,
building on the brand's consumer recognition and reinforcing the brand's
added focus on style, comfort and quality. The Company utilizes a database
marketing program, which targets and rewards frequent customers primarily
through catalogs, which are mailed four times per year and which display
the brand's current product. Customers can purchase the product in these
catalogs from the Company's stores, via the Naturalizer.com website or
by telephone to the Company's Consumer Services call center.
<p><i>F.X. LaSalle</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company operates 16 F.X.
LaSalle retail stores, primarily in the Montreal, Canada market that sell
better-grade men's and women's branded and private label footwear. This
footwear, primarily imported from Italy, retails at price points ranging
from $100 to $250. These stores average approximately 2,100 square feet.
Sales per square foot were $345 in fiscal 2002 and $353 in fiscal 2001.
<p><i>E-Commerce</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In late 2000, the Company
purchased a majority interest in Shoes.com, Inc., an e-tailing company.
Using the Company's distribution network and information systems infrastructure,
the Shoes.com site was relaunched as a multi-brand footwear site in Spring
2001. In addition, a FamousFootwear.com site was launched at the same time
and operates as a Famous Footwear e-tailing store. These sites offer footwear
and accessories to men, women and children that include Company branded
and licensed footwear as well as footwear purchased from outside suppliers
and certain merchandise that is sold in Famous Footwear stores.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company also operates
Naturalizer.com, which offers substantially the same product selection
to consumers as the Company's domestic Naturalizer retail stores. This
site functions as a retail outlet for the online consumer and serves as
another brand building vehicle for Naturalizer.

<p><u>Wholesale Operations</u>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company's Wholesale operations
design and market branded, licensed and private label dress, casual and
athletic footwear for women, men and children at a variety of price points
to approximately 2,000 retailers, including department stores, mass merchandisers,
national chains and independent retailers throughout the United States
and Canada. The division is a resource for many of the nation's largest
retailers, including Wal-Mart, Payless ShoeSource, The May Company, Federated,
Dillard's, Nordstrom, Sak's, Target, Sears and Famous Footwear, as well
as The Bay, Sears and Wal-Mart in Canada. The vast majority of the division's
customers also sell shoes bought from competing footwear suppliers.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fiscal 2002, the division
provided its customers with approximately 78 million pairs of shoes. Substantially
all of this footwear was imported through the Company's Sourcing division,
except for those pairs produced at the company-owned manufacturing facility
in Canada.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wholesale orders for shoes
are solicited by the Company's sales force, who is generally responsible
for managing the Company's relationships with its wholesale customers.
Orders placed as a result of these sales efforts are generally taken before
the shoes are sourced with delivery generally within three to four months
thereafter. Footwear is sold to wholesale customers on both a first-cost
and landed basis. First-cost sales are those in which the Company obtains
title to footwear from its overseas suppliers and typically relinquishes
title to customers at a designated overseas port. Landed sales are those
in which the Company obtains title to the footwear from its overseas suppliers
and maintains title until the footwear is inside the United States borders.
Certain high-volume styles, particularly in the Naturalizer and LifeStride
lines, are inventoried to allow prompt shipment on reorders.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to orders placed
through the Company's sales force, the Wholesale division provides its
retail customers the ability to directly check inventory of all wholesale
product in Brown Shoe's distribution centers, place orders, and track expected
product arrivals over its business-to-business Internet site, BrownShoeOnline.com.
Approximately 900 retailers utilize this e-commerce tool. In addition,
the Company provides these retailers with its "E-direct" system that allows
them to sell out-of-stock product, with the Company then shipping the product
directly to the consumer's home.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Major brand names owned by
the Company include Naturalizer, LifeStride, Buster Brown, Connie, Fanfare
and Brown Shoe. Each of the Company's brands is targeted to a specific
customer segment representing different styles and taste levels at different
price points.

<p><b><u>ITEM 1 - BUSINESS</u> (Continued)</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Introduced in 1927, Naturalizer
is one of the nation's leading women's footwear brands and is the Company's
flagship brand. Naturalizer products emphasize relevant and up-to-date
styling with quality, value, comfort and fit. This brand is sold in department
stores, independent shoe stores and in the Company's Famous Footwear and
Naturalizer retail stores.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LifeStride is a leading entry-level
price point, women's brand in department stores offering contemporary styling.
This brand is focused on providing the consumer with "stylized casual"
footwear at price points of $30 - $50.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Buster Brown brand of
children's footwear includes Buster Brown "classic" footwear offered to
department stores and independent retailers including The May Company and
Famous Footwear. The Company is capitalizing on the strength and recognition
of the Buster Brown brand by marketing licensed and branded children's
footwear under the Buster Brown &amp; Co. umbrella. These products are
sold to mass merchandisers including Wal-Mart, Payless ShoeSource and Target.
Licensed products include Barbie, Mary-Kate and Ashley, Spider-Man and
Bob the Builder. The Buster Brown &amp; Co. umbrella provides customers
with the assurance that these licensed products contain the quality that
they are accustomed to receiving from Buster Brown shoes.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to the above
mentioned children's licenses, the Company has a long-term license agreement,
which is renewable through 2014, to market the Dr. Scholl's brand of affordable
casual and work shoes for women and men both in the United States and Canada.
This footwear is primarily distributed through mass merchandisers. The
Company also sells the Original Dr. Scholl's Exercise Sandal and a related
line of footwear under this license to department stores, national chains
and independent retailers. In Spring 2003, this product will be distributed
in approximately 2,400 doors.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2001, the Company's Wholesale
division launched a collection of women's shoes - Carlos by Carlos Santana
- to major department stores. This footwear is being marketed under a license
agreement with guitarist Carlos Santana, and represents the Company's most
fashion forward line. It is distributed in approximately 400 department
store doors.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company also has a license
agreement for the HOT KISS label for junior footwear to complement the
apparel line with the same name. This line is in several major department
stores and Famous Footwear.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Products sold under license
agreements, which are generally for an initial term of two or three years
and subject to renewal, were responsible for approximately 9%, 8% and 6%
of consolidated sales in fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

<hr ALIGN=RIGHT SIZE=3 NOSHADE WIDTH="100%">
<p><b><u>ITEM 1 - BUSINESS</u> (Continued)</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company continues to
build on and take advantage of the heritage and consumer recognition of
its traditional brands. Marketing teams are responsible for the development
and implementation of marketing programs for each brand, both for the Company
and its retail customers. In fiscal 2002, the division spent approximately
$19 million in advertising and marketing support primarily for its Naturalizer
and LifeStride brands. The Company continually focuses on enhancing the
effectiveness of these marketing efforts through market research, product
development and marketing communications.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At April 5, 2003, the Company's
wholesale operations had a backlog of unfilled orders of approximately
$151 million compared to $142 million on April 6, 2002. Most orders are
for delivery within the next 90-120 days, and although orders are subject
to cancellation, the Company has not experienced significant cancellations
in the past. The backlog at a particular time is affected by a number of
factors, including seasonality, the continuing trend among customers to
reduce the lead time on their orders and, in some cases, the timing of
licensed product movie releases. Accordingly, a comparison of backlog from
period to period is not necessarily meaningful and may not be indicative
of eventual actual shipments.
<p><i>Brown Shoe Sourcing</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Brown Shoe Sourcing division
sources substantially all of the footwear globally for the Company's Wholesale
division and the Naturalizer Retail division, and a portion of the footwear
sold by Famous Footwear. The division, which in 2002 sourced 77.2 million
pairs of shoes, has developed a global sourcing capability through its
relationships with approximately 80 third-party independent footwear manufacturers.
Management attributes its ability to achieve consistent quality, competitive
prices and on-time delivery to the breadth of its established relationships.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company currently maintains
sourcing offices in Hong Kong, China, Brazil, Indonesia, Italy, Taiwan
and Mexico. This structure enables the Company to source footwear at various
price levels from significant shoe manufacturing regions of the world.
In 2002, more than 80% of the footwear sourced by Brown Shoe was from manufacturing
facilities in China. The Company has the ability to shift sourcing to alternative
countries, over time, based upon trade conditions, economic advantages,
production capabilities and other factors, if conditions warrant. The following
table provides an overview of the Company's foreign sourcing in 2002:

<p><b><u>ITEM 1 - BUSINESS (Continued)</u></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company monitors the
quality of the components of its footwear products prior to production
and inspects prototypes of each footwear product before production runs
are commenced. The Company also performs random in-line quality control
checks during production and before footwear leaves the manufacturing facility.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company maintains separate
design teams for each of its brands which are responsible for the creation
and development of new product styles. The Company's designers monitor
trends in apparel and footwear fashion and work closely with retailers
to identify consumer footwear preferences. From a design center in Florence,
Italy, the Company captures European influences like heel shapes and fabrics
before appearing at retail. The design center is electronically linked
to the Company's line builders in the United States who blend them with
the latest U.S. fashion trends. When a new style is created, the Company's
designers work closely with independent footwear manufacturers to translate
their designs into new footwear styles.
<p><u>Risk Factors</u>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Certain statements herein
and in the documents incorporated herein by reference as well as statements
made by the Company from time to time contain forward-looking statements
within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
Actual results could differ materially. The considerations listed below
represent certain important factors the Company believes could cause such
results to differ. These considerations are not intended to represent a
complete list of the general or specific risks that may affect the Company.
It should be recognized that other risks (including those discussed in
the Management's Discussion and Analysis section of the Annual Report to
Shareholders) may be significant, presently or in the future, and the risks
set forth below may affect the Company to a greater extent than indicated.
The Company disclaims any intent or obligation to update these forward-looking
statements.
<p><i>Competition and Changes in Consumer Preferences</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Competition is intense in
the footwear industry. Certain of the Company's competitors are larger
and have substantially greater resources than the Company. The Company's
success depends upon its ability to remain competitive in the areas of
style, price and quality, among others, and in part on its ability to anticipate
and respond to changing merchandise and fashion trends and consumer preferences
and demands in a timely manner.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, consumer preferences
and purchasing patterns may be influenced by consumers' disposable income.
Consequently, the success of the Company's operations may depend to a significant
extent upon a number of factors affecting disposable income, including
general economic conditions and factors such as employment, business conditions,
consumer confidence, interest rates and taxation.

<hr ALIGN=RIGHT SIZE=3 NOSHADE WIDTH="100%">
<p><b><u>ITEM 1 - BUSINESS</u> (Continued)</b>
<p><i>Reliance on Foreign Sources of Production</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company relies entirely
on broad-based foreign sourcing for its footwear products. The Company
sources footwear products from independent third-party manufacturing facilities
located in China and Brazil, and to a lesser extent from Indonesia, Italy,
Mexico, Taiwan and one Company-owned manufacturing facility in Canada.
Typically, the Company is a major customer of these third-party manufacturing
facilities. The Company believes its relationships with such third-party
manufacturing facilities provide it with a competitive advantage; thus
the Company's future results will partly depend on maintaining its close
working relationships with its principal manufacturers.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company relies heavily
on independent third-party manufacturing facilities, primarily located
in China. Historically, the trade relationship between the United States
and China has not had a material adverse effect on the Company's business,
financial condition or results of operations. There have been, however,
and may in the future be, threats to the trade relationships between the
United States and China, including past and future threats by the United
States to limit trade relations with China. There can be no assurance the
trade relationship between the United States and China will not worsen,
and if it does worsen, there can be no assurance the Company's business,
financial condition or results of operations will not be materially adversely
affected thereby. Further, the Company cannot predict the effect that changes
in the economic and political conditions in China could have on the economics
of doing business with Chinese manufacturers. Although the Company believes
it could find alternative manufacturing sources for those products it currently
sources from China through its existing relationships with independent
third-party manufacturing facilities in other countries, the loss of a
substantial portion of its Chinese manufacturing capacity would have a
material adverse effect on the Company.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As is common in the industry,
the Company does not have any long-term contracts with its independent
third-party foreign manufacturers. There can be no assurance the Company
will not experience difficulties with such manufacturers, including reduction
in the availability of production capacity, failure to meet production
deadlines, or increases in manufacturing costs. Foreign manufacturing is
subject to a number of risks, including work stoppages, transportation
delays and interruptions, political instability, expropriation, nationalization,
foreign currency fluctuations, changing economic conditions, the imposition
of tariffs, import and export controls and other non-tariff barriers and
changes in governmental policies.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, the Company's products
depend on the availability of leather. Any significant shortage of quantities
or increases in leather costs could have a material adverse effect on the
Company's business and results of operations.
<br>&nbsp;

<hr ALIGN=RIGHT SIZE=3 NOSHADE WIDTH="100%">
<p><b><u>ITEM 1 - BUSINESS</u> (Continued)</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the Company purchases
products from certain foreign manufacturers in United States dollars and
otherwise engages in foreign currency hedging transactions, there can be
no assurance the Company will not experience cost variations with respect
to exchange rate changes. The Company cannot predict whether additional
United States or foreign customs quotas, duties, taxes or other changes
or restrictions will be imposed upon the importation of non-domestically
produced products in the future or what effect such actions could have
on its business, financial condition or results of operations.
<p><i>Customer Concentration</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The customers of the Company's
wholesaling business include department stores and mass merchandisers.
Several of the Company's customers control more than one department store
and/or mass merchandiser chain. While the Company believes purchasing decisions
in many cases are made independently by each department store or mass merchandiser
chain under such common ownership, a decision by the controlling owner
of a group of department stores and/or mass merchandisers, or any other
significant customer, to decrease the amount of footwear products purchased
from the Company could have a material adverse effect on the Company's
business, financial condition or results of operations.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, the retail industry
has periodically experienced consolidation and other ownership changes,
and in the future the Company's wholesale customers may consolidate, restructure,
reorganize or realign, any of which could decrease the number of stores
that carry the Company's products.
<p><i>Intellectual Property Risks</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The success of the Company's
Wholesale division has to date been due, in part, to the Company's ability
to attract licensors which have strong, well-recognized characters and
trademarks. The Company's license agreements are generally for an initial
term of two to three years, subject to renewal, but even where the Company
has longer term licenses or has an option to renew a license, such license
is dependent upon the Company's achieving certain results in marketing
the licensed material. While the Company believes its relationships with
its existing licensors are good and it believes it will be able to renew
its existing licenses and obtain new licenses in the future, there can
be no assurance the Company will be able to renew its current licenses
or obtain new licenses to replace lost licenses. In addition, certain of
the Company's license agreements are not exclusive and new or existing
competitors may obtain similar licenses.

<hr ALIGN=RIGHT SIZE=3 NOSHADE WIDTH="100%">
<p><b><u>ITEM 1 - BUSINESS</u> (Continued)</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company believes that
its trademarks and tradenames are important to its business and are generally
sufficient to permit it to carry on its business as presently conducted
and planned. The Company cannot, however, know whether it will be able
to secure protection for its intellectual property in the future or if
that protection will be adequate for future operations. Further, the Company
faces the risk of ineffective protection of intellectual property rights
in jurisdictions where it sources and distributes its products. The Company
also cannot be certain that its activities do not infringe on the proprietary
rights of others. If the Company is compelled to prosecute infringing parties,
defend its intellectual property, or defend itself from intellectual property
claims made by others, it may face significant expenses and liability.
<p><i>Dependence on Major Branded Suppliers</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company's Famous Footwear
retail business purchases a substantial portion of its footwear products
from major branded suppliers. While the Company believes its relationship
with its existing suppliers is good, the loss of any of its major suppliers
could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial
condition or results of operations. As is common in the industry, the Company
does not have any long-term contracts with its suppliers. In addition,
the success of the Company's financial performance is dependent on the
ability of Famous Footwear to obtain product from its suppliers on a timely
basis and on acceptable terms.
<p><i>Litigation and Other Regulatory Proceedings</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are a defendant from time
to time in lawsuits and regulatory actions relating to our business. As
more fully set forth in Item 3 of this annual report on Form 10-K, these
include, among others, a pending class action lawsuit in Colorado relating
to alleged environmental contamination. Due to the inherent uncertainties
of litigation and regulatory proceedings, the Company cannot accurately
predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings. An unfavorable outcome
could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial
condition and results of operation. In addition, regardless of the outcome
of any litigation or regulatory proceedings, such proceedings are expensive
and will require that we devote substantial resources and executive time
to defend the Company.

<p><b><u>ITEM 2 - PROPERTIES</u></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company owns its principal
executive, sales and administrative offices in Clayton (St. Louis), Missouri.
The Famous Footwear division operates from a leased office building in
Madison, Wisconsin. The Canadian wholesale division operates from an owned
office building in Perth, Ontario, and the retail division from leased
office space in Laval, Quebec. A leased sales office and showroom is maintained
in New York, New York.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of the Company's footwear
sold through its domestic wholesale divisions is processed through two
company-owned distribution centers in Sikeston, Missouri and Fredericktown,
Missouri, which have 720,000 and 465,000 square feet, including mezzanine
levels, respectively. In fiscal 2002, the Company closed one of its two
manufacturing facilities in Canada and now owns and operates one manufacturing
facility and a 150,000 square-foot distribution facility in Perth, Ontario.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company's retail footwear
operations are conducted throughout the United States and Canada and involve
the operation of 1,307 shoe stores, including 172 in Canada. All store
locations are leased, with approximately half having renewal options. Famous
Footwear operates a leased 750,000 square foot distribution center, including
a mezzanine level, in Sun Prairie, Wisconsin, and a leased 800,000 square
foot distribution center, including mezzanine levels, in Lebanon, Tennessee.
The Canadian retailing division operates a leased 21,000 square foot distribution
center, which is adjacent to the division's office in Laval, Quebec.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Brown Shoe Sourcing division
leases office space in Hong Kong, China, Taiwan, Italy, Indonesia and Mexico.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><u>ITEM 3 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</u></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company is involved in
legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business.
In the opinion of management, after consulting with legal counsel, the
outcome of such ordinary course of business proceedings and litigation
currently pending will not have a materially adverse effect on the Company's
results of operations or financial position.

<p><b><u>ITEM 3 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</u> (Continued)</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company is involved in
environmental remediation and ongoing compliance activities at several
sites.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company is remediating,
under the oversight of Colorado authorities, the groundwater and indoor
air at its owned facility in Colorado and residential neighborhoods adjacent
to and near the property, which have been affected by solvents previously
used at the facility. During fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000, the Company incurred
charges of $4.1 million, $1.4 million and $3.0 million, respectively, related
to this remediation.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In March 2000, a class-action
lawsuit was filed in Colorado State Court (District for the City and County
of Denver) related to the Colorado site described above against the Company,
a prior operator at the site and two individuals. Plaintiffs allege claims
for trespass, nuisance, strict liability, negligence and exemplary damages
arising from the alleged release of solvents that are contaminating the
groundwater and indoor air in the areas adjacent to and near the site.
In July 2002, the court granted the plaintiffs' motion for class certification
and scheduled a trial for early 2003. The plaintiffs are seeking damages
of approximately $80 million for diminution in property values and remediation
damages to their property, and unspecified damages, such as for loss of
use and enjoyment and discomfort. The Company is vigorously contesting
this lawsuit, believes it has meritorious defenses and believes the specified
claims are without merit. In May 2001, the Company filed a lawsuit in the
Federal district court in Denver seeking contribution from parties the
Company believes to have contributed to pollution in and around the Colorado
site. In addition, the Company filed suit against another such party in
February 2003 in Colorado State Court. The Company is not able to assess
the ultimate outcome of these matters, but it does not believe these proceedings
will have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial
position, based upon the Company's current assessment of its legal position
and anticipated recoveries from, and/or allocations of damages (if any)
to, third parties. It is possible, however, future results of operations
for any particular quarter or annual period could be materially affected
by changes in facts or assumptions related to this matter.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company has completed
its remediation efforts at its closed New York tannery and two associated
landfills. In 1995, state environmental authorities reclassified the status
of these sites as being properly closed and requiring only continued maintenance
and monitoring over the next 21 years.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, various federal
and state authorities have identified the Company as a potentially responsible
party for remediation at certain landfills from the sale or disposal of
solvents and other by-products from the closed tannery and shoe manufacturing
facilities.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on information currently
available, the Company had an accrued liability of $7.3 million, as of
February 1, 2003, to complete the clean up at all sites. The ultimate cost
may vary.

<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>It is the Chief Executive
Officer's and Chief Financial Officer's ultimate responsibility to ensure
the Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide
reasonable assurance that material information, both financial and non-financial,
and other information required under the securities laws to be disclosed
is identified and communicated to senior management on a timely basis.
The Company's disclosure controls and procedures include mandatory communication
of material events, automated accounting processing and reporting, management
review of monthly, quarterly and annual results, an established system
of internal controls and internal control reviews by the Company's internal
auditors.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the fourth quarter,
management of the Company, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures
pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-14. Based on the evaluation, the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded the Company's
disclosure controls were effective. There have been no significant changes
in the Company's internal controls, or in other factors that could significantly
affect internal controls, subsequent to the date the Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer completed their evaluation.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In designing and evaluating
the disclosure controls and procedures, the Company's management recognized
that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated,
can provide only reasonable assurances of achieving the desired control
objectives and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment
in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I, Ronald A. Fromm, Chairman,
President and Chief Executive Officer of Brown Shoe Company, Inc. (the
"Registrant"), certify that:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. I have reviewed this annual
report on Form 10-K of the registrant;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Based on my knowledge,
this annual report does not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements
made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made,
not misleading with respect to the period covered by this annual report;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Based on my knowledge,
the financial statements, and other financial information included in this
annual report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition,
results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for,
the periods presented in this annual report;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. The registrant's other
certifying officers and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act 13a-14 and
15d-14) for the registrant and we have:
<dir>
<dir>a) Designed such disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that
material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated
subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly
during the period in which this annual report is being prepared;
<p>b) Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls
and procedures as of a date within 90 days prior to the filing date of
this annual report (the "Evaluation Date"); and
<p>c) Presented in this annual report our conclusions about the effectiveness
of the disclosure controls and procedures based on our evaluation as of
the Evaluation Date;</dir>
</dir>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. The registrant's other certifying
officers and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation, to
the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of registrant's board
of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):
<dir>
<dir>a) All significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal
controls which could adversely affect the registrant's ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial data and have identified for the

<dir>
<dir><font size=+0>a) All significant deficiencies in the design or operation
of internal controls which could adversely affect the registrant's ability
to record, process, summarize and report financial data and have identified
for the registrant's auditors any material weaknesses in internal controls;
and</font>
<p><font size=+0>b) Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management
or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal
controls; and</font></dir>
