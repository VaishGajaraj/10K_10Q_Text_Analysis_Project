has elected to use July 27, 2018, which was the initial trading date on the NASDAQ Capital Market, as the calculation date because

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical
company focused on the development of a therapeutic agent for the treatment of alcohol use disorder (&ldquo;AUD&rdquo;) using our
lead investigational new drug product, AD04, a selective serotonin-3 antagonist (i.e., a &ldquo;5-HT3 antagonist&rdquo;). The active
ingredient in AD04 is ondansetron, which is also the active ingredient in Zofran<SUP>&reg;</SUP>, an approved drug for treating
nausea and emesis. AUD is characterized by an urge to consume alcohol and an inability to control the levels of consumption. We
intend to commence a Phase 3 clinical trial using AD04 for the potential treatment of AUD in subjects with certain target genotypes.
We believe our approach is unique in that it targets the serotonin system and individualizes the treatment of AUD, through the
use of genetic screening. We have created an investigational companion diagnostic biomarker test for the genetic screening of patients
with certain biomarkers that, as reported in the <I>American Journal of Psychiatry </I>(Johnson, et. al. 2011&nbsp;&amp; 2013),
we believe will benefit from treatment with AD04. Our strategy is to integrate the pre-treatment genetic screening into AD04&rsquo;s
label to create a patient-specific treatment in one integrated therapeutic offering. Our goal is to develop a genetically targeted,
effective and safe product candidate to treat AUD in genotype positive patients that does not require abstinence as part of the
treatment.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">We have a worldwide, exclusive license
from the University of Virginia Patent Foundation (d.b.a the Licensing&nbsp;&amp; Venture Group) (&ldquo;UVA LVG&rdquo;), which
is the licensing arm of the University of Virginia, to commercialize our investigational drug candidate, AD04, subject to Food
and Drug Administration (&ldquo;FDA&rdquo;) approval of the product, based upon three separate patents and patent application families,
with patents issued in over 40 jurisdictions, including three issued patents in the U.S. Our investigational agent has been used
in several investigator-sponsored trials and we possess or have rights to use toxicology, pharmacokinetic and other preclinical
and clinical data that supports our Phase 3 clinical trial. Our therapeutic agent was the product candidate used in a University
of Virginia investigator sponsored Phase 2b clinical trial of 283 patients. In this Phase 2b clinical trial, ultra-low dose ondansetron,
the active pharmaceutical agent in AD04, showed a statistically significant difference between ondansetron and placebo for both
the primary endpoint and secondary endpoint, which were reduction in severity of drinking measured in drinks per drinking day (1.71
drinks/drinking day; p=0.0042), and reduction in frequency of drinking measured in days of abstinence/no drinking (11.56%; p=0.0352),
respectively. Additionally, and importantly, the Phase 2b results showed a significant decrease in the percentage of heavy drinking
days (11.08%; p=0.0445) with a &ldquo;heavy drinking day&rdquo; defined as a day with four (4) or more alcoholic drinks for women
or five (5) or more alcoholic drinks for men consumed in the same day.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The active pharmaceutical agent in AD04,
our lead investigational new drug product, is ondansetron (the active ingredient in Zofran<SUP>&reg;</SUP>), which was granted
FDA approval in 1991 for nausea and vomiting post-operatively and after chemotherapy or radiation treatment and is now commercially
available in generic form. In studies of Zofran<SUP>&reg;</SUP> conducted as part of its FDA review process, ondansetron was given
acutely at dosages up to almost 100 times the dosage expected to be formulated in AD04 with the highest doses of Zofran<SUP>&reg;
</SUP>given intravenously (&ldquo;i.v.&rdquo;), which results in approximately 160% the exposure level as oral dosing. Even at
high doses given i.v. the studies found that ondansetron is well-tolerated and results in few adverse side effects at the currently
marketed doses, which reach more than 80 times the exposure levels of the AD04 dose and are given i.v. The formulation dosage of
ondansetron used in our drug candidate (and expected to be used by us in our Phase 3 clinical trials) has the potential advantage
that it contains a much lower concentration of ondansetron than the generic formulation/dosage that has been used in prior clinical
trials, is dosed orally, and is available with use of a companion diagnostic biomarker. Our development plan for AD04 is designed
to demonstrate both the efficacy of AD04 in the genetically targeted population and the safety of ondansetron when administered
chronically at the AD04 dosage. However, to the best of our knowledge, no comprehensive clinical study has been performed to date
that has evaluated the safety profile of ondansetron at any dosage for long-term use (6 months or greater) at any dosage as anticipated
in our Phase 3 clinical trial.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">According to the National Institute
of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (the &ldquo;NIAAA&rdquo;) and the Journal of the American Medical Association
(&ldquo;JAMA&rdquo;), in the United States alone, approximately 35 million people each year have AUD (such number is based
upon the 2012 data provided in Grant et. al. the JAMA 2015 publication and has been adjusted to reflect a compound annual
growth rate of 1.13%, which is the growth rate reported by U.S. Census Bureau for the general adult population from
2012-2017), resulting in significant health, social and financial costs with excessive alcohol use being the third leading
cause of preventable death and is responsible for 31% of driving fatalities in the United States (NIAAA Alcohol Facts &amp;
Statistics). AUD contributes to over 200 different diseases and 10% of children live with a person that has an alcohol
problem. According to the American Society of Clinical Oncologists, 5-6% of new cancers and cancer deaths globally are
directly attributable to alcohol. The Centers for Disease Control (the &ldquo;CDC&rdquo;) has reported that AUD costs the
U.S. economy about $250 billion annually, with heavy drinking accounting for greater than 75% of the social and health
related costs. Despite this, according to the article in the JAMA 2015 publication, only 7.7% of patients (i.e.,
approximately 2.7 million people) with AUD are estimated to have been treated in any way and only 3.6% by a physician (i.e.,
approximately 1.3 million people). In addition, according to the JAMA 2017 publication, the problem in the United States appears to be
growing with almost a 50% increase in AUD prevalence between 2002 and 2013.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">AUD is characterized by an urge to consume
alcohol and an inability to control the levels of consumption. Until the publication of the fifth revision of the <I>Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</I> in 2013 (the &ldquo;DSM-5&rdquo;), AUD was broken into &ldquo;alcohol dependence&rdquo;
and &ldquo;alcohol abuse&rdquo;. More broadly, overdrinking due to the inability to moderate drinking is called alcohol addiction
and is often called &ldquo;alcoholism&rdquo;, sometimes pejoratively.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Since ondansetron is already manufactured
for generic sale, the active ingredient for AD04 is readily available from several manufacturers, and we have contracted with a
U.S. manufacturer to acquire ondansetron at a cost expected to be under $0.01 per dose. Clinical trial material (&ldquo;CTM&rdquo;)
has already been manufactured for the initial Phase 3 trial. The CTM has demonstrated good stability after four years with the
stability studies to date. We have entered into a Secrecy and Supply Agreement on December 1, 2011 with Cambrex Charles City, Inc.
(&ldquo;Cambrex&rdquo;) for the supply of the active ingredient for AD04. The agreement has an initial term of eight (8) years
and may be terminated by either party upon a material breach that is not cured within sixty (60) days of receipt of written notice
or certain bankruptcy events. Cambrex has the right to terminate the agreement if we do not cure a payment failure within thirty
(30) days of notice thereof and we have the right to terminate the agreement if a regulatory authority prohibits or restricts manufacture
and sale of the active ingredient in a way that would have an adverse effect on the sale price or volume of the product. Pursuant
to the terms of the agreement with Cambrex, Cambrex cannot decline a purchase order of 50kg of product or less and we are required
to purchase 66.67% of our requirements of the active ingredient sold in the United States and the European Union from Cambrex for
a period of five (5) years from submission of our NDA.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Today the most common treatments for AUD
are directed at achieving abstinence and typical treatments include psychological and social interventions. Most therapies actually
require abstinence prior to initiating therapy. Abstinence requires dramatic lifestyle changes often with serious work and social
consequences. Frequently, patients cannot attend family and social events in order to ensure compliance with abstinence, and patients
often must suffer from the stigma of having been labelled an alcoholic. Significant side effects of current pharmacologic therapies
include mental side effects such as psychiatric disorders and depressive symptoms and physical side effects such as nausea, dizziness,
vomiting, abdominal pain, arthritis and joint fitness. In fact, according to peer reviewed studies referenced in <I>The Sober Truth:
Debunking the Bad Science Behind 12-Step Programs and the Rehab Industry</I>, L. Dodes and Z. Dodes, 2014 by Dr. Lance Dodes, the
former Director of the substance abuse treatment unit of Harvard&rsquo;s McLean Hospital, 90% or more of patients that use current
therapy solutions, such as Alcoholics Anonymous, do not achieve long-term abstinence.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">There are four drugs approved by the FDA
and marketed in the United States for the treatment of alcohol addiction, Antabuse<SUP>&reg; </SUP>(disulfram) Vivitrol<SUP>&reg;</SUP>
(naltrexone), Revia<SUP>&reg;</SUP> (naltrexone) and Campral<SUP>&reg;</SUP> (acomprosate) and one drug, Selincro<SUP>&reg;</SUP>
(nalmefene) is marketed outside of the United States. All of the approved drugs, other than Selincro<SUP>&reg;</SUP>, require abstinence
prior to commencing treatment with the drug, and all five drugs are known to have significant side effects.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Antabuse<SUP>&reg; </SUP>was approved for
the treatment of alcohol dependence more than 50 years ago, making it the oldest such drug on the market. It works by interfering
with the body&rsquo;s ability to process alcohol. Its method of action and purpose is to cause patients that drink alcohol while
taking Antabuse<SUP>&reg;</SUP> to experience numerous and extremely unpleasant adverse effects, including, among others, flushing,
nausea, and palpitations, with the goal that patients will continue the medication but refrain from drinking in order to avoid
these effects.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Our goal with AD04 is to develop an effective
and safe product to treat AUD that does not require abstinence as part of the treatment and does not have the negative side effects
of the current drugs on the market. Our product candidate, AD04, is designed for genotype positive patients who desire to control
their drinking but cannot or do not want to completely abstain from drinking. By removing the difficulties associated with abstinence
and the side effects associated with the other current products on the market, we believe that we may be able to remove barriers
to patient adoption that inhibit adoption of current therapies and can attract a greater portion of the many millions of patients
with AUD that remain untreated. Unlike other therapies, our investigational product, AD04, uses a novel mode of action for treating
AUD that involves genetic screening with a companion diagnostic genetic test prior to treatment and is designed to reduce cravings
for alcohol to effectively curb alcohol intake, without the requirement of abstinence prior to or during treatment. Our product
candidate is intended to be easy to use since it is administered orally, currently on a twice daily basis and with a once-a-day
tablet planned as part of the product&rsquo;s life cycle management. To date, clinical testing of AD04 has shown it to have a positive
safety and tolerability profile with side effects similar to placebo.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The companion diagnostic genetic test to
be used to identify patients that are most likely to benefit from treatment with AD04 may potentially enhance the likelihood of
a successful outcome for those undergoing treatment. Additionally, it may provide doctors with the opportunity to have a non-threatening
conversation about alcohol with their patients and may provide the patient an acceptable path to help them determine if they might
be a candidate for help with their alcohol use. If the test results are positive, they would have a science based rationale for
their treatment, which reduces some of the stigma patients might otherwise endure, and allows them to be treated in the confidence
of their doctor, potentially with a simple, oral tablet.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">In the United States alone, approximately
35 million people each year have AUD. Based on data from the Phase 2b trial of AD04 and our analysis of publicly available genetic
databases, we preliminarily estimate that about one in three patients with AUD in the U.S. will have the genetic markers to indicate
possible treatment with AD04. At this time, we are not aware of any oral pharmaceutical treatment approved in the U.S. that addresses
the needs of patients who desire to control their drinking but cannot or do not want to abstain from drinking. The current abstinence-based
treatments have limitations. The limited side effects expected for our investigational new drug, based on clinical data so far,
are also believed to be an important factor in the expected rapid uptake of AD04 in the market. Our approach, if approved by FDA,
may allow for social drinking to continue and is aimed at reducing the dangerous, heavy drinking. This would allow patients to
live the life they want without the stigma associated with complete abstention and currently endured by those seeking help for
their excessive drinking. Assuming that one-third of AUD patients are genotype positive for treatment with AD04 and a $235 price
for a one month supply of the drug (assumed pricing based on an average of prices published by Blue Cross Blue Shield in June 2017
for tier-3 oral, on-patent, chronic maintenance drugs, discounted by 16.6%, to reflect the average difference between retail and
wholesale pricing for branded drugs as reported by drugs.com), the total potential market for AD04 would be approximately $36 billion
in the United States alone.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Beyond the United States, alcohol consumption
worldwide is a serious health issue. The 2014 Global Status Report on Alcohol and Health published by the World Health Organization
(the &ldquo;WHO&rdquo;) states that 5.9% of all deaths (about 3.3 million per year) and 5.1% of disease worldwide are attributable
to alcohol consumption. Europe consumes over 25% of the total alcohol consumed worldwide despite only having 14.7% of the world&rsquo;s
population. The WHO estimates that about 55 million people in Europe have AUD and, within Europe, Eastern Europe has a particularly
acute problem with Russia estimated to have about 21 million people with AUD. The WHO further estimates that 17.4% of adult Russians
and 31% of adult Russian males have AUD, and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development data indicates that 30%
of all deaths in Russia are alcohol related as reported by Quartz Media.</P>

is about 33% of the population in the United States and that the prevalence in Scandinavia and in certain areas of Central and
Eastern Europe may be greater than 50%. The FDA has agreed that the Phase 3 trials of AD04 can proceed only enrolling patients

to be more likely to then receive a prescription for AD04 (based on an external quantitative market study of 156 primary care physicians
and psychiatrists that was conducted by Ipsos-Insight LLC, who we commissioned, and that concluded a majority of genetically targeted

significant costs that would normally be required to develop therapeutic treatments to the point of being ready to commence a Phase

on what the regulatory authorities may require to secure marketing authorization, we estimate that we will require approximately
$7.5 million for the initial Phase 3 clinical trial (not including company overhead) and an additional $30 million of additional
capital to complete our second Phase 3 program (which includes $20 million for a confirmatory Phase 3 trial and any necessary Phase

with psychiatrists most likely to be familiar with the mechanism of action of AD04, we believe that a relatively small psychiatry-targeted,

commercial enterprise with an initial niche-market sales force at a relatively low cost for market entry. It also expands the universe
of potential acquirers of our company or AD04 to smaller and mid-size pharmaceutical companies. Once success is shown in the niche
market and the thought leaders and early adopters are prescribing AD04, market adoption risk will have been greatly reduced and
we would expect to be able to sell or partner with a large pharmaceutical partner to develop AD04 as a blockbuster product. This

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Ondansetron is a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist.
Preclinical and pharmacobehavioral studies suggest that blockade of serotonin-3 receptors will influence the dopamine reward system
activated by alcohol, decreasing dopamine release and attenuating craving for alcohol (Dawes, MA et al., 2005b; Johnson, BA et
al., 2002; Lovinger, DM, 1999a). Early clinical studies found that the efficacy of ondansetron is limited to certain subgroups
of the alcohol-dependent population and suggested the differential effect could be predicted based on age of onset of alcoholism,
an indistinct concept likely confounded by genetic, regional and ethnic differences (Johnson, BA et al., 2000; Kranzler, HR et
al., 2003). Recent research suggests the variable effect may be predictable based on molecular mechanism of ondansetron action
and individual subject genotype of key genes in the serotonin system (Enoch, MA et al., 2010; Johnson, BA et al., 2011; Kenna,
GA et al., 2009).</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">We are pursuing development of ondansetron
in the alcohol-dependent population. Clinical studies will initially focus on the use of a low dose, oral tablet (0.33 mg administered
twice daily) to reduce alcohol consumption in subjects with genotypes that have been correlated with a responsive to treatment
with ondansetron.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Ondansetron was first approved by the FDA
in 1991 as a solution for injection. Subsequent approvals were obtained for oral tablets in dosage forms and an oral solution.
It is marketed as Zofran<SUP>&reg;</SUP> and is also available in generic formulations, and it has been used widely for the approved
indications &ndash; prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with certain cancer chemotherapies and radiotherapies and for
the prevention of postoperative nausea or vomiting &mdash; at adult doses of 8&ndash;24 mg/day with manageable side effects.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Ondansetron has been administered to dogs&sbquo;
rats&sbquo; and mice as part of a preclinical toxicology program which included single-dose acute&sbquo; repeated-dose studies.
Ondansetron was not mutagenic in the standard battery of microbial tests for mutagenicity and no carcinogenic effects were seen
in 2-year studies in rats and mice with oral ondansetron doses up to 10 and 30 mg/kg/day, respectively. In studies of rats and
rabbits there was no evidence of reproductive toxicity seen on fertility, early embryonic development, perinatal/postnatal development
or fetal development of the F2 generation. Based on these studies, as well as over 20 years of human use in clinical trials and
the post-marketing environment, ondansetron is considered to be a well-tolerated drug with a generally mild safety profile.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Ondansetron, by blocking the 5-HT3 receptor,
is known to affect dopaminergic signaling in the brain; and the scientific rational for use of a 5-HT3 antagonist in the treatment
of alcohol dependence is well established (Johnson, BA, 2004). Briefly, studies suggest that: the rewarding effects of alcohol
involve activation of the 5-HT3 receptors leading to release of dopamine within the mesolimbic system of the brain (McBride, WJ
et al., 2004). Thus, by blocking activation of the 5-HT3 receptor, ondansetron may reduce the ethanol-stimulated release of dopamine
leading to reduced feelings of pleasure or reward and consequently, reduced consumption (Carboni, E et al., 1989; Costall, B et
al., 1987; Hagan, RM et al., 1990; Imperato, A and Angelucci, L, 1989; Lovinger, DM, 1999b; McBride, WJ et al., 2004; Minabe, Y

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Preclinical studies have demonstrated that
alcohol stimulates the release of both serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine or 5-HT) and dopamine within the cortio-mesolimbic system
(Campbell, AD et al., 1996; Campbell, AD and McBride, WJ, 1995; Di Chiara, G and Imperato, A, 1988; Imperato, A and Angelucci,
L, 1989; Yoshimoto, K et al., 1992; Yoshimoto, K et al., 1996; Zazpe, A et al., 1994). Other studies have shown that alcohol potentiates
the effects of 5-HT at the 5-HT3 receptor, leading to augmented release of dopamine, and that ondansetron and the selective antagonists
of the 5-HT3 receptor inhibit dopaminergic firing and release of dopamine in response to alcohol and serotonin (Costall, B et al.,
1987; Lovinger, DM, 1991; Minabe, Y et al., 1991; Rasmussen, K et al., 1991; Yoshimoto, K et al., 1996; Zazpe, A et al., 1994;
Zhou, Q et al., 1998). Finally, numerous in vivo studies in rats and mice have shown that ondansetron and other selective antagonist
of the 5-HT3 receptor reduce volitional intake of alcohol in models selectively bred for alcohol preference (Fadda, F et al., 1991;
Hodge, CW et al., 1993; McBride, WJ and Li, TK, 1998; Meert, TF, 1993; Tomkins, DM et al., 1995).</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The aforementioned nonclinical studies
have shown that 5-HT3 and dopamine interactions in the cortico-mesolimbic system appear to mediate many of the reinforcing effects
of alcohol. Collectively the available nonclinical studies suggest that, by inhibiting the 5-HT3 receptor and reducing the release
of dopamine in the cortico-mesolimbic area, ondansetron can interfere with the dopamine reward system activated by alcohol and
lead to reduced alcohol intake (Barnes, NM and Sharp, T, 1999; Dawes, MA <I>et al.</I>, 2005b; Johnson, BA <I>et al.</I>, 1993;
Johnson, BA and Cowen, PJ, 1993; Lovinger, DM, 1991, 1999a; Swift, RM <I>et al.</I>, 1996; Tomkins, DM <I>et al.</I>, 1995).</P>

on the effects of administration of 0.25 mg bid ondansetron (N=23), 2 mg bid ondansetron (N=25), or placebo (N=23) for 6 weeks
in alcohol-dependent males (Sellers, EM <I>et al.</I>, 1994). Endpoints included change in drinks per drinking day (&ldquo;DDD&rdquo;)
and proportion of responders, where a responder was defined as a subject with a Reliable Change score &gt; 1.96, representing an
improvement of at least 2 standard deviations. The Reliable Change score was calculated as the difference between pre- and post-test
DDD divided by the standard error. Analyses were conducted comparing pre-treatment with the Week 6 visit, representing the end-of-study
medication administration, and pre-treatment with the Week 7 visit, after completion of a 1-week follow-up period.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">In the 71 subjects who completed the study,
the on-treatment changes in DDD were approximately -1.9 (0.25 mg bid), -1.2 (2 mg bid), and -1.3 (placebo), with neither ondansetron
effect being statistically different from the placebo effect. The corresponding changes from pre-treatment to Week 7 (after 6 weeks
of treatment and a 1-week follow-up) were approximately -2.7 (0.25 mg bid), -1.1 (2 mg bid), and -1.6 (placebo), with the difference
between low-dose ondansetron and placebo approaching statistical significance (p=0.06). By Week 6, nearly twice as many subjects
on low-dose ondansetron compared with those on either high-dose ondansetron or placebo showed significant improvement according
to the Reliable Change score. Lower baseline drinking and higher level of education were significant predictors of reduction in
drinking while on treatment.</P>

Alcohol Use Disorder Conducted by the University of Virginia</B></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">In various studies, it has been shown that
alcohol dependent individuals with the LL genotype of the 5&rsquo;-HTT and the TT genotype in the 3&rsquo;-UTR LL and TT genotype
have lower B-CIT neuronal binding to 5-HTT. It is hypothesized that individuals with the LL or TT genotype, 5-HTT gene expression
is suppressed by increased alcohol consumption, and therefore, ondansetron, which causes 5-HTT gene expression would have the greatest
effect upon individuals that possess both the LL genotype of the 5&rsquo;-HTT and the TT genotype in the 3&rsquo;-UTR. A subsequent
Phase 2b study (N = 283), conducted by the University of Virginia for which we have acquired rights to the data, showed that a
prospectively identified subgroup of alcohol-dependent individuals with these specific polymorphisms of the serotonin transporter
protein responded therapeutically to ondansetron administration (Johnson, BA et al., 2011). Further analysis of this same data
set against 18 additional polymorphisms located on the genes for the A and B subunits of the serotonin 5-HT3 receptor revealed
polymorphisms that were also associated with a therapeutic response to ondansetron. Collectively, the genotypes from the two aforementioned
analyses comprise the genotypes selected for testing in Phase 3 trials for AD04. The Phase 3 studies will test ondansetron&rsquo;s
efficacy compared with placebo based on its ability to decrease the frequency and amount of heavy drinking among alcohol dependent
individuals with the selected genotypes.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The Phase 2b clinical trial conducted by
the University of Virginia was a 283-patient, 12-week, randomized, two-center, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study. Following
a 1 week placebo run in (single-blind), alcohol-dependent subjects were randomized to receive either 4 &micro;g/kg ondansetron
or placebo, orally, twice daily (double-blind) for 11 additional weeks. In addition to study treatment, all subjects received weekly,
standardized, manual-driven, cognitive behavioral therapy.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Eligible subjects were classified to one
of twelve groups described by the 2&times;2 x 3 factorial combinations and randomized to placebo or ondansetron (4 mcg/kg twice
daily [b.i.d.]) using a computed blocks randomization procedure that balances the twelve treatment groups on drinks/day &le; 7.99

for the SNP rs1042173 (TT, TG or GG) in the 3&acute;-UTR of the 5-SLC6A4 gene that codes for the serotonin transporter was performed
following randomization but prior to database lock. Genotyping and analysis of the study subjects for SNPs located on genes that
govern expression of the 5-HT3A and 5-HT3B subunits of the 5-HT3 receptor was performed after database lock.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">During treatment, subjects were evaluated
weekly at the study center for efficacy, safety, and tolerability. Alcohol consumption was collected via the self-reported Timeline
Follow-Back (TLFB) method (Sobell and Sobell, Psychosocial &amp; Biochem. Meth., 1992).</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Efficacy measures were based on self-reported
drinking outcomes with drinks per drinking day (&ldquo;DDD&rdquo;), with a standard drink equal to 14 grams of alcohol, and the
percentage of days abstinent (&ldquo;PDA&rdquo;) being the pre-specified efficacy end points. Withdrawal symptoms, social functioning,
and motivation to use alcohol were assessed using standard questionnaires and scales. Subject safety was monitored through periodic
electrocardiograms (EKGs), physical exams, safety laboratories and collection of adverse events, concomitant medications, and vital
signs. Additionally, a <I>post hoc</I> analysis was conducted using the endpoint of percentage of heavy drinking days (&ldquo;PDHD&rdquo;),
which is the number of days of heavy drinking days in a month as a percentage of days in the month, because it is widely recognized
as a clinically meaningful endpoint and is expected to be an end point in a pivotal/Phase 3 trials. The PDHD end point requires
that each day be determined to be a heavy drinking day (i.e., a day in which a female drinks 4 or more drinks or a male drinks
5 or more drinks) or not, making each day binary and requiring an increased sample size to ensure statistical power. Therefore,
the goal of the PDHD analysis was to determine if the was a trend toward and effect with PDHD without necessary achieving statistical
significance.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The study objectives were to evaluate the
safety of AD04 and to test the hypotheses that: (i) ondansetron will have a greater effect of reducing the severity of alcohol
drinking and of increasing the percentage of days abstinent among alcohol-dependent subjects with the LL genotype as compared with
S carriers (SS or SL) of the 5&acute;-HTTLPR; and (ii) ondansetron&rsquo;s therapeutic effect will be greatest among alcohol-dependent
subjects who possess both the LL genotype of the 5&acute;-HTTLPR and the TT genotype of rs1042173 in the 3&acute;-UTR of the 5&acute;-HTT.
After completion of the study, a planned additional analysis of the correlation between genotype and drinking outcomes was conducted
considering 18 SNPs located on the 5-HT3A and 5-HT3B subunit genes that were selected based on their minor allele frequency (&ge;
0.05) in different ethnic populations, to obtain uniform physical coverage of the two genes, and on results from previous genetic
association studies. This latter analysis identified three SNPs as having an apparent beneficial effect.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The primary analytic procedure used mixed-effects
linear regression models and a sensitivity analysis using repeated measures models.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Additionally, based on the expectation
that subjects with the LL and LL/TT variants of the SLC6A4 gene would respond to ondansetron treatment while others do not, the
possibility that SNPs in the 5-HT3A and 5-HT3B subunits of the 5-HT3AB receptor complex may also influence the response to ondansetron
was planned as a <I>post hoc</I> analysis. The possible role of SNPs on the HTR3A and HTR3B genes in the response to ondansetron
is logical since the 5-HT3A receptor subunit is the primary target for ondansetron&rsquo;s actions, and the 5-HT3B receptor subunit
may be associated with the availability and externalization of the 5-HT3AB receptor complex. Thus, alterations in post-synaptic
receptors, such as the 5-HT3AB receptor complex, could have a large impact on signal transduction along post-synaptic neurons.
For these analyses, a total of 18 SNPs on the genes for the 5-HT3A and 5-HT3B subunits were examined. SNPs were selected based
on their minor allele frequency (&ge; 0.05) in different ethnic populations, to obtain uniform physical coverage of the two genes,
and on results from previous genetic association studies.</P>

the SOCs of gastrointestinal disorders (ondansetron 65%, placebo 61%), metabolism and nutritional disorders (38%, 43%), and nervous
system disorders (60%, 58%). The incidence of TEAEs by preferred term was similar between the ondansetron and placebo groups. TEAEs
that occurred at a frequency &ge; 5% in the ondansetron group compared with the placebo group included constipation (32%, 21%),
fatigue (39%, 25%), and dizziness (21%, 12%). There was one death during the study; Subject #218 committed suicide on Study Day
40. The event was considered not related to study drug. Treatment-emergent SAEs were reported in 3 (2.1%) ondansetron-treated subjects
and 6 (3.8%) placebo-treated subjects. No SAE was considered related to study drug, and detoxification was the only SAE that was
reported for more than 1 subject (2 ondansetron subjects). No clinically meaningful changes in clinical laboratory results, vital
sign measurements, ECGs or physical examinations were observed for subjects during the course of the study.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Analysis of the LL genotype of the 5&acute;-HTTLPR
as compared to the non-LL genotypes showed a significant reduction in DDD and PDA (Johnson, et.al, Am. Jrnl. Psych., 2011). However,
the demonstrated effect of the LL/TT vs. other patients was more pronounced, and carriers of LL/TT genotype who received ondansetron
showed a greater reduction in drinking compared to LL/TT on placebo. Carriers of the LL/TT genotype who received ondansetron showed
a greater reduction in DDD compared to: 1) LL/TT carriers who received placebo (difference of 2.05 drinks/drinking day; 95% CI,
-3.72 to -0.39; p=0.0158), 2) LL/Gx carriers who received ondansetron (difference of 2.29 drinks/drinking day; 95% CI, -3.99 to
-0.72; p=0.0048), and 3) all other genotypes who received ondansetron treatment (difference of 2.58 drinks/drinking day; 95% CI,
-3.94 to 1.22; p&lt;0.0001); and a greater PDA compared with: 1) the LL/TT genotype group treated with placebo (mean difference=12.38%;
95% CI=&nbsp;-1.57 to 26.33; p= 0.0819), 2) LL/Gx carriers treated with ondansetron (mean difference=15.14%; 95% CI=&nbsp;1.41
to 28.87; p= 0.0307), and 3) all other genotypes treated with ondansetron (difference= 16.82%; 95% CI= 6.15 to 27.48; p=0.0020).
The <I>post hoc</I> analysis of the PDHD endpoint show that ondansetron treatment of subjects with the LL/TT genotype was associated
with a larger (but not statistically significant) reduction in PDHD compared to changes in PDHD in subjects with all other genotypes
who received treatment with ondansetron (mean difference= -8.49%; 95% CI= 20.34 to 3.367; p= 0.1601). Similar trends (i.e., augmented
reductions in PDHD) were observed for the LL/TT group treated with ondansetron versus the LL/Gx genotype group treated with ondansetron
and versus the LL/TT group treated with placebo (mean difference=-2.54% 95% CI= 17.74 to 12.66, p=0.7431; and mean difference=
5.72% 95% CI= 21.20 to 9.75, p=0.4684; respectively).</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">As stated above, a total of 18 SNPs on
the genes for the 5-HT3A and 5-HT3B subunits were examined with SNPs selected based on frequency and on results from previous genetic
association studies.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">These analyses identified 3 SNPs (three
in the gene for the 5-HT3A subunit and one in the gene for the 5-HT3B subunit) that were significantly associated with a positive
response to ondansetron based on reductions in DDD and PDA. Thus, the genotype profile targeted for Phase 3 development is defined
as those subjects who carry the LL/TT genotype and/or one of three 5-HT3 SNPs of interest (i.e., rs1150226-AG and rs1176713-GG
in the gene that encodes the 5-HT3A receptor subunit and rs17614942-AC in the gene that encodes the 5-HT3B receptor subunit). The
hypothesis that subjects who are carriers of the genotype panel targeted for study in Phase 3 (&ldquo;P3-genotype&rdquo;, with
such patients &ldquo;genotype positive&rdquo; or &ldquo;marker positive&rdquo;) preferentially respond to treatment with ondansetron
compared to subjects who do not carry any of the genotypes targeted for study in Phase 3 were assessed using the drinking endpoints
of DDD, PDA, and PDHD.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Carriers of the P3-genotype who received
ondansetron showed a greater reduction in DDD compared to P3-genotype carriers who received placebo (difference of 1.71 drinks/drinking
day; 95% CI= -2.88 to -0.54; p=0.0042), and compared to subjects treated with ondansetron who were not carriers of the P3-genotype
(All Other-OND; difference of 2.05 drinks/drinking day; 95% CI= -3.11 to -1.00, p=0.0001). In contrast, no difference was observed
between non-P3-genotypes who received ondansetron (All Other-OND) versus non-P3-genotypes who received placebo (All Other-Placebo;
difference of 0.40 drinks/drinking day; 95% CI= -0.43 to 1.23; p=0.3445). The mean baseline DDD for all subjects was 9.5 drinks/drinking
day. Carriers of the P3-genotype who received ondansetron (P3-OND) had a greater increase in PDA compared to P3-genotype carriers
who received placebo (P3-Placebo; difference of 11.56%; 95% CI= 0.80 to 22.31; p=0.0352) and compared to non-P3-genotype carriers
who received ondansetron (All Other-OND; difference of 11.52%; 95% CI= 1.76 to 21.28; p=0.0208). In contrast, no differences were

Other-OND versus All Other-Placebo; difference of -0.96%; 95% CI= -8.61 to 6.69; p=0.8055). The mean baseline PDA for all subjects
was 17%.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><I>&nbsp;</I></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">As stated above, for the PDHD <I>post hoc</I>
analysis of the Phase 2b clinical trial data, a heavy drinking day was defined as a day when a female drank 4 or more drinks in
a day, with a drink being defined as containing 14 grams of alcohol, or when a man drank 5 or more drinks in a day, which was the
definition the FDA indicated to us was required. It is also currently the definition of &ldquo;high-risk drinking&rdquo; in Dietary
Guidelines for Americans 2015-2020 (U.S. Departments of HHS and Agriculture), the NIAAA&rsquo;s definition of &ldquo;binge drinking&rdquo;,
and has historically been the definition for a heavy drinking day (Neal, D., &amp; Carey, K., 2007). The Substance Abuse and Mental
Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) defines heavy drinking &ldquo;as drinking 5 or more alcoholic drinks on the same occasion.&rdquo;
Subsequent to our analysis of the Phase 2b data and agreement with the FDA on the definition of a heavy drinking day as 4/5 or
more drinks in a day for females/males, the FDA published a draft guidance, in which it states, &ldquo;Those drinking 4 plus/5
plus [drinks for females and males, respectively] even on occasion have significantly higher risks (10 to 20 percent) of meeting
criteria for AUD.&rdquo; The FDA&rsquo;s draft guidance then states that the NIAAA defines a heavy drinking day as more than 3
drinks in a day for a woman and more than 4 drinks in a day for a man, which is currently only part of the NIAAA&rsquo;s definition
for &ldquo;low-risk drinking&rdquo;, and which is very similar but not necessarily identical to what the FDA indicated to us was
required and the criteria we used when generating our study report on the Phase 2b. So, it is unclear which definition of a heavy
drinking day the FDA will accept at this time. However, under this different definition of a heavy drinking day as more than 3/4
for females/males, the Phase 2b trial data support the effect of AD04 on reducing heavy drinking and showed a greater reduction
in PDHD compared to P3-genotype carriers who received placebo (P3-Placebo; difference of -10.24%; 95% CI= -21.18 to 0.70; p=0.0665),
and compared to non-P3-genotype carriers who received ondansetron (All Other-OND; difference of -11.65%; 95% CI= -21.54 to -1.77;
p=0.0209). In contrast, no difference was observed between non-P3-genotypes who received ondansetron (All Other-OND) versus non-P3-genotypes
who received Placebo (All Other-Placebo; difference of 4.09%; 95% CI= -3.70 to 11.88; p=0.3033). We do not expect a small change
to the definition of a heavy drinking day to dramatically change our plans or probability of success. We intend to discuss the
definition of a heavy drinking day with the FDA and EMA prior to our relevant submissions.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The FDA has indicated that we can proceed
with a single-arm, two-cell Phase 3 clinical trial design for the testing of AD04 as a treatment for AUD in patients that are genotype
positive when tested against the AD04 genetic panel using our companion diagnostic test (i.e., a negative genetic test result will
be an exclusion criterion). The initial Phase 3 trial is planned to be conducted in 294 patients in Scandinavia and Central and
Eastern Europe where the prevalence of genotype positive people appears to be higher than in the U.S. and Western Europe. The primary
analysis is expected to use the primary endpoints previously accepted by the European Medicines Authority (&ldquo;EMA&rdquo;) with
the reduction from baseline of heavy drinking and reduction from baseline in total alcohol consumed being the co-primary endpoints,
and an alternative analysis is expected to be conducted for filing in the United States using the FDA specified endpoint of reduction
in percentage of patients with heavy drinking during the efficacy observation period as compared to placebo (FDA Feb. 2015 Draft
Guidance <I>Alcoholism: Developing Drugs for Treatment Guidance for Industry</I> ) and which the FDA has indicated will be acceptable.
Under this guidance, the FDA appears to now define a heavy drinking as more than three drinks in a day for a woman and more than
four drinks in a day for a man, which is a reduction from the prior definition. We intend to seek clarification from the FDA on
the definition of a heavy drinking day prior to our submission to them and do not believe a minor change to the definition of a
heavy drinking day will be material to our plans. To conduct this initial trial, we plan to file a Clinical Trial Authorization
(&ldquo;CTA&rdquo;) with the EMA and not file with the FDA since the trial is intended to be run exclusively in Europe. We have
placed our investigational new drug (&ldquo;IND&rdquo;) application with the FDA on inactive status, which is a voluntary decision
that reflects our strategic decision not to pursue clinical trials in the United States at this time. If we should choose to conduct
clinical trials in the future in the United States, we will be required to reactivate our IND in the United States prior to commencing
any such clinical trials.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">If the initial Phase 3 trial is successful,
we intend to consult with the FDA and EMA, and assuming agreement from the agencies, conduct a second Phase 3 clinical trial in
a broader geography that includes the United States. The trial design is expected to be the same as the first Phase 3 trial but
is expected to include 580 patients in order provide increased exposure data to demonstrate the safety and tolerability of AD04
and increase the statistical power of the study. Depending on the results of the initial Phase 3 trial, which will not be fully
powered for the FDA endpoint, it is also possible that the FDA may require a third Phase 3 trial. If a third Phase 3 trial is required,
we would expect to conduct it in parallel with the second Phase 3 trial with a goal of not delaying approval of AD04, though this
would require additional funds and investment in the clinical trials.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">We have had a joint meeting with the Center
for Drug Evaluation and Review (&ldquo;CDER&rdquo;) and the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (&ldquo;CDRH&rdquo;), the
two divisions of the FDA responsible for drug approvals and test approvals, respectively. At the meeting the divisions agreed that
clinical validation of our companion diagnostic test for AD04 will be evaluated by CDER and the technical validation of our companion
diagnostic will be evaluated by CDRH. We already developed the methods for the companion diagnostic as a blood test and established
the test with a U.S. third-party vendor capable of supporting a Phase 3 clinical trial, and have built validation and possible
approval of the companion diagnostic into the Phase 3 program, including that we plan to store blood samples for all patients in
the event additional genetic testing is required by regulatory authorities.</P>

patients as part of our next Phase 3 trial. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data in

issued to UVA LVG Class A Units (which was equal to four percent (4%) of our equity on the date of issuance) as a license issue.
We are obligated to pay UVA LVG (i) annual minimum royalties of $40,000 commencing in 2017; (ii) a $20,000 milestone payments upon
dosing the first patient under a Phase 3 human clinical trial of a licensed product, $155,000 upon the earlier of the completion
of a Phase 3 trial of a licensed product or the partnering of the licensed or sale of our company, $275,000 upon acceptance of
an NDA by the FDA, and $1,000,000 upon approval for sale of AD04 in the U.S., Europe or Japan; and (iii) royalties equal to a 2%

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Since our inception, we have focused on
taking action primarily through the filing of patents geared toward ensuring AD04 will have market exclusivity for at least 10
years after it is launched with particular focus on the U.S. and Europe. Ondansetron, the active pharmaceutical ingredient (&ldquo;API&rdquo;)
of AD04 was granted FDA approval as Zofran<SUP>&reg;</SUP> for the treatment of post-operative and post-chemotherapy nausea and
emesis in January 1991 and is now commercially available in generic form at doses from more than 12 times the AD04 dose to over
70 times the AD04 dose with the highest doses being administered intravenously (&ldquo;i.v.&rdquo;), which provides almost twice
the drug exposure levels as oral dosing. With generic ondansetron available, the following threats have been addressed: (i) the
potential use of currently available ondansetron products (i.e., Zofran<SUP>&reg;</SUP>) &ldquo;off-label&rdquo;, and (ii) the
potential manufacturing and launching of a generic version AD04 by a competitor.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The lowest doses of Zofran<SUP>&reg;</SUP>
tablets (and its generic equivalents) on the market are a 4 mg and 8 mg tablet as compared to AD04, which is currently formulated
as a 0.33 mg tablet (12.2 times less than the 4 mg tablet). Thus, in order for a patient to use tablets already on the market and
get the AD04 dose, a patient would have to cut the 4 mg tablet into 12 parts (or the 8 mg tablet into 24 parts), which we do not
believe is reasonably possible; and, even with precise sectioning into 12 pieces, the dose may still not be accurate because tablets
at the Zofran<SUP>&reg;</SUP> dose have not been manufactured to ensure uniformity of distribution of the active ingredient across
the tablet. Therefore, we believe that the risk of a large number of patients attempting to cut the currently marketed tablet to
achieve the AD04 dose to be extremely low.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Since we do not believe that Zofran<SUP>&reg;</SUP>
tablets can be used as a substitute for AD04, the main question related to the potential for off-label use of the current products
for treating addictions then becomes whether doctors and patients will believe it is possible to use the currently available, higher
doses of ondansetron to treat addictions, including AUD. We believe doctors are extremely unlikely to prescribe currently available
high dose versions of ondansetron and that any such prescribing that dose will likely be limited and immaterial to the sales of
AD04 for two reasons &mdash; (1) we believe the high doses are unlikely to be efficacious as a treatment for AUD, and (2) we believe
the high doses would likely raise significant safety concerns.</P>

The high doses of ondansetron found in Zofran<SUP>&reg;</SUP> have been tested in clinical trials for treating AUD and have not shown efficacy against AUD (Sellers, et. al. 1994).

While high-dose ondansetron is safe and tolerable at the doses on the market if administered acutely (i.e., dosed for a few hours i.v. or a few days orally) as is done for post-operative and post-chemotherapy nausea and emesis, the drug is known to have cardiovascular side effects at higher doses, and results from clinical studies suggest that high doses of ondansetron may affect the electrical activity of the heart. In fact, the FDA withdrew approval of the 32 mg i.v. Zofran<SUP>&reg;</SUP> product that was previously on the market. As part of the FDA&rsquo;s on-going safety review of currently available ondansetron doses, the FDA has stated that: &ldquo;Ondansetron at currently marketed levels may increase the risk of developing prolongation of the QT interval of the electrocardiogram, which can lead to an abnormal or potentially fatal heart rhythm.&rdquo; There are also several recent lawsuits claiming that Zofran<SUP>&reg;</SUP> used for off label for morning sickness causes birth defects. Thus, if the currently available high-dose ondansetron was used chronically as would be needed for treating addiction there could potentially be significant safety concerns without additional clinical studies related to the chronic dosing of currently available ondansetron. At the lower dose of ondansetron in AD04, our product is almost as low as one one-hundredth of the dose of i.v. ondansetron that was removed from the market. The FDA has stated that we can commence chronic dosing of patients with AD04 without any further safety or non-clinical studies.</FONT></TD></TR>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Therefore, we do not expect physicians
to prescribe current ondansetron doses for currently unapproved use for treating AUD because there is no evidence those doses would
work for treating AUD and there may be safety concerns associated with the chronic administration of currently available doses.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">There is also a liquid, pediatric formulation
of Zofran<SUP>&reg;</SUP> on the market. It is offered in a 50 mL bottle that is available for a little over $100 online and would
provide a 2-month supply of AD04 if dosed at the 0.4 mL required to achieve the 0.33 mg AD04 dose. Our risk assessment is that,
though it would be possible to use the liquid formulation for administering a dose of ondansetron equivalent to AD04, it is not
expected to be a practice that would materially impact the sales of AD04, and the risk from the liquid formulation is low for the
following reasons:</P>

Cleanup of the sticky product would be inconvenient as would transportation and storage, and an opened bottle would need to be used within 4 weeks (per UKPAR). Therefore, we expect that AD04&rsquo;s convenient tablet would increase patient compliance relative to the liquid formulation. Bottle breakage and spillage will also be a concern.</FONT></TD></TR>

With the liquid formulation, measuring the small (0.4 mL) dose will be difficult with great opportunity for misdosing even if a graduated syringe is used. In real-world practice, many patients would use other methods such as estimated pouring into cups and drinking directly from the bottle.

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">In the United States, pharmaceutical products
are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the &ldquo;FDC Act&rdquo;), and other
federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage,
recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and
import and export of pharmaceutical products. In the United States, pharmaceutical products used for the prevention, treatment,
or cure of a disease or condition of a human being are subject to extensive regulation under the FDC Act. Failure to comply with
applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to
approve pending NDAs, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production
or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Pharmaceutical product development for
a new product or certain changes to an approved product in the United States typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal
tests, the submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application (&ldquo;IND&rdquo;), which must become effective before
clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the
drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes
many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product or disease.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation
of product chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and
efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including
good laboratory practices. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information,
including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term preclinical
tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">A 30-day waiting period after the submission
of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned
the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin. However, the FDA can impose a clinical hold
after 30 days if it has safety or compliance-related concerns.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Clinical trials involve the administration
of the investigational new drug or biologic to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator.
Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with good clinical practice (&ldquo;GCP&rdquo;),
an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of subjects and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors,
administrators, and monitors; as well as (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used
in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. subjects and subsequent
protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">As noted, the FDA may order the temporary,
or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial
either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients.
The study protocol and informed consent information for subjects in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional
review board (&ldquo;IRB&rdquo;), for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily
or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB&rsquo;s requirements, for safety or other concerns, or may impose other conditions.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing
approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of
the drug or biologic into healthy human subjects or patients, the product is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological
actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence of effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves
trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug or biologic for a particular indication, dosage
tolerance, and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If preliminary evidence of effectiveness
and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about
clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit
the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug or biologic and to provide adequate information for the labeling
of the product. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy
of the drug or biologic.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">After completion of the required clinical
testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin
in the United States. The NDA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical, and other testing and a compilation of data
relating to the product&rsquo;s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and control. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA
is substantial. The submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, currently exceeding
$2.5 million for fiscal year 2019 (although a waiver is possible in certain cases), and the manufacturer and/or sponsor under an
approved new drug application are also subject to a program fee set at more than $309,000 for fiscal year 2019. These fees are
typically increased annually.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of
an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency&rsquo;s threshold determination that
it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth
review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs. Most such applications for standard review drug
or biologic products are reviewed within ten to twelve months; most applications for priority review drugs or biologics are reviewed
in six to eight months. The FDA can extend these reviews by three months. The review process for both standard and priority review
may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended
to clarify information already provided in the submission.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The FDA may also refer applications for
novel drug or biologic products, or drug or biologic products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory
committee &mdash; typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts &mdash; for review, evaluation, and a recommendation
on questions raised by an application, including whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation
of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect
one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at
which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with current good manufacturing practice
(&ldquo;cGMP&rdquo;) is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug or biologic is safe
and effective in the indication studied.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the
manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter (&ldquo;CRL&rdquo;). In some cases,
FDA may choose to extend the review time, in consultation with the sponsor. A CRL generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission
and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when,
those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA&rsquo;s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval
letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">An approval letter authorizes commercial
marketing of the drug or biologic with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval,
the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the
potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe
use (&ldquo;ETASU&rdquo;). ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing,
dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS
can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. Moreover, product approval may require substantial
post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the product&rsquo;s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be
withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. The
FDA could also impose a boxed warning (sometimes referred to as a Black Box Warning) in the product label if it identifies a specific
risk that requires particular attention. This imposition of a Black Box Warning limits certain types of promotions.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Enacted in 2016, the 21<SUP>st</SUP> Century
Cures Act (the &ldquo;Cures Act&rdquo;), in part, revises the drug and device review and approval processes at the FDA. The Cures
Act, which was signed into law on December 13, 2016, among other things, requires the manufacturer of an investigational drug for
a serious disease or condition to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to
requests for individual patient access to such investigational drug. This requirement applies on the later of 60 calendar days
after the date of enactment of the Cures Act or the first initiation of a Phase 2 or Phase 3 trial of the investigational drug.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Once an NDA is approved, a product will
be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion
of drugs and biologics, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, industry-sponsored scientific and
educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Drugs and biologics may be marketed only for the approved
indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><FONT STYLE="font-size: 7pt">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Adverse event reporting and submission
of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of an NDA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase
4 testing, REMS, and special surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place other conditions
on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control, drug manufacture, packaging,
and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug and biologic manufacturers must list the product
with the FDA, and they and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain
state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency
inspects manufacturing and other facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs and other requirements. Accordingly, manufacturers
must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs.
Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals, issue warning or other letters, suspend production activities, or request
product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, or take other regulatory or enforcement action if it encounters
problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered. Significant expenses
are required to correct deficiencies.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">We believe that the success of our product
candidates may depend, in part, on the development and commercialization of either a companion diagnostic or complementary diagnostic.
Companion diagnostics and complementary diagnostics can identify patients who are most likely to benefit from a particular therapeutic
product; identify patients likely to be at increased risk for serious side effects as a result of treatment with a particular therapeutic
product; or monitor response to treatment with a particular therapeutic product for the purpose of adjusting treatment to achieve
improved safety or effectiveness. Companion diagnostics and complementary diagnostics are regulated as medical devices by the FDA
and, as such, require either clearance or approval prior to commercialization. The level of risk combined with available controls
to mitigate risk determines whether a companion diagnostic device requires Premarket Approval Application, or PMA, approval or
is cleared through the 510(k) premarket notification process. For a novel therapeutic product for which a companion diagnostic
device is essential for the safe and effective use of the product, the companion diagnostic device should be developed and approved
or 510(k)-cleared contemporaneously with the therapeutic. The use of the companion diagnostic device will be stipulated in the
labeling of the therapeutic product. This is also true for a complementary diagnostic, although it is not a prerequisite for receiving
the therapeutic. Currently, we intend to submit a 505(b)(2) new drug application to the FDA for AD04.&nbsp; We have interacted
primarily with the FDA&rsquo;s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, in consultation with the agency&rsquo;s Center for Devices
and Radiological Health.&nbsp; At this time, the FDA has not stated that a new marketing application (e.g., a PMA, or an approval
cleared through the 510(k) premarket notification process) will be required for the companion diagnostics to be used with the drug
product, but this could change.&nbsp; If the FDA requires a separate application for the diagnostic, this could potentially delay
the approval of the new drug application for AD04, complicate the review process, &nbsp;or even lead to the rejection of the new
drug application.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Under certain circumstances, an approved
application may be eligible for three years of non-patent market exclusivity provided by the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the Federal
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The FDA might grant such exclusivity, (which would be separate from any patent protection to which
an approved drug might be entitled) if the applicant conducted new clinical investigations (other than bioavailability studies)
that are new and essential to the application&rsquo;s approval. Among the types of exclusivity are those for a &ldquo;new chemical
entity&rdquo; and those for a new formulation or indication for a previously-approved drug. If granted, marketing exclusivity
for the types of products that include only drugs with innovative changes to previously-approved products using the same active
ingredient, might prohibit the FDA from approving an application for a competitor product, such as an abbreviated new drug application
or a 505(b)(2) NDA relying on the finding of safety and efficacy for three years. This three-year exclusivity, however, covers
only the innovation associated with the original NDA. It does not prohibit the FDA from approving applications for drugs with
the same active ingredient but without the new innovative change. These marketing exclusivity protections do not prohibit the
FDA from approving a full NDA, even if it contains the innovative change. There is no guarantee that the FDA will grant such exclusivity
and competitors can try to seek approval of competitive products, notwithstanding the exclusivity. However, if three years of
exclusivity is afforded, it offers us one more barrier to competitor entry for a few years.</P>

505(b)(2) NDA provided by Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, allows the FDA to rely, for approval of
an NDA, on data not developed by the applicant. Such an NDA, referred to as a 505(b)(2) application contains full reports of investigations
of safety and effectiveness, but where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted
by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. Such applications permit approval of
applications other than those for duplicate products and permit reliance for such approvals on scientific literature or an FDA
finding of safety and/or effectiveness for a previously approved drug product. While each application is different, these types
of applications will typically require bridging studies (to support the change or modification from the listed drug) and could
require clinical data to support the modification of the already-approved drug product.</P>

applicant to certify as to any patents that claim the drug for which a claim of patent infringement could be made. In certain cases,
the applicant of the NDA with a patent certification must provide notice to the patent holder, which can lead to a patent infringement
lawsuit, thereby delaying the FDA approval of the competitor product for up to 30 months, separate from any traditional patent
infringement litigation delay. Similarly, if the competitor has its own market exclusivity, this can delay approval of the product.
However, if a product obtains exclusivity or patent protection, it can delay entry of competitors for several years.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">There are a number of statutory exceptions
and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain business arrangements from prosecution under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute.
These statutory exceptions and safe harbors set forth provisions that, if all their applicable requirements are met, will assure
healthcare providers and other parties that they may not be prosecuted under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. The failure of
a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within one or more applicable statutory exceptions or safe harbors does not necessarily
mean that it is <I>per se</I> illegal or that prosecution will be pursued. However, conduct and business arrangements that do not
fully satisfy all requirements of an applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities
and will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Additionally,
the intent standard under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute was amended under the Affordable Care Act, to a stricter standard such
that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have
committed a violation. The Affordable Care Act provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services
resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal
civil False Claims Act, which is discussed below.</P>

among other things, persons or entities from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented a false or fraudulent claim to, or
the knowing use of false statements to obtain payment from or approval by, the federal government. Suits filed under the federal
civil False Claims Act, known as &ldquo;qui tam&rdquo; actions, can be brought by any individual on behalf of the government. These
individuals, sometimes known as &ldquo;relators&rdquo; or, more commonly, as &ldquo;whistleblowers&rdquo;, may share in any amounts
paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. The number of filings of qui tam actions has increased significantly
in recent years, causing more healthcare companies to have to defend a case brought under the federal civil False Claim Act. If
an entity is determined to have violated the federal civil False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual
damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties for each separate false claim. Many comparable state laws are broader
in scope and apply to all payors, and therefore, are not limited to only those claims submitted to the federal government.</P>

law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively,
the &ldquo;ACA&rdquo;), which has the potential to substantially change healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental
and private insurers, and significantly impact the drug and medical device industries. The ACA will impact existing government
healthcare programs and will result in the development of new programs. The ACA&rsquo;s provisions of importance include, but are
not limited to, a deductible 2.3% excise tax on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices offered for sale in the
Unites States, with limited exceptions, effective January 1, 2013.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">In addition, the ACA and its implementing
regulations, among other things, revised the methodology for calculation of rebates owed by manufacturers to the state and federal
government for covered outpatient drugs and certain biologics, including AD04 or any future product candidates, under the Medicaid
Drug Rebate Program, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program,
extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations,
subjected manufacturers to new annual fees and taxes for certain branded prescription drugs, and provided incentives to programs
that increase the federal government&rsquo;s comparative effectiveness research.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Other legislative changes have been proposed
and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among
other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with
recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required
goals, thereby triggering the legislation&rsquo;s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions
of Medicare payments to providers up to 2% per fiscal year. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer
Relief Act of 2012 (the &ldquo;ATRA&rdquo;) which delayed for another two months the budget cuts mandated by these sequestration
provisions of the Budget Control Act of 2011. In March 2013, the President signed an executive order implementing sequestration,
and in April 2013, the 2% Medicare payment reductions went into effect. The ATRA also, among other things, reduced Medicare payments
to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations
period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">In addition, Congress often uses the Medicare
program for pay for legislation. For example, on April 16, 2015, President Obama signed into law the &ldquo;Medicare Access and
CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015&rdquo; (&ldquo;MACRA&rdquo;). MACRA repealed the Medicare sustainable growth rate formula that
had been used to determine payment levels under the Medicare physician fee schedule (&ldquo;PFS&rdquo;), and established a new
method to update payments for physicians and other providers paid under the PFS. Congress reduced Medicare payments for several
categories of providers and made changes to Medicare policies to offset the cost of the bill. It is possible that future legislation
and regulations may include Medicare payment reductions or policy changes that result in reduced payments, increased burdens or
increased operating costs.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The full impact of the ACA, as well as
other laws and reform measures that may be proposed and adopted in the future, remains uncertain, but may continue the downward
pressure on medical device pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating
costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business operations. Efforts to significantly amend or repeal the ACA
continue and if passed could have a significant impact on important aspects of our business including medical device and drug pricing,
Medicare payment reductions or policy changes that result in reduced payments, or increased burdens or operating costs.</P>

company that is focused on the discovery and development of medications for the treatment of addictions and related disorders of
AUD in patients with certain targeted genotypes. We have a limited operating history. Investment in biopharmaceutical product development
is highly speculative because it entails substantial upfront capital expenditures and significant risk that any potential product
candidate will fail to demonstrate adequate effect or an acceptable safety profile, gain regulatory approval and become commercially
viable. We have no products approved for commercial sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales to date, and we
continue to incur significant research and development and other expenses related to our ongoing operations. To date, we have not
generated positive cash flow, revenues, or profitable operations, nor do we expect to in the foreseeable future. Through December
31, 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $12.0 million and through December 31, 2017, we had an accumulated deficit
of approximately $0.4 million (both net of reclassification of its accumulated deficit prior to reincorporation of approximately
$10.7 million to Additional paid in capital on reincorporation).</P>

expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business. The size of our
future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of future growth of our expenses and our ability to generate revenue. Our prior
losses and expected future losses have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders&rsquo; equity and working

pace than expected, including changes in and progress of our development activities, acquisitions of additional candidates and
changes in regulation. Moreover, preclinical and clinical testing may not start or be completed as we forecast and may not achieve
the desired results. Therefore, we expect to seek additional sources of funding, such as additional financing, grant funding or

acceptance of our proposed business and lead product, under-capitalization, cash shortages, limitations with respect to personnel,
financing and other resources, competition from better funded and experienced companies, and uncertainty of our ability to generate
revenues. In fact, though individual team members have experience running clinical trials, as a company we have yet to prove that
we can successfully run a clinical trial. There is no assurance that our activities will be successful or will result in any revenues
or profit, and the likelihood of our success must be considered in light of the stage of our development. In addition, no assurance
can be given that we will be able to consummate our business strategy and plans, or that financial, technological, market, or other
limitations may force us to modify, alter, significantly delay, or significantly impede the implementation of such plans. We have
insufficient results for investors to use to identify historical trends. Investors should consider our prospects in light of the
risk, expenses and difficulties we will encounter as an early stage company. Our revenue and income potential is unproven and our
business model is continually evolving. We are subject to the risks inherent to the operation of a new business enterprise, and
cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully address these risks.</P>

substantial doubt that we could continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months after issuance of their report based
on our current development plans and our operating requirements and us having suffered recurring losses from operations and having
a net capital deficiency. Although the funds raised as a result of the completion of our IPO and the receipt of proceeds from the
exercise of warrants have sustained our operations through 2018, based on our current development plans and operating requirements,
we project that, without additional capital, we will have fully expended our funds in the third quarter of 2019. Our financial
statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty. If we cannot raise the necessary
capital to continue as a viable entity, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business and our stockholders may

to be able to complete our initial phase 3 clinical trial, which we anticipate will cost $7.5 million. We expect to $3.0 of those
cost to be met from funds derived from the IPO and proceeds from warrant exercises. In addition, we could be forced to delay, discontinue
or curtail product development, forego sales and marketing efforts, and forego licensing in attractive business opportunities.
Unless we secure additional financing, we will be unable to fund completion of our second Phase 3 clinical trial with AD04. We
require approximately $4.5 million to fund completion of our first Phase 3 clinical trial, and will require additional funding
for additional Phase 3 clinical trials.</P>

this annual report on form 10-K will not be sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve months, given current expectations.
We will, however, require additional financing as we continue to execute our business strategy, including that we will require
additional funds in order to complete our initial phase 3 clinical trial and additional phase 3 trials of AD04, as well as any
additional clinical trials or other development of any products we may acquire or license. Our liquidity may be negatively impacted
as a result of a research and development cost increases in addition to general economic and industry factors. We anticipate that,
to the extent that we require additional liquidity, it will be funded through the incurrence of other indebtedness, additional
equity financings or a combination of these potential sources of liquidity. In addition, we may raise additional funds to finance
future cash needs through grant funding and/or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements. If we raise additional funds
by issuing equity securities or convertible debt, our stockholders will experience dilution. Debt financing, if available, would
result in increased fixed payment obligations and may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability
to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional
funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties, it may be necessary to relinquish valuable rights to
our products, future revenue streams or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. The covenants
under future credit facilities may limit our ability to obtain additional debt financing. We cannot be certain that additional
funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Any failure to raise capital in the future could have a negative impact
on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategies.</P>

at this time, may be from the sale of equity or convertible or other debt securities in a public or private offering, from a credit
facility or strategic partnership coupled with an investment in us or a combination of both. Our ability to raise capital through
the sale of equity may be limited by the various rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &ldquo;SEC&rdquo;) and The
NASDAQ Capital Market, which place limits on the number of shares of stock that may be sold. Equity issuances would have a dilutive
effect on our stockholders. We may be unable to raise sufficient additional financing on terms that are acceptable to us, if at
all. Our failure to raise additional capital and in sufficient amounts may significantly impact our ability to expand our business.

are currently planning a Phase 3 clinical trial with approximately 300 patients in Scandinavia and Central and Eastern Europe,
which will target the reduction of risk drinking (heavy drinking of alcohol) in subjects that possess selected genetics of the

the U.S. or Europe for AUD and additional development activity, including, without limitation, clinical trials, in order to seek
approval for the use of AD04 to treat any other indications (e.g., such as opioid use disorder, gambling addiction, smoking cessation,
and other drug addictions). In addition, because AD04 is our most advanced product candidate and there is limited history information

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Ondansetron, the active pharmaceutical
ingredient (&ldquo;API&rdquo;) of our current drug treatment, was granted FDA approval as Zofran<SUP>&reg; </SUP>in January 1991
and is approved in many foreign markets. Ondansetron, is commercially available in generic form, but not available: (i) at the
formulation/dosage levels expected to be marketed by us, or (ii) with a requirement to use a diagnostic biomarker, as we expect
to be the case with AD04. Although ondansetron has been approved to treat nausea and emesis it has not been approved to treat AUD
and it has not been approved for daily long-term use as planned by us. Clinical testing to date of ondansetron at the higher doses
used to treat nausea/emesis have not shown effectiveness in treating AUD or any other addictive disorder; however, if a third party
conducted a Phase 3 clinical program and showed success treating AUD at those doses, we could not prevent such third party from
marketing ondansetron for AUD at those doses.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Results from clinical studies suggest that
high intravenous doses of ondansetron may affect the electrical activity of the heart. In a Drug Safety Communication dated June
29, 2012, the FDA stated that: &ldquo;A 32 mg single intravenous dose of ondansetron (Zofran, ondansetron hydrochloride, and generics)
may affect the electrical activity of the heart (QT interval prolongation), which could pre-dispose patients to develop an abnormal
and potentially fatal heart rhythm known as Torsades de Pointes.&rdquo; In addition: &ldquo;No single intravenous dose should exceed
16 mg.&rdquo; There are also several recent lawsuits claiming that Zofran<SUP>&reg; </SUP>used for the unapproved use of morning
sickness causes birth defects. Although we do not believe that our dosage will cause such adverse event there can be no assurance
that the negative side effects of the generic drug that have been found in higher dosages will not occur in our dosage or otherwise
deter potential users of our product candidate and adversely impact sales of our product candidate. If we were to be required to
have such a warning on our drug label, patients may be deterred from using our product candidates.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">In addition, we also face the risk, that
doctors will prescribe off label, the generic form of ondansetron to treat AUD despite the different dosage of ondansetron in the
generic form from that in AD04, the lack of demonstrated clinical efficacy against AUD at the currently available doses (i.e.,
the Zofran<SUP>&reg;</SUP> and approved generics), and the potential safety concerns if the currently available/higher doses are
taken chronically as would be needed for AUD or other addictions. Physicians, or their patients, could divide the lowest dose existing
oral tablet into more than ten parts to approximate the necessary AD04 dosage.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Although we believe that any attempt by
competitors to reformulate and market ondansetron at our intended dosage levels, while technically feasible, infringes on our intellectual
property rights, and should, accordingly, be actionable, we cannot give assurances that we would be successful in defending our
rights or that we will have access to sufficient funds necessary to successfully prosecute any such violations of, or infringements
on, our intellectual property rights. Additionally, we cannot ensure investors that other companies will not discover and seek
to commercialize low doses of ondansetron, not currently available, for other indications.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Studies of Zofran<SUP>&reg;</SUP> conducted
as part of its FDA and other regulatory agencies review process found that the drug is well-tolerated and results in few adverse
side effects at dosages almost 100 times the dosage expected to be formulated in AD04. However, to the best of our knowledge, no
comprehensive clinical study has been performed to date that has evaluated the safety profile of ondansetron for long-term use.
We expect the FDA will require us to provide safety data in at least 100 patients for 12 months, and can offer no assurances that
safety results of these long term use studies will lead to any subsequent approval for long-term use. There can be no assurance
that long-term usage of ondansetron, at dosages anticipated by us, will be safe. Though the FDA has stated it will not require
additional non-clinical testing nor will it require a QT interval prolongation clinical study, such statements by the FDA are not
legally binding on the agency.</P>

have not yet been demonstrated in clinical trials for our investigational product candidate. Favorable results in early studies
or trials may not be repeated in later studies or trials. Even if our clinical trials are initiated and completed as planned, we
cannot be certain that the results will support our product candidate claims. Success in preclinical testing and early clinical
trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful. We cannot be sure that the results of later clinical trials
would replicate the results of prior clinical trials and preclinical testing, nor that they would satisfy the requirements of the
FDA or other regulatory agencies. Clinical trials may fail to demonstrate that our product candidate is safe for humans and effective
for indicated uses. Preclinical and clinical results are frequently susceptible to varying interpretations that may delay, limit
or prevent regulatory approvals or commercialization. Any delay in, or termination of, our clinical trials would delay our obtaining
FDA or EMA approval for the affected product candidate and, ultimately, our ability to commercialize that product candidate.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Previous clinical trials using ondansetron
have had different trial designs, doses, parameters and endpoints than the planned Phase 3 clinical trial that is expected to serve
as a basis for approval of AD04. Though various doses of ondansetron have been tested as treatments for alcohol addiction (Johnson,
BA et al., 2011; Johnson, BA et al., 2000; Kranzler et al, 2003; Sellers, EM et al., 1994), the 283-patient Phase 2b clinical trial
on which we are largely basing our clinical expectations only tested one dosing regimen, which was weight-based (Johnson, BA et
al., 2011). We plan to use a fixed dose in future clinical trials that we believe provides good coverage given the dose ranges
tested clinically; however, it is possible that the dose selected will not be the optimal dose and so drug effects may be limited
or not be demonstrated sufficiently in clinical testing. Additionally, only one genotype in the genetic panel that will be used
to define patients that are genotype positive for treatment with AD04 was used in primary analyses of the Phase 2b trial and three
of the genotypes were added to the panel after a retrospective exploratory analysis of the Phase 2b data. The genotype in the panel
related to the 5-HTT, that was included in the primary analysis (Johnson, BA et al., 2011) appears to make up about half of the
patients that are genotype positive. The three genotypes related to modulation of the 5-HT3 receptor were selected based on a retrospective
analysis that was constrained to 18 single-nucleotide polymorphism (&ldquo;SNPs&rdquo;) identified for analysis (Johnson, BA et
al., 2013). Therefore, confidence in the effects of the 5-HT3 genetics is less than that for the 5-HTT genetics, and this could
negatively impact the treatment effect of AD04 in the Phase 3 for a segment of the patients identified as genotype positive, which
could dilute the overall demonstrated effect of AD04 in the trial.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The endpoints for the Phase 2b clinical
trial of AD04 were reduction in the severity of drinking, measured as drinks per day of drinking alcohol and reduction frequency
of drinking, measured by days of total abstinence from alcohol. These are surrogate endpoints for the endpoints expected to be
required for approval, which, for Europe, are expected to be reduction of heavy drinking days (defined herein), measured in percentage
of heavy drinking days per month, and total average alcohol consumed per month, and, for the United States, is expected to be the
percentage of patients that have no heavy drinking days in the final 2 months of a six month treatment regimen of AD04. Though
the Phase 2b trial showed a statistically significant effect against both pre-specified endpoints and when analyzed for reducing
heavy drinking days, all when compared against the placebo group, it is possible that AD04 could affect the endpoints of the Phase
2b trial while not demonstrating a strong enough effect to gain approval.</P>

in duration, including a one week placebo run-in period, and the Phase 3 trials expected to be required for approval will be 24
weeks. Though the effect of AD04 against AUD in the Phase 2b trial appeared to begin in the first month of the trial and appeared
durable throughout the trial, we cannot be sure the effect will extend for the duration of the Phase 3 trials.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The FDA has indicated to us that a comparison
of the percent of patients with no heavy drinking days in the last two months of a six month clinical trial between the drug and
placebo groups will be a satisfactory endpoint for determination of a successful Phase 3 trial of AD04 and has published the draft
guidance <I>Alcoholism: Developing Drugs for Treatment Guidance for Industry</I> dated February 2015 indicating this endpoint for
the development of drugs for AUD. Similarly, the EMA has in the past accepted the co-primary endpoints of reduction from baseline
in days of heavy drinking and reduction total grams of alcohol consumed per month and has published the <I>Guideline on the development
of medicinal products for the treatment of alcohol dependence</I> on February 18, 2010 stating these endpoints as approvable endpoints
for alcohol addiction treatment. Despite these indications, neither the FDA nor the EMA is bound to accept the stated endpoint
if a new drug application for AD04 is submitted and their definitions of a heavy drinking day may change. We, however, can offer
no assurance that the FDA or EMA will approve our primary endpoints, that we can achieve success at the any endpoints they do approve,
or that these potential benefits will subsequently be realized.</P>

has stated that it would not object to the AD04 Phase 3 clinical trials going forward without including these additional subjects,
the FDA has indicated that some research in this area may be required prior to approval of AD04 for AUD within the marker negative population.
We believe the data supports our hypothesis that no further studies in genotype negative patients need be conducted. However, the
FDA has indicated that any approval based on a trial only in genotype positive subjects would result in labeling restricted to
treating patients that are genotype positive. If further studies are required, we will incur additional costs not anticipated,
and it could delay approval of AD04 or, if the results of such studies are not positive for AD04, it may result in AD04 not being
approved or it may result in AD04&rsquo;s patents failing to protect AD04 against generic competition.</P>

The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data in pediatric subjects, and we intend to apply for
such a waiver. If the FDA requires data in pediatric patients, the required studies could delay approval of AD04, requiring significantly
more capital be invested, and, if the results of such studies are not positive for AD04 it may result in AD04 not being approved.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Treatment with AD04 will be dependent on
identification of patients with a genetic test (i.e., a companion diagnostic). Companion diagnostics and complementary diagnostics
are regulated as medical devices by the FDA and, as such, require either clearance or approval prior to commercialization. While
the technology for the test we plan to use is well established, it cannot be certain the testing laboratory we set up will be able
to conduct the test with the selectivity and sensitivity that will be required or that the genetic test will be approved by FDA
for such use, which could increase the time and cost to develop AD04 and possibly prevent marketing approval. While we have been
party to a joint meeting with the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (&ldquo;CDER&rdquo;, the FDA division responsible for
drug approvals) and the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (&ldquo;CDRH&rdquo;, the FDA division responsible for device
approvals, including genetic tests) at which agreement was reached as to the development path for the genetic test, neither CDER
nor CDRH is bound to accept our planned submission package even if the data is positive. We have been instructed by CDER and CDRH
that we need to obtain a separate approval or marketing authorization for the companion diagnostic genetic test from CDRH. We plan
to collect and store additional blood samples from all patients enrolled in the Phase 3 trial in the event of any difficulties,
however, we cannot be certain we can overcome all of the technological, logistical or regulatory hurdles related to the genetic
testing, which include, without limitation, technical validation of the test (e.g. specificity, sensitivity, reproducibility, robustness
of methods), clinical validation acceptable to CDER and CDRH, all of which are needed for approval of AD04 and its companion diagnostic
genetic test. Failure in any of these areas could delay approval of AD04, increase the cost necessary to achieve approval of AD04

test, we currently plan to distribute the genetic test as widely as possible to third party testing companies with limited attention
to capitalizing on the revenue potential of the genetic test itself in order to achieve wider availability of the genetic test
to drive market uptake of AD04. However, we cannot be sure that third party testing companies will be willing to provide the test,
that reimbursement for the test will be available to make such business profitable, or that taking a genetic test will be acceptable
to patients or physicians. Additionally, our plans may change so that we attempt to make the test a material business of our own.
In this event, the availability of the genetic test in the market could be reduced, limiting market uptake of AD04, the testing
business could fail, and we could be in a position where it never reaches profitability. As one of our products/services, the genetic
test will be subject to all of the risks stated elsewhere herein related to reimbursement of our products and failure to achieve
adequate reimbursement could limit the potential sales of both the genetic test and AD04, and there is no assurance that the diagnostic
will be approved or authorized for marketing.</P>

high rate of attrition from the failure of product candidates proceeding through clinical trials. Product candidates in later stages
of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy profile despite having progressed through preclinical studies

product candidate AD04 was completed by the University of Virginia in 2008. Although we intend to commence our Phase 3 clinical
trial, our inability to locate and enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients in our future Phase 3 clinical trials would
result in significant delays or may require us to abandon one or more clinical trials. Retention of subjects in clinical trials
related to AUD can be challenging relative to trials in some other indications due to the nature of the target population. Our
ability to enroll patients in trials is affected by many factors out of our control including the size and nature of the patient
population, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the trial, the design of the clinical trial,
the prevalence and successful recruiting of patients that are genotype positive, competing clinical trials, and clinicians&rsquo;
and patients&rsquo; perceptions as to the potential advantages of the drug being studied in relation to other available therapies,
including any new drugs that may be approved for the indications we are investigating. Due to the use of a biomarker to determine
enrollment in our Phase 3 clinical trial, we will have a limited population of patients to draw from for our Phase 3 clinical trials.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The FDA had agreed to review our IND filing
prior to completion of the development of our manufacturing plan and production of our clinical supply so that we could proceed
more quickly once our Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (&ldquo;CMC&rdquo;) submission was ready but with the understanding
that we would be on clinical hold pending a satisfactory CMC submission. We then filed our IND without a complete CMC submission,
placing a voluntary clinical hold on our program as part of our IND filing pending the filing of a satisfactory CMC submission.
The clinical hold was confirmed by the FDA pending receipt of a satisfactory CMC submission. We have since completed our CMC development
and manufactured clinical supply for the planned Phase 3 trial, and believe we currently have the capability to file a satisfactory
CMC submission to remove the clinical hold. However, the CMC submission has not yet been made. No assurance can be given that the
CMC plan developed by us will be satisfactory to the FDA or that the clinical supply produced for use in clinical trials of AD04
will be approved for use in the trials by the FDA, either of which could result in delay of the clinical trial program and a requirement
for increased investment prior to commencement of clinical trials.</P>

to rapid and substantial technological change. Technological competition in the industry from pharmaceutical and biotechnology
companies, universities, governmental entities, and others diversifying into the field is intense and is expected to increase.
Many of these entities have significantly greater research and development capabilities, as well as substantially more marketing,
financial, and managerial resources than we do, and represent significant competition. Acquisitions of, or investments in, competing
biotechnology companies by large pharmaceutical companies could increase these competitors&rsquo; financial, marketing, and other
resources. We cannot assure you that developments by others will not render our products or technologies noncompetitive or that
we will be able to keep pace with technological developments. Competitors have developed, or are in the process of developing,
technologies that are, or in the future may be, the basis for competitive products. Some of these products may have an entirely
different approach or means of accomplishing similar therapeutic endpoints than products we are currently developing. These competing
products may be more effective and less costly than the products that we are developing. In addition, conventional behavioral therapies
and other treatment approaches currently in use today may continue to be used instead of, rather than in conjunction with, our

conduct additional preclinical and clinical testing or to perform post-marketing studies, as a condition to granting marketing
approval of a product. Initial acceptance by the FDA of clinical trial protocols is subject to constant review and any process
control failures could result in additional required testing. Regulatory approval of products often requires that subjects in clinical
trials be followed for long periods to assess their overall survival. The results generated after approval could result in loss
of marketing approval, changes in product labeling, and/or new or increased concerns about the side effects or efficacy of a product.
The FDA has significant post-market authority, including the explicit authority to require post-market studies and clinical trials,
labeling changes based on new safety information, and compliance with FDA-approved risk evaluation and mitigation strategies. The
FDA&rsquo;s exercise of its authority has in some cases resulted, and in the future could result, in delays or increased costs
during product development, clinical trials and regulatory review, increased costs to comply with additional post-approval regulatory
requirements and potential restrictions on sales of approved products based on labeling or other requirements.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Changes in regulatory requirements and
guidance may occur, and we may need to amend clinical trial protocols or our development plan to reflect these changes. Amendments
may require resubmitting clinical trial protocols to FDA and institutional review boards for reexamination, which may impact the
costs, timing or successful completion of a clinical trial. If we experience delays in completion of, or if we terminate any clinical
trials, the commercial prospects for product candidates may be harmed, and the ability to generate product revenues will be delayed.
In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also
ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of product candidates.</P>

any other jurisdiction, and a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one jurisdiction may have a negative effect
on the regulatory approval process in others. For example, even if the FDA grants marketing approval of a product candidate, comparable
regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions must also approve the manufacturing, marketing and promotion of the product candidate
in those countries. Approval procedures vary among jurisdictions and can involve requirements and administrative review periods
different from, and greater than, those in the United States, including additional preclinical studies or clinical trials, as clinical
studies conducted in one jurisdiction may not be accepted by or sufficient for regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions. In
many jurisdictions outside the United States, a product candidate must be approved for reimbursement before it can be approved
for sale in that jurisdiction. In some cases, the price that we intend to charge for our candidate products is also subject to
approval. Additionally, some foreign jurisdictions require participation of subjects from their country in the Phase 3 trial in
order to gain approval in their country.</P>

requirements for approval of product candidates with which we must comply prior to marketing in those jurisdictions. Obtaining
foreign regulatory approvals and compliance with foreign regulatory requirements could result in significant delays, difficulties
and costs for us and could delay or prevent the introduction of our products in certain countries. If we fail to comply with the
regulatory requirements in international markets and/or fail to receive applicable marketing approvals, our target market will
be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of AD04 or any future product candidates will be harmed.</P>

of AD04 or any future product candidates, we will be subject to ongoing regulatory obligations, such as post market surveillance
and current good manufacturing practice (&ldquo;GMP&rdquo;) requirements, and continued regulatory review, which may result in
significant additional expense. We may also be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or experience
unanticipated problems with product candidates. In addition, third parties on whom we rely must comply with regulatory requirements,
and any non-compliance on their part may negatively impact our business, assuming we obtain regulatory authorization at all.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Any regulatory approvals that we receive
for product candidates will require surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product candidate. The FDA may also
require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (&ldquo;REMS&rdquo;) program in order to approve product candidates, which could
entail requirements for a medication guide, physician communication plans or additional elements to ensure safe use, such as restricted
distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA could also require a boxed warning, sometimes
referred to as a Black Box Warning on the product label to identify a particular safety risk, which could affect commercial efforts
to promote and sell the product. In addition, if the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority approves product candidates,
the manufacturing processes, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion, import,
export and recordkeeping for product candidates will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements. These requirements
include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration, as well as continued compliance with
current GMPs and current good clinical practices (&ldquo;GCPs&rdquo;) for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval. We
are also subject to certain user fees imposed by the regulatory agencies. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with product
candidates, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with our third-party manufacturers or manufacturing
processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things:</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">As part of the regulatory process, we must
conduct clinical trials for each product candidate to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA and other
regulatory authorities. As we advance AD04 or any future product candidates we expect that our expenses will increase. The number
and design of the clinical trials that will be required varies depending upon product candidate, the condition being evaluated,
current medical strategies and the trial results themselves. Therefore, it is difficult to accurately estimate the cost of the
clinical trials. Clinical trials are very expensive and difficult to design and implement, in part because they are subject to
rigorous regulatory requirements. The clinical trial process is also time consuming. We estimate that clinical trials of product
candidates including AD04, will take at least several years to complete. Furthermore, failure can occur at any stage of the trials,
and we could encounter problems that cause us to abandon or repeat clinical trials. The commencement and completion of clinical
trials may be delayed or prevented by several factors, including:</P>

the collaborator&rsquo;s strategic interest in the products under development and such collaborator&rsquo;s ability to successfully
market and sell any such products. We intend to pursue collaborative arrangements regarding the sales and marketing of our products,
however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to establish or maintain such collaborative arrangements, or if able to
do so, that our collaborators will have effective sales forces. To the extent that we decide not to, or are unable to, enter into
collaborative arrangements with respect to the sales and marketing of our proposed products, significant capital expenditures,
management resources and time will be required to establish and develop an in-house marketing and sales force with technical expertise.
There can also be no assurance that we will be able to establish or maintain relationships with third party collaborators or develop
in-house sales and distribution capabilities. To the extent that we depend on third parties for marketing and distribution, any
revenues we receive will depend upon the efforts of such third parties over whom we have no control, and there can be no assurance
that such efforts will be successful. In addition, there can also be no assurance that we will be able to successfully market and
sell our products in the United States or overseas on our own.</P>

on us avoiding infringement of the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. There is a substantial amount of litigation
involving patents and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, as well as administrative
proceedings for challenging patents, including interference and reexamination proceedings before the USPTO, or oppositions and
other comparable proceedings in other jurisdictions. Recently, under the American Invents Act (&ldquo;AIA&rdquo;), new procedures
including <I>inter parties</I> review and post grant review have been implemented. These procedures are relatively new and the
manner in which they are being implemented continues to evolve, which brings additional uncertainty to our licensed patents and
pending applications. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties,
exist in the fields in which we are developing product candidates. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and
more patents are issued, the risk increases that our product candidates may give rise to claims of infringement of the patent rights
of others.</P>

claims or initiate litigation related to their patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights in technology
that is important to us. The asserted claims and/or litigation could include claims against us, our licensors or our suppliers
alleging infringement of intellectual property rights with respect to our products or components of those products. Regardless
of the merit of the claims, they could be time consuming, result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management
personnel, or require us to develop a non-infringing technology or enter into license agreements. We have not undertaken an exhaustive
search to discover any third party intellectual patent rights which might be infringed by commercialization of the product candidates
described herein. Although we are not currently aware of any such third party intellectual patent rights, it is possible that such
rights currently exist or might be obtained in the future. In the event that a third party controls such rights and we are unable
to obtain a license to such rights on commercially reasonable terms, we may not be able to sell or continue to develop our products,
and may be liable for damages for such infringement. We cannot assure you that licenses will be available on acceptable terms,
if at all. Furthermore, because of the potential for significant damage awards, which are not necessarily predictable, it is not
unusual to find even arguably unmeritorious claims resulting in large settlements. If any infringement or other intellectual property
claim made against us by any third party is successful, or if we fail to develop non-infringing technology or license the proprietary

If such products are not covered and reimbursed then patients may be responsible for the entire cost of the product, which can

payors in order to avoid subjecting their patients to such financial liability. The existence of adequate coverage and reimbursement

and some state Medicaid programs may not pay an adequate amount for AD04 or any of our other products or may make no payment at
all. Furthermore, the health care industry in the United States has experienced a trend toward cost containment as government and
private insurers seek to control health care costs by imposing lower payment rates and negotiating reduced contract rates with
service providers. Therefore, we cannot be certain that our services will be reimbursed at a level that is sufficient to meet our
costs.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Obtaining coverage and reimbursement approval
of a product from a government or other third-party payor is a time-consuming and costly process that could require us to provide
to the payor supporting scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data for the use of our products. Even if we obtain coverage
for a given product, the resulting reimbursement payment rates might not be adequate for us to achieve or sustain profitability
or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high. Patients are unlikely to use AD04 or any future product candidates
unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of AD04 or any future product
candidates.</P>

more foreign jurisdictions for AD04 or any future product candidates, we will be subject to rules and regulations in those jurisdictions.
In some foreign countries, particularly those in the European Union, the pricing of drugs is subject to governmental control. In
these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after obtaining marketing approval
of a product candidate. In addition, market acceptance and sales of product candidates will depend significantly on the availability
of adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors for product candidates and may be affected by existing and future
health care reform measures.</P>

the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the health
care system that could impact our ability to sell our products profitably. In particular, in 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable
Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act (collectively, the &ldquo;Healthcare Reform
Act&rdquo;), was enacted. The Healthcare Reform Act and its implementing regulations, among other things, revised the methodology
by which rebates owed by manufacturers to the state and federal government for covered outpatient drugs, including product candidates,
under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under
the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled
in Medicaid managed care organizations, subjected manufacturers to new annual fees and taxes for certain branded prescription drugs,
and provided incentives to programs that increase the federal government&rsquo;s comparative effectiveness research.</P>

and adopted in the United States since the Healthcare Reform Act was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among
other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with
recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required
goals, thereby triggering the legislation&rsquo;s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions
of Medicare payments to providers up to 2% per fiscal year. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer
Relief Act of 2012 (the &ldquo;ATRA&rdquo;) which delayed for another two months the budget cuts mandated by these sequestration
provisions of the Budget Control Act of 2011. In March 2013, the President signed an executive order implementing sequestration,
and in April 2013, the 2% Medicare payment reductions went into effect. The ATRA also, among other things, reduced Medicare payments
to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations
period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Use of our product candidate will require
pre-treatment screening. Our strategy for AD04 aims to integrate pre-treatment screening into the drug label, effectively creating
a patient-specific or &ldquo;precision&rdquo; treatment into one integrated therapeutic offering. Our ability to generate revenue
will depend upon the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement for our tests from third-party payors, including government
programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, private insurance plans and managed care programs. Health care providers that order diagnostic
services generally expect that those diagnostic services are covered and reimbursed by third-party payors for all or part of the

patients may be responsible for the entire cost of the test, which can be substantial. Therefore, health care providers generally
do not order tests that are not covered and reimbursed by third-party payors in order to avoid subjecting their patients to such
financial liability. The existence of adequate coverage and reimbursement for the procedures performed by us by government and
private insurance plans is central to the acceptance of our product candidate. During the past several years, third-party payors
have undertaken cost-containment initiatives including different payment methods, monitoring health care expenditures, and anti-fraud
initiatives. In addition, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, or CMS, which administers the Medicare program, has
taken the position that the algorithm portion of multi-analyst algorithmic assays, or MAAAs, is not a clinical laboratory test
and is therefore not reimbursable under the Medicare program. Although this position is only applicable to tests with a CMS determined
national payment amount, it is possible that the local MACs, who make coverage and payment determinations for tests such as ours
may adopt this policy and reduce payment for such test. If that were to happen, reimbursement for our pre-screening tests would
be uncertain. We may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability if third-party payors deny coverage or reduce their current
levels of payment, or if our costs of production increase faster than increases in reimbursement levels. Further, many private
payors use coverage decisions and payment amounts determined by CMS as guidelines in setting their coverage and reimbursement policies.
Future action by CMS or other government agencies may diminish payments to clinical laboratories, physicians, outpatient centers
and/or hospitals. Those private payors that do not follow the Medicare guidelines may adopt different coverage and reimbursement
policies for us and coverage and the amount of reimbursement under those polices is uncertain. For some governmental programs,
such as Medicaid, coverage and reimbursement differ from state to state, and some state Medicaid programs may not pay an adequate
amount for MyPRS <SUP>&reg;</SUP> or may make no payment at all. As the portion of the U.S. population over the age of 65 and eligible
for Medicare continues to grow, we may be more vulnerable to coverage and reimbursement limitations imposed by CMS. Furthermore,
the health care industry in the United States has experienced a general trend toward cost containment as government and private
insurers seek to control health care costs through various mechanisms, including imposing limitations on payment rates and negotiating

recession and stagnant economy for more than a decade. Additionally, political changes in the U.S. and elsewhere in the world have
created a level of uncertainty in the markets. If the economic climate does not improve or deteriorate, our business, as well as

and The NASDAQ Capital Market and biopharmaceutical companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations
that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Broad market and industry factors
may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. If the market price
of our common stock does not exceed the offering price, investors in our public offering may not realize any return on their investment
in us and may lose some or all of their investment. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against
companies following periods of volatility in the market price of a company&rsquo;s securities. This type of litigation, if instituted,
could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management&rsquo;s attention and resources, which would harm our business,
operating results or financial condition.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Our cash requirements may vary from
those now planned depending upon numerous factors, including the result of future research and development activities. The
proceeds derived from the sale of the shares in our initial public offering did not provide us with sufficient working
capital to fund completion of our first Phase 3 clinical trial with AD04 conducted in Scandinavia and Central and Eastern
Europe. As a result, we require additional funds to complete our first Phase 3 clinical trial and will require
additional funds in the future to conduct additional clinical trials. There are no other commitments by any person for future
financing. Though we believe a successful Phase 3 trial will be a significant value creation event for us, our securities may
be offered to other investors at a price lower than the price per share on The NASDAQ Capital Market, or upon terms which may
be deemed more favorable than offered previously, including in the IPO. In addition, the issuance of securities in any future
financing using our securities may dilute an investor&rsquo;s equity ownership. Moreover, we may issue derivative securities,
including options and/or warrants, from time to time, to procure qualified personnel or for other business reasons. The
issuance of any such derivative securities, which is at the discretion of our board of directors, may further dilute the
equity ownership of our stockholders. No assurance can be given as to our ability to procure additional financing, if
required, and on terms deemed favorable to us. To the extent additional capital is required and cannot be raised
successfully, we may then have to limit our then current operations and/or may have to curtail certain, if not all, of our

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">If our common stock is no longer listed
on The NASDAQ Capital Market and becomes traded on a securities market or exchange which is not registered as a national securities
exchange with the SEC under Section 6 of the Exchange Act, as long as the trading price of our common stock is below $5 per share,
the open-market trading of our common stock will be subject to the &ldquo;penny stock&rdquo; rules, unless we otherwise qualify
for an exemption from the &ldquo;penny stock&rdquo; definition. The &ldquo;penny stock&rdquo; rules impose additional sales practice
requirements on certain broker-dealers who sell securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors
(generally those with assets in excess of $1.0 million or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 together with their spouse).
These regulations, if they apply, require the delivery, prior to any transaction involving a penny stock, of a disclosure schedule
explaining the penny stock market and the associated risks. Under these regulations, certain brokers who recommend such securities
to persons other than established customers or certain accredited investors must make a special written suitability determination
regarding such a purchaser and receive such purchaser&rsquo;s written agreement to a transaction prior to sale. These regulations
may have the effect of limiting the trading activity of our common stock, reducing the liquidity of an investment in our common
stock and increasing the transaction costs for sales and purchases of our common stock as compared to other securities. The stock
market in general and the market prices for penny stock companies in particular, have experienced volatility that often has been
unrelated to the operating performance of such companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the
price of our stock, regardless of our operating performance. Stockholders should be aware that, according to SEC Release No. 34-29093,
the market for penny stocks has suffered in recent years from patterns of fraud and abuse. Such patterns include: (i) control of
the market for the security by one or a few broker-dealers that are often related to the promoter or issuer; (ii) manipulation
of prices through prearranged matching of purchases and sales and false and misleading press releases; (iii) boiler room practices
involving high-pressure sales tactics and unrealistic price projections by inexperienced sales persons; (iv)&nbsp;excessive and
undisclosed bid-ask differential and markups by selling broker-dealers; and (v) the wholesale dumping of the same securities by
promoters and broker-dealers after prices have been manipulated to a desired level, along with the resulting inevitable collapse
of those prices and with consequent investor losses. The occurrence of these patterns or practices could increase the volatility
of our share price.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical
company focused on the development of a therapeutic agent for the treatment of alcohol use disorder (&ldquo;AUD&rdquo;) using our
lead investigational new drug product, AD04, a selective serotonin-3 antagonist (i.e., a &ldquo;5-HT3 antagonist&rdquo;). The active
ingredient in AD04 is ondansetron, which is also the active ingredient in Zofran<SUP>&reg; </SUP>, an approved drug for treating
nausea and emesis. AUD is characterized by an urge to consume alcohol and an inability to control the levels of consumption. We
intend to commence a Phase 3 clinical trial using AD04 for the potential treatment of AUD in subjects with certain target genotypes.
We believe our approach is unique in that it targets the serotonin system and individualizes the treatment of AUD, through the
use of genetic screening. We have created an investigational companion diagnostic biomarker test for the genetic screening of patients
with certain biomarkers that, as reported in the <I>American Journal of Psychiatry </I>(Johnson, et. al. 2011&nbsp;&amp; 2013),
we believe will benefit from treatment with AD04. Our strategy is to integrate the pre-treatment genetic screening into AD04&rsquo;s
label to create a patient-specific treatment in one integrated therapeutic offering. Our goal is to develop a genetically targeted,
effective and safe product candidate to treat AUD that does not require abstinence as part of the treatment.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">We have a worldwide, exclusive license
from the University of Virginia Patent Foundation (d.b.a the Licensing&nbsp;&amp; Venture Group) (&ldquo;UVA LVG&rdquo;), which
is the licensing arm of the University of Virginia, to commercialize our investigational drug candidate, AD04, subject to Food
and Drug Administration (&ldquo;FDA&rdquo;) approval of the product, based upon three separate patents and patent application families,
with patents issued in over 40 jurisdictions, including three issued patents in the U.S. Our investigational agent has been used
in several investigator-sponsored trials and we possess or have rights to use toxicology, pharmacokinetic and other preclinical
and clinical data that supports our Phase 3 clinical trial. Our therapeutic agent was the product candidate used in a University
of Virginia investigator sponsored Phase 2b clinical trial of 283 patients. In this Phase 2b clinical trial, ultra-low dose ondansetron,
the active pharmaceutical agent in AD04, showed a statistically significant difference between ondansetron and placebo for both
the primary endpoint and secondary endpoint, which were reduction in severity of drinking measured in drinks per drinking day (1.71
drinks/drinking day; p=0.0042), and reduction in frequency of drinking measured in days of abstinence/no drinking (11.56%; p=0.0352),
respectively. Additionally, and importantly, the Phase 2b results showed a significant decrease in the percentage of heavy drinking
days (11.08%; p=0.0445) with a &ldquo;heavy drinking day&rdquo; defined as a day with four (4) or more alcoholic drinks for women
or five (5) or more alcoholic drinks for men consumed in the same day.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The active pharmaceutical agent in AD04,
our lead investigational new drug product, is ondansetron (the active ingredient in Zofran<SUP>&reg;</SUP>), which was granted
FDA approval in 1991 for nausea and vomiting post-operatively and after chemotherapy or radiation treatment and is now commercially
available in generic form. In studies of Zofran <SUP>&reg;</SUP> conducted as part of its FDA review process, ondansetron was given
acutely at dosages up to almost 100 times the dosage expected to be formulated in AD04 with the highest doses of Zofran<SUP>&reg;</SUP>
given intravenously (&ldquo;i.v.&rdquo;), which results in approximately 160% of the exposure level as oral dosing. Even at high
doses given i.v. the studies found that ondansetron is well-tolerated and results in few adverse side effects at the currently
marketed doses, which reach more than 80 times the exposure levels of the AD04 dose and are given i.v. The formulation dosage of
ondansetron used in our drug candidate (and expected to be used by us in our Phase 3 clinical trials) has the potential advantage
that it contains a much lower concentration of ondansetron than the generic formulation/dosage that has been used in prior clinical
trials, is dosed orally, and is available with use of a companion diagnostic biomarker. Our development plan for AD04 is designed
to demonstrate both the efficacy of AD04 in the genetically targeted population and the safety of ondansetron when administered
chronically at the AD04 dosage. However, to the best of our knowledge, no comprehensive clinical study has been performed to date

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">According to the National Institute
of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (the &ldquo;NIAAA&rdquo;) and the Journal of the American Medical Association
(&ldquo;JAMA&rdquo;), in the United States alone, approximately 35 million people each year have AUD (such number is based
upon the 2012 data provided in Grant et. al. the JAMA 2015 publication and has been adjusted to reflect a compound annual
growth rate of 1.13%, which is the growth rate reported by U.S. Census Bureau for the general adult population from
2012-2017), resulting in significant health, social and financial costs with excessive alcohol use being the third leading
cause of preventable death and is responsible for 31% of driving fatalities in the United States (NIAAA Alcohol Facts &amp;
Statistics). AUD contributes to over 200 different diseases and 10% of children live with a person that has an alcohol
problem. According to the American Society of Clinical Oncologists, 5-6% of new cancers and cancer deaths globally are
directly attributable to alcohol. And, <I>The Lancet</I> published that alcohol is the leading cause of death in people ages
15-49 both in the U.S. and globally. The Centers for Disease Control (the &ldquo;CDC&rdquo;) has reported that AUD costs the
U.S. economy about $250 billion annually, with heavy drinking accounting for greater than 75% of the social and health
related costs. Despite this, according to the article in the JAMA 2015 publication, only 7.7% of patients (i.e.,
approximately 2.7 million people) with AUD are estimated to have been treated in any way and only 3.6% by a physician (i.e.,
approximately 1.3 million people). In addition, according to the JAMA 2017 publication, the problem in the United States appears to be
growing with almost a 50% increase in AUD prevalence between 2002 and 2013.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">We have devoted substantially all of our
resources to development efforts relating to AD04, including preparation for conducting clinical trials, providing general and
administrative support for these operations and protecting our intellectual property. We currently do not have any products approved
for sale and we have not generated any significant revenue from product sales since our inception. From our inception through the
date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have funded our operations primarily through the private placement of debt and equity
securities and most recently, our initial public offering.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">We have incurred net losses in each year
since our inception, including net losses of approximately $11.6 million and $1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2018
and 2017, respectively. We had an accumulated deficit of approximately $12.0 million as of December 31, 2018 and $0.4 million as
of December 31, 2017, net of recapitalization of approximately $10.7 million of accumulated deficit as additional paid-in-capital
in connection with the conversion/reincorporation. Substantially all our operating losses resulted from costs incurred in connection
with our research and development programs, and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">We do not expect to generate revenue from
product sales unless and until we successfully complete development and obtain marketing approval for AD04, which we expect will
take a number of years and is subject to significant uncertainty. Although we believe the proceeds from our initial public offering
and our currently contemplated offering will be sufficient to fund our operations over the next twelve months, they will not be
sufficient to fund our entire initial Phase 3 clinical trial. We anticipate the need for at least a second Phase 3 clinical trial,
and possibly a third, in order to receive FDA approval for commercialization of AD04 for the treatment of AUD and they will not
be sufficient to complete the additional trials. Accordingly, we anticipate that we will need to raise additional capital in addition
to the net proceeds of our initial public offering and our currently contemplated offering prior to the commercialization of and
to complete the additional clinical trials for AD04. Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial revenue from product
sales, we expect to finance our operating activities through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, government or
other third-party funding, commercialization, marketing and distribution arrangements and other collaborations, strategic alliances
and licensing arrangements. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed
on favorable terms or at all. Our failure to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements as and when needed would have
a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to develop AD04.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Research and development is crucial to
the our development. Our research and development expenses were $368,000 and $182,000 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and
2017, respectively, representing 5.3% and 18.3% of our total operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017,

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">R&amp;D expenses increased by
approximately $186,000 (102%) during the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The
increase was largely attributable to the hiring of personnel devoting essentially the whole of their efforts to clinical
development efforts (additional $125,000) and additional R&amp;D consulting costs ($79,000) after completion of the IPO and
with ramp up for initiation of the planned Phase 3 study.</P>

increase was largely attributable to added G&amp;A personnel costs (an additional $334,000), added legal expense (an additional
$230,000), the implementation of director compensation (an additional $101,000), and increased equity compensation expense (an
additional $5,110,000, comprised of employee stock option expense of $199,000, stock issued as consideration to cancel the
performance bonus plan of $1.5 million, and stock and warrants issued to various consultants for the remainder).</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Our principal liquidity needs have historically
been working capital, R&amp;D, patent costs and personnel costs. We expect these needs to continue as we develop and eventually
commercialize our compound. Over the next several years, we expect to increase our R&amp;D expenses as we undergo clinical trials
to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the product. To date, we have funded our operations primarily with the proceeds from
our initial public offering and equity financings prior to our initial public offering and the issuance of notes. On July 31, 2018,
we closed our initial public offering. The aggregate net proceeds received by us from the offering were $6.3 million net of underwriter&rsquo;s
fees and expenses not recognized in previous periods.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Prior to July 31, 2018, we had outstanding convertible notes payable, net of debt discount, of approximately $234,000. The
principal and interest was scheduled to come due on these notes in 2029, and the notes bore interest at a rate of 15% per
annum. Upon consummation of our initial public offering, these notes automatically converted to equity.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">In May 2017, we issued a senior secured
bridge note in the principal amount of $287,500 (the &ldquo;Senior Secured Bridge Note&rdquo;) and received proceeds of $250,000
from said loan. The Senior Secured Bridge Note bore interest of 2% annually and the holder of the Senior Secured Bridge Note had
the right to require repayment of 115% of the outstanding principal amount plus interest upon us receiving proceeds of $250,000
or more from the sale of our equity (or equivalent securities) or the issuance of debt. The Senior Secured Bridge Note was amended
to modify the maturity date to December 4 from February 5, 2018 and upon maturity $349,900 was to be paid in full satisfaction
of the principal and outstanding interest. On February 22, 2018, the lender agreed to settle the Senior Secured Bridge Note for a payment
of $150,000 in cash, and our agreement to (i) pay, on consummation of a sale of equity with proceeds greater than $2,000,000, including
our initial public offering, a further cash payment of $100,000 at the earlier of such next financing or at the same time and in
equal amount (up to a maximum of $100,000) as payments are made to MVA 151 Investors, LLC (&ldquo;MVA&rdquo;) under the senior
secured note held by MVA, (ii) to issue upon such consummation of a sale of equity (x) a number of shares of common stock equal
to $50,000 divided by the price per share of the sale, and (y) warrants to purchase a number of shares of common stock equal to
$325,000 divided by the price per share of the sale, at a strike price equal to the price per share of the sale. The $100,000 was
paid on July 31, 2018 out of the proceeds our initial public offering.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">On February 22, 2018 and March 1,
2018, we entered into Security Purchase Agreements pursuant to which we issued senior secured notes in the aggregate
principal amount of $510,000 (the &ldquo;Secured Notes&rdquo;) to a number of our directors and entities controlled by
directors, as well as two consultants. The Secured Notes ranked <I>pari passu</I> with respect to seniority as to payment to
one another and the June 2018 Senior Note, senior as to payment as to all other outstanding debt, and were secured by a lien
on substantially all of our assets. The Secured Notes, as amended, bore interest at rate of 18% per annum and were payable
upon the earlier of August 1, 2018 or upon our consummation of our next debt or equity financing, including, without
limitation, our offering or a change of control of us. The Secured Notes were repaid in full using the proceeds of our
initial public offering.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">On June 3, 2018, we entered into a Security
Purchase Agreement pursuant to which we issued a senior secured note in the principal amount of $325,000 to one accredited institutional
investor (the &ldquo;June 2018 Senior Note&rdquo;). The June 2018 Senior Note was issued at an original issue discount of 15.4%,
or $50,000, did not bear interest and is payable on March 5, 2019 or upon an earlier event of default, including, without limitation,
a change of control of us. The June 2018 Senior Note was convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $2.00
per share, subject to adjustment for certain dilutive issuances. Additionally, in the event of the consummation by us of a dilutive
financing (defined as any debt or equity financing in the amount of $2,000,000 or more, at a price of less than $4.00 per share
of common stock), we agreed to reduce the conversion price then in effect to a price equal to 50% of the per share price of the
common stock issued in the dilutive financing. We also issued to the holder of the June 2018 Senior Note a warrant to purchase
300,000 shares of our common stock exercisable at $3.75 per share which will be exercisable for a term of five years. Upon the
written request of the warrant holder, given no more than once and no earlier than one hundred and eighty (180) days after we become
a reporting company under the Exchange Act, we have agreed to prepare and file with the SEC within sixty (60) days of our receipt
of such request a registration statement on Form S-1 covering the resale of the shares of common stock issuable under the warrant,
and to use our commercially reasonable efforts to cause the registration statement to be declared effective by the SEC and remain
effective during the exercise period of the warrant. The June 2018 Senior Note was repaid in full on December 20, 2018 upon its
conversion into 162,500 shares of our common stock.</P>

approximately $3.9 million at December 31, 2018 are not expected to be sufficient to fund operations for the subsequent
twelve months from the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, with total cash to be used during the period expected to be
approximately $6.4 million. Cash available at the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K will not be sufficient to fund our
operations for the next twelve months, given our current expectations. We will, despite receipt of the proceeds of our
initial public offering and even with the proceeds of our currently contemplated offering (for which there can be no
assurance that we will raise sufficient funds), require additional financing as we continue to execute our business strategy.
Of the estimated $7.5 million projected to be necessary to complete the initial Phase 3 trial, about $3.0 million will come
from IPO funds and proceeds from warrant exercises. We will therefor require at least $4.5 million in additional funds in
order to complete the initial Phase 3 trial of AD04. Without additional proceeds from this a financing, or another liquidity
event, we estimate that our existing cash would be exhausted by the end of 3<SUP>rd</SUP> quarter 2019.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Our liquidity may be negatively impacted as a result of research
and development cost increases in addition to general economic and industry factors. We anticipate that, to the extent that we
require additional liquidity, it will be funded through the incurrence of other indebtedness, additional equity financings or a
combination of these potential sources of liquidity. In addition, we may raise additional funds to finance future cash needs through
grant funding and/or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities
or convertible debt, our stockholders will experience dilution. Debt financing, if available, would result in increased fixed payment
obligations and may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such
as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaboration
and licensing arrangements with third parties, it may be necessary to relinquish valuable rights to our products, future revenue
streams or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. We cannot be certain that additional
funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Any failure to raise capital in the future could have a negative impact
on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategies.</P>

FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which supersedes the existing guidance for lease accounting, Leases (Topic 840).
ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize leases on their balance sheets, and leaves lessor accounting largely unchanged. the amendments
in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early
application is permitted for all entities. ASU 2016-02 requires a modified retrospective approach for all leases existing at, or
entered into after, the date of initial application, with an option to elect to use certain transition relief. In July 2018, the
FASB issued ASU No. 2018-10, &ldquo;<I>Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases</I>.&rdquo; The amendments in ASU 2018-10 clarify,
correct or remove inconsistencies in the guidance provided under ASU 2016-02 related to sixteen specific issues identified. Also
in July 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-11 &ldquo;<I>Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvement</I>&rdquo; which now allows entities
the option of recognizing the cumulative effect of applying the new standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained
earnings in the year of adoption while continuing to present all prior periods under previous lease accounting guidance. The effective
date and transition requirements for these two ASUs are the same as the effective date and transition requirements as ASU 2016-02.

260) Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480) Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815),&rdquo; which addresses the complexity
of accounting for certain financial instruments with down round features. Down round features are features of certain equity-linked
instruments (or embedded features) that result in the strike price being reduced on the basis of the pricing of future equity offerings.
Current accounting guidance creates cost and complexity for entities that issue financial instruments (such as warrants and convertible
instruments) with down round features that require fair value measurement of the entire instrument or conversion option. The amendments
in Part I of this Update are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December
15, 2018 with early adoption permitted. We early adopted ASU 2017-11 at the beginning of the second quarter of 2018; there was

requires us to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures
of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of sales and expenses
during the reporting periods. Certain of our more critical accounting policies require the application of significant judgment
by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates. By their nature, these judgments are
subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our judgments, including those related to prepaid
and other current assets, recoverability of long-lived assets and the fair value of our membership units. We use historical experience
and other assumptions as the basis for our judgments and making these estimates. Because future events and their effects cannot
be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. Any changes in those estimates will
be reflected in our financial statements as they occur. While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note
2 to our financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies
and estimates are most critical to a full understanding and evaluation of our reported financial results. The critical accounting
policies addressed below reflect our most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.</P>

new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as the operating environment changes.</P>

puts are closely and clearly related to a debt host should the debt contain a substantial premium or default provision (one that
is greater than 10% of the principal resulting from puts that require payoff for more than 110% of principal amount outstanding).

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 24pt">We have audited the
accompanying balance sheets of Adial Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the
related statements of operations, stockholders&rsquo; equity (deficit), and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period
ended December 31, 2018, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2018
and 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31,
2018, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.</P>

statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As described in Note 2, the Company has an
accumulated deficit of $12.0 million as of December 31, 2018 and has suffered recurring losses from operations and has a net working
capital deficiency. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going concern.
Management&rsquo;s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments
that may result from the outcome of these uncertainties.</P>

no such opinion.</P>

performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud,

significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.</P>

Inc. (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo; or &ldquo;Adial&rdquo;) was converted from a limited liability company to a corporation and reincorporated
in Delaware on October 1, 2017 from ADial Pharmaceuticals, LLC, which was formed on November 23, 2010 in the Commonwealth of Virginia.
Adial is presently engaged in the development of medications for the treatment of addictions and related disorders.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 24pt">The Company is planning
to commence its first Phase 3 clinical trial of its lead compound AD04 (&ldquo;AD04&rdquo;) for the treatment of alcohol use disorder.
Both the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (&ldquo;FDA&rdquo;) and the European Medicines Authority (&ldquo;EMA&rdquo;) have indicated
they will accept heavy-drinking-based endpoints as a basis for approval for the treatment of alcohol use disorder rather than the
previously required abstinence-based endpoints. Key patents have been issued in the United States, the European Union, and other
jurisdictions for which the Company has exclusive license rights. The active ingredient in AD04 is ondansetron, a serotonin-3 antagonist.
Due to its mechanism of action, AD04 has the potential to be used for the treatment of other addictive disorders, such as opioid
use disorder, obesity, smoking, and other drug addictions.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 24pt">In July 2018, the Company
raised proceeds of $6.3 million in an initial public offering (the &ldquo;IPO&rdquo;), net of offering expenses. On July 27, 2018,
the shares of common stock and offering warrants began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbols &ldquo;ADIL&rdquo;

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 24pt">The financial statements
have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, which contemplate continuation of the Company as
a going concern. To date, the Company has not generated any revenues. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had an accumulated deficit
of approximately $12.0 million, and has incurred net losses of approximately $11.6 million and $1.1 million for the years ended
December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Based on the current development plans for AD04 in both the U.S. and foreign markets
and the Company&rsquo;s other operating requirements, management believes that the existing cash at December 31, 2018 will not
be sufficient to fund operations for at least the next twelve months following the issuance of these financial statements. These
factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going concern.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 24pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 24pt">The Company&rsquo;s
continued operations will depend on its ability to raise additional capital through equity and/or debt financings, strategic relationships,
or out-licensing of its products in order to complete its ongoing research and development efforts and the planned Phase 3 clinical
trial. Without additional funding, the Company would exhaust its existing cash reserves by the end of the third quarter of 2019
and would be required to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of its research and development programs which would likely
have a material adverse effect on the Company.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 24pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 24pt">The financial statements
do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification
of liabilities that might result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 24pt">Generally, the Company&rsquo;s
operations are subject to a number of factors that can affect its operating results and financial condition. Such factors include,
but are not limited to: the results of clinical testing and trial activities of the Company&rsquo;s product candidates; the ability
to obtain regulatory approval to market the Company&rsquo;s products; the ability to manufacture the Company&rsquo;s products successfully;
competition from products manufactured and sold or being developed by other companies; the price of, and demand for, Company products;
the ability to negotiate favorable licensing or other manufacturing and marketing agreements for its products; and the ability
to raise capital to support its operations.</P>

at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.</P>

31, 2018, these notes had been paid in full, discharging the embedded derivative liability.</P>

the Company entered into a senior secured bridge note financing with a third party investment fund (the &ldquo;Senior Holder&rdquo;)
for the principal sum of $287,500 (the &ldquo;Senior Secured Bridge Note&rdquo;) of which $250,000 was received as proceeds and
$37,500 was recorded as original issue discount. The interest on the principal amount was at the rate of two percent per annum.

amount of $115,000, of which $100,000 was received as proceeds and $15,000 was recorded as original issue discount. In the event
of default, the full principal amount of $115,000 plus accrued interest would be immediately due and payable to the Subordinated
Holder; in addition, interest on the outstanding principal and accrued interest would increase to 15% and $25,000 would be due
and payable to Subordinated Holder for every calendar month the note is in default until full payment were made. Because the default
provisions required payment of significant penalties in the case of a default event (greater than 10% of the principal), the default
provision was determined to be a derivative instrument. In addition, upon repayment, the Subordinated Holders were to receive
warrants to purchase shares of the Company&rsquo;s common stock in the amount equal to the principal of the Subordinated Notes
and at an exercise price per share equal to 100% of the IPO price. The warrants were to provide for a cashless exercise and were

one third the price offered during the financing round that triggers the conversion, or the price obtained by dividing $2,000,000
by the Company&rsquo;s fully-diluted capitalization at the time of the financing round that triggers the conversion (the &ldquo;Conversion
Cap Price&rdquo;), whichever were lower. In the event that the Company or its assets were acquired prior to the closing of a financing
round of $2,000,000 or more, the outstanding principal and accrued interest of the notes were to automatically convert to the

equal to 150% of the Backstop Amount divided by the price per share of the Next Financing and (ii) a number of units of Company
common stock equal to 50% of the Backstop Amount divided by the price per share of the Next Financing. The warrants are to have
an exercise price equal to the price per share of the Next Financing and a term of five years. On March 1, MVA invested $92,000

as a C corporation on October 1, 2017. Prior to reorganization, for federal and state income tax purposes, the Company was a limited
liability company treated as a partnership, in which income tax liabilities and/or benefits were passed through to the Company&rsquo;s
unitholders. As such, the Company did not directly pay federal and state income taxes and recognition was not given to federal
and state income taxes for the operations of the Company prior to reorganization. After reorganization, the Company became a taxable
entity. Therefore, provision for taxes has been made for the fourth quarter of 2017, the period during which the Company was taxable.
On reincorporation, the Company recapitalized $10,673,709 in retained deficits and 2017 losses prior to reincorporation to additional
paid in capital, leaving a retained deficit $403,992 as the basis for a potential loss carryforward.</P>

a net operating loss carry-forward for federal and state tax purposes of approximately $7.1 million at December 31, 2018,
that is potentially available to offset future taxable income. The 20-year limitation was eliminated for losses generated
after January 1, 2018, giving the taxpayer the ability to carry forward losses indefinitely. However, NOL carry forward
arising after January 1, 2018, will now be limited to 80 percent of taxable income. For financial reporting purposes, no
deferred tax asset was recognized because at December 31, 2018, management estimates that it is more likely than not that
substantially all of the net operating losses will expire unused. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is
dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are
deductible. The timing and manner in which the Company can utilize its net operating loss carryforward and future income tax
deductions in any year may be limited by provisions of the Internal Revenue Code regarding the change in ownership of
corporations. Such limitation may have an impact on the ultimate realization of our carryforwards and future tax
deductions.</P>

Internal Revenue Code (&ldquo;Section 382&rdquo;) imposes limitations on a corporation&rsquo;s ability to utilize net operating
losses if it experiences an &ldquo;ownership change.&rdquo; In general terms, an ownership change may result from transactions
increasing the ownership of certain stockholders in the stock of a corporation by more than 50 percentage points over a three-year
period. Any unused annual limitation may be carried over to later years, and the amount of the limitation may under certain circumstances
be increased by the built-in gains in assets held by us at the time of the change that are recognized in the five-year period
after the change.</P>

Act (the Act) was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Act reduces the US federal corporate tax rate from 34% to 21%, requires companies
to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and creates new
taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. The Company measured its deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at
which they are anticipated to reverse in the future, which is generally 21%. However, the Company is still examining certain aspects
of the Act and refining its calculations, which could potentially affect the measurement of these balances or give rise to new
deferred tax amounts. The provisional amount recorded related to the re-measurement of the Company&rsquo;s deferred tax balance
was a tax expense of approximately $53,000, which was fully offset with a valuation allowance against our deferred taxes. Since
the Company was not a taxable entity prior to reincorporation, examination of returns for years prior to 2017 will not result
in changes to tax liability or benefit.&nbsp;</P>

including family relationships, our board of directors has determined that each of Messrs. Kermit Anderson, Robertson Gilliland,
Tony Goodman, James Newman, and Kevin Schuyler is &ldquo;independent&rdquo; under the applicable rules of the SEC and NASDAQ and
that neither Messrs. Stilley, nor Dr. Johnson is &ldquo;independent&rdquo; as defined under the such rules. In making such determination,
our board of directors considered the relationship that each such non-employee director has with our company and all other facts
and circumstances that our board of directors deemed relevant in determining his independence, including the beneficial ownership
of our capital stock by each non-employee director. Mr. Stilley is not an independent director under these rules because he is
our Chief Executive Officer and President and Dr. Johnson is not an independent director under these rules because of the payments
that have been made by us to Dr. Johnson in 2014 for his employment by the Company as a consultant and Chairman with executive
powers.</P>

in accordance with the rules of the SEC. These rules generally attribute beneficial ownership of securities to persons who possess
sole or shared voting power or investment power with respect to those securities. In addition, the rules include shares of common
stock issuable pursuant to the exercise of profits interest units, warrants or other rights that are either immediately exercisable
or exercisable on or before April 13, 2019, which is approximately 60 days after the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These
shares are deemed to be outstanding and beneficially owned by the person holding those options or warrants for the purpose of computing
the percentage ownership of that person, but they are not treated as outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership
of any other person. Unless otherwise indicated, the persons or entities identified in this table have sole voting and investment
power with respect to all shares shown as beneficially owned by them, subject to applicable community property laws.</P>

stock at $6.25 per share of common stock) to exchange the 480,600 Unit Warrants for warrants to purchase 480,600 shares of common
stock at an exercise price of $5.00 per share and warrants to purchase an aggregate of 480,600 shares of common stock at an exercise
price of $6.25 per share. The Unit Warrants were ultimately exercisable for an aggregate of 961,200 shares of common stock at a
weighted average exercise price of $5.63; the warrants issued in exchange for the Unit warrants are exercisable for an aggregate
of 961,200 shares of common stock at weighted average exercise price of $5.63. As a result of the exchange agreement, the 480,600

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The Audit Committee has adopted procedures
for pre-approving all audit and non-audit services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm, including the
fees and terms of such services. These procedures include reviewing detailed back-up documentation for audit and permitted non-audit
services. The documentation includes a description of, and a budgeted amount for, particular categories of non-audit services that
are recurring in nature and therefore anticipated at the time that the budget is submitted. Audit Committee approval is required
to exceed the pre-approved amount for a particular category of non-audit services and to engage the independent registered public
accounting firm for any non-audit services not included in those pre-approved amounts. For both types of pre-approval, the Audit
Committee considers whether such services are consistent with the rules on auditor independence promulgated by the SEC and the
PCAOB. The Audit Committee also considers whether the independent registered public accounting firm is best positioned to provide
the most effective and efficient service, based on such reasons as the auditor&rsquo;s familiarity with our business, people, culture,
accounting systems, risk profile, and whether the services enhance our ability to manage or control risks, and improve audit quality.
The Audit Committee may form and delegate pre-approval authority to subcommittees consisting of one or more members of the Audit
Committee, and such subcommittees must report any pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting.
All of the services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm were pre-approved by the Audit Committee.</P>
