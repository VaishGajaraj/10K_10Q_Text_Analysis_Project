<P><BR><FONT COLOR=#000000 face=Verdana size=2>Business</FONT></P>
<P>Autoliv is one of the world's leading suppliers of automotive occupant safety restraint systems with a broad range of product offerings; including modules and components for passenger and driver-side airbags, side-impact airbag protection systems, seat belts, steering wheels, safety seats and other safety systems and products. Autoliv has production facilities in 29 countries and has as customers almost all of the world's largest car manufacturers.</P>
<P>Autoliv employs approximately 28,000 people and its head office is located in Stockholm, Sweden and employs about 35 people. Autoliv&#146;s total headcount, including temporary employees, is approximately 31,800. Autoliv's sales in 2001 were $4.0 billion, approximately 70% of which consisted of airbags and associated products and approximately 30% of which consisted of seat belts and associated products. Autoliv's major markets are in Europe and the United States.</P>
<P><FONT COLOR=#000000 face=Verdana size=2>Financial Information on Segments</FONT></P>
<P>Autoliv considers its products to be components of integrated car passenger protection systems, which fall within a single industry segment. The financial data relating to Autoliv's business in such segment over the last three fiscal years is contained in the Financial Statements of the Annual Report (pages 26-38 of the printed report) and is incorporated herein by reference. A statement of net sales by product group for the last three years is contained in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the Annual Report and is incorporated herein by reference.</P>
<P><FONT COLOR=#000000 face=Verdana size=2>Financial Information on Geographic Areas</FONT></P>
<P>Financial information concerning Autoliv's geographic areas is included in Note 16 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the Annual Report, and is incorporated herein by reference.</P>
<P><FONT COLOR=#000000 face=Verdana size=2>Products, Market and Competition</FONT></P>
<P> Information concerning products, markets and competition is included in the sections entitled "The Market" and "Autoliv's Safety Systems" in the Annual Report and is incorporated herein by reference (pages 8 through 11 in the printed report).</P>
<P><FONT COLOR=#000000 face=Verdana size=2>Major Customers</FONT></P>
<P>Information concerning major customers is included in the section entitled "The Market" and Note 16 in the Annual Report and is incorporated herein by reference (pages 9 and 37 in the printed report).</P>
<P><FONT COLOR=#000000 face=Verdana size=2>Research, Development and Engineering</FONT></P>
<P>Expenses incurred for research, development and engineering activities were $200.8 million, $195.7 million and $197.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Further information is included in the section entitled "Research, Development and Engineering" of the Annual Report and is incorporated herein by reference (pages 12 and 15 in the printed report).</P>
<P><FONT COLOR=#000000 face=Verdana size=2>Manufacturing and Production</FONT></P>
<P>Including joint venture operations, Autoliv has approximately 80 wholly or partially owned production facilities located in 29 countries, consisting of both component factories and assembly factories. See "Item 2. Properties" for a description of Autoliv's principal properties. The component factories manufacture inflators, initiators, textile cushions, webbing materials, electronics, pressed steel parts, springs and overmoulded steel parts used in seat belt and airbag assembly, seat subsystems and steering wheels. The assembly factories source components from a number of parties, including Autoliv's own component factories, and assemble complete restraint systems for "just-in-time" delivery to customers. The products manufactured by Autoliv's wholly owned assembly factories in 2001 consisted of more than 61 million complete seat belt systems (nearly 33 million of which were fitted with pretensioners), and about 46 million airbag modules (including about 20 million side impact airbags).</P>
<P> Autoliv's "just-in-time" delivery systems have been designed to accommodate the specific requirements of each customer for low levels of inventory and rapid stock delivery service. "Just-in-time" deliveries require manufacturing in geographic areas close to the customers which allows for rapid delivery to customers. The fact that the major automobile manufacturers are continually expanding production activities into more countries and require the same or similar safety systems as produced in Europe, Japan or the US increases the importance to suppliers of having production capacity in several countries. Mergers and acquisitions among the customers also further this trend.</P>
<P>Automobile manufacturers are seeking competitive quotes from suppliers and demand significant staged price reductions over a product's life cycle. In line with its customers' purchasing strategies, Autoliv has implemented cost-saving programs which management believes will help reduce Autoliv's own material, production and administrative costs.</P>
<P>If the supply of raw materials and components is not disrupted, the Autoliv assembly operations generally are not constrained by capacity considerations. Autoliv can adjust capacity in response to changes in demand within a few weeks by the addition or removal of standardized production and assembly lines. Most of Autoliv's assembly factories can make sufficient space available to accommodate additional production lines to satisfy foreseeable increases in capacity.</P>
<P><FONT COLOR=#000000 face=Verdana size=2>Quality Management</FONT></P>
<P> Autoliv's products face extremely high reliability requirements. In order to meet high customer quality requirements and internal production efficiency requirements, Autoliv has for several years operated an advanced quality management system. The system is a zero defect rate system and is based upon preventive principles involving the measurement of a number of quality indicators. By reference to best practice within its industry segment, Autoliv has developed quality benchmarks applied throughout Autoliv and places great emphasis on continually improving the quality of its products, customer service and production processes.</P>
<P> All wholly-owned Autoliv subsidiaries (except for recently acquired companies) with direct deliveries to car manufacturers are certified according to ISO 9000 (as defined below). Most of Autoliv's joint ventures are also ISO 9000 certified. "ISO 9000", a quality assurance management system endorsed by European nations and many other countries, is a checklist of functions, policies and rules, considered necessary to assure the quality of a company's products and services.</P>
<P>Virtually all Autoliv companies (except for recently acquired companies) in North America and Europe are also certified according to QS-9000, an automotive quality standard.</P>
<P>In addition, Autoliv during 2001 launched a plan to start certifying its production facilities to ISO/TS 16949. So far 40% of the company&#146;s facilities have been certified to this new quality standard for the automotive industry. These facilities account for, at least, 70% of consolidated sales.</P>
<P><FONT COLOR=#000000 face=Verdana size=2>Sources and Availability of Raw Materials and Components</FONT></P>
<P> Autoliv's business uses many raw materials in the manufacture of its products, nearly all of which are generally available from a number of qualified suppliers. Peaks in worldwide demand have had an impact on raw material costs and availability, particularly with single or sole sourced supplies. Autoliv's business, however, has not generally experienced significant or long-term difficulty in obtaining raw materials.</P>
<P><FONT COLOR=#000000 face=Verdana size=2>Autoliv's Dependence on Suppliers</FONT></P>
<P>Autoliv may be dependent in certain instances on a single supplier for certain components.</P>
<P>Delays or stoppages in the delivery of components could result in Autoliv being unable to supply complete products to its customers. Such delays or stoppages could result in Autoliv's customers having to halt their own production processes, which might result not only in loss of income to Autoliv on the reduced volume of supplied products but also in the customer seeking recoupment for consequential losses incurred due to its own lost production.</P>
<P><FONT COLOR=#000000 face=Verdana size=2>Global Operations</FONT></P>
<P>An important element of Autoliv's strategy has been to establish joint ventures to promote Autoliv's geographical expansion and technological development and to gain assistance in marketing Autoliv's full product line to local automobile manufacturers. Total sales of Autoliv's joint venture operations to outside customers aggregated approximately $ 338 million in 2001. These joint venture operations are accounted for according to the equity method.</P>
<P>Autoliv typically contributes its design and production knowledge to the joint venture, with the local partner providing sales support and manufacturing facilities. Some of these local partners manufacture and sell standardized seat belt systems, but will, through the joint venture with Autoliv, be able to upgrade their technology to meet specific customer demands. In addition to joint ventures established in emerging markets, Autoliv has also, in certain instances, established joint ventures in markets such as France, either to strengthen its sales position or to gain access to the market.</P>
<P>Autoliv joint ventures and foreign subsidiaries may be subject to the usual risks inherent in global operations, including, but not limited to: risks with respect to currency exchange rates; economic and political destabilization; other disruption of markets; restrictive laws and actions of certain governments (such as restrictions on transfers of funds, export duties and quotas, foreign customs and tariffs, and unexpected changes in regulatory environments); difficulty in obtaining distribution and support; nationalization; and the laws and policies of the United States, the European Union, and the World Trade Organization affecting trade, investment and loans; and tax laws.</P>
<P>There can be no assurance that these factors will not have a material adverse impact on Autoliv's ability to increase or maintain its international sales or on its results of operations.</P>
<P><FONT COLOR=#000000 face=Verdana size=2>Patents and Proprietary Technology</FONT></P>
<P> Autoliv has developed a considerable amount of proprietary technology related to car occupant restraint systems and relies on a number of patents to protect such technology. Autoliv protects many of its innovations with patents, and vigorously protects and defends its patents, trademarks and know-how against infringement and unauthorized use. At present, Autoliv holds approximately 3,000 patents covering a large number of innovations and product ideas, mainly in the fields of seat belt and airbag technologies. In addition, Autoliv utilizes, and has access to, the patents of Autoliv's joint ventures and joint venture partners. These patents expire on various dates during the period 2002 to 2021. The expiration of any single patent is not expected to have a material adverse effect on Autoliv's financial position.</P>
<P>Although Autoliv believes that its products and technology do not infringe the proprietary rights of others, there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against Autoliv in the future. In addition, there can be no assurance that any patents now owned by Autoliv, will afford protection against competitors that develop similar technology.</P>
<P><FONT COLOR=#000000 face=Verdana size=2>Dependence on the Automotive Industry</FONT></P>
<P>The customers of Autoliv are automobile manufacturers whose production volumes are dependent upon general economic conditions and the level of consumer spending. The volume of car production in Autoliv's most important markets in Europe, North America, and Asia has fluctuated from year to year, and such fluctuations will give rise to fluctuations in the demand for Autoliv's products.</P>
<P><FONT COLOR=#000000 face=Verdana size=2>Substantial Reliance by Autoliv on Major Customers</FONT></P>
<P> A relatively small number of automobile manufacturers compose the existing customer base of Autoliv. Although business with any given customer is typically split into several contracts (usually one contract per car model), the loss of all of the business of certain customers could have a material adverse effect on Autoliv. Combined sales to Autoliv's largest customer represented approximately 20% and the largest contract 4% of total fiscal 2001 sales. See Note 16 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the Annual Report, which is incorporated herein by reference.</P>
<P><FONT COLOR=#000000 face=Verdana size=2>Autoliv's Pricing Pressures</FONT></P>
<P>As a consequence of the major automobile manufacturers' strong purchasing power, and the competitive pressures on car occupant restraint system suppliers to increase such suppliers' manufacturing capabilities, the unit prices of airbag systems, seat belts and other Autoliv products will  continue to decline in the future. In addition, similar to other automobile component manufacturers, Autoliv expects that Autoliv  and its subsidiaries will, under certain circumstances, quote  fixed or maximum prices for long-term supply arrangements. The  future profitability of Autoliv will depend upon, among other  things, its ability to continue to reduce its per unit costs and maintain a cost structure, internally and with its suppliers, that will enable it to remain cost-competitive. Autoliv's profitability may also be influenced by its success in designing and marketing technological improvements in car occupant restraint systems.</P>
<P><FONT COLOR=#000000 face=Verdana size=2>Product Recalls</FONT></P>
<P>The possibility of substantial product recalls could pose a significant commercial risk to Autoliv in the future. Autoliv carries product recall insurance with coverage limits that Autoliv management believes are sufficient to cover potential product recalls. A substantial product recall that is not covered by insurance or results in liabilities in excess of any coverage limits could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and operating results of Autoliv.</P>
<P><FONT COLOR=#000000 face=Verdana size=2>Seasonality and Backlog</FONT></P>
<P>Autoliv's business is not subject to significant seasonal fluctuations.<BR>There are no material backlogs in Autoliv's business.</P>
<P><FONT COLOR=#000000 face=Verdana size=2>Certain Regulatory Matters and Developments</FONT></P>
<P>The automotive safety industry is subject to substantial regulation, both in the United States and in many other countries, which may affect the demand for Autoliv's products and Autoliv's manufacturing and development costs. These regulations are subject to frequent review by applicable regulatory authorities and other governmental entities, and are subject to change. In the United States, current federal legislation requires driver-side and passenger-side airbags in all new passenger cars, effective September 1, 1997, and in all new light vehicles (unloaded vehicle weight of 5,500 pounds or less), effective September 1, 1998. Changes in regulations could have a material adverse impact on Autoliv's operations and financial condition. Such regulations are subject to a number of factors that are not within the control of Autoliv, including adverse publicity regarding the safety risks of airbags to children and small adults, domestic and foreign political developments, and litigation relating to Autoliv's and its competitors' products. There can be no assurance that regulatory developments or adverse publicity will not adversely affect customer demand for automotive safety products of Autoliv's business. Such changes could also result in slower increases, or in decreases, in demand for automotive safety products in other countries.</P>
<P>In June 1998 President Clinton signed into law the "Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21)", the omnibus highway transportation spending bill passed by Congress. Contained within this bill was a provision that directs the Department of Transportation to initiate a federal rulemaking procedure for the purpose of mandating testing protocols and phase-in schedules for advanced or "smart" restraints.</P>
<P>In May 2000, the final regulations (No. NHTSA 00-7013, Notice 1) were issued, requiring 35 % of all light vehicles sold in the United States between September 1, 2003 and August 31, 2004 to be in compliance with the new regulations. The following model year 65 % of all new vehicles shall be in compliance with the regulations and during the third model year 100 %. Theese regulations are expected to increase the unit price for frontal airbag system, and thereby increase the North American airbag market, but also have ripple effects on other markets.</P>
<P><FONT COLOR=#000000 face=Verdana size=2>Environmental</FONT></P>
<P>Since 1996, Autoliv has had an environmental plan, which is based on Autoliv's environmental policy (see the Company's web site: autoliv.com/manufacturing). According to the plan, the Autoliv plants and units should become certified according to ISO 14001, an international standard for environmental management systems. So far, facilities representing more than 85% of sales consolidated have been certified according to the standard, including all major plants  in Europe and North America</P>
<P>Autoliv has no pending environmental related problems to the best of Autoliv's management's knowledge.</P>
<P><FONT COLOR=#000000 face=Verdana size=2>Employees</FONT></P>
<P>At December 31, 2001, Autoliv and its subsidiaries had approximately 28,000 employees</P>
<P>Autoliv considers its labor relations to be good and has not experienced any major strike or other significant labor dispute for many years.</P>
<P>The majority of Autoliv's employees in its subsidiaries in Sweden are unionized. The principal unions to which Autoliv's Swedish employees belong are the Swedish Metal Workers Union, the Swedish Union of Clerical and Technical Employees in Industry, the Swedish Foremen and Supervisors' Association and the Swedish Association of Graduated Engineers. Important unions to which some of Autoliv's employees in subsidiaries in countries other than Sweden belong are IG Metall and Textil und Bekleidung in Germany, Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union in the United Kingdom, the Metal Workers Union in Australia, the Union of Needletraders and Industrial and Textile Employees in the United States, Confederation Generale des Travaileurs in France and Federacion Minerometalurgica, Union General de Trabajadores and Comisiones Obereras in Spain.</P>
<P>In Sweden, wages and general working conditions are typically the subject of centrally negotiated collective bargaining agreements. Within the limits established by these agreements, Autoliv's subsidiaries negotiate directly with the local unions representing the employees. In Australia, France and Spain, wages, salaries and general working conditions are negotiated with the local unions. In Germany, wages but not salaries are negotiated with the local unions, while in the United Kingdom and the United States there is far less union involvement in establishing wages, salaries and working conditions than in, for instance, Germany.</P>
<P>Under Swedish law, Autoliv's subsidiaries must negotiate important changes in operations and working conditions with the unions representing its employees. Although these negotiations may from time to time affect the timing of certain management decisions and actions, Autoliv's experience is that such negotiations contribute to good labor relations. In many other countries (e.g. Germany, Spain and France), negotiations must take place when a company wishes to dismiss employees and under certain other circumstances.</P>
<P>Employees in the Netherlands and Germany are represented by legally mandated workers' councils or similar organizations.</P>
<P>Twice a year Company Management are conducting a European Employee Council meeting (EEC) to provide employee representative with important information as well as to be a forum for exchange of opinions.</P>
<P><FONT COLOR=#000000 face=Verdana size=2>Item 2. Properties</FONT></P>
<P>Autoliv's various businesses operate through a number of production facilities and offices. Autoliv believes its properties to be adequately maintained and suitable for their intended use and its production facilities to have a capacity adequate for its current and foreseeable needs.</P>

<P>From time to time, Autoliv has been named as defendant in product liability and other lawsuits. Such lawsuits historically have not had an adverse impact on the financial condition of Autoliv. However, although Autoliv carries product liability insurance to the extent reasonably available against insurable risks, future damages awarded in the United States in product liability lawsuits could exceed the limits of available insurance coverage, and Autoliv might be held liable for punitive damages which are not capable of estimation. In addition, from time to time, the customers of Autoliv request their suppliers to participate in the defense of product liability litigation or to contribute to claim settlements. A substantial product liability award that is not covered by insurance or results in liabilities in excess of any coverage limits could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and operating results of Autoliv.<BR><BR><FONT COLOR=#000000 face=Verdana size=2>Item 4.
