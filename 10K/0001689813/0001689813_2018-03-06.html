Overview  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with a portfolio of innovative, late-stage product candidates targeting neurological diseases,
including rare disorders. Our product candidates are small molecules based on two distinct mechanistic platforms&#151;calcitonin gene-related peptide ("CGRP"), receptor antagonists and
glutamate modulators&#151;which we believe have the potential to significantly alter existing treatment approaches across a diverse set of neurologic indications with high unmet need in both
large markets and orphan indications. The most advanced product candidate from our CGRP receptor antagonist platform is rimegepant, an orally available, potent and selective small molecule human CGRP
receptor antagonist that we are developing for the acute treatment of migraine. We expect to receive the topline results of our two Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trials in the first quarter of 2018. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
glutamate platform includes three clinical-stage product candidates being developed for the treatment of various neurological indications: trigriluzole for the treatment of
obsessive-compulsive disorder ("OCD"), spinocerebellar ataxia ("SCA") and Alzheimer's disease; BHV-0223 for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis("ALS"); and BHV-5000 for the treatment of
neurological and psychiatric illnesses such as Rett syndrome, neuropathic pain and treatment-resistant depression. One of our advanced product candidates from our glutamate platform is BHV-0223, which
we are developing for the treatment of ALS, a neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. We have received orphan drug designation from the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration ("FDA") for BHV-0223 in ALS, and we have observed results suggesting bioequivalence to Rilutek in a recently completed Phase&nbsp;1 clinical trial. We plan to file&nbsp;a new drug
application ("NDA") with the FDA for BHV-0223 in the second half of 2018. With respect to our next most advanced product candidate in our glutamate platform, trigriluzole, we expect to receive the
results from an open-label 48-week extension study in SCA in the fourth quarter 2018. We expect to complete enrollment in our Phase&nbsp;2 clinical trial of trigriluzole for the treatment of OCD by
the end of 2018. With respect to BHV-5000, we initiated a Phase&nbsp;1 study in December 2017 which we expect to be completed in the second half of 2018. </FONT></P>

Migraine Overview and Market Opportunity  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Migraine is a chronic and debilitating disorder characterized by recurrent attacks lasting four to 72&nbsp;hours with multiple symptoms,
including typically one-sided, pulsating headaches of moderate to severe pain intensity that are associated with nausea or vomiting, and/or sensitivity to sound (phonophobia) and sensitivity to light
(photophobia). Migraines are often preceded by transient neurological warning symptoms, known as auras, which typically involve visual disturbances such as flashing lights, but may also involve
numbness or tingling in parts of the body. Migraine is both widespread and disabling. The Migraine Research Foundation ranks migraine as the world's third most prevalent illness, and the Global Burden
of Disease Study 2015 rates migraine as the seventh highest specific cause of disability worldwide. According to the Migraine Research Foundation, in the United States, approximately 36&nbsp;million
individuals suffer from migraine attacks. While most sufferers experience migraine attacks once or twice per month, more than 4&nbsp;million people have chronic migraine, defined as experiencing at
least 15 headache days per month, of which at least eight are migraine, for more than three months. Others have episodic migraine, which is characterized by experiencing less than 15 migraine days per
month. People with episodic migraine may progress to chronic migraine over time. Migraine attacks can last four hours or up to three days. More than 90%
of individuals suffering from migraine attacks are unable to work or function normally during a migraine attack, with many experiencing comorbid conditions such as depression, anxiety and insomnia. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Triptans
are the current first-line therapy for treatment of migraine, with over 13.9&nbsp;million annual prescriptions in the United States. Despite the market for triptans being
highly genericized, branded options continue to be popular. For example, even at a price of approximately $400-600/month, Maxalt </FONT></P>

a commonly prescribed triptan. There has been minimal improvement in the standard treatment for migraine since the early 1990s. Reformulations of generic triptans or incremental improvements with
new agents that target the same pathway are predicted to generate additional sales in the near term, but major sales growth for the migraine market are expected from novel therapeutics over the next
several years. We believe that rimegepant will be a potential best-in-class small molecule CGRP receptor antagonist for the acute treatment of migraine and could achieve meaningful penetration of the
market of migraine sufferers whose symptoms are not adequately addressed with current treatments. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
prevention of migraine in the United States is a multi-billion dollar potential market. According to a report published by </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Neuropsychiatric Disease and
Treatment</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, 38% to 50% of diagnosed migraine sufferers may be candidates for migraine prevention therapy. Currently, preventive medications approved for migraine include beta
blockers, such as propranolol, topiramate, sodium valproate, and botulinum toxin ("Botox") and generate nearly 10&nbsp;million prescriptions annually. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
patients with high frequency and chronic migraine, beta blockers, topiramate and sodium valproate are commonly used. These medications are often not well tolerated by patients because
of adverse events ("AEs") such as cognitive impairment, nausea, fatigue and sleep disturbance. In clinical trials with topiramate, the reduction in number of migraine days per month has been observed
to be relatively small; for example, migraine days reduced by 2.5&nbsp;days from six to seven days at baseline, or reduced by 3.5&nbsp;days from 15 to 16&nbsp;days at baseline. Migraine is twice
as prevalent in women as compared to men. In the affected female patient population, predominantly women of child-bearing age, the association of these agents with poor pregnancy outcomes and fetal
abnormalities can limit their use. Botox is only approved for the prevention of migraine in patients diagnosed with chronic migraine. Approximately 47% of Botox-treated patients experience a 50%
reduction in either migraine days per month or migraine frequency per month within six months, which leaves more than half of patients inadequately treated. In addition, the Botox dosing regimen
consists of approximately 31&nbsp;subcutaneous injections at various sites on the head and neck, with recommended repetition every 12&nbsp;weeks if the patient has a therapeutic response. </FONT></P>

CGRP's Role in Migraine  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CGRP receptor is located within pain-signaling pathways, intracranial arteries and mast cells and its activation is thought to play a causal
role in migraine pathophysiology. For example, research and clinical studies have shown: serum levels of CGRP are elevated during migraine attacks, infusion of intravenous CGRP produces persistent
pain in migraine sufferers and non-migraine sufferers, and treatment with anti-migraine drugs normalizes CGRP activity. Additionally, multiple clinical studies show that small molecule CGRP receptor
antagonists, which inhibit the binding of endogenous CGRP to CGRP receptors, are effective in diminishing migraine attacks. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Treatment
with a CGRP receptor antagonist is believed to relieve migraine through the following mechanisms: </FONT></P>

Our Lead Product Candidate: Rimegepant, an Oral CGRP Receptor Antagonist for Acute Treatment of
Migraine  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are developing rimegepant as an orally available, selective and potent small molecule CGRP receptor antagonist for the acute treatment of
migraine. We believe that rimegepant has the potential to be the best-in-class CGRP receptor antagonist for the treatment of migraine with the ability to address important unmet needs, such as durable
efficacy across all four traditional migraine symptoms and reduced incidence of headache recurrence, without contraindications or warnings in patients with cardiovascular disease or cardiovascular
risk factors such as hypertension. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rimegepant
dosed at 75 mg was observed to have statistically significant, durable improvement as compared to placebo in a Phase&nbsp;2b, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled,
dose-ranging clinical trial completed by Bristol-Myers Squibb Company ("BMS"). In this trial, 812 patients suffering from migraine attacks received either placebo, sumatriptan 100 mg (a currently
approved triptan medication for migraine) or rimegepant dosed at 10, 25, 75, 150, 300 or 600 mg. The Phase&nbsp;2b data showed statistically significant effects of rimegepant starting at the 75 mg
dose compared to placebo, meaning </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>that
at this dose level, statistically significant results were observed on all four key migraine symptoms&#151;pain, nausea, photophobia and phonophobia. Higher doses of rimegepant, while also
showing improvement compared to placebo, did not appear to convey any meaningful additional benefit above the 75 mg dose. The observed improvement profile is consistent with the published literature
showing a lack of a progressive dose-response curve for anti-migraine drugs used in the acute treatment of migraine. To our knowledge and based on publicly available information, rimegepant is the
only small molecule CGRP receptor antagonist currently in development that has achieved statistically significant improvement on all four of the traditional endpoints within a single study, which
suggests a broad efficacy profile important both to patients and physicians. Rimegepant also was observed to have evidence of durable improvement as demonstrated by statistically significant effects
on two-to-24&nbsp;hour and two-to-48&nbsp;hour pain freedom and two-to-24&nbsp;hour pain relief, as compared to placebo. In these measurements, benefits were present at two hours after dosing
and persisted through 24&nbsp;hours after dosing and, with respect to pain freedom, through 48&nbsp;hours after dosing. This durable improvement is significant because other common migraine
medications, such as triptans, have been associated with headache recurrence. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Phase&nbsp;2b trial successfully completed its aim of identifying a Phase&nbsp;3 dose. Based on these observations, we are advancing the 75 mg dose of rimegepant in our
Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trials. In July 2017, we initiated two Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trials of rimegepant, and we completed enrollment in these trials in November 2017. We expect to receive topline
results from both of these trials in the first quarter 2018. Additionally, in November 2017, we received agreement from the FDA of an initial pediatric study plan. In February 2018, we submitted a
request for scientific advice for rimegepant to the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ("CHMP") a committee of the European Medicines Agency ("EMA") and we anticipate receiving feedback in
the first half of 2018. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those
suffering from migraine often have accompanying nausea and have an aversion to consuming food or liquids during an attack. We are also developing an oral solid dosage formulation
of rimegepant that disperses almost instantly in the mouth, without the need for water. The Zydis oral dissolving tablet ("ODT") formulation being utilized uniquely addresses this issue. Biohaven has
exclusive worldwide rights to the Zydis ODT fast-dissolving formulation for the development of rimegepant pursuant to a January 2018 license agreement with Catalent U.K. Swindon Zydis Limited, a
subsidiary of Catalent,&nbsp;Inc. ("Catalent"). The agreement also provides exclusivity with respect to other small molecule CGRP receptor antagonists with the Zydis ODT technology. In February
2018, a bioequivalence study was conducted to compare this new ODT formulation to the tablet in current clinical development and provided evidence of equivalence. A third Phase&nbsp;3 efficacy study
with rimegepant commenced in February 2018. This study, utilizing the new ODT formulation, is designed to replicate the other two ongoing Phase&nbsp;3 studies and support the new formulation. The
study is expected to complete in the fourth quarter of 2018. </FONT></P>

Acute Treatment of Migraine and Limitation of Current Treatments  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clinicians use a number of pharmacologic agents for the acute treatment of migraine. A study published by the American Headache Society in 2015
concluded that the medications deemed effective for the acute treatment of migraine fell into the following classes: triptans, ergotamine derivatives, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ("NSAIDs"),
opioids and combination medications. The current standard of care for the acute treatment of migraine is prescription of triptans, which are serotonin 5-HT<SUB>1B/1D</SUB> receptor agonists. Triptans
have been developed and approved for the acute treatment of migraine over the past two decades. The initial introduction of triptans represented a shift toward drugs more selectively targeting the
suspected pathophysiology of migraine. While triptans account for almost 80% of anti-migraine therapies prescribed at office visits by healthcare providers, issues such as an incomplete effect or
headache recurrence remain important clinical limitations. In fact, only about 30% of patients from clinical trials are pain free at two hours after taking triptans. In addition, triptans are </FONT></P>

patients, including those with increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity or a strong family history of coronary artery disease, should be evaluated prior to receiving the first dose of a
triptan. Triptans are contraindicated in patients with a history of ischemic heart disease, coronary artery vasospasm, history of stroke, peripheral vascular disease or uncontrolled hypertension. Even
in patients who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, product labeling for triptans recommends that consideration be given to administration of the first dose in a medically-supervised setting
and performing an electrocardiogram immediately following administration. Additionally, periodic cardiovascular evaluation should be considered for long-term users of triptans who have cardiovascular
risk factors. According to a January 2017 study published in the journal </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Headache,</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> an estimated 2.6&nbsp;million migraine sufferers in the United
States have a cardiovascular event, condition or procedure that limits the potential of triptans as a treatment option. Thus, we believe there remains a significant unmet medical need for a novel
migraine-specific medication that does not increase the risk of cardiovascular liability. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traditionally, for approval of drugs for the acute treatment of migraine, the FDA required the drug to meet four co-primary endpoints at two
hours after dosage in clinical trials: pain freedom or pain relief, and freedom from nausea, phonophobia and photophobia. In October 2014, the FDA issued new, less stringent draft guidance (and formal
guidance in February 2018) indicating that pivotal migraine trials could use a preferred approach of co-primary 2-hour endpoints of freedom from pain and freedom from most bothersome symptom (among
nausea, photophobia or phonophobia) to support approval. We believe rimegepant may be superior to other acute treatments for migraine currently approved and in development because, based on our
Phase&nbsp;2b clinical trial data, rimegepant was observed to result in statistically significant improvement in all four endpoints of pain, nausea, photophobia and phonophobia at the 75 mg dose,
compared to placebo, with a favorable safety profile. </FONT></P>

so there is low potential for centrally mediated AEs. In addition, the preclinical and clinical evidence suggests that CGRP receptor antagonists, such as rimegepant, have an absence of vasoconstrictor

The Potential of CGRP Antagonists: Novel mechanism of action without causing vasoconstriction  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The release of the neuropeptide CGRP from pain nerves is believed to play a causal role in the underlying pathophysiology of migraine and is
also a potent dilator of intracranial arteries. Unlike triptans, which possess potent vasoconstrictive properties that could worsen cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, blocking the CGRP
receptor reverses pathologic dilation of blood vessels without constricting them past their normal resting state size and without active vasoconstriction. The absence of cardiovascular effects may
prove to be one of the major advantages in the use of CGRP receptor antagonists for the treatment of migraine. Preclinical and clinical evidence suggests that the use of CGRP receptor antagonists may
be effective in treating migraine by blocking the pathophysiological processes associated with CGRP release, specifically by: (1)&nbsp;inhibiting pain transmission; (2)&nbsp;decreasing artery
dilation without any active vasoconstriction; and (3)&nbsp;halting neurogenic inflammation. To date, the preclinical and clinical evidence indicates that CGRP receptor antagonists have an absence of
vasoconstrictor activity and lack other undesirable cardiovascular side effects, such as changes in the blood pressure or heart rate. Studies of numerous drugs in development have provided proof of
concept of the effects of CGRP targeting agents in humans. </FONT></P>

Phase&nbsp;2b Clinical Trial Design and Results  </I></FONT></P>

</UL>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rimegepant is being developed for oral administration and was observed to have evidence of comprehensive and durable treatment effect in a large
Phase&nbsp;2b clinical trial conducted by BMS. This Phase&nbsp;2b clinical trial, the results of which were published in 2014, was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging
trial of rimegepant for the acute treatment of migraine. The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of rimegepant compared with placebo in the acute treatment of migraine as measured by pain
freedom (headache pain intensity level reported as "no pain") at two hours post-dosing using a four point rating scale (no pain, mild pain, moderate pain, severe pain) while identifying an optimal
dose to support the Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trials. Subjects were randomized to receive placebo, a 100 mg dose of sumatriptan or one of six doses of rimegepant (10 mg, 25 mg, 75 mg, 150&nbsp;mg, 300
mg, or 600 mg). Randomization made use of an adaptive design, whereby one quarter of subjects were assigned placebo and one-eighth were assigned sumatriptan; the remainder were assigned to one of six
rimegepant groups based on a Bayesian analysis of the observed response rates. Subjects were instructed to treat one migraine of moderate to severe pain intensity and return to the clinic within seven
days. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
total of 885 subjects were randomized and 812 completed the study (the remaining subjects did not experience a migraine during the treatment phase of the trial). Key entry criteria
included: age 18 to 65 inclusive with at least a one-year history of migraine beginning prior to 50&nbsp;years of age; migraine attacks lasting four to 72&nbsp;hours if left untreated; not more
than eight attacks per month of moderate or greater severity over the prior three months; and less than 15 total headache days per month (migraine plus non-migraine) in each of the three preceding
months. </FONT></P>

were given an electronic diary to record improvements and returned to the study site within seven days of study treatment for review of the data. Patients who experienced relief
of headache pain to a mild intensity or pain-free intensity level at two hours post-dosing were considered to be responders. The patients who did not experience such relief at the end of two hours
were permitted to use an approved rescue medication. Use of rescue medication within 48&nbsp;hours was also recorded. Whatever the case, the patient was required to continue to complete his or her
electronic diary for up to 48&nbsp;hours after dosing. Secondary efficacy variables included total migraine freedom: a composite endpoint consisting of freedom from headache pain coupled with no
symptoms of photophobia, phonophobia or nausea, at two hours post-dosing, and sustained pain freedom from two-to-24&nbsp;hours. Exploratory measures included pain relief at two hours post-dosing,
sustained pain relief from two-to-24&nbsp;hours post-dosing, freedom from photophobia, phonophobia or nausea at two hours post-dosing, and sustained pain freedom from two-to-48&nbsp;hours

of liver enzyme measured in a liver function test to detect damage and inflammation to the liver. The subject in the rimegepant 75 mg dose group had peak alanine transaminase ("ALT") and aspartate
transaminase ("AST") elevations that were less than 1.22 times the upper limit of normal ("ULN") and reported as an AE, while the placebo subject had a total bilirubin level that was greater than
2xULN. No subjects in the Phase&nbsp;2b trial had AST or ALT elevation that exceeded 3xULN, a level that is considered to be a potentially meaningful indicator of a drug's potential to cause severe

Phase&nbsp;3 Clinical Trial Development Plan  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the results of the Phase&nbsp;2 clinical trial, we elected to advance the 75 mg dose of rimegepant in our Phase&nbsp;3 clinical
trials. According to FDA 2014 draft guidance for developing
drugs for acute treatment of migraine, approval for this indication has historically involved the demonstration of an effect on four co-primary endpoints: pain, nausea, photophobia and phonophobia.
More recently, the agency has considered an alternate approach and in the recently published FDA 2018 formal guidance indicated as the "preferred approach" for approval based on an effect at
2&nbsp;hours on headache pain freedom and freedom from a patient's most bothersome migraine symptom, or MBS, selected as either nausea, photophobia or phonophobia. Using this approach, the two
co-primary endpoints would be (1)&nbsp;having no headache pain at two hours after dosing and (2)&nbsp;a demonstrated effect on freedom from the MBS at two hours after dosing. Regardless of the
associated symptom identified as most bothersome, the FDA guidance states that all three important migraine symptoms (nausea, photophobia and phonophobia) should be assessed as secondary endpoints. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
had an end of Phase&nbsp;2 meeting with the FDA in March 2017 and we commenced two Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trials in July 2017. We completed enrollment in these trials in November
2017. Approximately 3,000 patients were enrolled and 2,300 patients randomized across these two Phase&nbsp;3 trials. We expect to receive topline results from both of these trials in the first
quarter of 2018. Additionally, in November 2017, we also received agreement from the FDA on an initial pediatric study plan. We submitted a request for scientific advice to CHMP for rimegepant in
February of 2018, and we anticipate receiving feedback in the first half of 2018. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both
Phase&nbsp;3 trials conform to the FDA guidance for approval in acute treatment of migraine. The trials are double-blinded, randomized, and placebo-controlled. The trials
recruited male and female patients 18-65&nbsp;years of age with at least a one year history of migraine, including an age of onset prior to 50, migraine attacks that last about four to
72&nbsp;hours, not more than eight attacks of moderate to severe intensity per month within the last three months and not less than two attacks per month. Our goal was to enroll patients who
represent the spectrum of real-world migraineurs, including those who have previously been non-responsive to triptans, as the FDA stated to us at our end of Phase&nbsp;2 meeting that
triptan-resistant patients may benefit from rimegepant treatment. We also enrolled patients who have cardiovascular risk factors and/or vascular disease. The primary objective of the trials is to
evaluate the efficacy of 75 mg of rimegepant compared with placebo in the acute treatment of migraine as measured by two co-primary endpoints: (1)&nbsp;pain freedom (headache pain intensity level
reported as "no pain") at two hours after dosing using a four-point numeric rating scale (no pain, mild pain, moderate pain, severe pain) and (2)&nbsp;freedom from the MBS at two hours after dosing.
The three other important migraine symptoms (nausea, photophobia and phonophobia) will be assessed as secondary endpoints, consistent with FDA guidance. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In designing the Phase&nbsp;3 trials, care was taken to minimize any changes in study populations compared to the already completed Phase&nbsp;2 trial with
rimegepant with no major changes in inclusion and exclusion criteria between the completed and planned trials. The main differences in trial design between the previous Phase&nbsp;2 trials and our
ongoing Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trials include: </FONT></P>

<UL>
<DL compact>
<DT style='font-family:times;margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>1.</FONT></DT><DD style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><I>Change in the primary outcome measure and statistical analysis plan to conform to recent FDA
guidance</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Phase&nbsp;2b trial identified pain freedom at two hours as the primary outcome measure and included various secondary and exploratory outcome
measures to assess the associated symptoms of nausea, photophobia and phonophobia. The Phase&nbsp;3 trials utilize pain freedom and freedom from MBS at two hours after dosing as co-primary
endpoints. In addition, to conform to recent FDA developments, and confirmed in our recent regulatory interactions, we intend to analyze the data collected in our Phase&nbsp;3 trials on a
non-completer-equals-failure (NC=F) basis, rather than on a last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF) basis used in the Phase&nbsp;2b trial;

sumatriptan and placebo arms. The Phase&nbsp;3 trials only include 75 mg rimegepant versus placebo, since 75 mg rimegepant was identified as the lowest dose in the Phase&nbsp;2b trial at which
improvements were observed in the four key migraine symptoms; and
<BR><BR></FONT></DD><DT style='font-family:times;margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>3.</FONT></DT><DD style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><I>Increase in sample size</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two Phase&nbsp;3 trials enrolled approximately 3,000 patients with the aim
of treating around 550 patients per arm with placebo or 75 mg rimegepant, respectively, in each trial; whereas in the Phase&nbsp;2b trial 203 patients received placebo and just under
100&nbsp;patients per arm received rimegepant. This increase in sample size is expected to support statistical comparisons on both primary and secondary endpoints. </FONT></DD></DL>
</UL>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This
change in the hierarchy of outcome measures, sample size and number of treatment arms reflect somewhat standard changes in clinical trial design to increase technical and regulatory
chances of success in the registrational program. We also developed a commercial-grade, tablet formulation of rimegepant that we are using in our Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trials. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
August 2017, we commenced a long-term safety study to meet FDA requirements for approval. This study will be a 12-month, long-term, open label safety study conducted in patients with
migraine. Two thousand patients will be treated in this study. A subset of approximately 600 patients will have a history of more frequent migraine attacks (i.e.,&nbsp;more than eight migraine
attacks per month) and will be able to take up to 30 doses of 75 mg rimegepant in one month. At our end of Phase&nbsp;2 meeting, the FDA stated its desire to see a safety study in which patients
received daily or near-daily dosing of rimegepant for at least three months. This desire stems from the FDA's concern about a potential liver signal with the class of CGRP antagonists. The FDA stated
that any risk of liver injury has to be very low and that exposure with the drug has to be sufficient to cap the risk of liver injury at a level acceptable for the migraine population. We believe the
design of our long-term safety study may adequately address this concern by providing for the enrollment of approximately 600 patients who experience nine to fourteen migraine episodes per month and
will be allowed to use rimegepant on a daily basis, which we believe will generate safety data with respect to long-term, frequent use of rimegepant. Importantly, we believe this study design, where
patients are allowed to take up to 30&nbsp;doses of 75 mg rimegepant in one month, embraces the FDA guidance for conduct of a long-term safety trial during which patients can treat all acute
migraine episodes with the investigational drug. Study visits for all patients will be monthly for the first three months and every three months thereafter. Based on feedback we received at our end of
Phase&nbsp;2 meeting with the FDA, we will administer liver function testing at two weeks post-dose and will follow patients with any abnormal liver function tests until clinical resolution. We
expect sufficient clinical data needed for filing an NDA for rimegepant will be available by the end of 2018. As of December&nbsp;31, 2017, approximately 1,100 patients are enrolled in this study,
and we expect enrollment to be complete in the first half of 2018. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those
suffering from migraine often have accompanying nausea and have an aversion to consuming food or liquids during an attack. We are also developing an oral solid dosage formulation
of rimegepant that disperses almost instantly in the mouth, without the need for water. The Zydis ODT formulation uniquely addresses this issue. Biohaven has exclusive worldwide rights to the Zydis
ODT fast-dissolving formulation for the development of rimegepant through a January 2018 license agreement with Catalent. The agreement also provides exclusivity with respect to other small molecule
CGRP receptor antagonists with the Zydis ODT technology. In February 2018, a bioequivalence study was conducted to compare this new ODT formulation to the tablet in current clinical development and
provided evidence of equivalence. A third Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trial with rimegepant commenced in February 2018. This study, utilizing the new ODT formulation, is designed to replicate the other
two ongoing Phase&nbsp;3 trials. The trial compares placebo to 75 mg of the ODT formulation and will randomize approximately 850 patients with migraine to evaluate approximately 425 patients per
treatment arm. We expect to complete this Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trial in the fourth quarter 2018. </FONT></P>

Clinical Trials with Rimegepant  </I></FONT></P>

</UL>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of March&nbsp;2, 2018, thirteen clinical trials have been completed (enrollment and treatment completed) in healthy volunteers and patients
with migraine that inform pharmacokinetic, metabolic interactions, safety, tolerability and efficacy of rimegepant. Rimegepant has been observed to be generally safe and well tolerated in humans when
given as single oral doses up to the maximum dose of 1500 mg and multiple oral doses up to the maximum daily dose of 600 mg for 14&nbsp;days. No deaths have occurred in clinical trials to date.
Currently, there are three ongoing Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trials, one Phase&nbsp;2/3 long-term safety study as well as two ongoing Phase&nbsp;1 clinical trials, with one more Phase&nbsp;1
expected to commence in the second quarter of 2018. These Phase&nbsp;1 trials included evaluation of important drug-drug interactions looking at the effect of administering itraconazole, rifampin or
fluconazole on the pharmacokinetics ("PK") of rimegepant. Also included are population studies to evaluate any differences seen in PK in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, as well as
differences in PK that could be seen in the elderly. We expect to initiate a cardiac conduction study ("TQT study") in 2018. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior
to the initiation of our Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trials, approximately 687 subjects had been dosed with rimegepant. In Phase&nbsp;1 and 2b trials, approximately 600 subjects have
received single doses of rimegepant, ranging from 25 mg to 1500 mg; and approximately 87 subjects have received multiple doses of rimegepant, ranging from 75 mg to 600 mg daily for up to
14&nbsp;days. In total, we believe the current data suggests a favorable benefit-risk profile for rimegepant in the acute treatment of migraine attacks. The clinical experience with rimegepant to
date has allowed the characterization of safety and tolerability at substantial multiples of the intended therapeutic dose and intended frequency of use. Rimegepant has been assessed in single doses
up to 1500 mg and in multiple doses from 75 mg to 600&nbsp;mg with 14&nbsp;days of dosing (including 300 mg twice daily), where the higher doses yielded exposures more than 54 times greater in
area under the curve ("AUC"), which is a measure of drug exposure, and 23 times higher in C<SUB>max</SUB>, which is the peak concentration that a drug achieves after dosing, as compared to the mean
therapeutic exposure of a single 75 mg dose. These high exposure multiples were observed to be generally well tolerated. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
completed rimegepant trials for which the results have been unblinded, as of March&nbsp;2, 2018, three SAEs have been reported in rimegepant-treated patients. None of these SAEs
were considered to be related to study drug: one subject had an SAE of severe post-lumbar puncture headache seven days after exposure to a single dose of rimegepant that was considered unrelated to
study treatment, one subject had stress related cardiomyopathy that occurred 8&nbsp;days after a single dose of rimegepant that was considered unrelated to study treatment, and one subject had an
SAE of moderate pneumonia with onset five days after exposure to a single dose of rimegepant that was considered unrelated to study treatment. In addition, one subject who received placebo experienced
an SAE (appendicitis). </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since
no data are available regarding the effects of rimegepant on human fetuses or newborns, women of childbearing potential must use adequate birth control and have a negative serum or
urine pregnancy test to be eligible to receive rimegepant. Female subjects should avoid attempts at pregnancy in the month prior to exposure to rimegepant and eight weeks after exposure to rimegepant.
All urine pregnancy testing results must be confirmed by serum pregnancy testing. Drug interaction studies with oral contraceptives demonstrated modest increase in exposure to estrogen and
norelgestromin upon multiple doses of rimegepant 75 mg. Co-administration of rimegepant with oral contraceptives was safe and well tolerated. These results enabled enrollment of women of child bearing
potential receiving oral contraceptives to be enrolled in the Phase&nbsp;3 studies. </FONT></P>

Nonclinical Toxicology  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rimegepant is not genotoxic or phototoxic and has a low potential for off-target receptor interactions or effects on the cardiovascular,
respiratory, and CNS systems. With repeated dosing up to three months, rimegepant was clinically tolerated at up to 150 mg/kg/day in rats and 100 mg/kg/day in monkeys. No histopathologic liver
findings were noted in monkeys treated for 3&nbsp;months at all doses (the highest dose yielded an AUC exposure that was 120&times; the anticipated human AUC at a therapeutic dose of 75
mg/day). The liver was the primary target organ in mice at levels of 100&nbsp;mg/kg/day and greater and in rats at levels of 60 mg/kg/day and greater. These dosing levels were not associated with
hepatocellular degeneration/necrosis, inflammation, or fibrosis. In monkeys treated for 3&nbsp;months, target organ effects were limited to minimal to moderate macrophage accumulation
(histiocytosis) in mandibular and mesenteric lymph nodes (considered to be a marginal exacerbation of a common spontaneous change in this species) at <FONT FACE="SYMBOL">&#179;</FONT> 100
mg/kg/day. Hepatic lipidosis identified in mouse and rat studies was determined to be rodent specific as it was not observed at rimegepant exposures in monkeys which overlapped those producing lipid
effects in rats in the three-month pivotal studies. At the NOEL (no observable effect level) and NOAEL (no observable adverse effect level) doses in rats (30 mg/kg/day) and monkeys (50 mg/kg/day) in
the three-month
studies, mean (male and female combined) AUC exposures were at least 23&times; (for rats) and 56&times; (for monkeys) the anticipated human AUC at a 75 mg/day clinical dose. Since fetal
effects in rats were observed only at doses that produced maternal toxicity (300 mg/kg/day) and there were no fetal findings in rabbits at any dose level, rimegepant is not considered to be a
selective developmental toxicant. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
a 6-month rat study, animals were administered rimegepant orally at daily doses of 0, 20, or 45&nbsp;mg/kg/day. The NOAEL was the high dose, 45 mg/kg/day with no evidence of
toxicity at any dose. In a 9-month cynomolgus monkey study, animals were administered rimegepant orally at daily doses of 0, 15 or 50 mg/kg/day. The NOAEL was the high dose, 50 mg/kg/day with no
evidence of toxicity at any dose level. Chronic administration to rats (6&nbsp;months) and monkeys (9&nbsp;months) demonstrated NOAEL values at doses of 45 and 50 mg/kg/day, respectively.
Exposures were at least 29X (rat) and 17X (monkey) the anticipated human AUC at a 75 mg/day clinical dose. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clinical
monitoring for potential hepatotoxicity has been and will continue to be conducted in subsequent studies in humans. Such monitoring will include routine liver function tests
including ALT, AST, total bilirubin, GGT and ALP at all study phases, including screening (before exposure to rimegepant), regularly during exposure, and after exposure. Additionally, the frequency,
severity, and discontinuations of hepatic-related AEs are monitored closely. All cases of DILI are reported as SAEs. There have been no reported cases of DILI with rimegepant administration to date.
Other symptoms or target organs from nonclinical studies that will continue to be followed include skeletal muscle effects, emesis, skin rash and hematology measures. We expect to complete the ongoing
two-year carcinogenicity study in the fourth quarter of 2018 and receive the study report in 2019. </FONT></P>

Our Product Candidate BHV-3500, a CGRP Receptor Antagonist for Acute Treatment and Prevention of
Migraine  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BHV-3500 is the second compound from our CGRP receptor antagonist platform. We are developing BHV-3500 for the acute treatment and prevention of
migraine, and we believe it has the potential to improve the existing standard of care based on the following benefits:</FONT></P>

inhalation or potential oral routes of administration with rapid onset of treatment effect, compared to the anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies ("mAbs") that are currently in development which have a more
cumbersome route of administration to patients in the form of intravenous or subcutaneous use. The first formulation of BHV-3500 entering the clinic is for intranasal delivery that will be assessed
for rapid onset of action in the acute treatment of migraine. </FONT><FONT SIZE=2>
<BR><BR></FONT></DD><DT style='font-family:times;margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><B>Favorable Safety Profile</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&#151;Like rimegepant, we believe BHV-3500 will have a favorable
safety and tolerability profile in the clinic, attributable to multiple properties such as its high selectivity for the CGRP receptor, low propensity to aggregate in lipids, and its expected excretion
from the body in a largely unchanged state. Unlike other small molecule CGRP receptor antagonists that show potential for liver effects at high exposures, BHV-3500 has not demonstrated any propensity
for liver abnormalities in preclinical studies to date, even at very high dose levels. Because preventative treatments involve chronic dosing on a daily basis, any potential target organ effects on
the liver could be problematic. Therefore, based on these observations from nonclinical toxicology studies, we believe that BHV-3500 may provide a substantial benefit over other agents with such
propensities. In addition, in preclinical studies of BHV-3500, no significant cardiovascular safety or systemic toxicity issues were observed, in contrast to sumatriptan, which displays dose-dependent
vasoconstriction. </FONT><FONT SIZE=2>
<BR><BR></FONT></DD><DT style='font-family:times;margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><B>Superior Chemical Attributes</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&#151;BHV-3500 is a highly soluble, potent antagonist at the
human CGRP receptor. Because BHV-3500 exhibits an </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>in vitro</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> and </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>in vivo</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> efficacy profile similar to
rimegepant, we believe that BHV-3500 will also have a comprehensive (pain, nausea, photophobia and phonophobia) and durable efficacy profile. The chemical attributes of BHV-3500 also allow for a
variety of formulations that may provide a more rapid onset of efficacy. Unlike mAbs, which are large biologic molecules, BHV-3500 is a small molecule that directly binds with high potency to the CGRP
receptor. </FONT><FONT SIZE=2>
<BR><BR></FONT></DD><DT style='font-family:times;margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><B>Higher Value to Patients and Payors with Lower Expected Cost Compared to
Biologics</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&#151;We expect that as a small molecule, BHV-3500 will have a lower cost of goods than mAbs, which are biologics. </FONT><FONT SIZE=2>
<BR><BR></FONT></DD><DT style='font-family:times;margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><B>Potential for Multiple Indications</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&#151;Although its nonclinical safety and efficacy
profile suggests BHV-3500's potential for daily administration and development for prevention of migraine, this compound also has the potential to be developed in the acute treatment of migraine.
BHV-3500 adds flexibility to our CGRP development program as a stand-alone agent for prevention therapy or a complementary/backup intranasal formulation for rapid onset of action in the acute
treatment of migraine. </FONT></DD></DL>
</UL>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
believe BHV-3500 has the potential to address a significant unmet need in the acute treatment of migraines in patients with both episodic and chronic migraine, as well as compete
effectively with current and future migraine prevention therapies. BHV-3500 may afford multiple routes of delivery including intranasal delivery and daily oral administration for acute and
preventative treatment of migraine, potential for enhanced safety profile, superior chemical attributes and a higher value to patients and payors with lower expected costs compared to large molecule
biologics in current development. </FONT></P>

is an important neurotransmitter present in over 90% of all brain synapses and is a naturally occurring molecule that nerve cells use to send signals to other cells in the
central nervous system. Glutamate plays an essential role in normal brain functioning and its levels must be tightly regulated. Abnormalities in glutamate function can disrupt nerve health and
communication, and in extreme cases may lead to nerve cell death. Nerve cell dysfunction and death leads to devastating diseases, including ataxia, ALS and other neurodegenerative disorders. Glutamate
clearance is necessary for proper synaptic activation and to prevent neuronal damage from excessive activation of glutamate receptors. Excitatory amino-acid transporters ("EAATs"), help regulate
glutamate clearance, and are responsible for most of the glutamate uptake within the brain. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
mechanism of action of our glutamate platform is depicted below. Glutamate must be tightly regulated once released from a pre-synaptic neuron and acts as a signaling neurotransmitter
to stimulate the post-synaptic neuron via stimulation of glutamate receptors (e.g.,&nbsp;NMDA, AMPA or Kainate receptors). Glial cells surrounding the synaptic junction are predominantly responsible
for clearing glutamate through transporters, the EAATs. There are five distinct types of glutamate transporters. (1)&nbsp;As depicted in the glial cell to the right of the figure below, BHV-0223 and
trigriluzole increase the activity of the EAATs to increase the clearance of glutamate and decrease glutamate release from the pre-synaptic neuron. Trigriluzole and BHV-0223 also inhibit presynaptic
ion channels that may inhibit the release of glutamate from presynaptic neurons. (2)&nbsp;As depicted in the postsynaptic neuron to the bottom of the figure below, BHV-5000 blocks glutamate
signaling that is mediated by post-synaptic NMDA receptors. Modulating glutamate also has the potential to be neuroprotective and increase the release of neurotrophic factors, including brain derived
neurotrophic factor ("BDNF") </FONT></P>

Glutamate Transporter Modulation  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abnormal glutamate release or dysfunction of glutamate clearance can cause overstimulation of glutamate receptors which can lead to a dangerous
neural injury called excitotoxicity, which has been associated with a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases. The FDA has approved anti-excitotoxicity drugs that act on the glutamatergic system by
blocking NMDA receptors, such as memantine ("Namenda") for Alzheimer's disease, lamotrigine ("Lamictal") for epilepsy and bipolar disorder and riluzole ("Rilutek") for ALS. Although these drugs show
the therapeutic potential of glutamate receptor antagonists in the treatment of a range of neurological diseases, many of these approved drugs have serious side effects and other drawbacks that we
have attempted to solve with our development of BHV-0223 and trigriluzole. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
are currently developing trigriluzole as a potential FDA-approved drug treatment option for patients suffering from OCD, Alzheimer's disease and ataxia (initially focusing on SCA). A
Phase&nbsp;2 double-blind, randomized controlled trial on the use of trigriluzole in OCD commenced in late 2017 and enrollment is expected to complete in 2018. In addition, a Phase&nbsp;2
double-blind, randomized controlled trial of trigriluzole in the treatment of mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease is being advanced in collaboration with the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study, a
consortium of sites funded by the National Institutes of Health. We expect that this trial will begin in the first half of 2018. The 48-week extension phase of the SCA Phase&nbsp;2/3 trial is
ongoing, and we expect to receive the data from that portion of the trial by the end of 2018. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OCD
is a chronic neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by symptoms of obsessions (intrusive thoughts) and compulsions (repetitive behaviors) that can interfere with patients'
functional abilities. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, the 12-month prevalence of OCD is 1% of the U.S. adult population, and approximately half of these cases are characterized
as severe. First-line treatment for OCD includes cognitive behavior therapy, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ("SSRIs") and adjunctive use of atypical antipsychotics. Nonetheless, up to 60% of
patients have an inadequate response to conventional intervention strategies. While SSRIs and atypical antipsychotics have been approved for OCD, the majority of patients do not have an adequate
response to pharmacologic treatment, and some seek invasive neurosurgical procedures to ameliorate symptoms. Despite the significant public health burden, no novel mechanisms of action have been

for OCD in over two decades. The rationale for use of trigriluzole in OCD is supported by clinical data with its active metabolite, riluzole, in populations with OCD in open-label and
placebo-controlled clinical trials as well as in preclinical, genetic and neuroimaging studies implicating the glutamatergic hyperactivity in the pathogenesis of OCD. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alzheimer's
disease is the most common form of dementia, characterized by symptoms of progressive memory loss and impairment in other areas of cognition. According to the Alzheimer's
Association, approximately 5.5&nbsp;million people in the United States are affected by the disease and, with the aging population, that number is expected to triple by 2050. We believe the
rationale for the study of trigriluzole in Alzheimer's disease is supported by preclinical studies on the active metabolite, riluzole, in multiple relevant preclinical models and our own clinical data
from the Phase&nbsp;2/3 clinical trial on the potential of trigriluzole to overcome limitations of administering riluzole. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SCA
represents an orphan disease. According to a 2016 report by Orphanet cataloging the prevalence and incidence of rare diseases, SCA affects approximately 22,000 individuals in the
United States. We have received both orphan drug designation and fast track designation from the FDA for trigriluzole for the treatment of SCA. In October 2017, we reported topline data from the
8-week randomization period from the Phase&nbsp;2/3 clinical trial in SCA. At the eight week time point, trigriluzole did not statistically differentiate from placebo. Post-hoc analyses suggested
the potential for favorable therapeutic effects of trigriluzole, based on numerically superior treatment effects compared to placebo in groups of subjects with less inherent pre-randomization
variability on the primary endpoint and also in those, who based on baseline characteristics, would be expected to have greater drug exposures. In the trial, we observed a favorable safety and
tolerability profile. For example, no subjects demonstrated an elevation of liver transaminases of 3-fold or greater than the upper limit of normal; whereas, a similar exposure of the active
metabolite, riluzole, is associated with about an 8% rate of such elevations, based on the Rilutek Prescribing Information. The 48-week extension phase of the SCA trial is ongoing, and we are
continuing to assess the data from the trial. Based on post-hoc analyses we are in active dialogue with the FDA to discuss the potential for further development of trigriluzole in ataxias and the FDA
has expressed willingness to accept a modification of our trial's primary endpoint, the Scale for Assessment and Rating of Ataxia ("SARA"), as an acceptable registrational endpoint. Future development
of trigriluzole in ataxia will be based on these interactions and results from the extension phase of the ongoing Phase&nbsp;2/3 trial. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition, preclinical and small-scale pilot studies are underway to explore trigriluzole's use in the treatment of a pipeline of other indications such as essential tremor,
psychiatric disorders including anxiety and depression as well as some cancers whose spread is thought mediated by glutamate transmission, such as melanoma and glioblastoma. We are also developing
analogs of trigriluzole and other related prodrugs for potential use in these indications. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
are currently developing BHV-0223 for the treatment of ALS. According to the ALS Association, ALS affects up to 20,000 individuals in the United States and according to industry data,
we estimate 15,000 individuals are clinically diagnosed, with 7,500 ALS patients actively treated with generic riluzole or branded Rilutek. As the first of two drugs approved by the FDA for the
treatment of ALS and the only drug to extend life and/or time to tracheostomy, riluzole is the established standard of care. However, while the market is highly genericized, there have not been
further clinical improvements or advances in ALS riluzole therapeutics since the FDA's approval in 1995. In addition, the use of riluzole is limited by a number of non-desirable attributes. We have
received orphan drug designation from the FDA for BHV-0223 in ALS and we have observed results suggesting bioequivalence to Rilutek in a recently completed Phase&nbsp;1 clinical trial. We believe
that BHV-0223, if approved, could gain meaningful market share based on its favorable formulation attributes. </FONT></P>

severely physically and cognitively impaired. Rett syndrome affects approximately 15,000 individuals in the United States. No approved drug therapies for Rett syndrome are currently available and care
is supportive. The rationale for the study of BHV-5000 in Rett syndrome is based on results of studies with BHV-5000, its active metabolite and ketamine in preclinical mouse models, in which
improvement in key clinical features of the disease have been observed, including a reduction in the frequency of episodes of respiratory suppression. These preclinical findings are supported by
anecdotal clinical reports regarding the use of ketamine, another NMDA receptor antagonist, in patients with Rett syndrome that have been reported to also show clinical improvements. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trigriluzole is a new chemical entity ("NCE") and tripeptide prodrug of the active metabolite, riluzole. Based on its mechanism of action,
preclinical data and clinical studies, trigriluzole has potential for therapeutic benefit in a range of neurological and neuropsychiatric illnesses. Initial development has focused on its use in
treating SCA, an orphan neurological indication that currently has no approved drug therapies and for which the active metabolite, riluzole, has demonstrated preliminary efficacy in two prior
randomized controlled trials conducted by third parties. We acquired trigriluzole from ALS Biopharma,&nbsp;LLC ("ALS Biopharma"), and Fox Chase Chemical Diversity Center,&nbsp;Inc. ("FCCDC"),
along with an estate of over 300 prodrugs. A prodrug is a compound that, after administration, is metabolized in the body into an active drug. Trigriluzole is actively transported by virtue of
recognition of its tripeptide moiety by the PepT1 transporter in the gut, and is responsible for the increased bioavailability of the drug. Once inside the body, the prodrug, trigriluzole is cleaved
by enzymes in the blood to the active metabolite riluzole. To mitigate the limitations of riluzole, several classes of prodrugs were designed, synthesized, and evaluated in multiple </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>in vitro</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> stability
assays that predict </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>in vivo</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> drug levels. Trigriluzole is a third generation of
prodrug development and the product of six years of intensive chemistry efforts. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Riluzole

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
prodrug design and selected administration pathway that was pursued with trigriluzole is intended to address all of these limitations of riluzole. In addition, a prodrug can be
engineered to enhance absorption and protect from diminished absorption when taken with meals. The trigriluzole preclinical development strategy was based on optimizing </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>in
vivo</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> and </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>in vitro</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> features, such as stability in gastrointestinal and stomach fluids; stability in liver microsomes; favorable
safety pharmacology with respect to off-target effects (particularly liver effects); metabolic cleavage in the plasma to release the active moiety; and enhanced gastrointestinal absorption properties.
In </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>in vivo</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> studies in rodents, the intended benefits of this optimization program were observed, including delayed peak concentrations and greater
exposure. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After
six years of chemistry development and preclinical testing, the resulting lead prodrug from the chemistry program was trigriluzole. Trigriluzole is chemically comprised of riluzole
linked via an amide bond to a tripeptide that is a substrate for gut transporters (PepT1) and which contributes to its improved bioavailability. The tripeptide moiety is cleaved by plasma
aminopeptidases, releasing riluzole and naturally occurring amino acids, which we believe are readily managed by endogenous metabolic routes. We believe that the estate of compounds we acquired,
combined with our internally developed intellectual property, will provide a significant barrier to entry from competitors. Trigriluzole is stable in fluids from the gastrointestinal tract and
expected to have a differentiated profile with regard to any liability for hepatic effects. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SCA
was chosen as the lead indication based on a strong preclinical rationale as well as demonstration of preliminary efficacy of trigriluzole's active metabolite, riluzole, in two

Overview of Ataxias and Limitations of Current Treatment  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ataxias are a group of degenerative diseases of the nervous system, including hereditary ataxias and sporadic ataxias. According to the National
Ataxia Foundation, the word "ataxia" originates from a Greek word meaning "without order" or "incoordination" and aptly describes many of the symptoms that are experienced by people who suffer from
the many forms of ataxia, including problems with coordination, balance and movement which can affect a person's fingers, hands, arms, legs, body, speech and eye movements. Ataxias are generally
classified as being either hereditary or sporadic. Hereditary ataxias are degenerative disorders that progress over a number of years. The hereditary ataxias include autosomal dominant forms, such as
SCA, episodic ataxias and dentratorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy, and autosomal recessive forms, such as Friedreich's ataxia, fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome and ataxia-telangiectasia.
Sporadic ataxias are generally idiopathic, do not run in families and have an onset later in life. Sporadic ataxias share many clinical features of the hereditary forms, which is thought to be
attributable to similar underlying cerebellar dysfunction. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although
symptoms may vary, the typical clinical course of SCA might be described as follows. Balance and coordination are affected first. Incoordination of hands, arms, and legs, and
slurring of speech are other common, early symptoms. Over time, individuals with SCA may develop numbness, tingling, or pain in the arms and legs (sensory neuropathy), uncontrolled muscle tensing
(dystonia), muscle wasting (atrophy), and muscle twitches (fasciculations). Walking becomes difficult and is characterized by walking with feet placed further apart to compensate for poor balance.
Impaired coordination of the arms and hands affects the ability to perform tasks requiring fine motor control such as writing and eating. Rarely, rigidity, tremors, and involuntary jerking movements
(chorea) have been reported in people who have been affected for many years. As time goes on, ataxia can affect speech and swallowing. Finally, individuals with SCA may also have difficulty
processing, learning, and remembering information (cognitive impairment). Notably, there can also be significant clinical variation in the order and extent of symptom expression between mutations,
within a common mutation, and even within a kindred that shares the same genotype. Non-cerebellar involvement may also occur in many SCA subtypes (such as cognition, pyramidal, extrapyramidal, motor
neuron, peripheral nerve or macular involvement). Signs and symptoms of SCA typically begin in early adulthood, but can appear anytime from childhood to late adulthood; SCA is degenerative and
progresses over a number of years. The neurodegeneration is attributed to the production of abnormal proteins that cause the affected nerve cells, predominantly cerebellar purkinje fibers, to
eventually function poorly and ultimately degenerate. As SCA progresses, coordination problems become more pronounced. Atrophy of the cerebellum and sometimes brainstem may be apparent on brain
imaging. The diagnosis of SCA requires the exclusion of acquired, non-genetic causes of ataxia, such as </FONT></P>

Phase&nbsp;1 Trials with Trigriluzole  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July 2016, we began a Phase&nbsp;1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and PK of single
and multiple ascending doses of trigriluzole in normal healthy volunteers. In this study, the initial safety and tolerability of trigriluzole at single doses ranging from 9.5&nbsp;mg to
200&nbsp;mg and multiple doses ranging from 35 mg to 200 mg daily were assessed. Fifty-eight healthy volunteers have been dosed with trigriluzole and 20 have been dosed with placebo. Based on
preliminary data, both single and multiple doses up to 200 mg have been well tolerated without evidence of novel, clinically significant safety signals or lab abnormalities. There is no apparent dose
response regarding the frequency or severity of AEs. In the blinded group, including subjects treated with both placebo and trigriluzole, the most common AEs were headache (five subjects, two with
moderate severity and three with mild severity) and constipation (two subjects). No pattern of AEs or lab abnormalities has become apparent to provide specific cautions or to suggest cautions beyond
what is appropriate for the active metabolite, riluzole. Preliminary results suggest approximately 25% to 30% greater systemic exposure of the active metabolite via oral administration of trigriluzole
as compared to riluzole tablets. In addition, the time to peak concentration of the active metabolite via oral administration of trigriluzole was extended relative to that achieved with oral riluzole
tablets, thus suggesting the mitigation of first-pass metabolism. A cross-over arm of the trial assessing fed and fasted conditions suggested no food effect. These pharmacokinetic properties
differentiate from direct oral
administration of the active metabolite. These preliminary safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic data support advancement of trigriluzole. Commencing in December 2017, an additional single and
multiple dose study was conducted to assess the safety, tolerability and PK of a 280 mg dose in 10 healthy young and elderly volunteers (8 active; 2 placebo). Preliminary results support adequate
safety and tolerability and yielded mean exposures comparable to what would be expected from a 200 mg dose of Rilutek (based on extrapolation from Chandu 2010), a dose that has been safely used in
clinic populations and associated with efficacy in a range of disorders in randomized controlled trials (Huntington Study Group Neurology 2003; Lacomblez Neurology 1996). In addition, a bioequivalence
study was conducted to bridge a commercial formulation with a Phase&nbsp;2/3 formulation in 32 healthy volunteers. The commercial formulation was well-tolerated and provided bioequivalent exposure
with the Phase&nbsp;2/3 formulation. Exposures from these recent Phase&nbsp;1 studies are consistent with an absolute bioavailability of approximately 85% or greater, based on known absolute
bioavailabilty of Rilutek of 60%. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based
on the results of our Phase&nbsp;1 trial with trigriluzole and two third-party academic trials that have shown preliminary efficacy of riluzole in cerebellar ataxias, we advanced
trigriluzole into a Phase&nbsp;2/3 clinical trial for SCA. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Phase&nbsp;2/3 trial has two periods: an 8-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase followed by a 48-week open-label treatment. The study is being conducted at
approximately 15 sites in the United States. The design of the trial was informed predominantly by an advisory panel of the leading ataxia experts that we hosted in February 2016 as well as the
observations from peer-reviewed publications in the scientific literature. 141 subjects were randomized to receive a once-daily dose of either placebo or 140 mg trigriluzole. Patients were stratified
by diagnosis (genotype) and baseline severity (as measured by the patient's gait SARA score of <FONT FACE="SYMBOL">&#163;</FONT>4 and &gt;4). The primary outcome measure </FONT></P>

the trial is the change from baseline in patient SARA score after eight weeks of treatment. The choice of the SARA, a validated scale, as the primary outcome measure was based on the consensus of a
panel of national experts, based largely on the validation of the instrument in multiple populations, its effective use in demonstrating efficacy in a trial with riluzole (as shown in the Romano study
discussed above), favorable psychometric properties, and its ability to assess a broad spectrum of ataxia-related symptoms. A secondary outcome measure is the patient time to perform an eight-meter
walk test. Exploratory outcome measures include improvement as measured using the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale Part&nbsp;IV on functional assessment, Clinical Global Impression of
Improvement and the Patient Global Impression of Change. Qualifying subjects have genotypically confirmed diagnosis of the most common SCA subtypes. They must have moderate symptom severity
(i.e.,&nbsp;SARA scores of 8 to 30 inclusive and be able to walk eight meters without assistance). Almost all subjects who completed the eight-week treatment phase elected to participate in the
48-week open-label extension phase. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
reported topline data from the 8-week randomization period from the Phase&nbsp;2/3 clinical trial in SCA. At the eight week time point, trigriluzole did not statistically
differentiate from placebo. After eight weeks of treatment, trigriluzole treated subjects demonstrated an improvement of &#150;0.81 points [95% CI: &#150;1.4 to
&#150;0.2] on the SARA versus &#150;1.05 points [95% CI: &#150;1.6 to &#150;0.4] improvement in placebo,
p-value&nbsp;= 0.52. Placebo response in this genetically defined disorder was higher than expected based upon prior European randomized controlled trials in SCA (Romano et al 2015; Ristori et al
2010). Post-hoc analyses suggested the potential for favorable therapeutic effects of trigriluzole, based on numerically superior treatment effects compared to placebo in groups of subjects with less
inherent pre-randomization variability on the primary endpoint and also in those, who based on baseline characteristics, would be expected to have greater drug exposures. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
this trial, we observed a favorable safety and tolerability profile of trigriluzole, with no drug-related SAEs and low discontinuation rates due to AEs. No randomized subjects
demonstrated an elevation of liver transaminases of three-fold or greater than the upper limit of normal; whereas, a similar exposure of the active metabolite, riluzole, is associated with about an 8%
rate of such elevations. We believe that the reduced effects on the liver may be attributable to a higher bioavailability that in part reflects mitigated first-pass liver metabolism and enhanced
PepT1-mediated absorption. Trigriluzole has shown absence of a negative food effect, optimized oral bioavailability and no pattern of clinically significant effects on liver function, presenting a
profile that appears distinct from what is described for riluzole in its U.S. prescribing information. This profile, in context of recent Phase&nbsp;1 data assessing higher doses, will allow for
exploration of higher exposures of the active metabolite than allowed by the current Rilutek label. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Post-hoc
analyses of the data have led to our continued interest in developing trigriluzole in SCA and is also founded on two academic randomized controlled trials studying the active
metabolite or trigriluzole in diverse populations with cerebellar ataxia. In these two publications, the authors conducted studies of riluzole compared to placebo to assess improvement in patients
with ataxias using two different ataxia rating scales. In each study, the authors observed statistically significant improvements in the riluzole treatment groups compared to the placebo groups. </FONT></P>

Development and Regulatory Pathway  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our clinical program for trigriluzole is based on a regulatory pathway under section&nbsp;505(b)(2) of the U.S. Food Drug and Cosmetic Act
that allows reference to data on riluzole for the purpose of safety assessments. In addition, under current FDA interpretations, we believe trigriluzole also qualifies as an NCE and thereby is
eligible for conventional regulatory data exclusivities. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
are in active dialogue with the FDA to discuss the potential for further development of trigriluzole in ataxias and the FDA has expressed willingness to accept a modification of our

Overview of Trigriluzole in OCD  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OCD is a chronic neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by symptoms of obsessions (intrusive thoughts) and compulsions (repetitive behaviors)
that can interfere with patients' functional abilities. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, the 12-month prevalence of OCD is 1% of the U.S. adult population, and approximately half
of these cases are characterized as severe. First-line treatment for OCD includes cognitive behavior therapy, SSRIs and adjunctive use of atypical antipsychotics. Nonetheless, up to 60% of patients
have an inadequate response to conventional intervention strategies. While SSRIs and atypical antipsychotics have been approved for OCD, the majority of patients do not have an adequate response to
pharmacologic treatment, and some seek invasive neurosurgical procedures to ameliorate symptoms. Despite the significant public health burden, no novel mechanisms of action have been approved by the
FDA for OCD in over two decades. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>adults
with OCD conducted by a third party showed favorable trends for the use of riluzole in outpatient settings but not in inpatient settings, a difference possibly attributed to the intensive
therapeutic interactions often available in an inpatient setting. Another randomized controlled third-party study in refractory OCD failed to demonstrate the efficacy of the adjunctive use of riluzole
in 60&nbsp;pediatric patients with refractory OCD. A third randomized controlled third party trial demonstrated statistically significant therapeutic effects with the adjunctive use of riluzole as
compared to adjunctive placebo in 50 adults with refractory OCD. These clinical effects are consistent with findings such as genetic associations of glutamate transporter genes with OCD and increased
glutamate concentrations in brain and cerebrospinal fluid of patients with OCD. Taken together, we believe there is a clear rationale for advancement of trigriluzole or another optimized prodrug of
riluzole from our pipeline into a Phase&nbsp;2 proof-of-concept trial in OCD. </FONT></P>

Overview of Trigriluzole in Alzheimer's Disease  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alzheimer's disease is a progressive, fatal neurodegenerative dementia. It accounts for up to 80% of dementias. According to the Alzheimer's
Association, in 2016 there were approximately 5.5&nbsp;million people in the United States with the disease, and that number is expected to escalate rapidly in the coming years as the population
ages. Observations in multiple preclinical models, suggests the active metabolite of trigriluzole protects from Alzheimer's-related pathology and cognitive dysfunction. Reduced glutamate uptake
transporters have been reported in postmortem brain tissue of individuals with Alzheimer's disease and the level of glutamate transporter reduction correlates with cognitive impairment as well as
markers of synaptic density and neurodegeneration. Preclinical studies also suggest that age-related memory impairment in rats correlates with decreased glutamate transporter expression and this
impairment has been shown to be restored by three-weeks of daily treatment with trigriluzole's active drug metabolite. These findings form our rationale for pursuing a Phase&nbsp;2, proof-of-concept
trial of trigriluzole in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease, which we anticipate beginning in the first half of 2018 in collaboration with the Alzheimer's disease Cooperative Study
("ADCS"). </FONT></P>

pathophysiology of essential tremor ("ET") reflects underlying cerebellar dysfunction. ET is the most common type of tremor, characterized by action and postural tremor in the upper extremities and/or
head and voice tremor. The prevalence of ET is approximately four times that of the second most common tremor disorder, Parkinson's disease. ET can be highly disabling, as many ET patients cannot
write, type, drink, or feed themselves due to tremor. ET is a progressive disease and with time, the tremor becomes more severe and disabling. Currently, only two medications, primidone and
propranolol, are commonly employed as first-line symptomatic treatment of ET, but these are ineffective in 40% of ET patients and none of the available medications are FDA-approved for ET. Therefore,
a novel symptomatic therapy for ET could serve an important unmet medical need for a substantial population. Preclinical studies with trigriluzole in mouse genetic and toxicity models of ataxia have
shown reductions in tremor. Supported by this data, we are developing a Phase&nbsp;2 study of trigriluzole in subjects with ET in collaboration with the Tremor Research Group, a national,

only 43.7% of these patients receiving treatment are receiving minimally adequate treatment, which equates to only 18.9% of those with the disorder. Current first-line treatments include
SSRIs, serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (duloxetine and venlafaxine), benzodiazepines and combinations thereof. Nonetheless, approximately half of patients do not respond adequately to
these therapies and many patients are not amenable to treatment with these agents (e.g.,&nbsp;due to tolerability or predisposition to substance abuse). GAD has significant societal and economic
impact. For example, it is the most common contributor to workplace disability. In addition, patients with GAD utilize high levels of medical services; in addition to visiting psychiatrists to
directly manage symptoms of GAD, patients visit internists and specialty clinicians to evaluate somatic complaints that range from
headaches to fatigue to gastrointestinal distress. Our rationale for potentially advancing trigriluzole into a Phase&nbsp;2 trial in GAD in the future is based on treatment effect in preclinical
models of anxiety as well as favorable open-label case studies of patients treated with riluzole. In one case study, eight of 15 patients demonstrated a remission with a median response time of

Overview of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Limitations of Current Treatments  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ALS is a progressive neurodegenerative motor neuron disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and the spinal cord. The disease belongs to a
group of disorders known as motor neuron diseases, which are characterized by the gradual degeneration and death of motor neurons. ALS affects up to 20,000 individuals in the United States and
typically presents in patients with painless muscle weakness, trouble swallowing and muscle atrophy that ultimately progresses to paralysis, impaired breathing and death. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since
the FDA's approval of riluzole in 1995, only two agents have been approved by the FDA in ALS drug therapeutics and riluzole is the only agent indicated to enhance survival and/or
time to tracheostomy. Several therapies are currently in clinical trials. Riluzole itself has pharmacokinetic and pharmaceutic limitations that have restricted its broader clinical application.
Riluzole tablets have 60% bioavailability, attributed to high first-pass metabolism in the liver that is thought to be mediated via metabolism by the heterogeneously expressed CYP1A2 enzyme. This
metabolic route is also thought to contribute to the high pharmacokinetic variability associated with riluzole. In addition, riluzole is associated with reduced exposure when taken with meals, or a
negative food effect, resulting in the guidance to take riluzole within a period of fasting (one hour before or two hours after a meal) for each of two daily doses. In addition, riluzole has
dose-dependent effects on liver function tests that necessitate periodic liver function test monitoring and is associated with transient liver transaminase elevations. At riluzole daily doses of 100
mg, drug discontinuation is required in 2% to 4% of subjects. However, this has not been observed with lower doses, an important observation as the planned commercial dose of BHV-0223 represents a
lower drug load than the FDA-approved dose of riluzole while delivering similar exposures. The drug substance of riluzole itself has other intrinsic limitations that complicate the ability to produce
non-tablet formulations, including very low solubility in water, poor oral palatability, pH dependent chemical stability and intense oral numbness if administered directly to the oral mucosa. </FONT></P>

Our Clinical Program for BHV-0223 in ALS  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BHV-0223 is a formulation of riluzole designed to advance beyond the limitations of riluzole tablets for application in ALS. BHV-0223 is a
sublingual ODT of riluzole, that makes use of proprietary Zydis ODT technology that we have licensed from Catalent for use with riluzole. Catalent's ODT technology allows us to develop a form of
riluzole that is fast-dissolving and which we expect will mitigate many of the shortcomings associated with the solid oral dosage form of riluzole. Based on over 20&nbsp;years of global clinical
experience with riluzole, we expect that BHV-0223 is likely to be well tolerated in chronic dosing. To date, Biohaven has conducted two Phase&nbsp;1 trials of BHV-0223 in healthy volunteers. </FONT></P>

directly enter the blood stream without passing through the intestines. Since absorption of BHV-0223 occurs through the vasculature under the tongue, we do not anticipate fasting requirements. We

BHV-0223 (40 mg) achieves bioequivalent exposures relative to Rilutek (50 mg). In the study, 138 healthy volunteers were administered BHV-0223 and Rilutek under fasted conditions. In the pre-specified
primary analysis, BHV-0223 achieved area-under-the-curve and peak exposures of approximately 90% and 113%, respectively, compared to those generated by generic riluzole. The 90% confidence intervals

Glutamate NMDA Receptor Antagonism  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An NMDA receptor antagonist is a type of glutamate antagonist that works to inhibit the action of NMDA receptors which may play a role in
degenerative diseases that affect the brain. BHV-5000 is an oral prodrug of the intravenous drug lanicemine, also referred to as BHV-5500, both of which we in-licensed from AstraZeneca AB
("AstraZeneca"). In addition to being orally available, BHV-5000 is a first-in-class, low-trapping, NMDA receptor antagonist with differentiating pharmacologic properties from other agents in
development targeting this receptor. The unique property of low-trapping antagonists is their ability to uncouple from the NMDA receptor more freely than other agents, a property that is thought to
contribute to their mitigated risk of dissociative effects as has been observed in the clinic. Lanicemine, the active metabolite of BHV-5000, binds within the NMDA channel pore and functionally blocks
the flow of charged ions through the NMDA receptor complex. Lanicemine was initially advanced by AstraZeneca into clinical trials for the potential treatment of stroke, but this development was
discontinued as initial results did not warrant continued development for this indication. We are developing BHV-5000 as a potential best-in-class NMDA receptor antagonist for treatment of
neuropsychiatric indications. </FONT></P>

Overview of Rett Syndrome and Limitations of Current Treatments  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rett syndrome is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder resulting from an X-linked dominant gene mutation (MECP2). As a result, it occurs almost
exclusively in females. After six to 18&nbsp;months of apparently normal development, patients with Rett syndrome show global deceleration of psychomotor development and subsequent loss of acquired
cognitive and motor skills, such as the loss of speech. Patients may also develop pathognomonic stereotyped hand movement or display autonomic dysfunction such as breathing irregularities, including
brain-mediated episodes of transient respiratory suppression, or apneic periods. With intensive care, patients may survive into adulthood, yet they are severely physically and cognitively impaired.
Rett syndrome occurs in all racial and ethnic groups and occurs worldwide in approximately 1 in every 10,000 live female births. There are approximately 15,000&nbsp;females with Rett syndrome in the
United States. No approved treatments for Rett syndrome are currently available and care is supportive. </FONT></P>

particular, BHV-5000 has been observed to reduce the number of apneic episodes that are driven by dysfunctions in the central nervous system. These preclinical findings are consistent with those
reported for the NMDA receptor antagonist, ketamine, and have been observed at concentrations that have been well tolerated by healthy volunteers in clinical trials. The potential relevance of the
preclinical models with this mechanism of action are supported by anecdotal reports on the incidental use of ketamine in patients with Rett syndrome that have been associated with clinical
improvements. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
figure below shows results from a preclinical study with BHV-5000 in a transgenic mouse model. Transgenic (heterozygous for MECP2 mutation) and wild-type mice were administered a
single dose of saline or BHV-5000 followed by measurement of apneic episodes. Acute administration of BHV-5000 was associated with a marked reduction in the number of apneic episodes. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lanicemine
has been administered to approximately 770 subjects in single or multiple doses in 18 clinical trials conducted by AstraZeneca and has been observed to be generally well
tolerated. In clinical experience with lanicemine, the most common adverse event was dizziness. CNS-type AEs from Phase&nbsp;1 trials also included headache, somnolence, asthenia, impaired
concentration and dysesthesias. In one study, formal assessment of cognitive function in healthy volunteers revealed improvement in some components of memory, decreased vigilance and decreased
calmness. Hypotension and hypertension have been reported as AEs, with low mean increases in blood pressure reported in some studies (e.g.,&nbsp;4&nbsp;-&nbsp;8 mmHg supine systolic blood
pressure; 2&nbsp;-&nbsp;4 mmHg supine diastolic blood pressure&#151;which occurred at doses higher than considered necessary for therapeutic effects). AEs related to dissociation were
infrequent but more common in the lanicemine group compared to placebo. AEs potentially associated with abuse potential were low but more common in the lanicemine group than the placebo group. No
pattern of clinically meaningful differences between lanicemine and placebo were noted on physical exam, clinical laboratory test results or ECG results. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approximately
40 healthy volunteers have been dosed with single or multiple doses of BHV-5000 in clinical trials conducted by AstraZeneca, and it was observed to be well tolerated
without any clinically relevant safety issues. We believe BHV-5000 has no pharmacologic activity of its own and is rapidly metabolized to lanicemine in humans. After oral ingestion, systemic
concentrations of BHV-5000 are very low, typically below the limit of quantification. </FONT></P>

Nonclinical Toxicology Experience with Lanicemine and BHV-5000  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In nonclinical studies, the major dose limiting effects in both rats and dogs were central nervous system effects, which appeared rapidly and
included ataxia, head weaving, depressed activity, and, at very high doses, convulsions. At pharmacologically effective doses, lanicemine did not elicit adverse effects on learning, memory or
attention. Small increases in heart rate and blood pressure at very high doses were observed. In the rat with daily dosing, effects on adrenal gland, heart tissue, thyroid and kidney were apparent at
very high doses&#151;more than 10-fold the proposed maximum clinical exposure. These effects were not seen in dogs and intermittent dosing in the rat was not associated with effects on the
kidney or heart. At very high doses, evidence of neuron degeneration was apparent in very few neurons, a finding that is associated with glutamate antagonists. Based on these preclinical findings,
which were consistent with other NMDA receptor antagonists, such as ketamine, lanicemine was advanced into clinical trials. Toxicology studies with BHV-5000, up to 2&nbsp;weeks in rats and dogs,
revealed findings consistent with lanicemine, which was expected given the negligible concentrations of BHV-5000 as compared to the active metabolite, lanicemine. A GLP neurotoxicology study is
ongoing, as required for this class of agent, in order to confirm maximum acceptable therapeutic exposures in clinic populations. </FONT></P>

Clinical Development of BHV-5000  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July 2017, we received orphan drug designation from the FDA for BHV-5000 for the treatment of patients with Rett syndrome. Our clinical
program for BHV-5000 will build upon AstraZeneca's previous development efforts for lanicemine. In support, BHV-5000 is rapidly metabolized to lanicemine and, in a Phase&nbsp;1 trial, concentrations
of BHV-5000 were detectable in only a few subjects who received the highest dose. As a result, we intend to rely on long-term Good Laboratory Practices ("GLP") toxicology, reproductive toxicology and
carcinogenicity studies of lanicemine to potentially expedite the safety package for BHV-5000. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
lead formulation has been selected for advancing into a Phase&nbsp;1 clinical trial of BHV-5000, to bridge PK with a prior formulation. Enrollment in this study commenced in the
fourth quarter of 2017, with the first patient dosed in January 2018. All 10 subjects have been enrolled in a combined single and multiple dose trial (8 active; 2 placebo) and completed study
participation. From preliminary results on blinded data, administration was observed to be well tolerated with no clinically relevant safety signals. These results are consistent with prior
experience. That is, prior formulations of BHV-5000 had been dosed in approximately 40 healthy subjects in a Phase&nbsp;1 trial conducted by AstraZeneca, and was observed to be well tolerated with
no clinically relevant safety signals. Its active metabolite, lanicemine, has been administered intravenously in clinical trials conducted by AstraZeneca to approximately 770 subjects, in single or
multiple doses, and has been observed to be generally well tolerated with most AEs being mild and transient in nature. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After
completing the ongoing Phase&nbsp;1 study, we plan to commence a randomized controlled trial of BHV-5000 with the potential for positive results to provide pivotal registration
evidence of efficacy. One of our planned indications for BHV-5000 is Rett syndrome, based on the ability of BHV-5000 and its active metabolite to favorably impact breathing abnormalities and global
brain biochemical abnormalities in transgenic mouse models. The Phase&nbsp;2/3 trial is being developed in collaboration with experts in the field. The current aim is to enroll approximately 120
patients, and the patients will be randomly assigned to up to 24&nbsp;weeks of treatment of either placebo or BHV-5000. The primary outcome measure is under consideration with experts and may
include a behavioral outcome scale and potentially reduction in respiratory abnormalities (number of apneic episodes). Discussion of outcome measures will be a focus of regulatory interactions with
the FDA. </FONT></P>

Overview of BHV-5000 in Other Indications  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that modulation of NMDA receptor activity has the potential for broad applicability across a number of CNS disorders. Our goal is to
rapidly advance BHV-5000 into the clinic to assess for efficacy in neuropsychiatric indications with high unmet medical needs. Potential other conditions include depression, neuropathic pain and other
disorders involving NMDA receptor dysfunction. </FONT></P>

Major Depressive Disorder  </I></FONT></P>

</UL>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Major depressive disorder ("MDD") is the leading cause of disability worldwide, according to the World Health Organization. In the United
States, the prevalence rate is approximately 7%. Despite the approval of over two dozen agents, therapeutic effects are limited. More than one-third of patients who complete an initial course of
antidepressant treatment will not achieve a satisfactory response, and as many as 20% of patients have chronic depression despite multiple interventions. The only class of agents approved for this
population of inadequate responders (also deemed treatment resistant depression) is atypical antipsychotic medications (e.g.,&nbsp;aripiprazole, quetiapine, olanzapine-fluoxetine combination and
brexpiprazole), agents associated with significant short-term and long-term side effect burdens (sedation, metabolic syndrome, obesity, extrapyramidal side effects that can include akathisia and
elevated risk of tardive dyskinesia). Other agents in clinical stages of development for major depressive disorder include rapastinel (Allergan, in Phase&nbsp;2 testing), esketamine
(Johnson&nbsp;&amp; Johnson, in Phase&nbsp;3 testing), and ALKS-5461 (a combined formulation of buprenorphine and samidorphin developed by Alkermes, which has reported positive Phase&nbsp;3 data). </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clinical
findings of antidepressant effects of the NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine have provided a link between the NMDA receptor function and depression and a rationale for testing
BHV-5000 as an antidepressant. In nonclinical studies, BHV-5000's active metabolite is active in models of depression and anxiety. These data prompted a line of investigation with lanicemine that
included four randomized controlled trials conducted by AstraZeneca in patients with treatment resistant depression, overall suggesting an adequate safety and tolerability profile and potential for
therapeutic benefit. However, the clinical data to date has not established clear efficacy and additional trials are needed. </FONT></P>

Neuropathic Pain  </I></FONT></P>

</UL>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neuropathic pain is a chronic condition caused by dysfunctional or damaged nerves. Neuropathic pain can be a debilitating and common problem
affecting approximately 10% of adults in the United States. Despite the availability of multiple approved drugs, including Lyrica, and guidelines for the treatment of neuropathic pain, treatment of
this condition remains a major therapeutic challenge. Existing analgesics are often ineffective, can cause serious side effects and have abuse potential that limits widespread use. Increased NMDA
receptor activity is known to contribute to central sensitization in neuropathic pain. NMDA receptor antagonists have been shown to reduce hyperalgesia and pain in animal models of neuropathic pain
induced by nerve injury and diabetic neuropathy. Clinically used NMDA receptor antagonists, including ketamine and dextromethorphan, can be effective in patients suffering from neuropathic pain
syndromes. The clinical use of robust NMDA antagonists, such as ketamine, is limited due to dissociative, psychotomimetic and abuse potential properties. Novel NMDA receptor antagonists, such as
BHV-5000, that are not associated with the psychotomimetic effects and abuse potential could lead to better management of neuropathic pain without causing serious side effects. </FONT></P>

Competition  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis
on proprietary drugs. While we believe that our knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources,
including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product
candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their safety, efficacy, convenience, price, the level of generic
competition and the availability of coverage and reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many
of the companies against which we are competing, or against which we may compete in the future, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and
development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved drugs than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and
biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors,
particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel
and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. </FONT></P>

Triptans (Acute Treatment of Migraine)  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clinicians use a number of pharmacologic agents for the acute treatment and/or prevention of migraine. Initial management is often with
over-the-counter products (e.g.&nbsp;Excedrin, ibuprofen) or some prescription non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (e.g.&nbsp;diclofenac). The dominant class of prescription medication for the acute
treatment of migraine are serotonin 5-HT<SUB>1B/1D</SUB> receptor agonists, or triptans. There are seven different triptans (almotriptan, eletriptan, frovatriptan, naratriptan, rizatriptan,
sumatriptan, zolmitriptan), the first of which was developed and approved over 25&nbsp;years ago and, today, all triptans are generic. The initial introduction of triptans represented a shift toward
drugs more selectively targeting the suspected pathophysiology of migraine. A 5-HT<SUB>1F</SUB> receptor antagonist, lasmiditan, could be approved as early as 2019. Lasmiditan was developed by
CoLucid and acquired by Eli Lilly in January 2017. Lasmiditan could be the first new class of agent approved for the acute treatment of migraine since the triptans and, if approved, would be launched
prior to rimegepant. Lasmiditan was designed to act through non-vasoconstrictive mechanisms in the 5-HT<SUB>1</SUB> pathways such that patients who have cardiovascular risk factors, stable
cardiovascular disease, or those who are dissatisfied with current triptan therapies could be treated. In August 2017, Lilly announced that lasmiditan met both its primary (pain freedom) and key
secondary (most bothersome symptom) endpoints at 2&nbsp;hours. Lilly plans to submit lasmiditan for approval in the second half of 2018.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preliminary data from lasmiditan, compared
with the results from the rimegepant program, would suggest ability to differentiate on both durability of benefit and AEs. </FONT></P>

Other Oral CGRP Candidates in Development  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we will be pursuing approval of our orally available, small molecule rimegepant for the acute treatment of migraine, the most relevant
comparator to rimegepant is the oral CGRP receptor antagonist under development from Allergan, ubrogepant. Allergan recently announced results on an earnings call from the first of their
Phase&nbsp;3 studies (Achieve 1)&nbsp;with results from the second trial anticipated by mid-2018. This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of orally administered ubrogepant 50 mg and 100 mg
compared to placebo in a single migraine. Both doses showed a statistically greater percentage of ubrogepant patients pain free at 2&nbsp;hours as compared to placebo, as well as statistical
significance on the co-primary, absence of the most bothersome migraine associated symptom at 2&nbsp;hours post dose. Patients were permitted to take a second dose of investigational product or
rescue medication after the 2&nbsp;hour time point. Durability of effect was not shared beyond 8&nbsp;hours post dose, at which time pain freedom appeared statistically significantly more improved
than placebo for both doses of ubrogepant. Ubrogepant was well tolerated with an adverse event profile similar to placebo. There were 6 cases of LFTs (ALT or AST) &gt;3x ULN (1 on placebo, 5 on
ubrogepant): 2 cases of LFTs&nbsp;&gt;5x ULN on ubrogepant and 1 case of LFTs &gt;10x ULN on ubrogepant. No cases were determined to have a probable relationship to study drug. There were no cases of Hy's
Law. Launch of ubrogepant is anticipated in the first quarter 2020. Based on the published Phase&nbsp;2 studies with both of rimegepant and ubrogepant, and the early data from the Phase&nbsp;3
study of ubrogepant, we believe rimegepant has the potential to be best-in-class. Allergan is a global pharmaceutical company with
presence in the CNS area and, in particular, with physicians treating chronic migraine through its Botox franchise. </FONT></P>

Migraine Prevention Treatments  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agents currently used to reduce the frequency of migraine episodes were first approved for other uses (e.g.&nbsp;beta blockers,
antidepressants, anticonvulsants). Botox is the only product that has been approved by the FDA for the prevention of chronic migraine (defined as at least 15 headache days per month, at least 8 of
which are migraine). For those patients who do not qualify as having chronic migraine, but still have significant disability due to migraine, there are five products approved by the FDA for use:
topiramate (Topamax) and valproic acid (Depakote), both anticonvulsant medicines, propranolol (Inderal) and timolol (Blocadren), both beta-blockers, and amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
biologic CGRP therapies have been studied for the prevention of migraine. Phase&nbsp;3 studies for erenumab (Amgen/Novartis) and framenezumab (Teva) have recently been published
and both of these agents, in addition to galcanezumab (Lilly) and ALD-403 (Alder) are expected to begin to enter the market in the second half of 2018. These therapies, while effective, do not
eliminate the need for acute treatment of migraine attacks. In addition, they all require SQ or IV administration. We believe that BHV-3500 may have the opportunity to differentiate from these
therapies due to its potential to be used for both the acute treatment and prevention of migraine. </FONT></P>

no approved drug treatments for SCA or any other cerebellar ataxia, in the United States. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
are aware of companies with clinical stage programs in development for potential treatments for SCA and other cerebellar disorders, including Bioblast Pharma, which is in
Phase&nbsp;2 development of trehalose, which targets SCA 3 and acts as a protein stabilizer; Steminent Biotherapeutics, which is currently conducting a Phase&nbsp;2 trial of allogeneic
adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells that target polyglutamine SCAs; EryDel which is planning a Phase&nbsp;3 trial for its product, IEDAT01, which delivers dexamethasone sodium phosphate through
red blood cells, Shionogi&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;CO.,&nbsp;Ltd., which is investigating Rovatirelin, a non-peptide mimetic of thyrotropin-releasing hormone, in a Phase&nbsp;3 trial in Japan;
Shire&nbsp;Plc, which is exploring Cuvitru, an intravenous immune globulin that is approved for the treatment of primary immunodeficiency disorders, in Phase&nbsp;2 development. Mitsubishi Tanabe
received approval for taltirelin, an oral thyrotropin releasing hormone, in Japan in 2009 but has not filed with the FDA to seek approval in the United States. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With

respect to BHV-0223, which we are developing for the treatment of ALS, we believe our primary competitor is Covis Pharmaceuticals, which sells Rilutek, the brand name for riluzole,
which is currently the only approved drug for the treatment of ALS in the United States. Riluzole is also generically available. Edaravone (Radicava, Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma) was recently approved by

new formulations of riluzole: Aquestive Therapeutics has filed an IND to begin clinical development of a riluzole oral soluble film, and Italfarmaco SpA, a private Italian company, markets an oral
liquid suspension formulation of riluzole in the United Kingdom and elsewhere in Europe under the brand name Teglutik. We are aware of several companies that are exploring potential treatments for
ALS, mostly agents with novel mechanisms of action being administered with riluzole. We are not aware of any company marketing or developing a sublingual formulation of riluzole. Other companies of
which we are not aware may also be developing formulations using the API riluzole; if such companies pursued regulatory approval of such product candidates using the Section&nbsp;505(b)(2)
regulatory pathway, those product candidates would potentially compete with BHV-0223. For example, Italfarmaco and Aquestive have obtained orphan designation for their products, and are eligible to
obtain orphan exclusivity subject to a showing of clinical superiority to riluzole. Based on orphan drug designation requirements, the first approval of a novel formulation of riluzole may obligate
subsequent formulations to demonstrate advantages with regard to safety, efficacy or meaningful contribution to patient care, in order to achieve marketing authorization. </FONT></P>

Patent Protection and Terms  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The term of individual patents depends on the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are granted. In most countries, including
the United States, the patent term is generally 20&nbsp;years from the earliest claimed filing date of a non-provisional patent application in the applicable country. In the United States, a
patent's term may, in certain cases, be extended by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in examining and granting a
patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over a commonly owned patent or a patent naming a common inventor and having an earlier expiration date. The Drug Price Competition and
Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (the "Hatch-Waxman Act") permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration date of a U.S. patent as partial compensation for the length of
time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent term extension is not available for all approved products and, even if an approved product is eligible, only one patent covering the approved product
may be extended, the extension can only be based on a single approved product, and the total extension granted cannot extend the remaining term of the patent beyond 14&nbsp;years from product
approval. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore,
the patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical products and processes like those we intend to develop and commercialize are generally uncertain and involve complex
legal and factual questions. No consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in such patents has emerged to date in the United States. The patent situation outside the United States is
even more uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries can diminish our ability to protect our inventions and enforce our
intellectual </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and patent applications owned by third parties exist in the fields in which we are developing products.
In addition, because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be applications unknown to us, which may later result in issued patents that our product candidates or proprietary
technologies may infringe. Moreover, we may be aware of patent applications, but incorrectly predict the likelihood of those applications issuing with claims of relevance to us. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under
U.S. law, a person may be able to patent a discovery of a new way to use a previously known compound, even if such compound itself is patented, provided the newly discovered use is
novel and non-obvious. Such a method-of-use patent, however, if valid, only protects the use of a claimed compound for the specified methods claimed in the patent. This type of patent does not prevent
persons from using the compound for any previously known use of the compound. Further, this type of patent does not prevent persons from making and marketing the compound for an indication that is
outside the scope of the patented method. </FONT></P>

Overview  </I></FONT></P>

</UL>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July 2016, we entered into an exclusive, worldwide license agreement with BMS for the development and commercialization rights to rimegepant
and BHV-3500, as well as other CGRP-related intellectual property. Subject to certain limitations and certain retained rights of BMS, the license included an exclusive license under certain BMS patent
rights and BMS know-how to the extent necessary to research, discover, develop, make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell, export and import licensed compounds and licensed products in the field of
prevention, treatment or control of any disease, disorder or condition in humans. In exchange for these rights, we agreed to pay BMS initial payments, milestone payments and tiered royalties on net
sales of licensed products under the agreement. Our initial payments to BMS totaled $9.0&nbsp;million and were paid within 90&nbsp;days after entering into the agreement. The milestone payments
due to BMS under the agreement consist of development and commercial milestones. The development milestones due under the agreement depend on the licensed product being developed. Development
milestones due under the agreement with respect to rimegepant or a derivative thereof total up to $127.5&nbsp;million, and, for any product other than rimegepant or a derivative thereof, total up to
$74.5&nbsp;million. Commercial milestones total up to $150.0&nbsp;million for each licensed product. If we receive revenue from sublicensing any of our rights under the agreement, we are also
obligated to pay a portion of that revenue to BMS as well. The tiered royalty payments are based on annual worldwide net sales of licensed products under the agreement, with percentages in the
low-to-mid teens. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
made a payment of $5.0&nbsp;million to BMS pursuant to our obligations under the BMS agreement during the third quarter of 2017 for the achievement of a specified milestone. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under
the BMS agreement, we agreed to refrain, either ourselves or via our sublicensees or third parties, from engaging in the development and commercialization of specified competitive
compounds
for a period of seven years. Further, BMS has retained the right to use the licensed compounds for internal research purposes and for the generation of analogs and derivatives of licensed compounds.

progress and keeping BMS informed of material changes that may affect the development plan. With respect to any of the licensed products, we are solely responsible for all development, regulatory and
commercial activities and costs. We are also obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to achieve specified regulatory and commercial milestones, and maintain a sufficient supply of our
products to satisfy our expected commercialization efforts in each country in which we sell such products. Following our first commercial sale of a product, we must provide BMS with periodic reports
of our commercial activities. In connection with the agreement, BMS agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to assign and transfer any INDs for the licensed compounds to us. </FONT></P>

Agreement with ALS Biopharma,&nbsp;LLC and Fox Chase Chemical Diversity Center&nbsp;Inc.  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In August 2015, we entered into an agreement with ALS Biopharma and FCCDC pursuant to which ALS Biopharma and FCCDC assigned to us their
worldwide patent rights to a family of over 300&nbsp;prodrugs of glutamate modulating agents, including trigriluzole, as well as other innovative technologies. In addition, we received a
non-exclusive license to certain trade secrets and know-how of ALS Biopharma. We took assignment of these patent rights subject to the provisions of the Bayh Dole Act, as applicable, to the extent
that any invention included with the assigned patent rights was funded in whole or in part by the United States government. In addition, certain of the patent rights that do not cover trigriluzole
were co-owned by Rutgers, and thus, we took assignment of these patent rights subject to the co-ownership interest of Rutgers. Under the agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable
efforts to diligently commercialize and develop markets for the patent products. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
consideration for this assignment of patent rights, we paid ALS Biopharma $2.5&nbsp;million between August 2015 and November 2016 as funding for research to be performed by ALS
Biopharma in connection with a mutually agreed upon research plan. We are also obligated to pay regulatory milestone payments of $3.0&nbsp;million upon a specified regulatory approval for the first
licensed product under the agreement as well as additional milestone payments of $1.0&nbsp;million for each licensed product that completes the specified regulatory milestone thereafter. We are also
obligated to make royalty payments of a low single-digit percentage based on net sales of products licensed under the agreement, payable on a quarterly basis. </FONT></P>

shares with an exercise price of $5.60 per share, of which 275,000 shares were immediately exercisable at issuance and the remaining 325,000 shares became exercisable upon our achievement of a
specified regulatory milestone. This milestone was achieved in May 2016. We also agreed to grant specified preemptive rights to ALS Biopharma to participate in equity offerings that are open to our
other shareholders. </FONT></P>

Overview  </I></FONT></P>

</UL>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October 2016, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with AstraZeneca pursuant to which AstraZeneca granted us a license to certain
patent rights and know-how for all human uses for the commercial development, manufacture, distribution and use of any products or processes resulting from development of those patent rights,
including BHV-5000 and lanicemine. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under
the AstraZeneca agreement, we have the right to sublicense our rights under the agreement subject to AstraZeneca's prior written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. We will be responsible for preparing, filing, prosecuting and maintaining the licensed patents and applications, and for Orange Book listing any listable patents. We
have the right to enforce the licensed patents and to defend challenges to the validity or enforceability of the licensed patents. AstraZeneca, however, retains the right to apply for patent term
extensions for the licensed patents. We may not assign our rights or delegate our obligations under the AstraZeneca agreement without AstraZeneca's consent, including in the event of a change of
control. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
exchange for these rights, in addition to the agreement to issue equity consideration noted below, we agreed to pay AstraZeneca an upfront payment, milestone payments and royalties on
net sales of licensed products under the agreement. We made the upfront payment to AstraZeneca of $5.0&nbsp;million upon signing the agreement. The milestone payments due to AstraZeneca under the
agreement consist of regulatory and commercial milestones. The regulatory milestones due under the agreement depend on the indication of the licensed product being developed as well as the territory
where regulatory approval is obtained. Development milestones due under the agreement with respect to Rett syndrome total up to $30.0&nbsp;million, and, for any indication other than Rett syndrome,
total up to $60.0&nbsp;million. Commercial milestones are based on net sales of all products licensed under the agreement and total up to $120.0&nbsp;million. We have agreed to pay tiered
royalties of mid single-digit to low double-digit percentages based on net sales of products licensed under the agreement. If we receive revenue from sublicensing any of our rights under the
agreement, we are also obligated to pay a portion of that revenue to AstraZeneca. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the consideration, we agreed to issue to AstraZeneca common shares in the amount of $5.0&nbsp;million if we completed a financing

AstraZeneca which, at the completion of our IPO, automatically converted into 538,150 common shares. In addition, we agreed to issue to AstraZeneca common shares in the amount of $5.0&nbsp;million

of the last to expire of the applicable patents in that country. The patent applications related to BHV-5000 would, if issued, have a statutory expiration date in 2033. Either party may terminate the
agreement upon the other party's uncured material breach or upon insolvency or bankruptcy. AstraZeneca also has the right to terminate the agreement in certain circumstances. We have the right to
terminate the agreement without cause. In the event the agreement is terminated in its entirety for any reason, all rights and licenses granted to us by AstraZeneca under the agreement, and all
sublicenses granted by us under the agreement, immediately terminate, and we are required to assign to AstraZeneca all of the regulatory documentation applicable to any licensed compound or licensed
product owned or controlled by us or our affiliates, to transfer control of any clinical studies involving licensed products to AstraZeneca and continue such studies at our cost for six months, and to
assign to AstraZeneca all of our agreements with third parties that are reasonably necessary for the exploitation of the licensed products. </FONT></P>

automatically extends for one-year terms unless either party gives advance notice of intent to terminate. In addition, Catalent may terminate the agreement either in its entirety or terminate the

development, manufacture, distribution, use and sale of products and processes resulting from the development of those patent rights related to the use of riluzole in treating various neurological
conditions such as general anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. As part of the consideration for this license, we issued Yale 250,000 of our common shares and granted Yale
the right to purchase up to 10% of the securities issued in each of our equity offerings. Under the terms of the agreement, in the event of a change of control, as defined in the agreement to include
our IPO, we will be obligated to pay to Yale the lesser of (i)&nbsp;5% of the dollar value of all initial and future potential consideration paid or payable by the acquirer or
(ii)&nbsp;$1.5&nbsp;million as a change-of-control payment. In the event of an IPO, which we completed in May 2017, the change-of-control payment to Yale is reduced by the value of Yale's equity
investment in our company. The value of this change-of-control payment was determined to be zero at the expiration of the lockup period in October 2017 since the value of shares at the end of the
lockup were worth more than their initial equity investment. </FONT></P>

Government Regulation  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act ("FDCA") and its implementing regulations. The
process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and
financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant and/or
sponsor to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, including imposition of a clinical hold, refusal by the FDA to approve applications, withdrawal of an approval, import/export delays,
issuance of warning letters and other types of enforcement letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of
government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA and the Department of Justice or other governmental entities. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
clinical testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, distribution, record keeping, advertising, promotion, import, export and marketing, among other things, of our product candidates

Preclinical and Human Clinical Trials in Support of an NDA  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluations of the product candidate, as well as </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>in vitro</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>
and animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product candidate. The conduct of preclinical trials is subject to federal regulations and requirements including GLP regulations.
The results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, which must become effective before
clinical trials may be commenced. The IND will become effective automatically 30&nbsp;days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the trials as
outlined in the IND prior to that time. In this case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can proceed. The FDA may nevertheless initiate a clinical
hold after the 30&nbsp;days if, for example, significant public health risks arise. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clinical
trials involve the administration of the product candidate to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements. Each clinical
trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB at each of the sites at which the trial will be conducted. The IRB will consider, among other things, ethical factors, the safety of human subjects and
the possible liability of the institution. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clinical
trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases prior to approval, but the phases may overlap or be combined. These phases generally include the following: </FONT></P>

<UL>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><I>Phase&nbsp;1.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phase&nbsp;1 clinical trials represent the initial introduction of a product candidate into human subjects, frequently
healthy volunteers. In Phase&nbsp;1, the product candidate is usually tested for safety, including adverse effects, dosage tolerance, absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and
pharmacodynamics. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><I>Phase&nbsp;2.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phase&nbsp;2 clinical trials usually involve studies in a limited patient population to (1)&nbsp;evaluate the efficacy
of the product candidate for specific indications, (2)&nbsp;determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and (3)&nbsp;identify possible adverse effects and safety risks. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><I>Phase&nbsp;3.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a product candidate is found to be potentially effective and to have an acceptable safety profile in Phase&nbsp;2
clinical trials, the clinical trial program will be expanded to Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trials to further demonstrate clinical efficacy, optimal dosage and safety within an expanded patient population
at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><I>Phase&nbsp;4.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clinical trials may be conducted after approval to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the
intended therapeutic indication and to document a clinical benefit in the case of drugs approved under accelerated approval regulations, or when otherwise requested by the FDA in the form of
post-market requirements or commitments. Failure to promptly conduct any required Phase&nbsp;4 clinical trials could result in enforcement action or withdrawal of approval. </FONT></P>

</UL>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
Phase 2/3 trial design, which we are using in our trigriluzole and BHV-5000 development programs, is often used in the development of pharmaceutical and biological products. The trial
includes Phase&nbsp;2 elements, such as an early interim analysis of safety or activity, and Phase&nbsp;3 elements, such as larger patient populations with less restrictive enrollment criteria.
The early interim analysis of clinical or physiologic activity and/or safety allows the study to be stopped, changed or continued before a large number of patients have been enrolled, while still
allowing all data from enrolled patients to count in the analysis used to support approval. </FONT></P>

must be accompanied by a significant user fee payment, which typically increases annually, although waivers may be granted in limited cases. The FDA has substantial discretion in the
approval process and may refuse to accept any application or decide that the data is insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once
an NDA has been accepted for filing, which occurs, if at all, 60&nbsp;days after submission, the FDA sets a user fee goal date that informs the applicant of the specific date by
which the FDA intends to complete its review. We will be required to pay a user fee to the FDA to review the NDA, unless we receive a waiver or qualify for an exemption. This is typically
10&nbsp;months from the date that the FDA receives the application-filing for standard review NDAs (</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>i.e.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, NDAs seeking approval of drugs that are not
new molecular entities). The review process can be extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews NDAs to determine, among other things, whether the proposed
product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMPs to assure and preserve the product's identity, strength, quality and purity.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured and will not approve the product unless the manufacturing facilities comply with cGMPs.
Additionally, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical trial sites for compliance with GCP and integrity of the data supporting safety and efficacy. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During
the approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy ("REMS") is necessary to assure the safe use of the product. If the FDA
concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the application must submit a proposed REMS, and the FDA will not approve the application without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS can substantially
increase the costs of obtaining approval. The FDA could also require a special warning, known as a boxed warning, to be included in the product label in order to highlight a particular safety risk.
The FDA may also convene an advisory committee of external experts to provide input on certain review issues relating to risk, benefit and interpretation of clinical trial data. The FDA may delay
approval of an NDA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied and/or the FDA requires additional testing or information. The FDA may require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor
safety or efficacy of a product. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
the basis of the FDA's evaluation of the NDA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA will issue either an
approval of the NDA or a Complete Response Letter, detailing the deficiencies in the submission and the additional testing or information required for reconsideration of the application. Even with
submission of this additional information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. </FONT></P>

Post-Approval Requirements  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approved drugs that are manufactured or distributed in the United States pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing
regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse
experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims and some manufacturing and supplier changes are subject to
prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application
fees for certain supplemental applications. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase&nbsp;4 clinical
trials, and surveillance programs to further assess and monitor the product's safety and effectiveness after commercialization. The FDA may also require a REMS, which could involve requirements for,

addition, entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to
periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. The FDA has promulgated specific requirements for drug cGMPs. Changes to the manufacturing
process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP requirements and
impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that
the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once
an approval is granted, the FDA may issue enforcement letters or withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems
occur after the product reaches the market. Corrective action could delay product distribution and require significant time and financial expenditures. Later discovery of previously unknown problems
with a product, including AEs of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved
labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other
potential consequences include, among other things:</FONT></P>

Orange Book Listing  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA certain patents whose
claims cover the applicant's product or an approved method of using the product. Upon approval of an NDA, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA's
Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, known as the Orange Book. Any applicant who files an Abbreviated New Drug Application ("ANDA"), seeking approval of a generic
equivalent version of a drug listed in the Orange Book or a 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must certify, for each patent listed in the Orange Book for the referenced drug,
to the FDA that (1)&nbsp;no patent information on the drug product that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA, (2)&nbsp;such patent has expired, (3)&nbsp;if such patent
has not expired, the date on which it expires or (4)&nbsp;such patent is invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the
application is submitted. The fourth certification described above is known as a paragraph&nbsp;IV certification. A notice of the paragraph&nbsp;IV certification must be provided to each owner of
the patent that is the subject of the certification and to the holder of the approved NDA to which the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application refers. The applicant may also elect to submit a
"section&nbsp;viii" statement certifying that its proposed label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of- use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use
patent. This section&nbsp;viii statement does not require notice to the patent holder or NDA owner. There might also be no relevant patent certification. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
the reference NDA holder and patent owners assert a patent challenge directed to one of the Orange Book listed patents within 45&nbsp;days of the receipt of the paragraph&nbsp;IV
certification notice, the FDA is prohibited from approving the application until the earlier of 30&nbsp;months from the receipt of the paragraph&nbsp;IV certification, expiration of the patent,
settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant. Even if the 45&nbsp;days expire, a patent infringement lawsuit can be brought and could delay
market entry, but it would not extend the FDA-related 30-month stay of approval. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The

Non-Patent Exclusivity  </I></B></FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to patent exclusivity, the holder of the NDA for the listed drug may be entitled to a period of non-patent exclusivity, during which
the FDA cannot approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application that relies on the listed drug. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
drug, including one approved under a 505(b)(2) application, may obtain a three-year period of non-patent market exclusivity for a particular condition of approval, or change to a
marketed product, such as a new formulation for a previously approved product, if one or more new clinical studies (other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies) was essential to the approval

Orphan Drugs  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition affecting fewer than
200,000 individuals in the United States, or in other limited cases. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process,
though companies developing orphan drugs may be eligible for certain incentives, including tax credits for qualified clinical testing. In addition, an NDA for a product that has received orphan drug
designation is not subject to a prescription drug user fee unless the application includes an indication other than the rare disease or condition for which the drug was designated. A Company must
request orphan drug designation before submitting an NDA. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally,
if a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is
entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same active moiety for the same indication for seven years, except in limited
circumstances, such as another drug's showing of clinical superiority over the drug with orphan exclusivity. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different active moieties for the same
indication or obtain approval for the same active moiety for a different indication. In some cases, orphan drug status is contingent on a product with an orphan drug designation showing that it is
clinically superior to a previously approved product or products. </FONT></P>

Foreign Regulation  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other
countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products.
Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before we can commence clinical trials or
marketing of the product in foreign countries and jurisdictions. Although many of the issues discussed above with respect to the United States apply similarly in the context of the European Union and
other geographies, the approval process varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain
approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory
approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. </FONT></P>

Coverage, Reimbursement and Pricing  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. In the
United States and foreign markets, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and the adequacy of
reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities, and private entities, such as managed care organizations, private health insurers and other organizations. The
process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product.
Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an </FONT></P>

list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Moreover, a third-party payor's decision to provide coverage for a product does not
imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. For example, the payor's reimbursement payment rate may not be adequate or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high.
Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. The Medicare and Medicaid programs increasingly are used as models for how private payors and other
governmental payors develop their coverage and reimbursement policies for drugs and biologics. However, one third-party payor's decision to cover a particular product does not ensure that other payors
will also provide coverage for the product, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels
sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Further, some third-party payors may require pre-approval of coverage for new or innovative devices or drug
therapies before they provide reimbursement for use of such therapies. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third-party
payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy.
To obtain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies to demonstrate the medical necessity and
cost-effectiveness of our product. These studies will be in addition to the studies required to obtain regulatory approvals. If third-party payors do not consider a product to be cost-effective
compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the product after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to
sell its products at a profit. Thus, obtaining and maintaining reimbursement status is time-consuming and costly. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
U.S. and foreign governments regularly consider reform measures that affect health care coverage and costs. For example, the U.S. and state legislatures have shown significant
interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution
of generic products for branded prescription products. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act ("collectively, the ACA") contains
provisions that may reduce the profitability of products, including, for example, increased rebates for products sold to Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care
plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part&nbsp;D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies' share of sales to federal health care programs. The Centers for Medicare
and Medicaid Services ("CMS") may develop new payment and delivery models, such as bundled payment models. For example, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ("HHS") set a goal of moving
30% of Medicare payments to alternative payment models tied to the quality or value of services by 2016 and 50% of Medicare payments into these alternative payment models by the end of 2018. Adoption
of government controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for our products. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and
reimbursement. In addition, the focus on cost containment measures, particularly in the United States, has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing.
Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if we attain favorable coverage and reimbursement status for one or more products for which we receive regulatory
approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. </FONT></P>

Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular drug candidate to currently available therapies, or so called health
technology assessments, in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of drug products for which
their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a drug
product or may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company. </FONT></P>

will be required to spend substantial time and money to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations. Recent
healthcare reform legislation has strengthened these federal and state healthcare laws. For example, the ACA amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and criminal healthcare
fraud statutes to clarify that liability under these statutes does not require a person or entity to have actual knowledge of the statutes or a specific intent to violate them. Moreover, the ACA
provides that the government may assert that a claim that includes items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for
purposes of the civil False Claims Act. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business

of the provisions of the ACA have yet to be implemented, and there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, as well as recent efforts by the
Trump administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the ACA. President Trump has signed two Executive Orders designed to delay the implementation of any certain provisions of the ACA or
otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the ACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the
ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017
includes a provision repealing, effective January&nbsp;1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage
for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the "individual mandate". Additionally, on January&nbsp;23, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for
fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees, including the so-called "Cadillac" tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on
certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, other federal health reform measures have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. For example, as a result of the
Budget Control Act of 2011, providers are subject to Medicare payment reductions of 2% per fiscal year through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Further, the American Taxpayer
Relief Act of 2012 reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments from providers from three to five years.
The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 also introduced a quality payment program under which certain individual Medicare providers will be subject to certain incentives or penalties
based on new program quality standards. Payment adjustments for the Medicare quality payment program will begin in 2019. At this time, it is unclear how the introduction of the quality payment program
will impact overall physician reimbursement under the Medicare program. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further,
there have been several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing,
review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. At the federal level, the costs of prescription
pharmaceuticals in the United States has also been the subject of considerable discussion, and members of Congress and the Trump Administration have stated that they will address such costs through
new legislative and administrative measures. At the state level, legislatures are increasingly aggressive in
passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on
certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional
healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and
other healthcare programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, once approved, or put pressure on our product pricing. </FONT></P>

The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the "FCPA") prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or
offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist
the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the
company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of
internal accounting controls for international operations. Activities that violate the FCPA, even if they occur wholly outside the United States, can result in criminal and civil fines, imprisonment,
disgorgement, oversight, and debarment from government contracts. </FONT></P>

Corporate Information  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were incorporated as a business company limited by shares organized under the laws of the British Virgin Islands in September 2013. Our
registered office is located at P.O.&nbsp;Box&nbsp;173, Road Town, Tortola, British Virgin Islands and our telephone number is +1 (284)&nbsp;852-3000. Our U.S. office and the office of our U.S.

Facilities  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our principal offices currently occupy a total of approximately 4,240 square feet of leased office space in New Haven, Connecticut. This space
is pursuant to two separate lease agreements, a lease for 2,240 square feet which expires in June 2018 and a lease for 2,000 square feet that expires in October 2018. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
August 2017, we entered into a new lease agreement to consolidate our headquarters into a free standing building in New Haven, Connecticut compromising of approximately 10,366 square
feet of office space. The lease commenced on August&nbsp;10, 2017 for a term of 85&nbsp;months with payments commencing in February 2018. The lease includes two optional 5-year renewal terms. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
believe that our current facilities, including the facilities we will occupy under our new lease agreement, are suitable and adequate to meet our current needs, and that our new
facilities under our new lease agreement will be suitable and adequate to meet our needs at that time. We intend to add new facilities or expand existing facilities as we add employees, and we believe
that suitable additional or substitute space will be available as needed to accommodate any such expansion of our operations. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were incorporated in 2013, and our operations to date have been largely focused on organizing and staffing our company, raising capital and
in-licensing the rights to, and advancing the development of, our product candidates, including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials. We have not yet demonstrated an ability to
successfully complete Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trials, obtain marketing approvals, manufacture products on a commercial scale, or arrange for a third party to do so on our behalf, or conduct sales and
marketing activities necessary for successful commercialization. Consequently, predictions about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating
history or a history of successfully developing and commercializing products. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net loss was $127.2&nbsp;million and $63.5&nbsp;million for the

and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future. None of our product candidates have been approved for marketing in the United States, or in any other jurisdiction, and may never receive
such approval. It could be several years, if ever, before we have a commercialized product that generates significant revenues. As a result, we are uncertain when or if we will achieve profitability
and, if so, whether we will be able to sustain it. The net losses we incur may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. We anticipate that our expenses will increase

addition to the fluctuation of our operating expenses, our financial results may also be materially impacted in the future by material changes in the operating results of Kleo or if
we conclude that the value of our investment in Kleo is impaired and, as a result, we are required by U.S.&nbsp;GAAP to write down the carrying value of our investment. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
become and remain profitable, we must develop and eventually commercialize one or more product candidates with significant market potential. This will require us to be successful in a
range of challenging activities, including completing clinical trials of our product candidates, developing commercial scale manufacturing processes, obtaining marketing approval, manufacturing,
marketing and selling any current and future product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval, and satisfying any post-marketing requirements. We are only in the preliminary stages of
most of these activities and, in some cases, have not yet commenced certain of these activities. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
may never succeed in any or all of these activities and, even if we do, we may never generate sufficient revenue to achieve profitability. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because
of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of expenses or when, or if, we will obtain
marketing approval to commercialize any of our product candidates. If we are required by the FDA or other regulatory authorities such as the EMA to perform studies and trials in addition to those
currently
expected, or if there are any delays in the development, or in the completion of any planned or future preclinical studies or clinical trials of our current or future product candidates, our expenses
could increase and profitability could be further delayed. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even
if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable would decrease
the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, maintain our research and development efforts, expand our business or continue our operations. A decline in the value of our
company also could cause you to lose all or part of your investment. </FONT></P>

We will need substantial additional funding to pursue our business objectives. If we are unable to raise
capital when needed or on terms favorable to us, we could be forced to curtail our planned operations and the pursuit of our growth strategy.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Identifying potential product candidates and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain
process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain regulatory approval and achieve product sales. We expect our expenses to increase in
connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we continue to develop our product candidates. Our expenses could increase beyond our current expectations if the FDA requires us to perform
clinical trials and other studies in addition to those that we currently anticipate. For example, for our trigriluzole clinical program, we intend to meet with the FDA to review the Phase&nbsp;2/3
clinical trial data to better understand the potential pathways for an eventual filing. Given that the topline results did not show differentiation of trigriluzole from placebo in patients with SCA,
the FDA may require additional data and studies to support an eventual filing, beyond what becomes available from completion of the ongoing long-term extension phase of the current trial. With regard
to our BHV-5000 program, due to the small number of patients with Rett syndrome, we believe that BHV-5000 will require only a single pivotal trial. However, the FDA ordinarily requires two
well-controlled clinical trials prior to marketing approval of a product candidate. If the FDA requires us to conduct additional clinical trials of trigriluzole or BHV-5000, or any of our other
product candidates, we would incur substantial additional, unanticipated expenses in order to obtain regulatory approval of those product candidates. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Our revenue, if any, will be derived from sales of products that we do not expect to be commercially
available for a number of years, if at all. Additionally, if we obtain marketing approval for our product candidates, we expect to incur significant expenses related to manufacturing, marketing, sales
and distribution and,
with respect to certain of our product candidates, the payment of milestone and royalty fees. Furthermore, we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
of December&nbsp;31, 2017, we had cash of $131.5&nbsp;million. We expect that our existing cash will be sufficient to fund our planned operating expenses, financial commitments
and other cash requirements through December&nbsp;31, 2018. This estimate is based on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we expect.
Changes may occur beyond our control that would cause us to consume our available capital before that time, including changes in and progress of our development activities and changes in regulation.
Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:</FONT></P>

will require additional capital to complete our planned clinical development programs for our current product candidates to seek regulatory approval. If we receive regulatory approval
for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product manufacturing, sales, marketing and distribution. Any additional capital raising efforts

financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our shareholders and the issuance of additional securities by us, whether equity or debt, or the market perception that such issuances are
likely to occur, could cause the market price of our common shares to decline. As a result, we may not be able to access the capital markets as frequently as comparable U.S. companies. See
"&#151;Our status as a British Virgin Islands ("BVI"), business company means that our shareholders enjoy certain rights that may limit our flexibility to raise capital, issue dividends and
otherwise manage ongoing capital needs"

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our report from our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2017 includes an explanatory paragraph
stating that our recurring losses from operations since inception and required additional funding to finance our operations raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If
we are unable to obtain sufficient funding, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected and we may be unable to continue as a going
concern. If we are unable to continue as a going concern, we may have to liquidate our assets and may receive less than the value at which those assets are carried on our audited financial statements,
and it is likely that investors will lose all or a part of their investment. If we seek additional financing to fund our business activities in the future and there remains substantial doubt about our
ability to continue as a going concern, investors or other financing sources may be unwilling to provide additional funding to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. </FONT></P>

addition, our license agreements with BMS and AstraZeneca obligate us to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize product candidates, to provide BMS and
AstraZeneca with development reports documenting our progress, and to provide them with data from certain clinical trials. In addition, such license agreements provide BMS and AstraZeneca with rights
of first negotiation, triggered by their receipt of a summary of certain topline data from certain of our clinical trials, to regain the respective rights we have in-licensed from them. If either BMS
or AstraZeneca exercises their right of first negotiation, we will be required to negotiate in good faith with BMS or AstraZeneca, as the case may be, for a specified period of time before we can
enter into negotiations with third parties to sublicense these rights. BMS's and AstraZeneca's rights of first negotiation may adversely impact or delay our ability to enter into collaborations with
third parties for the development of these compounds. Our license agreement with BMS further provides that any sublicense, other than to an affiliate or a third-party manufacturer, requires BMS' prior
written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Our license agreement with AstraZeneca further provides that, except with respect to wholly owned subsidiaries, we cannot assign the
agreement without their consent, even in the event of a change of control. This could adversely impact or delay our ability to effect certain transactions. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover,
under our agreement with BMS, until 2023, neither we nor our affiliates may, ourselves or through or in collaboration with a third party, engage directly or indirectly in the
clinical development or commercialization of competitive compounds related to the CGRP-based mechanism of action of the licensed products. In the event that we are or become non-compliant with this
provision due to licensing, collaboration or acquisition activity, we must either divest ourselves of the competitive compound within a certain period of time or negotiate with BMS to have the
competitive compound included as a licensed product under our agreement with BMS. The failure to so divest or reach terms with BMS may result in the termination of our license with BMS. These
prohibitions could adversely impact or delay our ability to effect certain transactions, such as our ability to acquire or be acquired by a third party. </FONT></P>

We depend entirely on the success of a limited number of product candidates, which are in clinical
development and none of which have completed a pivotal trial. If we do not obtain regulatory approval for and successfully commercialize one or more of our product candidates or we experience
significant delays in doing so, we may never become profitable.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not have any products that have received regulatory approval and may never be able to develop marketable product candidates. We expect
that a substantial portion of our efforts and expenses over the next few years will be devoted to the development of our product candidates; specifically, the conducting of our completion of the
ongoing extension phase of the Phase&nbsp;2/3 clinical trial of trigriluzole in SCA, initiation of our Phase&nbsp;2 clinical trials in both OCD and Alzheimer's disease, patient tolerability
studies and NDA preparation for BHV-0223, completion of our three Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trials and long-term safety study for rimegepant, and completion of our Phase&nbsp;1
study for BHV-5000. As a result, our business currently depends heavily on the successful development, regulatory approval and, if approved, commercialization of these product candidates. We cannot be
certain that our product candidates will receive regulatory approval or will be successfully commercialized even if they receive regulatory approval. The research, testing, manufacturing, safety,
efficacy, labeling, approval, sale, marketing and distribution of our product candidates are, and will remain, subject to comprehensive regulation by the FDA and similar foreign regulatory
authorities. Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any product candidate, we must demonstrate through pre-clinical studies and clinical trials that the product candidate is
safe and effective for use in each target indication. Drug development is a long, expensive and uncertain process, and delay or failure can occur at any stage of any of our clinical trials. Failure to
obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates in the United States will prevent us from commercializing and marketing our product candidates. The success of our product candidates will depend
on several additional factors, including:</FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of these factors are beyond our control, including the time needed to adequately complete clinical testing, the regulatory submission process, potential
threats to our intellectual property rights and changes in the competitive landscape. It is possible that none of our product candidates will ever obtain regulatory approval, even if we expend
substantial time and resources seeking such approval. If we do not achieve one or more of these factors in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to
successfully complete clinical trials, obtain regulatory approval or, if approved, commercialize our product candidates, which would materially harm our business, financial condition and results of

Clinical trials are very expensive, time-consuming and difficult to design and implement and involve
uncertain outcomes. Furthermore, results of earlier preclinical studies and clinical trials may not be predictive of results of future preclinical studies or clinical trials.  </I></B></FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The risk of failure for our product candidates is high. It is impossible to predict when or if any of our product candidates will prove
effective or safe in humans or will receive regulatory approval. To obtain the requisite regulatory approvals to market and sell any of our product candidates, we must demonstrate through extensive
preclinical studies and clinical trials that our product candidates are safe and effective in humans for use in each target indication. Clinical testing is expensive and can take many years to
complete, and the outcome is inherently uncertain. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition, the results of preclinical studies and earlier clinical trials may not be predictive of the results of later-stage preclinical studies or clinical trials. The results
generated to date in preclinical studies or clinical trials for our product candidates do not ensure that later preclinical studies or clinical trials will demonstrate similar results. Further, we
have limited clinical data for each of our product candidates and have not completed Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trials for any of our product candidates. Product candidates in later stages of clinical
trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through preclinical and earlier stage clinical trials. For example, the favorable results of the
Phase&nbsp;2b trial of rimegepant may not be predictive of similar results in subsequent trials. In particular, we developed a different tablet formulation of rimegepant for use in our
Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trials of rimegepant, which commenced enrollment in July 2017. We cannot be certain that we will observe the same results in our Phase&nbsp;3 trials with the new dosage form
as we did in the Phase&nbsp;2b clinical trial of rimegepant. In later-stage clinical trials, we will likely be subject to more rigorous statistical analyses than in completed earlier stage clinical
trials. A number of companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in later-stage clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, notwithstanding
promising results in earlier trials, and we cannot be certain that we will not face similar setbacks. Moreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and
analyses, and many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval of
their products. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
some instances, there can be significant variability in safety or efficacy results between different clinical trials of the same product candidate due to numerous factors, including
changes in clinical trial procedures set forth in protocols, differences in the size and type of the patient populations, adherence to the dosing regimen and other clinical trial protocols, and the
rate of dropout among clinical trial participants. If we fail to produce positive results in our planned pre-clinical studies or clinical trials of any of our product candidates, the development
timeline and regulatory approval and commercialization prospects for our product candidates, and, correspondingly, our business and financial prospects, would be materially adversely affected. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
could also encounter delays if a clinical trial is suspended or terminated by us, by the IRBs or Ethics Committees of the institutions at which such trials are being conducted, by the
Data Safety Monitoring Board for such trial or by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. Such authorities may suspend or terminate a clinical trial due to a number of factors, including failure to
conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements, including the FDA's current Good Clinical Practice ("GCP") regulations, or our clinical protocols, inspection of the clinical
trial operations or trial site by the FDA resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold, unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using a drug, changes
in governmental regulations or administrative actions or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial. </FONT></P>

order to commence our planned clinical trials of BHV-0223, BHV-3500 and BHV-5000, we will have to complete development of a commercial-grade formulation and obtain sufficient clinical
supply of both product candidates. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
we experience delays in the commencement or completion of any clinical trial of our product candidates, or if any of our clinical trials are terminated, the commercial prospects of
our product candidates may be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenue from sales of any of these product candidates will be delayed or not realized at all. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
do not know whether any of our preclinical studies or clinical trials will begin as planned, will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule, or at all. Any delays in
completing our clinical
trials will increase our costs, slow down our product candidate development and approval process and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenue from product sales. Any of
these occurrences may significantly harm our business, financial condition and prospects. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical
trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates. Significant preclinical study or clinical trial delays also could shorten any periods during which we
may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates or allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do and impair our ability to successfully commercialize our product
candidates. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally,
we regularly assess our portfolio based on emerging data from pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, and we may make changes to expand or discontinue programs based on
these assessments. Expansion of the number or scope of clinical trials may result in additional expenses compared to our expectations. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our future success is dependent upon our ability to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for and then successfully commercialize one
or more of our product candidates. The time required to obtain approval by the FDA is unpredictable but typically takes many years following the commencement of clinical trials and depends upon
numerous factors, including the substantial discretion of the regulatory authorities. In addition, approval policies, regulations, or the type and amount of clinical data necessary to gain approval is
generally uncertain, may change during the course of a product candidate's clinical development and may vary among jurisdictions. We have not obtained regulatory approval for any product candidate and
it is possible that none of our existing product candidates or any product candidates we may seek to develop in the future will ever obtain regulatory approval. Neither we nor any future collaborator
is permitted to market any of our product candidates in the United States or abroad until we receive regulatory approval of a NDA from the FDA or approval from the EMA or other applicable foreign
regulatory agency. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior
to obtaining approval to commercialize a product candidate in any jurisdiction, we must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA, EMA or any comparable foreign regulatory agency,

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
example, with respect to our ongoing Phase&nbsp;2/3 clinical trial of trigriluzole for the treatment of SCA, we are in discussions with the FDA regarding the data and understand
the potential for the already acquired data and pending extension phase data to contribute sufficient support for a filing. Given that topline results of the 8-week randomization phase did not show
that trigriluzole differentiates from placebo, the limitations of relying on extension phase data in comparison to historical controls and the FDA's previously raised concerns on the adequacy of the
SARA as a primary outcome assessment, there is substantial risk that the FDA or any regulatory agency would interpret any favorable results from the subgroups of the Phase&nbsp;2/3 trial or from the
long-term extension phase to not be an adequate basis for approval. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BHV-0223
40mg met bioequivalent criteria (AUC and C<SUB>max</SUB>) with generic riluzole 50mg tablets. Since the currently approved riluzole is associated with a negative food effect
(lower AUC and C<SUB>max</SUB> when administered with high fat meals), a food assessment was performed within the BHV-0223 Phase&nbsp;1 study. Topline results from the food effect assessment,
demonstrated bioequivalent AUC exposure for BHV-0223 40 mg under both fed and fasting states. However, C<SUB>max</SUB> concentrations were lowered by more than 20% under the fed state. We believe
that BHV-0223's property of maintaining therapeutic AUC exposures regardless of feeding state is clinically important for patients. Ultimately, the FDA will determine the labeling of BHV-0223 with
regard to the effect of feeding, which may impact our marketing of BHV-0223 if it is approved. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any
of our current or future product candidates could take a significantly longer time to gain regulatory approval than expected or may never gain regulatory approval. This could delay
or eliminate any potential product revenue by delaying or terminating the potential commercialization of our product candidates. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of
the large number of drugs in development, only a small percentage successfully complete the FDA or foreign regulatory approval processes and are commercialized. The lengthy approval
process as well as the unpredictability of future clinical trial results may result in our failing to obtain regulatory approval to market our product candidates, which would significantly harm our
business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FDA
guidance regarding the approval of drugs for the acute treatment of migraine has recently changed. No drug has been approved under the new guidance, and it is not certain how such
guidance will be interpreted and applied by the FDA. We intend to seek advice and guidance from the FDA which may include requesting a pre-NDA meeting with the FDA prior to the submission of an NDA
for any of our product candidates. If the feedback we receive is different from what we currently anticipate, this could delay the development and regulatory approval process for these product
candidates. We generally plan to seek regulatory approval to commercialize our product candidates in the United States, the European Union and other key global markets. To obtain regulatory approval
in other countries, we must comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of such other countries regarding safety, efficacy, chemistry, manufacturing and controls, clinical trials,
commercial sales, pricing and distribution of our product candidates. Even if we are successful in obtaining approval in one jurisdiction, we cannot ensure that we will obtain approval in any other
jurisdiction. Failure to obtain approval in one jurisdiction may negatively impact our ability to obtain approval elsewhere. Failure to obtain marketing authorization for our product candidates will
result in our being
unable to market and sell such products. If we fail to obtain approval in any jurisdiction, the geographic market for our product candidates could be limited. Similarly, regulatory agencies may not
approve the labeling claims that are necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of our product candidates or may grant approvals for more limited patient populations than requested. </FONT></P>

if we eventually complete clinical testing and receive approval of an NDA or foreign marketing application for our product candidates, the FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory

Strategy ("REMS") which may be required to ensure safe use of the drug after approval. Any delay in obtaining, or inability to obtain, applicable regulatory approval would delay or prevent

Our product candidates may fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy in clinical trials, or may cause serious
adverse or unacceptable side effects that could prevent or delay regulatory approval and commercialization, limit the commercial profile of an approved label, increase our costs, necessitate the
abandonment or limitation of the development of some of our product candidates or result in significant negative consequences following marketing approval, if any.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of our product candidates, we must demonstrate through lengthy, complex and
expensive preclinical testing and clinical trials that our product candidates are both safe and effective for use in each target indication, and failures can occur at any stage of testing. Clinical
trials often fail to demonstrate efficacy or safety of the product candidate studied for the target indication. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
example, in its Phase&nbsp;2b clinical trial, rimegepant dosed at 75 mg showed statistically significant improvement as compared to placebo on all four key migraine
symptoms&#151;pain, nausea, photophobia, phonophobia&#151;which are inherently subjective endpoints that are difficult to measure. Patients in the trial were provided with an electronic
data capturing device, or an electronic subject diary, which they used to record and rank their assessments of pain, nausea, photophobia and phonophobia at specified time points after they had taken
the study medication following the occurrence of a moderate to severe migraine headache. The measurements from the trial were based on subjective patient feedback as recorded on their electronic
subject diary, which can be influenced by factors outside of our control, and can vary widely from day to day for a particular patient, and from patient to patient and site to site within a clinical
study. The placebo effect also tends to have a more significant impact on clinical trials involving subjective measures such as pain. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover,
undesirable side effects caused by our product candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more
restrictive label, the limitation of commercial potential or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA. Results of our clinical trials could reveal a high and unacceptable severity and
prevalence of side effects or unexpected characteristics. Accordingly, we may need to abandon their development or limit development to certain uses or sub-populations in which such side effects are
less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective. Prior to any regulatory approval of rimegepant, we would need to complete a 12-month safety study as well as longer-term
nonclinical toxicology and carcinogenicity studies. If any of these studies identify safety issues, we may need to complete additional studies, or abandon development of rimegepant. Many compounds
that initially showed promise in preclinical or early-stage testing have later been found to cause side effects that restricted their use and prevented further development of the compound in the
tested indication. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
animal studies, at very high doses, rimegepant was observed to have a negative effect on the liver. We observed elevated liver enzymes in one patient that received very high doses of
rimegepant in a drug-drug interaction study. We recently repeated that drug-drug interaction study at the anticipated therapeutic dose of rimegepant and did not observe clinically meaningful
elevations in liver enzymes. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the completed Phase&nbsp;2b trial of rimegepant conducted by BMS, one patient dosed with rimegepant experienced an asymptomatic and mild increase in certain hepatic enzymes, which
are a type of liver enzyme measured in a liver function test to detect damage and inflammation to the liver. Even though no patient treated with rimegepant in the Phase&nbsp;2b trial had liver

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition, at our end of Phase&nbsp;2 meeting, the FDA stated its desire to see a safety study in which patients received daily or near-daily dosing of rimegepant for at least three
months. This desire stems from the FDA's concern about a potential liver signal with the class of CGRP antagonists. The FDA stated that any risk of liver injury has to be very low and that exposure
with the drug has to be sufficient to cap the risk of liver injury at a level acceptable for the migraine population. We believe the design of our long-term safety study may adequately address this
concern by providing for the enrollment of approximately 600 patients who experience eight or more migraine days per month, who will, in the study, be allowed to use rimegepant on a daily basis, which
we believe will generate safety data with respect to long-term, frequent use of rimegepant. However, the FDA may determine that our trial design or the data we collect is insufficient to address their
concerns, in which case we could be required to conduct additional trials. </FONT></P>

of serious treatment-related side effects could impede subject recruitment and clinical trial enrollment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trial, require us

Our clinical drug development program may not uncover all possible adverse events that patients who use our
products may experience. The number of subjects exposed to treatment and the average exposure time in the clinical development program may be inadequate to detect rare adverse events, or chance
findings, that may only be detected once our products are administered to more patients and for greater periods of time.  </I></B></FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clinical trials by their nature utilize a sample of the potential patient population. However, with a limited number of subjects and limited
duration of exposure, rare and severe side effects of our product candidates may only be uncovered when a significantly larger number of patients are exposed to the product. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although
we have monitored the subjects in our studies for certain safety concerns and we have not seen evidence of significant safety concerns in our clinical trials, patients treated
with our product candidates, if approved, may experience adverse reactions. If safety problems occur or are identified after one of our products reaches the market, the FDA or comparable foreign
regulatory authorities may require that we amend the labeling of our product, recall our product, or even withdraw approval for our product. SAEs deemed to be caused by our product candidates, either
before or after receipt of marketing approval, could have a material adverse effect on the development of our drug candidates and our business as a whole. </FONT></P>

companies, or others selling such products. In addition, we have agreed to indemnify the licensors of the intellectual property related to our product candidates against certain intellectual property
infringement claims. Any claims against us, or with respect to which we are obligated to provide indemnification, regardless of their merit, could be difficult and costly to defend or settle, and

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Factors

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With
respect to our CGRP receptor antagonists, rimegepant and BHV-3500, we face competition from other companies that market or are developing migraine treatments. These include products
in the class of products known as triptans, including the 5-HT<SUB>1F</SUB> receptor antagonist lasmiditan being developed by CoLucid Pharmaceuticals, as well as other small molecule CGRP receptor
antagonists such as ubrogepant, being developed by Allergan. These products are more advanced in their clinical development than rimegepant and BHV-3500, and therefore may receive marketing approval
before our migraine product candidates receive marketing approval, if at all, which could make it more difficult for our products to achieve commercially reasonable market acceptance. In addition, we
expect that our migraine product candidates will also compete with opioids and other analgesics, monoclonal antibodies in development and Botox and other treatments that have been approved by the FDA
for migraine. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With
respect to BHV-0223, which we are developing for the treatment of ALS, we believe our primary competition is Covis Pharmaceuticals, which sells Rilutek, the brand name for riluzole,
and the six approved generic versions of Rilutek. Edaravone (Radicava, Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma) was recently approved by the FDA on May&nbsp;5, 2017 for the treatment of ALS, based on efficacy
studies conducted in Japan with the vast majority of patients on background riluzole therapy. Edaravone is administered to patients by intravenous infusion. We are aware of at least two other
companies marketing or planning to market new formulations of riluzole. MonoSol Rx has filed an IND with the FDA to conduct clinical trials for a riluzole oral soluble film, and Italfarmaco SpA
("Italfarmaco") a private Italian company, markets an oral liquid suspension formulation of riluzole in the United Kingdom and elsewhere in
Europe under the brand name Teglutik. To our knowledge based on publicly available information, no other companies are marketing sublingual formulations of riluzole. Other companies of which we are
not aware may also be developing formulations using the API riluzole; if such companies pursued regulatory approval of such product candidates using the Section&nbsp;505(b)(2) regulatory pathway,
those product candidates would potentially compete with BHV-0223. For example, Italfarmaco has obtained orphan designation for Teglutik, and is eligible to obtain orphan exclusivity subject to a
showing of clinical superiority to riluzole. If Teglutik is shown to be clinically superior to Rilutek and receives marketing approval before BHV-0223, then BHV-0223 may need to demonstrate clinical
superiority to Teglutik to receive marketing approval. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With
respect to trigriluzole, which we are currently developing for the treatment of ataxias and other neurologic disorders, with SCA as our initial indication, there are currently no
approved drug treatments for spinocerebellar ataxias in the United States. We are also developing trigriluzole for the potential treatment of Alzheimer's disease and OCD and if we continue to pursue
those indications, we would face substantial competition from companies that develop or sell products that treat Alzheimer's disease or OCD. With respect to BHV-5000, which we are developing for the
treatment of Rett syndrome, there are currently no approved drug treatments for Rett syndrome in the United States. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
we expand our development of BHV-0223 or BHV-5000 into additional neuropsychiatric or other indications, we would face substantial competition from companies that develop or sell
products that treat those indications. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many
of the companies against which we are competing or against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and
development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved drugs than we do. These third parties compete with us in recruiting
and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Established
biopharmaceutical companies may invest heavily to accelerate research and development of novel compounds or to in-license novel compounds that could make our product

The successful commercialization of certain of our product candidates will depend in part on the extent to
which governmental authorities and health insurers establish adequate coverage, reimbursement levels and pricing policies. Failure to obtain or maintain adequate coverage and reimbursement for our
product candidates, if approved, could limit our ability to market those products and decrease our ability to generate revenue.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The availability and adequacy of coverage and reimbursement by governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, private health
insurers and other third-party payors, is essential for most patients to be able to afford products such as our product candidates, if approved. Our ability to achieve acceptable levels of coverage
and reimbursement for products by governmental authorities, private health insurers and other organizations will have an effect on our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates, if
approved, and attract additional collaboration partners to invest in the development of our product candidates. Coverage under certain government programs, such as Medicare, Medicaid and Tricare, may
not be available for certain of our product candidates. Assuming we obtain coverage for a given product by a third-party payor, the resulting reimbursement payment rates may not be adequate or may
require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high. We cannot be sure that coverage and adequate reimbursement in the United States, the European Union or elsewhere will be available for any
product that we may develop, and any reimbursement that may become available may be decreased or eliminated in the future. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third-party
payors increasingly are challenging prices charged for pharmaceutical products and services, and many third-party payors may refuse to provide coverage and reimbursement for
particular drugs when an equivalent generic drug or a less expensive therapy is available. It is possible that a third-party payor may consider our product candidates as substitutable by less
expensive therapies and only offer to reimburse patients for the less expensive product. Even if we show improved efficacy or improved convenience of administration with our product candidates,
pricing of existing drugs may limit the amount we will be able to charge for our product candidates, once approved. These payors may deny or revoke the reimbursement status of a given product or
establish prices for new or existing marketed products at levels that are too low to enable us to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. If reimbursement is not
available or is available only at limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our product candidates, and may not be able to obtain a satisfactory financial return on products
that we may develop. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There
is significant uncertainty related to the insurance coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products. In the United States, third-party payors, including private and
governmental payors, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs, play an important role in determining the extent to which new drugs and biologics will be covered. The Medicare and Medicaid programs
increasingly are used as models for how private payors and other governmental payors develop their coverage and reimbursement policies for drugs and biologics. Some third-party payors may require
pre-approval of coverage for new or innovative devices or drug therapies before they will reimburse health care providers who use such therapies. It is difficult to predict at this time what
third-party payors will decide with respect to the coverage and reimbursement for our product candidates. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obtaining
and maintaining reimbursement status is time-consuming and costly. No uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement for products exists among third-party payors in the United
States. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process
that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied
consistently or obtained in the first instance. Furthermore, rules and regulations regarding reimbursement change frequently, in some cases at short notice, and we believe that changes in these rules

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
efforts to educate physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community on the benefits of our products, if approved, may require significant resources and
may never be successful. Such efforts may require more resources than are typically required due to the complexity and uniqueness of our product candidates. Because we expect sales of our product
candidates, if approved, to generate substantially all of our product revenue for the foreseeable future, the failure of our product candidates to find market acceptance would harm our business and
could require us to seek additional financing. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition, the potential market opportunity for our product candidates is difficult to estimate precisely. Our estimates of the potential market opportunity are predicated on several
key assumptions such as industry knowledge and publications, third-party research reports and other surveys. While we believe that our internal assumptions are reasonable, these assumptions may be
inaccurate. If any of the assumptions proves to be inaccurate, then the actual market for our product candidates could be smaller than our estimates of the potential market opportunity. If the actual
market for our product candidates is smaller than we expect, or if the products fail to achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, health care payors and patients, our revenue from product
sales may be limited and we may be unable to achieve or maintain profitability. </FONT></P>

We currently have limited marketing, sales or distribution infrastructure. If we are unable to develop sales,

candidates, if approved.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We currently have limited marketing, sales and distribution capabilities and our product candidates are still in clinical development. If any of
our product candidates are approved, we intend either to establish a sales and marketing organization with technical expertise and supporting distribution capabilities to commercialize our product
candidates, or to outsource these functions to a third party. Either of these options would be expensive and time-consuming. These costs may be incurred in advance of any approval of our product
candidates. In addition, we may not be able to hire a sales force that is sufficient in size or has adequate expertise in the medical markets that we intend to target. Any failure or delay in the
development of our internal sales, marketing and distribution capabilities would adversely impact the commercialization of our products. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
the extent that we enter into collaboration agreements with respect to marketing, sales or distribution, our product revenue may be lower than if we directly marketed or sold any
approved products. In addition, any revenue we receive will depend in whole or in part upon the efforts of these third-party collaborators, which may not be successful and are generally not within our
control. If we are unable to enter into these arrangements on acceptable terms or at all, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any approved products. If we are not successful in
commercializing any approved products, either on our own or through collaborations with one or more third parties, our future product revenue will suffer and we may incur significant additional
losses. </FONT></P>

If the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities approve generic versions of any of our products that
receive marketing approval, or such authorities do not grant our products appropriate periods of exclusivity before approving generic versions of our products, the sales of our products could be
adversely affected.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once an NDA is approved, the product covered thereby becomes a "reference listed drug" in the FDA's publication, "Approved Drug Products with
Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations," commonly known as the Orange Book. Manufacturers may seek approval of generic versions of reference listed drugs through submission of ANDAs in the United States.
In support of an ANDA, a generic manufacturer need not conduct clinical trials. Rather, the applicant generally must show that its product has the same active ingredient(s), dosage form, strength,
route of administration and conditions of use or labeling as the reference listed drug and that the generic version is bioequivalent to the reference listed drug, meaning it is absorbed in the body at
the same rate and to
the same extent. Generic products may be significantly less costly to bring to market than the reference listed drug and companies that produce generic products are generally able to offer them at
lower prices. Thus, following the introduction of a generic drug, a significant percentage of the sales of any branded product or reference listed drug is typically lost to the generic product. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
FDA may not approve an ANDA for a generic product until any applicable period of non-patent exclusivity for the reference listed drug has expired. The FDCA provides a period of five
years of non-patent exclusivity for a new drug containing an NCE. Specifically, in cases where such exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be submitted to the FDA until the expiration of five
years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph&nbsp;IV certification that a patent covering the reference listed drug is either invalid or will not be infringed by the generic product, in
which case the applicant may submit its application four years following approval of the reference listed drug. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While
we believe that rimegepant contains active ingredients that would be treated as NCEs by the FDA and, therefore, if approved, should be afforded five years of data exclusivity, the
FDA may disagree with that conclusion and may approve generic products after a period that is less than five years. Moreover, while we believe that trigriluzole, a prodrug of riluzole, and BHV-5000
will also be treated as NCEs under current FDA interpretations, if approved, the FDA may ultimately disagree with our conclusion. Manufacturers may seek to launch these generic products following the
expiration of the applicable marketing exclusivity period, even if we still have patent protection for our product. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Competition
that our products may face from generic versions of our products could materially and adversely impact our future revenue, profitability and cash flows and substantially
limit our ability to obtain a return on the investments we have made in those product candidates. </FONT></P>

with its investigational plan and protocol and applicable laws and regulations, and our reliance on the CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. If we or any of our CROs
or vendors fail to comply with applicable regulations, the data generated in our preclinical studies and clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA, EMA or any comparable foreign regulatory
agency may require us to perform additional preclinical studies and clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot assure you that upon inspection by a given regulatory agency,
such regulatory agency will determine that all of our clinical trials comply with GCP regulations. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with products produced under cGMP requirements.
Our failure to comply with these requirements may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While
we will have agreements governing their activities, our CROs will not be our employees, and we will not be able to control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources
to our future preclinical and clinical programs. These CROs may also have relationships with other commercial entities, including our competitors, for whom they may also be conducting clinical trials,
or other drug development activities which could harm our business. We face the risk of potential unauthorized disclosure or misappropriation of our intellectual property by CROs, which may reduce our
trade secret protection and allow our potential competitors to access and exploit our proprietary technology. If our CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations, fail to
meet expected deadlines, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for any
other reason, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory
approval for, or successfully commercialize any product candidate that we develop. As a result, our financial results and the commercial prospects for any product candidate that we develop would be
harmed, our costs could increase, and our ability to generate revenue could be delayed. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
our relationship with these CROs terminates, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs or do so on commercially reasonable terms. Switching or adding
additional CROs involves substantial cost and requires management time and focus, and could delay development and commercialization of our product candidates. In addition, there is a natural
transition period when a new CRO commences work. As a result, delays occur, which can negatively impact our ability to meet our desired clinical development timelines. Though we intend to carefully
manage our relationships with our CROs, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a negative impact on
our business and financial condition. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
ability to develop our product candidates depends and our ability to commercially supply our products will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully obtain the APIs and other
substances and materials used in our product candidates from third parties and to have finished products manufactured by third parties in accordance with regulatory requirements and in sufficient
quantities for preclinical and clinical testing and commercialization. If we fail to develop and maintain supply relationships with these third parties, we may be unable to continue to develop or
commercialize our product candidates. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
do not have direct control over the ability of our contract suppliers and manufacturers to maintain adequate capacity and capabilities to serve our needs, including quality control,
quality assurance and qualified personnel. Although we are ultimately responsible for ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements such as cGMPs, we are dependent on our contract suppliers and
manufacturers for day-to-day compliance with cGMPs for production of both APIs and finished products. Facilities used by our contract suppliers and manufacturers to produce the APIs and other
substances and materials or finished products for commercial sale must pass inspection and be approved by the FDA and other relevant regulatory authorities. Our contract suppliers and manufacturers
must comply with cGMP requirements enforced by the FDA through its facilities inspection program and review of submitted technical information. If the safety of any product or product candidate or
component is compromised due to a failure to adhere to applicable laws or for other reasons, we may not be able to successfully commercialize or obtain regulatory approval for the affected product or
product candidate, and we may be held liable for injuries sustained as a result. Any of these factors could cause a delay or termination of preclinical studies, clinical trials or regulatory
submissions or approvals of our product candidates, and could entail higher costs or result in our being unable to effectively commercialize our approved products on a timely basis, or at all. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
also rely and will continue to rely on certain third parties as the sole source of the materials they supply or the finished products they manufacture. For example, Catalent is the
sole-source supplier for the Zydis formulation of BHV-0223, and we expect Catalent to be the sole source supplier for the ODT formulation of rimegepant. We may also have sole-source suppliers for one
or more of our other product candidates. Some of the APIs and other substances and materials used in our product candidates are currently available only from one or a limited number of domestic or
foreign suppliers and foreign manufacturers and certain of our finished product candidates are manufactured by one or a limited number of contract manufacturers. In the event an existing supplier
fails to supply product on a timely basis or in the requested amount, supplies product that fails to meet regulatory requirements, becomes unavailable through business interruption or financial
insolvency or loses its regulatory status as an approved source or if we or our manufacturers are unable to renew current supply agreements when such agreements expire and we do not have a second
supplier, we likely would incur added costs and delays in identifying or qualifying replacement manufacturers and materials and there can be no assurance that replacements would be available to us on
a timely basis, on acceptable terms or at all. In certain cases we may be required to get regulatory approval to use alternative suppliers, and this process of approval could delay production of our
products or development of product candidates indefinitely. We and our manufacturers do not currently maintain inventory of these APIs and other substances and materials. Any interruption in the
supply of an API or other substance or material or in the manufacture of a finished product could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition, these contract manufacturers are or may be engaged with other companies to supply and manufacture materials or products for such companies, which also exposes our suppliers
and manufacturers to regulatory risks for the production of such materials and products. As a result, failure to meet the regulatory requirements for the production of those materials and products may
also affect the regulatory clearance of a contract supplier's or manufacturer's facility. If the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory agency does not approve these facilities for the supply or
manufacture of our product candidates, or if it withdraws its approval in the future, we may need to find alternative supply </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
we prepare for later-stage clinical trials and potential commercialization, we will need to take steps to increase the scale of production of our product candidates, which may include
transferring production to new third-party suppliers or manufacturers. In order to conduct larger or late-stage scale clinical trials for our product candidates and supply sufficient commercial
quantities of the resulting drug product and its components, if that product candidate is approved for sale, our contract manufacturers and suppliers will need to produce our product candidates in
larger quantities, more cost effectively and, in certain cases, at higher yields than they currently achieve. These third-party contractors may not be able to successfully increase the manufacturing
capacity for any of such product candidates in a timely or cost-effective manner or at all. Significant scale up of manufacturing may require additional processes, technologies and validation studies,
which are costly, may not be successful and which the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities must review and approve. In addition, quality issues may arise during those scale-up activities because of
the inherent properties of a product candidate itself or of a product candidate in combination with other components added during the manufacturing and packaging process, or during shipping and
storage of the APIs or the finished product. If our third-party contractors are unable to successfully scale up the manufacture of any of our product candidates in sufficient quality and quantity and
at commercially reasonable prices, and we are unable to find one or more replacement suppliers or manufacturers capable of production at a substantially equivalent cost in substantially equivalent
volumes and quality, and we are unable to successfully transfer the processes on a timely basis, the development of that product candidate and regulatory approval or commercial launch for any
resulting products may be delayed, or there may be a shortage in supply, either of which could significantly harm our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
expect to continue to depend on third-party contract suppliers and manufacturers for the foreseeable future. Our supply and manufacturing agreements, if any, do not guarantee that a
contract supplier or manufacturer will provide services adequate for our needs. We and our contract suppliers and manufacturers continue to improve production processes, certain aspects of which are
complex and unique, and we may encounter difficulties with new or existing processes. While we attempt to build in certain contractual obligations on such third-party suppliers and manufacturers, we
may not be able to ensure that such third parties comply with these obligations. Depending on the extent of any difficulties encountered, we could experience an interruption in clinical or commercial
supply, with the result that the development, regulatory approval or commercialization of our product candidates may be delayed or interrupted. In addition, third-party suppliers and manufacturers may
have the ability to increase the price payable by us for the supply of the APIs and other substances and materials used in our product candidates, in some cases without our consent. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally,
any damage to or destruction of our third-party manufacturers' or suppliers' facilities or equipment may significantly impair our ability to have our product candidates
manufactured on a timely basis. Furthermore, if a contract manufacturer or supplier becomes financially distressed or insolvent, or discontinues our relationship beyond the term of any existing
agreement for any other
reason, this could result in substantial management time and expense to identify, qualify and transfer processes to alternative manufacturers or suppliers, and could lead to an interruption in
clinical or commercial supply. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our

face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators, and a number of more established companies may also be pursuing strategies to license or acquire third-party
intellectual property rights that we may consider attractive. These established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, financial resources and greater clinical
development and commercialization capabilities. In addition, companies that perceive us to be a competitor may be unwilling to assign or license rights to us. Whether we reach a definitive agreement
for a collaboration will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator's resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed
collaborator's evaluation of a number of factors. Those factors may include the design or results of clinical trials, the likelihood of approval by the FDA, EMA or similar foreign regulatory
authorities, the potential market for the subject product candidate, the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering such product candidate to patients, competing products, the existence of
uncertainty with respect to our ownership of technology, which can exist if there is a challenge to such ownership without regard to the merits of the challenge, and industry and market conditions
generally. The collaborator may also consider alternative product candidates or technologies for similar indications that may be available to collaborate on and whether such a collaboration could be
more attractive than the one with us for our product candidate. We may also be restricted under existing license agreements from entering into agreements on certain terms with potential collaborators.
Collaborations are complex and time-consuming to negotiate and
document. In addition, there have been a significant number of recent business combinations among large pharmaceutical companies that have resulted in a reduced number of potential future
collaborators. </FONT></P>

rights or maintain the existing intellectual property rights we have, we may have to curtail the development of such product candidate, reduce or delay its development program or one or more of our
other development programs, delay its potential commercialization or reduce the scope of any sales or marketing activities, or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization
activities at our own expense. If we elect to increase our expenditures to fund development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional capital, which may not be

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since
its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, as well as recent efforts by the Trump administration to repeal or replace
certain aspects of the ACA. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA or otherwise circumvent some of
the requirements for health insurance mandated by the ACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not
passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 includes a provision
repealing, effective January&nbsp;1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a
year that is commonly referred to as the "individual mandate". Additionally, on January&nbsp;23, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that
delayed the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees, including the so-called "Cadillac" tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health
insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. We continue to evaluate the effect that the ACA and its possible repeal and replacement has
on our business. It is uncertain the extent to which any such changes may impact our business or financial condition. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. On August&nbsp;2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among
other things, created
measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through
2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation's automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers
of 2% per fiscal year. These reductions went into effect on April&nbsp;1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional
Congressional action is taken. On January&nbsp;2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of
providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five
years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other health care funding, which could have an adverse effect on our customers and accordingly, our financial operations. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover,
payment methodologies may be subject to changes in healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives. For example, CMS may develop new payment and delivery models, such as
bundled payment models. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ("HHS") set a goal of moving 30% of Medicare payments to alternative payment models tied to the quality or value of services by
2016 and 50% of Medicare payments into these alternative payment models by the end of 2018. We expect that additional U.S. federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of
which could limit the amounts that the U.S. federal government will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing
pressures. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further,
there have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries and proposed state and federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing,

between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the costs of drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal
level, the costs of prescription pharmaceuticals in the United States has also been the subject of considerable discussion, and members of Congress and the Trump Administration have stated that they
will address such costs through new legislative and administrative measures. At the state level, legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control
pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency
measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Legally mandated price controls on payment amounts by third-party payors or other restrictions
could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to
determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs. This could reduce the ultimate demand for our products or put
pressure on our product pricing, which could negatively affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the European Union, similar political, economic and regulatory developments may affect our ability to profitably commercialize any of our product candidates, if approved. In addition
to continuing pressure on prices and cost containment measures, legislative developments at the European Union or member state level may result in significant additional requirements or obstacles that
may increase our operating costs. The delivery of healthcare in the European Union, including the establishment and operation of health services and the pricing and reimbursement of medicines, is
almost exclusively a matter for national, rather than European Union, law and policy. National governments and health service providers have different priorities and approaches to the delivery of
health care and the pricing and reimbursement of products in that context. In general, however, the healthcare budgetary constraints in most EU member states have resulted in restrictions on the
pricing and reimbursement of medicines by relevant health service providers. Coupled with ever-increasing European Union and national regulatory burdens on those wishing to develop and market
products, this could prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to commercialize any products for which we
obtain marketing approval. In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products
and therapies. </FONT></P>

We may not be able to obtain or maintain orphan drug designation or exclusivity for our product candidates.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have obtained orphan drug designation in the United States for trigriluzole in SCA, BHV-0223 in ALS and BHV-5000 in Rett syndrome. We may
seek orphan drug designation for other product candidates in the future. Regulatory authorities in some jurisdictions, including the United States and the European Union, may designate drugs for
relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which
is generally defined as a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
orphan drug exclusivity for BHV-0223 for ALS is contingent upon a showing that BHV-0223 is clinically superior to Rilutek in the treatment of ALS. Clinical superiority may be
demonstrated by showing that a drug has greater effectiveness than the approved drug, greater safety in a substantial portion of the target population, or otherwise makes a major contribution to
patient care. If we are unable to demonstrate that BHV-0223 is clinically superior to riluzole, we will not be entitled to the
benefits of orphan drug exclusivity for BHV-0223 for ALS, which could adversely affect our business and our ability to market and sell BHV-0223 if it is approved for sale. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally,
if a product with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled
to a period of marketing exclusivity, which precludes the FDA or the EMA from approving another marketing application for the same drug for the same indication during that time period. The applicable
period is seven years in the United States and ten years in the European Union. The European exclusivity period can be reduced to six years if a drug no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug
designation or if the drug is sufficiently profitable so that market exclusivity is no longer justified. Orphan drug exclusivity may be lost if the FDA or the EMA determines that the request for
designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
cannot assure you that any future application for orphan drug designation with respect to any other product candidate will be granted. If we are unable to obtain orphan drug
designation with respect to other product candidates in the United States, we will not be eligible to obtain the period of market exclusivity that could result from orphan drug designation or be
afforded the financial incentives associated with orphan drug designation. Even when we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a product, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from
competition because different drugs can be approved for the same condition. Even after an orphan drug is approved, the FDA can subsequently approve a later drug for the same condition if the FDA
concludes that the later drug is clinically superior in that it is shown to be safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. </FONT></P>

Fast track designation by the FDA may not actually lead to a faster development or regulatory review or

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In May 2017, we received fast track designation from the FDA for trigriluzole for the potential treatment of SCA. Fast track designation
provides opportunities for frequent interactions with FDA review staff, as well as eligibility for priority review, if relevant criteria are met, and rolling review. Fast track designation is intended
to facilitate and expedite development and review of an NDA to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious or life-threatening conditions. However, fast track designation does not
accelerate clinical trials or mean that the regulatory requirements are less stringent, nor does it ensure that trigriluzole will receive marketing approval or that approval will be granted within any
particular timeframe. We may also seek fast track designation for our other product candidates. We may not experience a faster development process, review or approval compared to </FONT></P>

If we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for product candidates, we may not be able to
compete effectively in our markets.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Market exclusivity for pharmaceutical products is based upon patent rights and certain regulatory forms of exclusivity. The failure to obtain
patents of commercially relevant scope, or limitations on the use or loss of patent rights, could have a negative effect on our business. In addition, the patent environment can be unpredictable and
the validity and enforceability of patents cannot be predicted with certainty. Absent relevant patent protection for a product, once the regulatory exclusivity periods expire, generic versions can be
approved and marketed. Regulatory forms of exclusivity vary from country-to-country and are not available in certain countries. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
rely upon patents to protect the intellectual property related to our development programs and product candidates. Our success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and
maintain patent protection in the United States and other countries with respect to our current and future product candidates. We have sought to protect our proprietary positions by filing and
in-licensing patents and patent applications. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, and we or our licensors may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a
reasonable cost or in a timely manner or in all jurisdictions. None of our patents claiming trigriluzole or BHV-0223 have issued, and applications filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT,
with respect to trigriluzole and BHV-0223 have been nationalized and are pending in the U.S., European countries, Japan, Korea, China, India, Russia, Brazil, Canada, and other countries. It is also
possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development in time to obtain patent protection. The patent applications that we own or in-license may fail to result in
issued patents with claims that cover our current and future product candidates in the United States or in other foreign countries. If the patent
applications we hold or have in-licensed with respect to our development programs and product candidates fail to issue, if their breadth or strength of protection is threatened, or if they fail to
provide meaningful exclusivity for our current and future product candidates, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to develop product candidates, and threaten our ability to
commercialize, products. Any such outcome could have a negative effect on our business. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
patent position of biopharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions. In addition, the laws of foreign countries may not protect
our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Publications of discoveries in scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United
States and other jurisdictions remain confidential for a period of time after filing, and some remain so until issued. Therefore, we cannot know with certainty whether we were the first to make the
inventions claimed in our owned or licensed patents or pending patent applications, or that we were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. As a result, the issuance, scope,
validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. There is no assurance that all potentially relevant prior art relating to our patents and patent applications
has been found, and such prior art could potentially invalidate one or more of our patents or prevent a patent from issuing from one or more of our pending patent applications. There is also no
assurance that there is not prior art of which we are aware, but which we do not believe affects the validity, patentability or enforceability of a claim in our patents and patent applications, which
may, nonetheless, ultimately be found to affect the validity, patentability or enforceability of a claim. </FONT></P>

these patents or any other patents owned by or licensed to us after patent issuance could deprive us of rights necessary for

protection it affords, is limited. Even if patents covering our product candidates are obtained, once the patent life has expired for a product candidate, we may be open to competition from
competitive medications, including generic medications. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such product
candidates might expire before or shortly after such product candidates are commercialized. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude
others from commercializing product candidates similar or identical to ours. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Depending
upon the timing, duration and conditions of FDA marketing approval of our product candidates, one or more of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension
under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, and similar legislation in the European Union. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit
a patent term extension of up to five years for a patent covering an approved product as compensation for effective patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process.
However, we may not receive an extension if we fail to apply within applicable deadlines, fail to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise fail to satisfy applicable requirements.
Moreover, the length of the extension could be less than we request. In the United States, only one patent per approved product can be extended, and the extension cannot extend </FONT></P>

parties owning such intellectual property rights could seek either an injunction prohibiting our sales, or, with respect to our sales, an obligation on our

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
current law in the United States, as in most other countries in the world, uses a "first-to-file" system for deciding which party should be granted a patent when two or more patent
applications are filed by different parties claiming the same invention. This requires that we promptly file patent applications on our inventions. The failure to do so could result in another patent
applicant being awarded a patent, even though we may have made the invention first. Current U.S. law also provides a lower evidentiary standard in U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ("USPTO")
proceedings compared to the evidentiary standard in U.S. federal courts necessary to invalidate a patent claim. Hence, a third party could potentially provide evidence in a USPTO proceeding sufficient
for the USPTO to hold a claim invalid even though the same evidence would be insufficient to invalidate the claim if first presented in a district court action. Accordingly, a third party may attempt
to use the USPTO procedures to invalidate our patent claims that would not have been invalidated if first challenged by the third party as a defendant in a district court action. </FONT></P>

Some intellectual property which we have in-licensed may have been discovered through government funded
programs and thus may be subject to federal regulations such as "march-in" rights, certain reporting requirements, and a preference for U.S. industry. Compliance with such regulations may limit our
exclusive rights, and limit our ability to contract with non-U.S. manufacturers.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the intellectual property rights we have licensed or acquired, including rights licensed to us by Rutgers, the State University of New
Jersey, and rights assigned to us by ALS Biopharma may have been generated through the use of U.S. government funding and may therefore be subject to certain federal regulations. As a result, the U.S.
government may have certain rights to intellectual property embodied in our current or future product candidates pursuant to the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980 ("Bayh-Dole Act"). These U.S. government rights
in certain inventions developed under a government-funded program include a non-exclusive, non-transferable, irrevocable worldwide license to use inventions for any governmental purpose. In addition,
the U.S. government has the right to require us to grant exclusive, partially exclusive, or non-exclusive licenses to any of these inventions to a third party if it determines that:
(i)&nbsp;adequate steps have not been taken to commercialize the invention; (ii)&nbsp;government action is necessary to meet public health or safety needs; or (iii)&nbsp;government action is
necessary to meet requirements for public use under federal regulations (also referred to as "march-in rights"). The U.S. government also has the right to take title to these inventions if we, or the
applicable licensor, fail to disclose the invention to the government and fail to file an application to register the intellectual property within specified time limits. Intellectual property
generated under a government funded program is also subject to certain reporting requirements, compliance with which may require us or the applicable licensor to expend substantial resources. In
addition, the U.S. government requires that any products embodying the subject invention or produced through the use of the subject invention be manufactured substantially in the United States. The
manufacturing preference requirement can be waived if the owner of the intellectual property can show that reasonable but unsuccessful efforts have been made to grant licenses on similar terms to
potential licensees that would be likely to manufacture substantially in the United States or that under the circumstances domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible. This preference for U.S.
manufacturers may limit our ability to contract with non-U.S. product manufacturers for products covered by such intellectual property. To the extent any of our current or future intellectual property
is generated through the use of U.S. government funding, the provisions of the Bayh-Dole Act may similarly apply. Any exercise by the government of certain of its rights could harm our competitive
position, business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. </FONT></P>

or other violation of the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. There have been many lawsuits and other proceedings involving patent and other intellectual property rights
in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including patent infringement lawsuits, interferences, inter partes reviews, post grant reviews and re-examination proceedings before the USPTO, and
corresponding foreign patent offices. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we are developing product
candidates. Some claimants may have substantially greater resources than we do and may be able to sustain the costs of complex intellectual property litigation to a greater degree and for longer
periods of time than we could. In addition, patent holding companies that focus solely on extracting royalties and settlements by enforcing patent rights may target us. As the biotechnology and
pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our product candidates may be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of third
parties. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
may in the future become party to, or be threatened with, adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our product candidates and
technology, including interference or derivation proceedings, post grant review and inter partes review before the USPTO or similar adversarial proceedings or litigation in other jurisdictions.
Similarly, we or our licensors or collaborators may initiate such proceedings or litigation against third parties, including to challenge the validity or scope of intellectual property rights
controlled by third parties. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future, regardless of their merit. There is a risk
that third parties may choose to engage in litigation with us to enforce or to otherwise assert their patent rights against us. Even if we believe such claims are without merit, a court of competent
jurisdiction could hold that these third-party patents are valid, enforceable and infringed, and the holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to commercialize such product
candidate unless we obtained a license under the applicable patents, or until such patents expire or are finally determined to be invalid or unenforceable. Similarly, if any third-party patents were
held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover aspects of our technology, such as our compositions, formulations, or methods of treatment, prevention or use, the holders of any such patents may be
able to block our ability to develop and commercialize the applicable product candidate unless we obtained a license or until such patent expires or is finally determined to be invalid, unenforceable
or not infringed by our technology. In either case, such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be
non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. Furthermore, even in the absence of litigation, we may need or may choose to obtain licenses from third
parties to advance our research or allow commercialization of our product candidates, and we have done so from time to time. We may fail to obtain any of these licenses at a reasonable cost or on
reasonable terms, if at all. In such an event, we would be unable to further practice our technologies or develop and commercialize any of our product candidates at issue, which could harm our
business significantly. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parties
making claims against us may obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to further develop and commercialize one or more of our
product candidates, if approved. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of employee resources from our
business. Third parties making
such claims may have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to these legal actions than we or our licensors or collaborators can. In the event of a successful claim of infringement
against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys' fees for willful infringement, pay royalties, redesign our infringing products or obtain one or more
licenses from third parties, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. </FONT></P>

intellectual property rights. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file legal claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. Our adversaries in these proceedings may
have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to prosecuting these legal actions than we can. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours or our
licensors is not valid or is unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse
result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
initiation of a claim against a third party may also cause the third party to bring counter claims against us such as claims asserting that our patents are invalid or unenforceable
or claims challenging the scope of the intellectual property rights we own or control. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity or unenforceability are
commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness, non-enablement, lack of adequate
written description or lack of statutory subject matter. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant
material information from the USPTO, or made a materially misleading statement, during prosecution. Third parties may also raise similar validity claims before the USPTO in post-grant proceedings such
as ex parte re-examinations, inter partes review, or post-grant review, or oppositions or similar proceedings outside the United States, in parallel with litigation or even outside the context of
litigation. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. We cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we, our licensors and the
patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
the patents and patent applications that we have licensed, we may have limited or no right to participate in the defense of any licensed patents against challenge by a third party.
Therefore, these
patents and applications may not be defended in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity or unenforceability, we
would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of any future patent protection on our current or future product candidates. Such a loss of patent protection could harm our business. In addition, if the
breadth or strength of protection provided by our or our licensors' patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or
commercialize current or future product candidates. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
may not be able to prevent, alone or with our licensors, infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect
those rights as fully as in the United States. Any litigation or other proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights may fail, and even if successful, may result in substantial costs and
distract our management and other employees. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore,
because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could
be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities
analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have an adverse effect on the price of our common shares. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filing, prosecuting and defending patents covering our product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively

not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. Further, licensing partners may not prosecute patents in certain jurisdictions in which we
may obtain commercial rights, thereby precluding the possibility of later obtaining patent protection in these countries. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our
inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our
technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and may also export infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but
enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These
products may compete with our product candidates, and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many
companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries,
particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biotechnology products,
which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents, if obtained, or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce
our patent rights, whether owned or licensed to us, in foreign jurisdictions, whether or not successful, could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of
our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing, and could provoke third parties to assert claims against
us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual
property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license. Furthermore, while we intend to protect our
intellectual property rights in our expected significant markets, we cannot ensure that we will be able to initiate or maintain similar efforts in all jurisdictions in which we may wish to market our
product candidates. Accordingly, our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights in such countries may be inadequate, which may have an adverse effect on our ability to successfully
commercialize our product candidates in all of our expected significant foreign markets. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally,
the requirements for patentability may differ in certain countries, particularly developing countries. For example, unlike other countries, China has a heightened
requirement for patentability, and specifically requires a detailed description of medical uses of a claimed drug. In India, unlike the United States, there is no link between regulatory approval of a
drug and its patent status. Furthermore, generic drug manufacturers or other competitors may challenge the scope, validity or enforceability of our or our licensors' patents, requiring us or our
licensors to engage in complex, lengthy and costly litigation or other proceedings. Generic drug manufacturers may develop, seek approval for, and launch generic versions of our products. In addition
to India, certain countries in Europe and developing countries, including China, have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties. In those
countries, we and our licensors may have limited remedies if patents are infringed or if we or our licensors are compelled to grant a license to a third party, which could materially diminish the
value of those patents. This could limit our potential revenue opportunities. Accordingly, our and our licensors' efforts to enforce intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to
obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we own or license. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we are not currently experiencing any claims challenging the inventorship or ownership of our patents or ownership of our intellectual
property, we may in the future be subject to claims that former employees, collaborators or other third parties have an interest in our patents or other intellectual property as an inventor or
co-inventor, or that an employee, consultant, or other third party performed work for us that conflicts with that person's obligations to a third party, such as an employer, and thus, that the third
party has an ownership interest in the intellectual property arising out of work performed for us. While it is our policy to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the conception
or development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who, in fact, conceives
or develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. For example, the assignment of intellectual property rights may not be self-executing or the assignment agreements may be breached, or we
may have disputes arise from conflicting obligations of consultants or others who are involved in developing our product candidates. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these and other
claims challenging inventorship or ownership. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive
ownership of, or right to use, valuable intellectual property. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to
management and other employees. This risk similarly applies to any intellectual property that we in-license. If a licensor is subject to a claim challenging inventorship or ownership, it could
adversely impact our exclusivity under or rights to use valuable in-licensed intellectual property. </FONT></P>

Our inability to protect our confidential information and trade secrets would harm our business and
competitive position.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to seeking patents for some of our technology and product candidates, via intellectual property we own or license, we also rely on
trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect these trade secrets, in part, by entering into
non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, contract manufacturers,
consultants, advisors and other third parties. We also enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. We also seek to preserve the
integrity and confidentiality of our data, trade secrets and know-how by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems.
Monitoring unauthorized uses and disclosures is difficult, and we do not know whether the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary technologies will be effective. We cannot guarantee that our
trade secrets and other proprietary and confidential information will not be disclosed or that competitors will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets. Despite these efforts, any of these
parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a
party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts both within and outside the United
States may be less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. Moreover, if a competitor lawfully obtained or independently developed any of our trade secrets, we would have no right to prevent
such competitor from using that technology or information to compete with us. Any misappropriation, disclosure or independent development of our trade secrets could harm our competitive position. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trade
secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect as trade secrets and know-how will over time be disseminated within the industry through independent development, the publication
of journal articles, and the movement of personnel skilled in the art from company to company or academic to industry scientific positions. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or
independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent such competitor from using that technology or information to compete with us, which could harm our competitive position. If
we are unable to prevent material disclosure of the intellectual property related to our technologies to third parties, we will not be able to establish or maintain a competitive advantage in our
market, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Even if we are able to adequately protect our trade secrets and proprietary information, our trade
secrets could otherwise become known or could be independently discovered by our competitors. Competitors could purchase our products and attempt to replicate some or all of the competitive advantages
we derive from our development efforts, willfully infringe our intellectual property rights, design around our protected technology or develop their own competitive technologies that fall outside of
our intellectual property rights. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Periodic maintenance and annuity fees on any issued patent are due to be paid to the USPTO and foreign patent agencies in several stages over
the lifetime of the patent. The USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the
patent application process. While an inadvertent lapse can in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which
noncompliance can result in abandonment or
lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Non-compliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a
patent or patent application include failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. If we or
our licensors fail to maintain the patents and patent applications covering our products, our competitors might be able to enter the market, which would harm our business. In addition, to the extent
that we have responsibility for taking any action related to the prosecution or maintenance of patents or patent application in-licensed from a third party, any failure on our part to maintain the
in-licensed rights could jeopardize our rights under the relevant license and may expose us to liability. </FONT></P>

We will continue to incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management
and board of directors will be required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives and corporate governance practices.  </I></B></FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a public company listed in the United States, we have and will continue to, incur significant incremental legal, accounting and other
expenses. We estimate the additional costs we will incur as a result of being a public company to be approximately $1.5&nbsp;million to $2.0&nbsp;million annually. These additional costs could
negatively affect our financial results. In addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including regulations implemented by the SEC and
the New York Stock Exchange, may increase legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time consuming. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and
standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management's time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance
activities. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover,
these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, we expect that
these rules and regulations may make it more difficult for us to obtain some types of insurance, including director and
officer liability insurance, and we might be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage, which in turn could make it
more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our management and board of directors. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition, these rules and regulations are often subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may
evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing
revisions to disclosure and governance practices. If, notwithstanding our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards, we fail to comply, regulatory authorities may initiate legal
proceedings against us and our business may be harmed. </FONT></P>

shareholder approval, including the election and removal of directors and approval of any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. Some of these persons or entities may
have interests different than yours. For example, because many of these shareholders purchased their shares at prices substantially below the current market price of our common shares and have held

be at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors including our business prospects, cash requirements, financial performance and new product development.
Accordingly, investors cannot rely on dividend income from our common shares and any returns on an investment in our common shares will likely depend entirely upon any future appreciation in the price

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our management has broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds from our recent initial public offering ("IPO") and could spend the
proceeds in ways that do not improve our results of operations or enhance the value of our common shares. You may not agree with our decisions, and our use of the proceeds may not yield any return on
your investment. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
expect to, and in some cases have begun to, use the net proceeds from our recent IPO to conduct our two Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trials of rimegepant for the acute treatment of
migraine which commenced in July 2017; to fund continued research and development of BHV-3500 for the acute treatment and prevention of migraine; to complete our ongoing extension phase of the
Phase&nbsp;2/3 clinical trial with trigriluzole for the treatment of spinocerebellar ataxia, and initiate studies with trigriluzole in OCD and Alzheimer's disease; to fund continued research and
development of BHV-5000 for the treatment of symptoms associated with Rett syndrome, including completion of our planned Phase&nbsp;1 clinical trial for this indication; to fund other research and
development activities, including development of BHV-0223 for the treatment of ALS, as well as completion of our bioequivalence study of BHV-0223; and for working capital and other general corporate
purposes, including the satisfaction of any milestone payment obligations under our license agreements. The failure by our management to apply these funds effectively could result in financial losses
that could have an adverse effect on our business, cause the price of our common shares to decline and delay the development of our product candidates. Pending their use, we may invest the net
proceeds from our IPO in a manner that does not produce income or that loses value. </FONT></P>

We are an "emerging growth company," and we cannot be certain if the reduced reporting requirements
applicable to "emerging growth companies" will make our common shares less attractive to investors.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are an "emerging growth company," as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the "JOBS Act"). For as long as we continue
to be an "emerging growth company," we may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not "emerging growth companies,"
including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote
on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As an "emerging growth company," we are required to report only two years of financial
results and selected financial data compared to three and five years, respectively, for comparable data reported by other public companies. We may take advantage of these exemptions until we are no
longer an "emerging growth company." We could be an "emerging growth company" until December&nbsp;31, 2022, which is the end of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the completion of
our recent IPO, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if the aggregate market value of our common shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $700&nbsp;million as of
any June&nbsp;30 (the end of our second fiscal quarter) before that time, in which case we would no longer be an "emerging growth company" as of the following December&nbsp;31 (our fiscal year
end). We cannot predict if investors will find our common shares less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common shares less attractive as a result, there
may be a less active trading market for our common shares and the price of our common shares may be more volatile. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of
deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a
timely basis. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior
to the completion of our IPO, we were a private company with limited accounting personnel and other resources to address our internal control over financial reporting. In
preparation of our financial statements in connection with our IPO, we determined that material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting existed during each of fiscal 2014, 2015 and
2016 and remained unremediated as of December&nbsp;31, 2017. These material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting are described below. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
did not design or maintain an effective control environment commensurate with our financial reporting requirements. We lacked a sufficient number of trained professionals with an

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These
material weaknesses contributed to several accounting adjustments being made to our financial statements for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017 related
to our accounting for our license agreement obligations, income taxes, variable interest entities, share-based compensation, derivative liabilities, warrants and contingent equity, research and
development expense, general and administrative expense, and other income (expense). In addition, these material weaknesses contributed to the restatement of our financial statements for the nine
months ended September&nbsp;30, 2016 related to our accounting for license agreement obligations. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
identified an additional material weakness as a result of the material weakness in our control environment in that we did not design and maintain controls over the operating
effectiveness of information technology ("IT") general controls for information systems that are relevant to the preparation of our financial statements. Specifically, we did not design and maintain
effective controls over program change management; user access, including segregation of duties; or computer operations. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These
IT deficiencies did not result in a material misstatement to our financial statements; however, the deficiencies, when aggregated, could impact the effectiveness of IT-dependent
controls, such as automated controls that address the risk of material misstatement to one or more assertions, along with the IT controls and underlying data that support the effectiveness of
system-generated data and reports. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each
of the control deficiencies could result in a misstatement of these accounts or disclosures that would result in a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated
financial statements that would not be prevented or detected, and accordingly, we determined that these control deficiencies constitute material weaknesses. </FONT></P>

The holders of our common shares may have fewer protections as a shareholder of our company, as the rights of
shareholders under BVI law differ from those under U.S. law.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our corporate affairs are governed by our memorandum and articles of association, the BVI Business Companies Act, 2004 (the "BVI Act") and the
common law of the BVI. The rights of shareholders to take legal action against our directors, actions by minority shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under BVI law are to
a large extent governed by the common law of the BVI and by the BVI Act. The common law of the BVI is derived in part from comparatively limited judicial precedent in the BVI as well as from English
common law, which has persuasive, but not binding, authority on a court in the BVI. The rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under BVI law therefore are not
as clearly established as they would be under statutes or judicial precedents in some jurisdictions in the United States. In particular, the BVI has a less developed body of securities laws as
compared to the United States, and some states, such as Delaware, have more fully developed and judicially interpreted bodies of corporate law. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
a result of all of the above, holders of our common shares may have more difficulty in protecting their interests through actions against our management, directors or major
shareholders than they would as shareholders of a U.S. company. They may have greater difficulty securing legal advice about the law of the BVI than they would U.S. and state law, and the relatively
less developed nature of that country's securities law may leave investors with less certainty about the validity and strength of any claims they believe they may have against us. In addition, other
differences between BVI and U.S. law, as well as the terms of our articles of association, may result in shareholders having different potential influence than they would under various U.S. state laws
with respect to matters such as officer and director actions, mergers and acquisitions, takeover efforts, and other corporate decision making. </FONT></P>

fewer alternatives available to them if they believe that corporate wrongdoing has occurred. The BVI courts are also unlikely to: (i)&nbsp;recognize or enforce against us judgments of courts in the

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In

general rule pursuant to English common law known as the rule in </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Foss v. Harbottle</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, a court will generally refuse to interfere with the management of a
company at the insistence of a minority of its shareholders who express dissatisfaction with the conduct of the company's affairs by the majority or the board of
directors. However, every shareholder is entitled to have the affairs of the company conducted properly according to law and the constituent documents of the company. As such, if those who control the
company have persistently disregarded the requirements of company law or the provisions of the company's memorandum and articles of association, then the courts will grant relief. Generally, the areas
in which the courts will intervene are the following: (1)&nbsp;an act complained of which is outside the scope of the authorized business or is illegal or not capable of ratification by the
majority; (2)&nbsp;acts that constitute fraud on the minority where the wrongdoers control the company; (3)&nbsp;acts that infringe on the personal rights of the shareholders, such as the right to
vote; and (4)&nbsp;where the company has not complied with provisions requiring approval of the shareholders, which are more limited than the rights afforded minority shareholders under the laws of
many states in the United States. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having
regard to the above, the protection available to minority shareholders under BVI law may be more limited than under the laws of some jurisdictions in the United States. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a BVI business company, it may be difficult for a shareholder to effect service of process within the United States upon us, our directors
and officers, or to enforce against us, or them, judgments obtained in U.S. courts, including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or
any state therein. Additionally, it may be difficult to assert U.S. securities law claims in actions originally instituted outside of the United States. Foreign courts may refuse to hear a U.S.
securities law claim because foreign courts may not be the most appropriate forums in which to bring such a claim. Even if a foreign court agrees to hear a claim, it may determine that the law of the
jurisdiction in which the foreign court resides, and not U.S. law, is applicable to the claim. Further, if U.S. law is found to be applicable, the content of applicable U.S. law must be proved as a
fact, which can be a time-consuming and costly process, and certain matters of procedure would still be governed by the law of the jurisdiction in which the foreign court resides. </FONT></P>

tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we do business. Our actual tax rate may vary from our expectation and that variance may be material. A number of factors may increase our future effective tax
rates, including: (1)&nbsp;the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed; (2)&nbsp;the resolution of issues arising from any future tax audits with various tax
authorities; (3)&nbsp;changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; (4)&nbsp;our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income and any
adjustments to the amount of the net operating loss carryforwards we can utilize; and (5)&nbsp;changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws, and changes in generally accepted

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
a company organized under the laws of the BVI, we are principally subject to taxation in the BVI. Under the current laws of the BVI, tax on a company's income is assessed at a zero
percent tax rate. For U.S. federal tax purposes, a corporation is generally considered a "domestic corporation" if it is incorporated or organized in the United States, and a "foreign corporation" if
it is incorporated or organized in a non-U.S. jurisdiction. Because we are a BVI incorporated entity, we would be classified as a foreign corporation under these general rules. Section&nbsp;7874 of
the Code ("Section&nbsp;7874") however, contains rules that can result in a foreign corporation being treated as a domestic corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes. Under Section&nbsp;7874, a
foreign corporation will nevertheless be treated as a domestic corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes if (1)&nbsp;the foreign corporation directly or indirectly acquires substantially all of the
assets held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation (including the indirect acquisition of assets by acquisition of all the outstanding shares of a domestic corporation), (2)&nbsp;the
shareholders of the acquired domestic corporation hold at least 80% (by either vote or value) of the shares of the acquiring foreign corporation after the acquisition by reason of holding shares in
the acquired domestic corporation (including the receipt of the foreign corporation's shares in exchange for the domestic corporation's shares) (the "ownership test"), and (3)&nbsp;the foreign
corporation's "expanded affiliated group" does not have substantial business activities in the foreign corporation's country of organization or incorporation relative to the expanded affiliated
group's worldwide activities. For purposes of Section&nbsp;7874, "expanded affiliated group" means the foreign corporation and all subsidiaries in which the foreign corporation, directly or
indirectly, owns more than 50% of the shares by vote and value. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
December&nbsp;31, 2016, we entered into an agreement with the stockholders of Biohaven Pharmaceuticals,&nbsp;Inc. ("BPI"), a Delaware corporation, to purchase all of the
outstanding capital stock of BPI for an aggregate purchase price of $0.6&nbsp;million, payable by the issuance of Company promissory notes to each BPI stockholder. Although we and BPI had certain
shareholders in common before December&nbsp;31, 2016, based on the rules for determining share ownership under Section&nbsp;7874, we believe the stockholders of BPI owned less than 80% of our
company. Accordingly, we do not believe that this transaction meets the ownership test under Section&nbsp;7874 and therefore do not believe that we should be treated as a domestic corporation for
U.S. federal tax purposes. However, the tax law in this area could be changed, including changed on a retroactive basis, and the application of Section&nbsp;7874 to our acquisition of BPI could
substantially increase our effective tax rate. </FONT></P>

December&nbsp;22, 2017, President Trump signed into law new legislation that significantly revises the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The newly enacted U.S. federal
income tax law, among other things, contains significant changes to corporate taxation, including reduction of the corporate tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%, limitation
of the tax deduction for interest expense to 30% of adjusted earnings (except for certain small businesses), limitation of the deduction for net operating losses to 80% of current year taxable income
and elimination of net operating loss carrybacks, one time taxation of offshore earnings at reduced rates regardless of whether they are repatriated, elimination of U.S. tax on foreign earnings
(subject to certain important exceptions), immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions </FONT></P>

depreciation expense over time, and modifying or repealing many business deductions and credits. Notwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, the overall impact of the new
federal tax law is uncertain and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the newly enacted
federal tax law. The impact of this tax reform on holders of our common shares is also uncertain and could be adverse. We urge our shareholders to consult with their legal and tax advisors with
respect to this legislation and the potential tax consequences of investing in or holding our common shares. </FONT></P>

may also become subject to income, withholding or other taxes in jurisdictions by reason of our activities and operations, and it is possible that taxing authorities in such
jurisdictions could assert that we are subject to greater taxation than we currently anticipate. For example, we expect to form an Irish subsidiary that will be the principal operating company for
conducting our business and the entity that will hold our intellectual property rights in certain of our product candidates. This new Irish subsidiary would be subject to taxation in Ireland. In
addition to the establishment of this Irish entity as our principal operating company, we, as the parent company, may also be subject to taxation in Ireland in the future, even as we remain a company
organized under the laws of the BVI. Any of these transactions may result in higher tax liabilities and a higher overall effective tax rate. Any significant increase in our future effective tax rates
could reduce net income for future periods. </FONT></P>

If we are a passive foreign investment company there could be adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to
U.S. holders.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Code, we will be a passive foreign investment company ("PFIC") for any taxable year in which (1)&nbsp;75% or more of our gross
income consists of passive income or (2)&nbsp;50% or more of the average quarterly value of our assets consists of assets that produce, or are held for the production of, passive income. For
purposes of these tests, passive income includes dividends, interest, gains from the sale or exchange of investment property and certain rents and royalties. In addition, for purposes of the above
calculations, a non-U.S. corporation that directly or indirectly owns at least 25%
by value of the shares of another corporation is treated as if it held its proportionate share of the assets and received directly its proportionate share of the income of such other corporation. If
we are a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. holder holds our shares, the U.S. holder may be subject to adverse tax consequences regardless of whether we continue to qualify as a PFIC,
including ineligibility for any preferred tax rates on capital gains or on actual or deemed dividends, interest charges on certain taxes treated as deferred, and additional reporting requirements. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although
we do not believe we were a PFIC for our taxable year ended December&nbsp;31, 2017 and do not currently expect to be a PFIC for our current taxable year or future taxable
years, we cannot provide any assurances regarding our PFIC status for any past, current or future taxable years. The determination of whether we are a PFIC is a fact-intensive determination made on an
annual basis applying principles and methodologies which in some circumstances are unclear and subject to varying interpretation. In particular, the characterization of our assets as active or passive
may depend in part on our current and intended future business plans which are subject to change. In addition, for our current and future taxable years, the total value of our assets for PFIC testing
purposes may be determined in part by reference to the market price of our shares from time to time, which may fluctuate considerably. Under the income test, our status as a PFIC depends on the
composition of our income which, in our current and future taxable years, we may not be able to fully control, for example, with respect to income attributed to us from entities owned 25% or more by
us. The composition of our income and assets is also affected by how, and how quickly, we spend the cash we raise in any offering, including in our recent IPO. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
certain circumstances, a U.S. holder of shares in a PFIC may alleviate some of the adverse tax consequences described above by making a "qualified electing fund" ("QEF") election to
include in income its pro rata share of the corporation's income on a current basis. However, a U.S. holder may make a qualified electing fund election with respect to our common shares only if we
agree to furnish such U.S. holder annually with a PFIC annual information statement as specified in the applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations. We currently do not intend to prepare or provide the
information that would enable U.S. holders to make a QEF election if we are treated as a PFIC for any taxable year, and prospective investors should assume that a QEF election will not be available. </FONT></P>

Use of Proceeds from Registered Securities  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On May&nbsp;3, 2017, our registration statement on Form&nbsp;S-1, as amended (File No 333-217214) was declared effective by the SEC in
connection with our IPO, pursuant to which we sold 11,385,000 of our common shares at a public offering price of $17.00 per share, including the full exercise by the underwriters of their option to
purchase additional shares. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
received net proceeds of $176.1&nbsp;million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses borne by us. None of the expenses incurred by us were
direct or indirect payments to any of (i)&nbsp;our directors or officers or their associates, (ii)&nbsp;persons owning 10&nbsp;percent or more of our common shares, or (iii)&nbsp;our
affiliates. Morgan Stanley, Piper Jaffray&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Co. and Barclays Capital acted as joint book-running managers for the offering. William Blair acted as lead manager. Needham&nbsp;&amp; Company
acted as co-manager. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There
has been no material change in the planned use of proceeds from our initial public offering from that described in the final prospectus filed with the SEC on May&nbsp;3, 2017.
During the period from the closing of our IPO to December&nbsp;31, 2017, we used the proceeds primarily to fund continued development of our clinical programs, including costs associated with
contract research organizations, contract manufacturing organizations, consultants, personnel and other infrastructure costs to support our research and development operations, costs associated with
operating as a public company, a milestone payment to BMS and investments in Kleo. </FONT></P>

Overview  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with a portfolio of innovative, late-stage product candidates targeting neurological diseases,
including rare disorders. Our product candidates are small molecules based on two distinct mechanistic platforms&#151;calcitonin gene-related peptide ("CGRP") receptor antagonists and glutamate
modulators&#151;which we believe have the potential to significantly alter existing treatment approaches across a diverse set of neurological indications with high unmet need in both large
markets and orphan indications. </FONT></P>

an NDA will be available by the end of 2018. Additionally, this program will also be supported by results of thirteen completed (enrollment and treatment completed) Phase&nbsp;1 studies, two ongoing

third Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trial with a bioequivalent ODT of rimegepant was commenced in February 2018, and we expect this trial to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2018.
Additionally, in November 2017, we received agreement from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") of an initial pediatric study plan. In February 2018, we submitted a request for scientific
advice for rimegepant was submitted to the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, a committee of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and we anticipate receiving feedback in the
first half of 2018. </FONT></P>

Trigriluzole for ataxias  </I></FONT></P>

</UL>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are developing trigriluzole for the treatment of ataxias, with an initial focus on spinocerebellar ataxia ("SCA"). We have received both
orphan drug designation and fast track designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for trigriluzole for the treatment of SCA. In October 2017, we reported topline data from the 8-week
randomization period from the Phase&nbsp;2/3 clinical trial in SCA. At the eight week time point, trigriluzole did not statistically differentiate from placebo. In the trial, we observed a favorable
safety and tolerability profile. The 48-week extension phase of the SCA trial is ongoing and we are continuing to assess the data from the trial. Based on post-hoc subgroup analyses we are in
discussions with the FDA regarding the potential for further development of trigriluzole in ataxias, and the FDA has expressed willingness to accept a modification of our study's primary endpoint, the
Scale for Assessment and Rating of Ataxia, also called SARA, as an acceptable registrational endpoint. </FONT></P>

BHV-0223  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are developing BHV-0223 for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ("ALS"). In December 2016, we received orphan drug designation
from the FDA for BHV-0223 to treat ALS. In January 2018, we announced results of a bioequivalence study with BHV-0223 and marketed riluzole. </FONT></P>

Financings and Other Recent Developments  </B></FONT></P>

</UL>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since our inception in September 2013, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to acquiring and developing product candidates,
organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, prosecuting intellectual property rights, planning for commercialization, and conducting research and development activities
for our product candidates. We do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. Prior to our initial public offering ("IPO") in May 2017, we funded our
operations primarily with proceeds from the sale of preferred shares and common shares through private placements and borrowings under a credit agreement with a bank. Prior to the completion of our
IPO in May 2017, we had received net cash proceeds of $96.4&nbsp;million from sales of our preferred shares and common shares through private placements and gross proceeds of $5.0&nbsp;million
from borrowings under the credit agreement. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
May&nbsp;3, 2017, our registration statement on Form&nbsp;S-1 relating to our IPO was declared effective by the SEC. The IPO closed on May&nbsp;9, 2017 and we issued and sold
9,900,000 common shares at a public offering price of $17.00 per share, for net proceeds of $152.7&nbsp;million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $11.8&nbsp;million and
other offering expenses of $3.9&nbsp;million. Upon the closing of the IPO, all of the convertible preferred shares then outstanding converted into an aggregate of 9,358,560 common shares. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition, on May&nbsp;9, 2017, the underwriters of the IPO fully exercised their option to purchase additional shares, and on May&nbsp;11, 2017, we issued and sold 1,485,000
common shares resulting in net proceeds of $23.5&nbsp;million after deducting offering expenses of $1.8&nbsp;million. Thus, the aggregate net proceeds we received from the IPO, after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, were $176.1&nbsp;million. In connection with the completion of the IPO, we issued an aggregate of 1,883,523 common shares to BMS and
AstraZeneca in satisfaction of obligations to contingently issue equity securities pursuant to our license agreements for no additional consideration. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since
our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our ability to generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend heavily on the successful
development and eventual commercialization of one or more of our current product candidates and programs. Our net loss was $127.2&nbsp;million, $63.5&nbsp;million and $10.1&nbsp;million for the
years ended December&nbsp;31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of December&nbsp;31, 2017, we had an accumulated deficit of $202.6&nbsp;million. We </FONT></P>

not generate revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates. We expect to continue to incur
significant expenses for at least the next several years as we advance our product candidates from discovery through preclinical development and clinical trials and seek regulatory approval and pursue
commercialization of any approved product candidate. In addition, if we obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related
to product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution. In addition, we may incur expenses in connection with the in-license or acquisition of additional product candidates. We also incur
incremental costs associated with operating as a public company, including significant legal, accounting, investor relations and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because
of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when or if we will be able to
achieve profitability. Even if we are able to generate product sales, we may not become profitable. If we fail to become profitable, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels
and be forced to reduce or terminate our operations. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
a result, we will need substantial additional funding to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from
product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through the public or private sale of equity, debt financings or other capital sources, including collaborations with other companies or
other strategic transactions. We may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements or arrangements when needed on favorable terms, or at all. If we fail to raise capital or
enter into such agreements as, and when, needed, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development and commercialization of one or more of our product candidates or delay
our pursuit of potential in-licenses or acquisitions. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
of December&nbsp;31, 2017, we had cash of $131.5&nbsp;million. Without additional external funding, we expect that our existing cash will be sufficient to fund our planned
operating expenses, financial commitments and other cash requirements through December&nbsp;31, 2018. The assumption for remaining cash usage assumes that planned programs and expenditures continue
and that we do not reduce, stop or curtail programs or other spending. Beyond that point, we will need to raise additional capital to finance our operations, which cannot be assured. We have concluded
that this circumstance raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the issuance date of our financial statements for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2017. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly,
in its report on our financial statements for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2017, our independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph
stating that our
recurring losses from operations since inception and required additional funding to finance our operations raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. </FONT></P>

</UL>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
recognize external development costs based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using estimates of our clinical personnel or information provided to us by
our service providers. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
external direct research and development expenses are tracked on a program-by-program basis for our product candidates and consist primarily of external costs, such as fees paid to
outside consultants, CROs, CMOs, and central laboratories in connection with our preclinical development, process development, manufacturing and clinical development activities. Our direct research
and development expenses by program also include fees incurred under license agreements. We do not allocate employee costs or other indirect costs, to specific programs because these costs are
deployed across multiple programs and, as such, are not separately classified. We use internal resources primarily to oversee the research and development as well as for managing our preclinical
development, process development, manufacturing and clinical development activities. Many employees work across multiple programs and we do not track personnel costs by program. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research
and development activities are central to our business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in
earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. As a result, we expect that our research and development expenses will increase
substantially over the next several years as we increase personnel costs conduct clinical trials and prepare regulatory filings for our product candidates. We also expect to incur additional expenses
related to milestone and royalty payments payable to third parties with whom we have entered into license agreements to acquire the rights to our product candidates. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The

candidates. This uncertainty is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development and commercialization, including the uncertainty

Loss from Equity Method Investment  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From August 2016 through December 2017, we purchased shares in Kleo Pharmaceuticals,&nbsp;Inc., a privately-held Delaware corporation
("Kleo"). As of December&nbsp;31, 2017 and 2016, we owned approximately 43.3% and 18.6%, respectively, of the outstanding shares of Kleo's common stock. We account for our investment in Kleo under
the equity method of accounting. As a result, our proportionate share of Kleo's net income or loss each reporting period is included in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of
operations and comprehensive loss and results in a corresponding adjustment to the carrying value of the equity method investment on our consolidated balance sheet. </FONT></P>

Accretion of Beneficial Conversion Feature  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the second tranche closing of Series&nbsp;A preferred shares in February 2017, we determined that the conversion option
associated with the shares sold met the definition of a beneficial conversion feature ("BCF") as the fair value of the underlying common shares exceeded the adjusted conversion price. The BCF was
recognized at its fair value of $12.0&nbsp;million as a reduction to the carrying value of the Series&nbsp;A preferred shares and a corresponding adjustment to additional paid-in capital. In May
2017, upon the completion our IPO, all of the outstanding Series&nbsp;A
preferred shares were automatically converted into an aggregate of 9,358,560 common shares. Upon conversion of the Series&nbsp;A preferred shares, the remaining unamortized BCF was reclassified to
additional paid-in capital as a deemed dividend. </FONT></P>

Provision for Income Taxes  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands ("BVI"), we are principally subject to taxation in the BVI. Under the current laws of
the BVI, tax on a company's income is assessed at a zero percent tax rate. As a result, we have not recorded any income tax benefits from its losses incurred in the BVI during each reporting period,
and no net operating loss carryforwards will be available to us for those losses. Our BVI company has historically outsourced all of the research and clinical development for its programs under a
master services agreement with BPI. As a result of providing services under this agreement, BPI was profitable during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2017 and 2016, and BPI is subject to taxation
in the United States. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
tax provision includes the effects of consolidating the results of operations of BPI, either as a variable interest entity for periods through the acquisition of BPI, or as of
December&nbsp;31, 2017 and 2016, as our wholly owned subsidiary. Due to BPI's history of cumulative losses through September&nbsp;30, 2016,
we had recorded no tax benefits for the losses incurred by BPI through that date and had recorded a full valuation allowance against BPI's deferred tax assets, which consisted primarily of its U.S.
net operating loss carryforwards for all periods through September&nbsp;30, 2016. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During
the three months ended December&nbsp;31, 2016, we fully utilized BPI's remaining U.S. net operating loss carryforwards due to BPI's profitability, and we recorded a full release
of the valuation allowance of $9 due to management's reassessment of the amount of deferred tax assets that it believes are more likely than not to be realized. As a result, we recorded an income tax
provision for the first time during the three months ended December&nbsp;31, 2016. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
of December&nbsp;31, 2017, we evaluated our deferred tax assets and determined that a full valuation allowance on these assets was appropriate due to excess research and development
credits. We recorded an income tax provision during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2017 of $ 1.0&nbsp;million which primarily represents U.S. Federal alternative minimum tax and state taxes
related to BPI's profitable operations in the United States. </FONT></P>

Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From our inception through December&nbsp;30, 2016, we consolidated the results of BPI as a variable interest entity. Although we did not have
an ownership interest in BPI through that date, we determined that BPI was a variable interest entity, of which we were the primary beneficiary. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Net
income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss through December&nbsp;30, 2016 consisted of the portion
of the net income or loss of BPI that was not allocated to us. On December&nbsp;31, 2016, we acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of BPI. As a result, for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2017 and for periods thereafter, we no longer report any non-controlling interests related to BPI. </FONT></P>

our BHV-3500 program, $3.6&nbsp;million in direct costs for our BHV-0223 program, partially offset by a decrease of $11.6&nbsp;million in direct costs for our BHV-5000 program. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
increase in direct costs for rimegepant was primarily due to costs of Phase&nbsp;3 trials, long-term safety study and related drug supply, as well as a $5.0&nbsp;million payment
to BMS upon initiation of our Phase&nbsp;3 trial. The increase in costs for BHV-3500 were primarily related to formulation development and toxicology for this program. The increases in direct costs
for our BHV-0223 program was primarily a result of our bioequivalence study for this program. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
decrease in direct costs for our BHV-5000 program during 2017 primarily related to the costs associated with acquiring technology under our licensing agreement with AstraZeneca in
October 2016 which did not recur in 2017. Upon acquiring the technology, we accrued a liability of $8.6&nbsp;million for our contingent obligation to issue equity to AstraZeneca and paid an upfront
license fee of $5.0&nbsp;million under the agreement, for total expense of $13.6&nbsp;million during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016. During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2017, we
incurred direct costs of $1.9&nbsp;million primarily associated with pre-clinical studies which commenced in the second quarter of 2017 and start-up activities related to our Phase&nbsp;1 clinical
trial which commenced in the fourth quarter of 2017. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
increase in personnel costs of $10.2&nbsp;million in personnel-related costs was primarily as a result of hiring additional personnel to support our expanding number of clinical
trials and preparing for potential commercialization of BHV-0223. Our headcount in research and development increased to 29 as of December&nbsp;31, 2017, compared to 6 as of December&nbsp;31,
2016. Personnel-related costs for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2017 and 2016 included share-based compensation expense of $6.9&nbsp;million and $2.4&nbsp;million, respectively. The increase
in share-based compensation was a result of hiring new personnel and the impact of higher stock price on both our employee and non-employee share-based compensation expense. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
increase in other unallocated costs was primarily due to increased use of research and development consultants that support activities across multiple drug candidate programs as well
as the increased purchase of supplies used across all programs. </FONT></P>

to the hiring of additional personnel in our general and administrative functions, $5.8&nbsp;million in professional fees supporting ongoing business operations, including increased compliance and
other costs associated with becoming a public company. Personnel-related costs for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2017 and 2016 included share-based compensation expense of $6.3&nbsp;million

 <P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research
and development expenses were $55.5&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016, compared to $7.6&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015. The
increase of $48.0&nbsp;million was primarily due to increases of $25.1&nbsp;million in direct costs for our rimegepant program, $13.6&nbsp;million in direct costs for our BHV-5000 program,
$8.3&nbsp;million in spending related to our trigriluzole program and $2.3&nbsp;million in research and discovery and unallocated costs, all partially offset by a decrease of $1.2&nbsp;million
in direct costs for our BHV-0223 program. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
increase in direct costs for our rimegepant program was primarily due to an accrual of a liability of $13.1&nbsp;million for our contingent obligation to issue equity to BMS under
our license agreement with BMS and the payment of $9.0&nbsp;million in license fees under that agreement. The increase in direct costs for our BHV-5000 program was due to an accrual of a liability
of $8.6&nbsp;million for our contingent obligation to issue equity to AstraZeneca under our license agreement and the payment of $5.0&nbsp;million in license fees under that agreement. The
increase in direct costs for our trigriluzole program primarily related to an animal toxicity study that commenced in December 2015. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
decrease in direct costs for our BHV-0223 program was due to formulation work and Phase&nbsp;1 clinical trial work that was completed during the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2015. Our Phase&nbsp;2 clinical trial of BHV-0223 had not begun as of December&nbsp;31, 2016. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
increase in unallocated costs was primarily due to an increase of $2.2&nbsp;million in personnel-related costs, including share-based compensation, as a result of hiring additional
personnel in our research and development department. Personnel-related costs for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016 and 2015 included share-based compensation expense of $2.4&nbsp;million and
$1.5&nbsp;million, respectively. </FONT></P>

the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015. The increase of $3.0&nbsp;million was primarily due to increases of $1.9&nbsp;million in personnel-related costs, including share-based compensation,
$1.0&nbsp;million in professional fees and $0.1&nbsp;million in facility-related costs. Personnel-related costs for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2016 included share-based
compensation expense of $2.2&nbsp;million and $1.3&nbsp;million, respectively. The increase in personnel-related costs was due to the hiring of additional personnel in our general and
administrative functions. Professional fees increased due to costs associated with the preparation, audit and review of our financial statements as well as ongoing business operations. </FONT></P>

Other Income (Expense), Net  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other income (expense), net was a net expense of $2.8&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016, compared to
$0.4&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015. The increase of $2.4&nbsp;million in net expense was primarily due to an increase of $2.3&nbsp;million in the fair value of the
contingent equity liability associated with our license agreements with BMS and AstraZeneca and an increase in interest expense of $0.4&nbsp;million due to interest on borrowings under our credit
agreement with Wells Fargo that we entered into in August 2016. These increases in other expense were partially offset by a decrease of $0.3&nbsp;million in the change in the fair value of the
derivative liability associated with our license agreement with Yale. </FONT></P>

taxes for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015. We recorded a tax provision in 2016 for the U.S. federal and state income taxes of BPI's profitable operations in the United States and due to the
fact that, in the three months ended December&nbsp;31, 2016, we fully utilized BPI's remaining U.S. net operating loss carryforwards. </FONT></P>

Liquidity and Capital Resources  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since our inception, we have not generated any revenue and have incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows from our
operations. Prior to the completion of our IPO in May 2017, we funded our operations primarily with proceeds from the sale of preferred shares and common shares through private placements and
borrowings under our credit agreement with Wells Fargo. Prior to the completion of our IPO, we had received net cash proceeds of $96.4&nbsp;million from
sales of our preferred shares and common shares and gross proceeds of $5.0&nbsp;million from borrowings under the credit agreement. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
May&nbsp;3, 2017, our registration statement on Form&nbsp;S-1 relating to our IPO was declared effective by the SEC. The IPO closed on May&nbsp;9, 2017 and we issued and sold
9,900,000 common shares at a public offering price of $17.00 per share, resulting in net proceeds of $152.7&nbsp;million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering
expenses. In addition, on May&nbsp;9, 2017, the underwriters of our IPO fully exercised their option to purchase additional shares, and on May&nbsp;11, 2017, we issued and sold an additional
1,485,000 common shares, resulting in additional net proceeds to us of $23.5&nbsp;million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses. The aggregate net
proceeds we received from the IPO, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, were $176.1&nbsp;million. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon
the closing of the IPO, we paid principal and interest aggregating $0.6&nbsp;million due under the notes payable to related parties. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
of December&nbsp;31, 2017, we had cash of $131.5&nbsp;million. Cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested in non-interest-bearing accounts with a view to liquidity and
capital preservation. </FONT></P>

Operating Activities  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2017, operating activities used $94.8&nbsp;million of cash, resulting from our net loss of
$128.0&nbsp;million, including a $5.0&nbsp;million payment to BMS upon commencement of our Phase&nbsp;3 trial, partially offset by non-cash charges of $31.8&nbsp;million and net cash provided
by changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $1.4&nbsp;million. Net cash provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2017 consisted
primarily of a $1.4&nbsp;million increase in accrued expenses and a $4.0&nbsp;million increase in accounts payable partially offset by an increase of $4.0&nbsp;million in prepaid expense and
other current assets. The increases in accrued expenses, accounts payable and prepaid expenses and other current assets were primarily due to increases in clinical trial activities, as well as
professional fees associated with the preparation, audit and review of our financial statements. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During
the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016 operating activities used $29.5&nbsp;million of cash, resulting from our net loss of $63.5&nbsp;million, partially offset by non-cash
charges of $31.2&nbsp;million and net cash provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $2.8&nbsp;million. Net cash provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities
for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016 consisted primarily of a $2.1&nbsp;million increase in accrued expenses and a $0.7&nbsp;million increase in accounts payable. The increase in accrued
expenses and accounts payable was due to our increased level of operating activities and the timing of vendor invoicing and payments. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During
the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, operating activities used $5.6&nbsp;million of cash, resulting from our net loss of $10.1&nbsp;million and net cash used in changes in
our operating assets and liabilities of $0.3&nbsp;million, partially offset by non-cash charges of $4.7&nbsp;million. Net cash used in changes in our operating assets and liabilities for the year
ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 consisted primarily of a $0.4&nbsp;million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets as a result of prepayments under our ongoing research, development and
clinical trial work performed by CROs, partially offset by a $0.1&nbsp;million increase in accrued expenses. The increase in accrued expenses was due to our increased level of operating activities
and the timing of vendor invoicing and payments. </FONT></P>

Credit Agreement  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On August&nbsp;30, 2016, we entered into a one-year credit agreement with Wells Fargo providing for a term loan in the principal amount of
$5.0&nbsp;million (the "Credit Agreement") and we borrowed the full $5.0&nbsp;million available. Our obligations under the Credit Agreement were guaranteed by a member of our board of directors,
who is also a shareholder. A second member of our board of directors and shareholder entered into a separate agreement with the guaranteeing director to share the guarantee responsibilities under the

shares at an exercise price of $9.2911 per share. The Credit Agreement was fully satisfied with a principal and interest repayment to Wells Fargo as of August&nbsp;31, 2017. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December&nbsp;31, 2016, we entered into stock purchase agreements with each of the stockholders of BPI, acquiring 100% of the issued and
outstanding shares of BPI for aggregate purchase consideration of $0.6&nbsp;million. We funded the acquisition through the issuance of promissory notes to each of the former stockholders of BPI. The
three former beneficial stockholders of BPI are shareholders of our company and currently serve as our chief executive officer, our chief medical officer and the chairman of our board of directors,
respectively. Upon consummation of our IPO, the promissory notes became due, and we fully satisfied the obligations to the related parties with a principal and interest payment aggregating
$0.6&nbsp;million. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without
additional external funding, we expect that our existing cash will be sufficient to fund our planned operating expenses, financial commitments and other cash requirements through
December&nbsp;31, 2018. The assumption for cash usage through this date assumes that planned programs and expenditures continue and that we do not reduce, stop or curtail programs or other spending.
Beyond that point, we will need to raise additional capital to finance our operations, which cannot be assured. We have concluded that this circumstance raises substantial doubt about our ability to
continue as a going concern within one year after the issuance date of our financial statements for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2017. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we expect. We expect that we will require
additional capital to commercialize rimegepant, if we receive regulatory approval, and to pursue in-licenses or acquisitions of other product candidates. If we receive regulatory approval for
rimegepant, trigriluzole, BHV-0223, or our other product candidates, we expect to incur commercialization expenses related to product manufacturing, sales, marketing and distribution, depending on
where we choose to commercialize. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because
of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development and commercialization of pharmaceutical product candidates, we are unable to estimate the exact

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until
such time, if ever, that we can generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of public and private equity
offerings, debt financings, other third-party funding, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements or marketing and distribution arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through
the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our existing shareholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences
that adversely affect the rights of our existing shareholders. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our
ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through other third-party funding, strategic
alliances, licensing arrangements or marketing and distribution arrangements, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product
candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we will be required to delay, limit,
reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market products or product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and
market ourselves. </FONT></P>

Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP").
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and
expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we
believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other
sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our
financial statements appearing at the end of this Annual Report, we believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our
financial statements. </FONT></P>

expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of
service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual costs. The majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears
for services performed, on a pre-determined schedule or when contractual milestones are met; however, some require advance payments. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet
date in the consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of these estimates with the service providers and make
adjustments if necessary. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to:</FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
base our expenses related to preclinical studies and clinical trials on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with multiple
research institutions and CROs that conduct and manage preclinical studies and clinical trials on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to
contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the expense.
Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time
period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate,
we adjust the accrual or the amount of prepaid expenses accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status
and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To
date, there have not been any material adjustments to our prior estimates of accrued research and development expenses. </FONT></P>

Share-Based Compensation  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We measure stock options and other share-based awards granted to employees and directors based on the fair value on the date of the grant and
recognize the corresponding compensation expense of those awards over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. We have only issued stock options
with service-based vesting conditions and record the expense for these awards using the straight-line method. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
share-based awards granted to consultants and non-employees, we recognize compensation expense over the period during which services are rendered by such consultants and
non-employees until completed. At the end of each financial reporting period prior to completion of the service, the fair value of these awards is remeasured using the then-current fair value of our
common shares and updated assumption inputs in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
estimate the fair value of each stock option grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which uses as inputs the fair value of our common shares and assumptions we make for
the volatility of our common shares, the expected term of our stock options, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock options and our expected dividend
yield. </FONT></P>

Valuation of Warrant Liability  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with entering into the Credit Agreement, we issued warrants to purchase our common shares to the guarantor and co-guarantor of our
obligations under the agreement. We classify the warrants as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet because each warrant represents a freestanding financial instrument that is not indexed to
our own shares. The warrant liability was initially recorded at fair value upon entering into the Credit Agreement and is subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date. Changes in the
fair value of the warrant liability are recognized as a component of other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. We will continue to recognize
changes in the fair value of the warrant liability until the warrants are exercised, expire or qualify for equity classification. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At
December&nbsp;31, 2017, we utilized the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value the warrant liability. The Black-Scholes option pricing model incorporated assumptions and
estimates to value the warrant liability. Estimates and assumptions impacting the fair value measurement included the number of shares for which the warrants will be exercisable, the fair value per
share of the underlying common shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants, the remaining contractual term of the warrants, the risk-free interest rate, the expected dividend yield, and the expected
volatility of the price of the </FONT></P>

Valuation of Derivative Liability  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our license agreement with Yale provides for a change-of-control payment to Yale upon the occurrence of a change-of-control event, as defined in
the agreement, including an IPO. We classify the change-of-control payment obligation as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet because it represents a contingent obligation to pay a variable
amount of cash that may be based, in part, on the value of our own shares. The derivative liability was initially recorded at fair value upon entering into the license agreement and is subsequently
remeasured to fair value at each reporting date. Changes in the fair value of the derivative liability are recognized as a component of other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of
operations and comprehensive loss. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While
outstanding, the fair value of the derivative liability was determined using a Monte-Carlo simulation, which is a statistical method used to generate a defined number of share
price paths to develop a reasonable estimate of the range of the expected share prices. The Monte-Carlo simulation incorporated assumptions and estimates to value the derivative liability, including
the amount of the payment, the settlement date, the trading price of our common shares, the risk-free interest rate and the expected volatility of the price of the underlying common shares. Changes to
these assumptions could have a material impact on the fair value of the derivative liability. </FONT></P>

Valuation of Contingent Equity Liability  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our license agreements with BMS and AstraZeneca require us to issue common shares upon the occurrence of specified financing or
change-of-control events or development milestones, as defined in the agreements. In each agreement, the class and number of shares to be issued upon a triggering event were not known upon entering
into the license agreements; however, the dollar amount of the shares to be issued upon a triggering event is fixed. We classified these contingent obligations to issue shares as a liability on our
consolidated balance sheet because each represented an obligation to issue a variable number of shares for a fixed dollar amount. Each contingent equity liability was initially recorded at fair value
upon entering into each respective agreement and was subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date. Changes in the fair values of the contingent equity liabilities are recognized as a
component of other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. Upon the closing of the IPO in May 2017, the conditions for issuing shares to BMS and
AstraZeneca under the terms of the respective license agreements were satisfied, and accordingly, we issued 1,345,374 and 538,149 common shares, respectively, to BMS and AstraZeneca valued at
$22.9&nbsp;million and $9.1&nbsp;million, respectively. The contingent equity liabilities were adjusted to fair value immediately prior to the completion of the IPO, and upon issuance of the
common shares, the contingent equity liabilities were reclassified to equity. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
fair values of the contingent equity liabilities were determined using the PWERM, which considers as inputs the probability of occurrence of events that would trigger the issuance of
shares, the expected timing of such events, the expected value of the contingently issuable equity upon the occurrence of a triggering event and a risk-adjusted discount rate. The estimates are based,
in part, on subjective assumptions and could differ materially in the future. Changes to these assumptions could have a material impact on the fair value of the contingent equity liabilities. </FONT></P>

Interest Rate Risk  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The market risk inherent in our financial instruments and in our financial position has historically been the potential loss arising from
adverse changes in interest rates. As of December&nbsp;31, 2017 and 2016, we had cash of $131.5&nbsp;million and $23.6&nbsp;million, respectively. As of December&nbsp;31, 2017, we held our
cash in non-interest-bearing money market accounts and accordingly, the value of these accounts is not subject to fluctuation in interest rates. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior
to the completion of our IPO in May 2017, we adopted an investment policy related to the use of the net proceeds from the sale of our common shares in our IPO, pursuant to which we
hold such net proceeds in non-interest bearing accounts, with the goal of capital preservation and liquidity so that such funds are readily available to fund our operations. </FONT></P>

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The term "disclosure controls and procedures," as defined in Rules&nbsp;13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the "Exchange Act"), refers to controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls
and procedures designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to a company's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide
only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management
necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any system of controls also is based in part
upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over
time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a control system,
misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based
on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December&nbsp;31, 2017, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of
December&nbsp;31, 2017, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level as a result of the material weaknesses discussed below. Notwithstanding these
material weaknesses, our management has concluded that the financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of
operations and cash flows in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
connection with the preparation of our financial results for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2015, our management concluded that, as of December&nbsp;31, 2015, our
internal control over financial reporting was not effective as a result of material weaknesses in our control over financial reporting. The material weaknesses remained unremediated as of
December&nbsp;31, 2017. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a
material misstatement of our financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting included the
following: </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We

Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the first quarter 2018, we completed the implementation of a new Enterprise Resource Planning ("ERP") system and a new share-based compensation system. During this period, we also
began implementation of formal disclosure controls and procedures, including a Disclosure Committee and management sub-certifications. We believe that these activities, plus the hiring of experienced
finance staff, will further support the remediation of these material weaknesses. </FONT></P>

Opinion on the Financial Statements  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Biohaven Pharmaceutical Holding Company&nbsp;Ltd. and its subsidiaries as of
December&nbsp;31, 2017 and 2016, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, convertible preferred shares and shareholders' equity (deficit), and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2017, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). In our opinion, the
consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December&nbsp;31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of their operations and their
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2017 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. </FONT></P>

Substantial Doubt About the Company's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed
in Note&nbsp;1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has incurred recurring losses from operations since inception and will require additional financing to fund future operations
that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note&nbsp;1. The financial statements do not
include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. </FONT></P>

Basis for Opinion  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
Company's consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
PCAOB. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
conducted our audits of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable
assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an
audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures
that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included
evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. </FONT></P>

1. Nature of the Business and Basis of Presentation  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Biohaven Pharmaceutical Holding Company&nbsp;Ltd. (the "Company") was incorporated in Tortola, British Virgin Islands in September 2013. The Company is a clinical-stage
biopharmaceutical company with a portfolio of innovative, late-stage product candidates targeting neurological diseases, including rare disorders. The Company's product candidates are small molecules
based on two distinct mechanistic platforms&#151;calcitonin gene-related peptide ("CGRP") receptor antagonists and glutamate modulators&#151;which the Company believes have the potential
to alter existing treatment approaches across a diverse set of neurological indications with high unmet need in both large markets and orphan indications. The most advanced product candidate from the
Company's CGRP receptor antagonist platform is rimegepant, which the Company is developing for the acute treatment of migraine and for which it initiated two Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trials in July
2017, with topline results expected in the first quarter 2018. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company is subject to risks and uncertainties common to early-stage companies in the biotechnology industry, including, but not limited to, development by competitors of new
technological innovations, dependence on key personnel, protection of proprietary technology, compliance with government regulations and the ability to secure additional capital to fund operations.
Product candidates currently under development will require significant additional research and development efforts, including preclinical and clinical testing and regulatory approval, prior to
commercialization. These efforts may require additional capital, additional personnel and infrastructure, and further regulatory and other capabilities. Even if the Company's product development
efforts are successful, it is uncertain when, if ever, the Company will realize significant revenue from product sales. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") and include the
accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries after elimination of all significant intercompany accounts and transactions. Investments in companies in which the Company owns less than a 50% equity
interest and where it exercises significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. </FONT></P>

Biohaven Pharmaceuticals,&nbsp;Inc.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has historically outsourced all of the research and clinical development for its programs under a master services agreement (the
"MSA") with Biohaven Pharmaceuticals,&nbsp;Inc. ("BPI"). BPI was incorporated in the state of Delaware in July 2013. The three founders of BPI, each of whom owned one-third of the equity of BPI
through December&nbsp;31, 2016, are related parties of the Company (see Note&nbsp;17). Substantially all of the operations of BPI have been performed in service to the Company under the terms of
the MSA, and substantially all of the funding for the operations of BPI was provided by the Company. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From
inception, the Company has consolidated the results of BPI. On December&nbsp;31, 2016, the Company acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of BPI (see Note&nbsp;18). </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From
inception through the acquisition of BPI, 100% of the equity in BPI was reflected as a net loss attributable to non-controlling interest on the consolidated statement of operations
and comprehensive loss. Since the acquisition of BPI on December&nbsp;31, 2016, the Company no longer reports any non-controlling interest related to BPI. </FONT></P>

Stock Split  </I></B></FONT></P>

</UL>

Initial Public Offering  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On May&nbsp;3, 2017, the Company's registration statement on Form&nbsp;S-1 relating to its initial public offering of its common shares (the
"IPO") was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). The IPO closed on May&nbsp;9, 2017 and the Company issued and sold 9,900,000 common shares at a public offering price
of $17.00 per share for net proceeds of $152,651 after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $11,781 and other offering expenses of approximately $3,868. Upon the closing of the IPO, all
convertible preferred shares then outstanding converted into an aggregate of 9,358,560 common shares. In addition, on May&nbsp;9, 2017, the underwriters of the IPO fully exercised their option to
purchase additional shares, and on May&nbsp;11, 2017, the Company issued and sold 1,485,000 common shares for net proceeds of $23,478 after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of
$1,767. Thus, the aggregate net proceeds to the Company from the IPO, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering costs, were $176,128. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
connection with the completion of its IPO, the Company issued an aggregate of 1,883,523 common shares to Bristol Myers-Squibb Company ("BMS") and AstraZeneca AB ("AstraZeneca") in
satisfaction of obligations to contingently issue equity securities pursuant to the license agreements (see Note&nbsp;13) for no additional consideration. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also
in connection with the completion of its IPO in May 2017, the Company amended its memorandum and articles of association to authorize the issuance of up to 200,000,000 no par value
common shares and 10,000,000 no par value undesignated preferred shares. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through
December&nbsp;31, 2017, the Company has funded its operations primarily with proceeds from sales of preferred and common shares and proceeds from the IPO. The Company has
incurred recurring losses since its inception, including net losses of $127,190, $63,534 and $10,066 during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. In addition, as of
December&nbsp;31, 2017, the Company had
an accumulated deficit of $202,646. The Company expects to continue to generate operating losses for the foreseeable future. As of March&nbsp;6, 2018, the issuance date of these consolidated
financial statements, the Company expects that its cash of $131,468 as of December&nbsp;31, 2017 will be sufficient to fund operating expenses, financial commitments and other cash requirements </FONT></P>

1. Nature of the Business and Basis of Presentation (Continued) </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>through
December&nbsp;31, 2018. The future viability of the Company beyond that point is dependent on its ability to raise additional capital to finance its operations. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
execute its business plans, the Company will require funding to support its continuing operations and pursue its growth strategy. Until such time as the Company can generate
significant revenue from product sales, if ever, it expects to finance its operations through the sale of public or private equity, debt financings or other capital sources, including collaborations
with other companies or other strategic transactions. The Company may not be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms, or at all. The terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or
the rights of the Company's shareholders. If the Company is unable to obtain funding, the Company could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate some or all of its research and development programs,
product portfolio expansion or commercialization efforts, which could adversely affect its business prospects. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
the Company is unable to obtain funding, the Company could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate some or all of its research and development programs, product portfolio expansion or
commercialization efforts, which could adversely affect its business prospects, or the Company may be unable to continue operations. Although management continues to pursue these plans, there is no
assurance that the Company will be successful in obtaining sufficient funding on terms acceptable to the Company to fund continuing operations, if at all. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based
on its recurring losses from operations incurred since inception, expectation of continuing operating losses for the foreseeable future, and need to raise additional capital to
finance its future operations, the Company has concluded that there is substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the consolidated financial
statements are issued. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Accordingly, the consolidated financial
statements have been prepared on a basis that assumes the Company will continue as a going concern and which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in
the ordinary course of business. </FONT></P>

Use of Estimates  </I></B></FONT></P>

</UL>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses
during the reporting periods. Significant estimates and assumptions reflected in these consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, the accrual for research and development
expenses and the valuation of common shares, stock options, warrants, derivative instruments and contingent equity instruments. In addition, management's assessment of the Company's ability to
continue as a going concern involves the estimation of the amount and timing of future cash inflows and outflows. Estimates are periodically reviewed in light of changes in circumstances, facts and
experience. Changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known. Actual results could differ from those estimates. </FONT></P>

Equity Method Investments  </I></B></FONT></P>

</UL>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investments in non-public companies in which the Company owns less than a 50% equity interest and where it exercises significant influence over
the operating and financial policies of the investee are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. The Company's proportionate share of the net income or loss of the equity method
investment is included in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss and results in a corresponding adjustment to the carrying value of the
investment on the consolidated balance sheet. Dividends received reduce the carrying value of the investment. The Company periodically reviews the carrying value of its investment to determine if
there has been an other-than-temporary decline in carrying value. A variety of factors are considered when determining if a decline in carrying value is other than temporary, including, among other
factors, the financial condition and business prospects of the investee, as well as the Company's intent with regard to the investment. </FONT></P>

respective assets. As of December&nbsp;31, 2017 and 2016, the Company's property and equipment consisted of office equipment and computer equipment, as well as construction in progress comprised of
computer software and leasehold improvements. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company is also a deemed owner of a building related to a lease agreement which has been accounted for as a financing lease (see Note&nbsp;16). The lease represents a failed
sales-leaseback due to the non-normal tenant improvements and the Company's continuing involvement in the property. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
fair value of the building and improvements funded by the landlord will be recognized on the balance sheet as of December&nbsp;31, 2017. Construction costs funded by the Company
will be recognized on the consolidated balance sheet as incurred. These assets will be amortized over respective depreciable lives. The Company will record rent expense based on the estimated fair
value of the rental for land. The Company will recognize a financing obligation for the fair value of the property, construction costs incurred by the Company and the landlord, and the landlord
allowance. The liability will be amortized over the lease term based on the minimum lease payments required under the lease and the Company's incremental borrowing rate. The minimum lease payments are
recorded as interest expense and in part as a payment of principal reducing the financing obligation. </FONT></P>

asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement
date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value are
to be classified and disclosed in one of the following three levels of the fair value hierarchy, of which the first two are considered observable and the last is considered
unobservable:</FONT></P>

Share-Based Compensation  </I></B></FONT></P>

</UL>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company measures stock options granted to employees and directors based on the fair value on the date of the grant and recognizes
compensation expense of those awards, over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur. Generally, the
Company issues stock options with only service-based vesting conditions and records the expense for these awards using the straight-line method. The Company also issues, from time to time, stock
options with performance-based vesting conditions and records the expense for these awards when the Company concludes that it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
share-based awards granted to non-employees including consultants, compensation expense is recognized over the period during which services are rendered by such non-employees until
completed. At the end of each financial reporting period prior to completion of the service, the fair value of the unvested awards are remeasured using the then-current fair value of the Company's
common shares and updated assumption inputs in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company classifies share-based compensation expense in its consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss in the same manner in which the award recipient's payroll costs
are classified or in which the award recipient's service payments are classified. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
fair value of each stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Prior to May 2017, the Company was a private company and,
accordingly, lacks a history of company-specific historical and implied volatility information for its shares. Therefore, it estimates its expected share price volatility based on the historical
volatility of publicly traded peer companies and expects to continue to do so until such time as it has adequate historical data regarding the volatility of its own traded share price. The expected
term of the Company's stock options has been determined utilizing the "simplified" method for awards that qualify as "plain-vanilla" options. The expected term of stock options granted to
non-employees is equal to the contractual term of the option award. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award
for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. Expected dividend yield is based on the fact that the Company has never paid cash dividends on common shares and does not expect
to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. </FONT></P>

Warrant Liability  </I></B></FONT></P>

</UL>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with entering into a credit agreement, the Company issued warrants to purchase common shares to two of the Company's directors in
connection with a guarantee of its obligations under the agreement (see Note&nbsp;8). The Company classifies the warrants as a liability on its consolidated balance sheet because each warrant
represents a freestanding financial instrument that is not indexed to the Company's own shares. The warrant liability was initially recorded at fair value upon entering into the credit agreement and
is subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date. Changes in the fair value of the warrant liability are recognized as a component of other income (expense), net in the consolidated
statement of operations and comprehensive loss. Changes in the fair value of the warrant liability will continue to be recognized until the warrants are exercised, expire or qualify for equity
classification. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's license agreement with Yale University ("Yale") (see Note&nbsp;13) provides for a change-of-control payment to Yale upon the
occurrence of a change-of-control event, as defined in the agreement, including an IPO. The Company classifies the change-of-control payment obligation as a liability on its consolidated balance sheet
because it represents a contingent obligation to pay a variable amount of cash that may be based, in part, on the value of the Company's own shares. The derivative liability was initially recorded at
fair value upon entering into the license agreement and was subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date. Changes in the fair value of the derivative liability were recognized as a
component of other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss prior to its expiration. </FONT></P>

</UL>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's license agreements with AstraZeneca and BMS (see Note&nbsp;13) require the Company to issue capital shares upon the occurrence
of specified financing or change-of-control events or development milestones. In each agreement, the class and number of shares to be issued upon a triggering event were not known upon entering into
the license agreements; however, the dollar amount of the shares to be issued upon a triggering event is fixed. The Company classifies these contingent obligations to issue shares as a liability on
its consolidated balance sheet because each represents an obligation to issue a variable number of shares for a fixed dollar amount. Each contingent equity liability was initially recorded at fair
value upon entering into each respective
agreement and is subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date. Changes in the fair values of the contingent equity liabilities are recognized as a component of other income (expense),
net in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. Changes in the fair value of the contingent equity liabilities are recognized through the occurrence of the respective
triggering event. </FONT></P>

financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Changes in deferred tax
assets and liabilities are recorded in the provision for income taxes. The Company assesses the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent
it believes, based upon the weight of available evidence, that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is established
through a charge to income tax expense. Potential for recovery of deferred tax assets is evaluated by estimating the future taxable profits expected and considering prudent and feasible tax planning
strategies. The provision for income taxes includes the effects of applicable tax reserves, or unrecognized tax benefits, as well as the related net interest and penalties. </FONT></P>

Net Income (Loss) per Share  </I></B></FONT></P>

</UL>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company follows the two-class method when computing net income (loss) per share as the Company has issued shares that meet the definition of
participating securities. The two-class method determines net income (loss) per share for each class of common and participating securities according to dividends declared or accumulated and
participation rights in undistributed earnings. The two-class method requires income available to common shareholders for the period to be allocated between common and participating securities based
upon their respective rights to receive
dividends as if all income for the period had been distributed. Net income (loss) per share attributable to common shareholders is calculated based on net income (loss) attributable to Biohaven
Pharmaceutical Holding Company&nbsp;Ltd. and excludes net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests for relevant periods. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basic
net income (loss) per share attributable to common shareholders is computed by dividing the net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders is computed by adjusting net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders to reallocate
undistributed earnings based on the potential impact of dilutive securities. Diluted net income (loss) per share attributable to common shareholders is computed by dividing the diluted net income
(loss) attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period, including potential dilutive common shares. For purpose of this calculation,
outstanding options, warrants to purchase common shares, convertible preferred shares and contingently issuable equity are considered potential dilutive common shares. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company's convertible preferred shares contractually entitled the holders of such shares to participate in dividends but contractually did not require the holders of such shares to
participate in losses of the Company. In periods in which the Company reports a net loss attributable to common shareholders, diluted net loss per share attributable to common shareholders is the same
as basic net loss per share attributable to common shareholders, since potentially dilutive common shares are considered to be anti-dilutive. </FONT></P>

The new standard involves several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either
equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows. Certain of these changes are required to be applied retrospectively, while other changes are required to be applied
prospectively. The Company has elected to early adopt ASU&nbsp;2016-09 on January&nbsp;1, 2017 and has reflected the adoption in the
consolidated financial statements of the Company. The adoption of ASU&nbsp;2016-09 had no material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. </FONT></P>

</UL>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU&nbsp;No.&nbsp;2017-09, Compensation&#151;Stock Compensation (Topic&nbsp;718): Scope of
Modification Accounting ("ASU&nbsp;2017-09"), which clarifies when to account for a change to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award as a modification. Under the new guidance,
modification accounting is required only if the fair value, the vesting conditions, or the classification of the award (as equity or liability) changes as a result of the change in terms or
conditions. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is
currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU&nbsp;2017-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, "Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash," which will require entities to show the change in the total of cash, cash
equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents within the statement of cash flows. As a result, entities will no longer separately present transfers between unrestricted cash and
restricted cash. This guidance will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2017, including interim periods within those annual reporting periods, and early
adoption is permitted. The Company does not anticipate a material impact to the consolidated financial statements as a result of the adoption of this guidance. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.&nbsp;2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments ("ASU&nbsp;2016-15"), to address diversity in
practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December&nbsp;15,
2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU&nbsp;2016-15 will have on its consolidated financial statements. </FONT></P>

for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract (i.e.,&nbsp;lessees and lessors). The new standard requires lessees to apply a dual approach,
classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee. This classification will determine whether
lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, respectively. A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a
lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12&nbsp;months regardless of their classification. ASU&nbsp;2016-02 (Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 842) supersedes the

Valuation of Warrant Liability  </I></FONT></P>

</UL>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warrant liability in the tables above is composed of the fair value of warrants to purchase common shares that the Company issued to two of
its directors in connection with a guarantee of its obligations under a credit agreement (see Note&nbsp;8). The fair value of the warrant liability was determined based on significant inputs not
observable in the market, which represents a Level&nbsp;3 measurement within the fair value hierarchy. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At
December&nbsp;31, 2017, the Company utilized the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value the warrant liability. The Black-Scholes option pricing model incorporated assumptions
and estimates to value the warrant liability. Estimates and assumptions impacting the fair value measurement included the number of shares for which the warrants will be exercisable, the fair value
per share of the underlying common shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants, the remaining contractual term of the warrants, the risk-free interest rate, the expected dividend yield, and the
expected volatility of the price of the underlying common shares. The fair value per share of the Company's common shares was based on the closing trading price of the shares on December&nbsp;29,
2017, the last trading day of the year, </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>and
the increase in the fair value of the common shares during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2017 is the primary reason for the increase in the fair value of the warrant liability during the same
period. The Company was a private company prior to its IPO in May 2017 and therefore lacks a history of company-specific volatility information of its shares. Therefore, it estimated its expected
share volatility based on the historical volatility of publicly traded peer companies for a term equal to the remaining contractual term of the warrants. The risk-free interest rate was determined by
reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve for time periods approximately equal to the remaining contractual term of the warrants. The Company estimated a 0% expected dividend yield based on the fact
that the Company has never paid or declared dividends and does not intend to do so in the foreseeable future. </FONT></P>

December&nbsp;31, 2016, the fair value of the derivative liability was determined using a Monte-Carlo simulation, which is a statistical method used to generate a defined number of share price paths
to develop a reasonable estimate of the range of the expected share prices. The Monte-Carlo simulation incorporated assumptions and estimates to value the derivative liability, including the amount of
the payment, the settlement date, the trading price of the Company's common shares, the risk-free interest rate and the expected volatility of the price of the underlying common shares. The Company
continued to remeasure the derivative liability to fair value at each reporting date and recognized any changes in the fair value of the derivative liability through October&nbsp;31, 2017. The
derivative liability upon expiration of the lock-up period was determined to be $0 based on the value of the Company's shares on this date. </FONT></P>

of shares was 75%, the expected timing of such an event was estimated to be less than one year, the value of the contingently issuable equity was $18,750 and the discount rate was assessed to be 0%.
In connection with the closing of the IPO in May 2017, the conditions for issuing shares in connection with the contingent equity liability were satisfied, and accordingly, the Company issued
1,345,374 common shares to BMS. The contingent equity liability was adjusted to fair value immediately prior to the completion of the IPO, and upon issuance of the common shares, the contingent equity
liability was reclassified to equity. </FONT></P>

AstraZeneca (see
Note&nbsp;13) was determined based on significant inputs not observable in the market, which represents a Level&nbsp;3 measurement within the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the contingent
equity liability was determined using the PWERM, which considered as inputs the probability of occurrence of events that would trigger the issuance of shares, the expected timing of such events, the
value of the contingently issuable equity and a risk-adjusted discount rate. The contingently issuable equity is issuable in two tranches, each for a fixed dollar amount of $5,000, for a total amount
of $10,000. Using the PWERM, the Company assessed the fair value of each tranche of the contingent equity liability separately. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
October 2016, upon completion of the Series&nbsp;A First Closing (see Note&nbsp;10), the first tranche of contingently issuable equity became issuable to AstraZeneca. As a result,
the Company issued to AstraZeneca 538,150 Series&nbsp;A preferred shares with an aggregate fair value of $5,000, or $9.2911 per share, in satisfaction of the obligation to issue the first tranche of
equity under the agreement. Upon the issuance of the 538,150 Series&nbsp;A preferred shares to AstraZeneca in October 2016, the Company reclassified the carrying value of the first tranche
contingent equity liability, equal to the then-current fair value of $5,000, to the carrying value of Series&nbsp;A preferred shares. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
shares related to the second tranche became issuable upon the earlier of (i)&nbsp;the initiation of a Phase&nbsp;2b or equivalent clinical trial of a product candidate based on
the licensed patent rights and (ii)&nbsp;any liquidity event, including an IPO, any change of control or any assignment of the Company's rights or obligations under the license agreement. As of
December&nbsp;31, 2016, the Company determined that the fair value of the second tranche contingent equity liability was $4,875. In determining this fair value, the assumed probability of occurrence
of the event that was most probable of triggering the issuance of shares was 65%, the expected timing of such an event was estimated to be less than one year, the value of the contingently issuable
equity was $7,500 and the discount rate was assessed to be 0%. In connection with the closing of the IPO in May 2017, the conditions for issuing shares in
connection with the contingent equity liability were satisfied, and accordingly, the Company issued 538,149 common shares to AstraZeneca. The contingent equity liability was adjusted to fair value
immediately prior to the completion of the IPO, and upon issuance of the common shares, the contingent equity liability was reclassified to equity. </FONT></P>

Beneficial Conversion Feature  </I></FONT></P>

</UL>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the second tranche closing of Series&nbsp;A preferred shares on February&nbsp;17, 2017, the Company determined that the
conversion option associated with the shares sold met the definition of a beneficial conversion feature ("BCF") as the fair value of the underlying common shares exceeded the adjusted conversion
price. The BCF was recognized at its fair value of $12,006 as a reduction to the carrying value of the Series&nbsp;A preferred shares and a corresponding adjustment to additional paid-in capital.
The fair value was determined using Level&nbsp;3 inputs, equal to the product of the number of shares sold in the second tranche closing multiplied by the difference between the adjusted conversion
price and the per share value of common shares at the commitment date (see Note&nbsp;10). In May 2017, upon the completion of the Company's IPO, all of the outstanding Series&nbsp;A preferred
shares were automatically converted into an aggregate of 9,358,560 common shares. Upon conversion of the Series&nbsp;A preferred shares, the remaining unamortized BCF was reclassified to additional
paid-in capital as a deemed dividend. </FONT></P>

5. Equity Method Investment  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On August&nbsp;29, 2016, the Company executed a stock purchase agreement with Kleo Pharmaceuticals,&nbsp;Inc. ("Kleo"), a privately held Delaware corporation, to purchase 3,000,000
shares of Kleo's common stock at an initial closing, with a commitment to purchase an aggregate of 5,500,000 additional shares of common stock, in each case at a share price of $1.00 per share (the
"Kleo SPA"). Kleo is a development-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on advancing the field of immunotherapy by developing small molecules that emulate biologics. The Company purchased 3,000,000
shares upon the initial closing on August&nbsp;31, 2016, and the remaining 5,500,000 shares were to be purchased in four equal tranches of 1,375,000 shares beginning six months from the initial
closing and then every three months thereafter. In connection with the initial investment, the Company received the right to designate two of the members of Kleo's board of directors. The Company
completed all four of remaining tranche purchases in March, June, October 2017 and January 2018, with each tranche purchase consisting of 1,375,000 shares for cash consideration of $1,375. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
March 2017, the Company purchased 500,000 shares of Kleo common stock directly from a co-founder of Kleo for consideration of $250 in cash and 32,500 common shares of the Company. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition to these purchases, in October 2017, the Company purchased an additional aggregate of 2,049,543 shares for cash consideration of $2,253 which allowed the Company to maintain
its relative ownership interest in Kleo. As of December&nbsp;31, 2017, the Company's ownership interest in the outstanding stock of Kleo was 43.3%. Upon completion of the fourth and final tranche
investment in January 2018 (see Note&nbsp;20), the Company's ownership increased to 46.6%. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company has a variable interest in Kleo through its equity investment. Kleo is a variable interest entity due to the equity investment at risk being insufficient to finance its
activities. An assessment of whether or not the Company has the power to direct activities that most significantly impact Kleo's economic performance and to identify the party that obtains the
majority of the benefits of the investment was performed as of December&nbsp;31, 2017 and 2016, and will be performed as of each subsequent reporting date. After each of these assessments, the
Company concluded that the activities that most significantly impact Kleo's economic performance are the ability to direct the research
activities, the ability to select vendors to perform the research, the ability to maintain research staff and the ability to raise additional funds, each of which are directed by Kleo. Based on the
outcome of these assessments, the Company concluded that the investment should be accounted for under the equity method. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company has recorded its investments in Kleo to date based on the costs of those investments, as adjusted for the Company's proportional share of Kleo's net income or loss in each
period. The difference between the cost of the Company's investments in Kleo and its proportionate share of the net assets of Kleo was allocated to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. The
Company records future adjustments to the carrying value of its investment at each reporting date equal to its proportionate share of Kleo's net loss for the corresponding period. The Company recorded
other expense and a corresponding reduction in the carrying value of its investment in Kleo of $1,885 and $247 for its proportionate share of Kleo's net loss for the years ended December&nbsp;31,
2017 and 2016, respectively. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
carrying value of the Company's investment in Kleo was $7,847 and $2,753 as of December&nbsp;31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and is reported as equity method investment on the
consolidated balance sheet. The carrying value of the investment represents the Company's maximum loss exposure as of December&nbsp;31, 2017. </FONT></P>

Association ("Wells Fargo") providing for a term loan in the principal amount of $5,000 (the "Loan") and borrowed the full $5,000 available under the Credit Agreement. Borrowings under the Credit
Agreement bore interest at a rate equal to monthly LIBOR plus 1.50% per annum, and the Credit Agreement required monthly, interest-only payments beginning on September&nbsp;30, 2016 and continuing
through August&nbsp;30, 2017 (the "Maturity Date"), when all amounts of unpaid principal and interest became due. The monthly LIBOR rate was reset each month. The Credit Agreement was fully
satisfied with a principal repayment to Wells Fargo of $5,000 on August&nbsp;31, 2017. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company determined that the obligation to issue the warrants represented a liability that was considered outstanding for accounting purposes on August&nbsp;30, 2016, the date of
the Credit Agreement. The fair value of the warrant liability upon issuance represented a premium paid for the guaranty of the Loan, and, accordingly, the Company recorded the issuance-date fair value
of the warrant liability of $934 as a debt discount and as a warrant liability in the Company's consolidated balance sheet. In addition, the Company paid an arrangement fee of $150 to the lender and
incurred legal costs of $47, both of which were recorded as a debt discount. The debt discount was reflected as a reduction of the carrying value of the notes payable on the Company's consolidated
balance sheet and was amortized to interest expense over the term of the note using the effective interest method. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company recognized interest expense of $906 and $385 during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company recognized $784 and $347 related to the
accretion of the debt discount during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As of December&nbsp;31, 2017, the unamortized debt discount was $0. </FONT></P>

of promissory notes to each of the former stockholders of BPI. The former stockholders of BPI are shareholders of the Company and also serve as the Company's Chairman of the board of directors, Chief
Executive Officer, and Chief Medical Officer, respectively. The notes were payable in five annual payments, the first four of which were interest only, with the final payment to include the principal
balance outstanding plus any accrued and unpaid interest. The notes bore interest at a rate of 4.5% per annum and had a maturity date of December&nbsp;31, 2021. The notes became immediately due and
payable upon specified events, including immediately prior to the consummation of an initial public offering of the Company's common shares or upon the occurrence of a change of control of the

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company agreed to issue warrants to purchase $1,000 of common shares to each of the Guarantor and Co-Guarantor of the Credit Agreement (see
Note&nbsp;8), who are members of the Company's board of directors (see Note&nbsp;17). The warrant has an exercise price of $9.2911, the price per share paid by investors in the Series&nbsp;A
First Closing (see Note&nbsp;10). In January 2017, the Company issued the warrants to the Guarantor and Co-Guarantor, pursuant to which each director received a warrant to purchase 107,500 common
shares at an exercise price of $9.2911 per share. The warrants are immediately exercisable and expire upon the second anniversary of the Company's IPO. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
of December&nbsp;31, 2016, the Company determined that the obligation to issue the warrants represented a liability that was considered outstanding for accounting purposes on
August&nbsp;30, 2016, the date the Company entered into the Credit Agreement. The Company classified the warrants as a liability on its consolidated balance sheet because each warrant represents a
freestanding financial instrument that is not indexed to the Company's own shares. As of December&nbsp;31, 2017, the Company continued to classify these warrants as a liability on the consolidated
balance sheet because the warrants contain anti-dilution price protection provisions through January&nbsp;26, 2018. As a result, changes in the fair value of the warrant liability will continue to
be recognized as a component of other income (expense), net until the earliest of (i)&nbsp;the exercise of the warrants, (ii)&nbsp;the expiration of the warrants or (iii)&nbsp;January&nbsp;26,
2018. The warrant liability was initially recorded at fair value upon entering into the Credit Agreement and is subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date. Changes in the fair value
of the warrant liability are recognized as a component of other income (expense), net in the Company's consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
fair value of the warrant liability was determined to be $934 on the date of issuance. The Company remeasured the liability as of December&nbsp;31, 2017 and 2016 and determined
that the fair value of the warrant liability was $4,021 and $780, respectively. The Company recorded expense of $3,241 and a gain of $154 within other income (expense), net in the consolidated
statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. </FONT></P>

October 2016, the Company issued and sold an aggregate of 4,305,209 Series&nbsp;A preferred shares, at an issuance price of $9.2911 per share, for proceeds of $37,295, net of
offering costs of $2,705 (the "Series&nbsp;A First Closing"). The $2,705 of offering costs consisted of $1,730 payable in cash and 105,010 shares of the Company's Series&nbsp;A preferred shares
valued at $975, or $9.2911 per share, which were issued directly to the two placement agents involved in the Series&nbsp;A financing. The preferred share purchase agreement provided for the issuance
of additional Series&nbsp;A preferred shares in a second and final tranche (the "Series&nbsp;A Second Closing"). Also, in October 2016, the Company issued to AstraZeneca 538,150 Series&nbsp;A
preferred shares with an aggregate fair value of $5,000, or $9.2911 per share, in satisfaction of the obligation to issue the first tranche of contingently issuable equity under the Company's license
agreement with AstraZeneca (see Note&nbsp;13). </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
February 2017, the Company completed the Series&nbsp;A Second Closing through the issuance and sale of an aggregate of 4,305,182 Series&nbsp;A preferred shares at an issuance
price of $9.2911 per share for cash proceeds of $38,666, net of offering costs of $2,606. The $2,606 of offering costs for the second tranche consisted of $1,334 payable in cash and 105,009 shares of
the Company's Series&nbsp;A preferred shares valued at $1,242, or $11.83 per share, which were issued directly to the two placement agents involved in the Series&nbsp;A financing. The conversion
option associated with the Series&nbsp;A preferred shares sold in the second closing met the definition of a BCF as the fair value of the underlying common shares of $9.85 per share exceeded the
stated conversion price of $9.2911 (or $7.0613, as adjusted, as described below under Conversion). Upon the sale and issuance of the Series&nbsp;A preferred shares, $2,406 of the BCF was immediately
accreted, as this represented the difference between the stated conversion price and per share value of the common shares. The remaining portion of the BCF was being amortized using the effective
interest method over the period from the date of issuance to the date of the earliest possible conversion, October&nbsp;1, 2017. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
May 2017, upon the completion of the Company's IPO, all of the outstanding Series&nbsp;A preferred shares were automatically converted into an aggregate of 9,358,560 common shares.
Upon conversion of the Series&nbsp;A preferred shares, the remaining unamortized BCF was reclassified to additional paid-in capital as a deemed dividend. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
holders of the Series&nbsp;A preferred shares had voting rights commensurate with common shares and also preferential liquidation rights. Additionally, the Series&nbsp;A

Yale Agreement  </I></B></FONT></P>

</UL>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September 2013, the Company entered into an exclusive license agreement with Yale (the "Yale Agreement") to obtain a license to certain
patent rights for the commercial development, manufacture, distribution, use and sale of products and processes resulting from the development of those patent rights, related to the use of riluzole in
treating various neurological conditions, such as general anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. As part of the consideration for this license, the Company issued Yale
250,000 common shares and granted Yale the right to purchase up to 10% of the securities issued in specified future equity offerings by the Company, in addition to the obligation to issue shares to
prevent anti-dilution. The obligation to contingently issue equity to Yale, which was no longer outstanding at December&nbsp;31, 2017, was determined to be a liability, which was accounted for at
its fair value of $0 at each reporting date. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Yale Agreement provides for a change-of-control payment to Yale upon the occurrence of a change-of-control event, as defined in the agreement, including an IPO. Upon the occurrence
of a change-of-control event, the Company is obligated to pay to Yale the lesser of (i)&nbsp;5% of the dollar value of all initial and future potential consideration paid or payable by the acquirer
and (ii)&nbsp;$1,500. If the change-of-control event is as an IPO, the amount the Company will be obligated to pay to Yale will be reduced by the value of Yale's equity investment in the Company on
the first day that Yale is free to sell its equity interest. The Company classifies the change-of-control payment obligation as a liability on its consolidated balance sheet because it represents a
contingent obligation to pay a variable amount of cash that may be based, in part, on the value of the Company's own shares. The issuance date fair value of the derivative liability of $14 was
recognized as a research and development expense upon entering the agreement with Yale. The Company continued to remeasure the derivative liability to fair value at each reporting date and recognized
any changes in the fair value of the derivative liability
through October&nbsp;31, 2017. The derivative liability upon expiration of the lock-up period was determined to be $0 based on the value of the Company's shares on this date. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company recorded other income (expense) of $512, $(65) and $(370), during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, for the change in the fair value of
the derivative liability. The fair value of the derivative liability was $0 and $512 as of December&nbsp;31, 2017 and 2016, respectively (see Note&nbsp;3). </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition, the Company agreed to pay Yale up to $2,000 upon the achievement of specified regulatory milestones and annual royalty payments of a low single-digit percentage based on net
sales of products from the licensed patents, subject to a minimum amount of up to $1,000 per year. If the Company grants any sublicense rights under the Yale Agreement, it must pay Yale a low
single-digit percentage of sublicense income that it receives. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Yale Agreement also requires the Company to meet certain due diligence requirements based upon specified milestones. The Company can elect to extend the deadline for its compliance
with the due diligence requirements by a maximum of one year upon the payment to Yale of up to $150. The Company is also required to reimburse Yale for any fees that Yale incurs related to the filing,
prosecution, defending and maintenance of patent rights licensed under the Yale Agreement. In the event that the Company fails to make any payments, commits a material breach, fails to maintain
adequate insurance or challenges the patent rights of Yale, Yale can terminate the Yale Agreement. </FONT></P>

General Hospital ("MGH"), pursuant to which MGH granted the Company a license to certain patent rights for the commercial
development, manufacture, distribution and use of any products or processes resulting from development of those patent rights, related to treating depression with a combination of ketamine and
scopolamine. The Company is also obligated to pay MGH annual license maintenance fees and future milestone payments of up to $750 upon the achievement of specified clinical and regulatory milestones
and up to $2,500 upon the achievement of specified commercial milestones. The Company has also agreed to pay MGH royalties of a low single-digit percentage based on net sales of products licensed
under the agreement. If the Company receives revenue from sublicensing any of its rights under the agreement, the Company is also obligated to pay a portion of that revenue to MGH. </FONT></P>

MGH Agreement also requires the Company to meet certain due diligence requirements based upon specified milestones. The Company can elect to extend the deadline for its compliance

the filing, prosecution, defending, and maintenance of patent rights licensed under the agreement. The MGH Agreement expires upon expiration of the patent rights under the MGH Agreement, unless
earlier terminated by either party. </FONT></P>

ALS Biopharma Agreement  </I></B></FONT></P>

</UL>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In August 2015, the Company entered into an agreement (the "ALS Biopharma Agreement") with ALS Biopharma and Fox Chase Chemical Diversity
Center&nbsp;Inc. ("FCCDC"), pursuant to which ALS Biopharma and FCCDC assigned the Company their worldwide patent rights to a family of over 300 prodrugs of glutamate modulating agents, including
trigriluzole, as well as other innovative technologies. Under the ALS Biopharma Agreement, the Company is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize and develop markets for the
patent products. The Company is obligated to pay $3,000 upon the achievement of specified regulatory milestones with respect to the first licensed product and $1,000 upon the achievement of specified
regulatory milestones with respect to subsequently developed products, as well as royalty payments of a low single-digit percentage based on net sales of products licensed under the agreement, payable
on a quarterly basis. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In

Rutgers Agreement  </I></B></FONT></P>

</UL>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June 2016, the Company entered into an exclusive license agreement (the "Rutgers Agreement") with Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey
("Rutgers"), licensing several patents and patent applications related to the use of riluzole to treat various cancers. Under the Rutgers Agreement, the Company is required to pay Rutgers annual
license maintenance fees until the first commercial sale of a licensed product, at which point the Company will pay Rutgers minimum annual royalties. The Company is also obligated to pay Rutgers up to
$825 in the aggregate upon the achievement of specified clinical and regulatory milestones. The Company agreed to pay Rutgers royalties of a low single-digit percentage of net sales of licensed
products sold by the Company, its affiliates or its sublicensees, subject to a minimum amount of up to $100 per year. If the Company grants any sublicense rights under the Rutgers Agreement, the
Company must pay Rutgers a low double-digit percentage of sublicense income it receives. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under
the Rutgers Agreement, in the event that the Company experiences a change of control or sale of substantially all of its assets prior to the initiation of a Phase&nbsp;3 clinical
trial related to products licensed under the agreement, and such change of control or sale results in a full liquidation of the Company, the Company will be obligated to pay Rutgers a
change-of-control fee equal to 0.3% of the total value of the transaction, but not less than $100. The Company determined that the change-of-control payment should be accounted for as a liability. The
fair value of the obligation for all periods presented was $0 based on the Company's assessment that the probability of a change-in-control event occurring prior to the initiation of a Phase&nbsp;3
clinical trial related to products licensed under the agreement was remote. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Rutgers Agreement also requires the Company to meet certain due diligence requirements based upon specified milestones. The Company can elect to extend the deadline for its
compliance with the due diligence requirements by a maximum of one year upon payments to Rutgers of up to $500 in the aggregate. Under the Rutgers Agreement, the Company is required to reimburse
Rutgers for any fees that Rutgers incurs related to the filing, prosecution, defending, and maintenance of patent rights licensed under the agreement. The Rutgers Agreement expires upon expiration of
the patent rights under the agreement or ten years from the date of first commercial sale of a licensed product, whichever is later, unless terminated by either party. </FONT></P>

BMS Agreement  </I></B></FONT></P>

</UL>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July 2016, the Company entered into an exclusive, worldwide license agreement (the "BMS Agreement") with BMS for the development and
commercialization rights to rimegepant and BHV-3500, as well as other CGRP-related intellectual property. In exchange for these rights, the Company agreed to pay BMS initial payments, milestone
payments and royalties on net sales of licensed products under the agreement. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company is obligated to make milestone payments to BMS upon the achievement of specified development and commercialization milestones. The development milestone payments due under
the agreement depend on the licensed product being developed. With respect to rimegepant, the Company is obligated to pay up to $127,500 in the aggregate upon the achievement of the development
milestones. For any product other than rimegepant, the Company is obligated to pay up to $74,500 in the aggregate upon the achievement of the development milestones. In addition, the Company is
obligated to pay up to $150,000 for each licensed product upon the achievement of commercial milestones. If the Company receives revenue from sublicensing any of its rights under the agreement, it is
also obligated to pay a portion of that revenue to BMS. The Company is also obligated to make tiered royalty payments to BMS based on annual worldwide net sales, with percentages in the low to
mid-teens. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under
the BMS Agreement, the Company is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop licensed products and to commercialize at least one licensed product using the patent
rights licensed from BMS and is solely responsible for all development, regulatory and commercial activities and costs. The Company is also required to reimburse BMS for any fees that BMS incurs
related to the filing, prosecution, defending, and maintenance of patent rights licensed under the BMS Agreement. Under the BMS Agreement, BMS transferred to the Company manufactured licensed
products, including certain materials that will be used by the Company to conduct clinical trials. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
BMS Agreement will terminate on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis upon the expiration of the royalty term with respect to each licensed product in
each country. BMS has the right to terminate the agreement upon the Company's insolvency or bankruptcy, the Company's uncured material breach of the agreement, including the failure to meet its
development and commercialization obligations, or if the Company challenges any of BMS's patent rights. The Company has the right to terminate the BMS Agreement if BMS materially breaches the
agreement or if, after the Company provides notice, it chooses not to move forward with development and commercialization in a specific country. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
BMS Agreement required the Company to complete a financing transaction with gross proceeds of at least $30,000, of which a minimum of $22,000 was to be from investment in equity
prior to October&nbsp;17, 2016, unless extended by mutual agreement of the Company and BMS. The BMS Agreement was amended, effective October&nbsp;14, 2016, to extend the deadline for completing
the financing transaction to October&nbsp;31, 2016, on which date the Series&nbsp;A First Closing was completed (see Note&nbsp;10). </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under
the BMS Agreement, the Company also agreed to issue BMS common shares in the amount of $12,500, which shares are contingently issuable upon the earliest to occur of (i)&nbsp;the
initiation of a Phase&nbsp;3 trial for the first licensed compound to reach such milestone, (ii)&nbsp;the Company's IPO or </FONT></P>

event resulting in the change of control of the Company. Under the terms of the BMS Agreement, if the qualifying financing transaction involves the issuance of preferred shares, BMS is
entitled to receive preferred shares instead of common shares, at its option. BMS also had the right to purchase up to 8%, on a fully diluted basis, of shares issued in a qualifying financing
transaction (as defined in the BMS Agreement) on the same terms and rights as all other investors involved in the financing. The number of shares issuable to BMS under the agreement will be determined
by dividing $12,500 by a price per share equal to the lower of (i)&nbsp;the price per share paid by investors in the Series&nbsp;A First Closing, or $9.2911 (see Note&nbsp;10), or
(ii)&nbsp;the price per share paid by investors in any subsequent financing event that occurs prior to the events specified above. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
obligation to contingently issue equity to BMS is classified as a liability on the consolidated balance sheet because it represents an obligation to issue a variable number of shares
for a fixed dollar amount. Upon entering into the BMS Agreement, the issuance-date fair value of the contingent equity liability of $13,125 was recognized as research and development expense in the
consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. The Company remeasured the fair value of the contingent equity liability at each reporting date since the date of issuance, recognizing
changes in the fair value of the contingent equity liability as a component of other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. Changes in the fair value
of the contingent equity liability
continued to be recognized until the occurrence of a triggering event, which occurred in May 2017 with the completion of the IPO. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
May 2017, in connection with the completion of its IPO, the Company issued 1,345,374 common shares to BMS in satisfaction of its obligation to contingently issue equity securities
pursuant to the license agreement and remeasured the contingent equity liability to fair value. The Company recognized expense of $8,809 and $13,125 during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2017 and
2016, respectively, as a result of changes to the fair value of the contingent equity liability prior to its extinguishment in May 2017. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company recorded $5,000 of research and development expense related to a payment made in connection with the BMS Agreement during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2017 for the
achievement of a specified milestone. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October 2016, the Company entered into an exclusive license agreement (the "AstraZeneca Agreement") with AstraZeneca, pursuant to which
AstraZeneca granted the Company a license to certain patent rights for the commercial development, manufacture, distribution and use of any products or processes resulting from development of those
patent rights, including BHV-5000 and BHV-5500. In exchange for these rights, the Company agreed to pay AstraZeneca an upfront payment, milestone payments and royalties on net sales of licensed
products under the agreement. The regulatory milestones due under the agreement depend on the indication of the licensed product being developed as well as the territory where regulatory approval is
obtained. Development milestones due under the agreement with respect to Rett syndrome total up to $30,000, and, for any indication other than Rett syndrome, total up to $60,000. Commercial milestones
are based on net sales of all products licensed under the agreement and total up to $120,000. The Company has also agreed to pay tiered royalties based on net sales of all products licensed under the
agreement of mid-single-digit to low double-digit </FONT></P>

If the Company receives revenue from sublicensing any of its rights under the AstraZeneca Agreement, the Company is also obligated to pay a portion of that revenue to AstraZeneca. The

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
part of the consideration under the AstraZeneca Agreement, the Company agreed to issue to AstraZeneca common shares in the amount of $10,000 if the Company completed a qualifying
equity financing resulting in proceeds of at least $30,000 prior to December&nbsp;29, 2016. Under the terms of the AstraZeneca Agreement, if the qualifying financing transaction involved the
issuance of preferred shares, AstraZeneca would be entitled to receive preferred shares instead of common shares, at its option. The number of shares issued would be determined based on the price per
share paid by investors in the qualifying financing transaction. Upon the occurrence of the qualifying financing transaction, 50% of the shares would be issuable upon the closing of the transaction
(the "First Tranche") and the other 50% would become issuable upon the earlier of (i)&nbsp;the initiation of a Phase&nbsp;2b or equivalent clinical trial of a product candidate based on the
licensed patent rights or (ii)&nbsp;any liquidity event, including an IPO of the Company, any change of control of the Company or any assignment of the Company's rights and obligations under the
AstraZeneca Agreement (the "Second Tranche"). The number of shares issuable to AstraZeneca in each of the First Tranche and the Second Tranche is determined by dividing $5,000 by the price per share
paid by investors in the Company's Series&nbsp;A First Closing, or $9.2911 (see Note&nbsp;10). In addition, AstraZeneca had the right to purchase up to 8%, on a fully diluted basis, of shares
issued in such qualifying financing transaction, on the same terms and rights as all other investors involved in the financing. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
October 2016, upon completion of the Series&nbsp;A First Closing (see Note&nbsp;10), the contingency associated with the First Tranche of contingently issuable equity related to
the occurrence of a qualified financing was satisfied. As a result, the Company issued to AstraZeneca 538,150 Series&nbsp;A preferred shares with an aggregate fair value of $5,000, or $9.2911 per
share. Upon issuance of the 538,150 Series&nbsp;A preferred shares to AstraZeneca, the Company reclassified the contingent equity liability associated with the First Tranche of $5,000 to the

Catalent Agreement for BHV-0223  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March 2015, the Company entered into a development and license agreement with Catalent U.K. Swindon Zydis Limited ("Catalent") pursuant to
which the Company obtained license rights to the Zydis technology in BHV-0223. BHV-0223 was developed under this agreement, and Catalent has manufactured BHV-0223 for clinical testing. Upon entering
the Catalent Agreement, the Company is obligated to pay Catalent up to $1,575 upon the achievement of specified regulatory and commercial milestones. The Company is also obligated to make royalty
payments of a low single-digit percentage based on net sales of products licensed under the Catalent Agreement. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under
this Agreement, the Company is responsible for conducting clinical trials and for preparing and filing regulatory submissions. The Company has the right to sublicense its rights
under the Catalent Agreement subject to Catalent's prior written consent. Catalent has the right to enforce the patents covering the Zydis Technology and to defend any allegation that a formulation
using Zydis technology, such as BHV-0223, infringes a third party's patent. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This
agreement terminates on a country-by-country basis upon the later of (i)&nbsp;10&nbsp;years after the launch of the most recently launched product in such country and
(ii)&nbsp;the expiration of the last valid claim covering each product in such country, unless earlier voluntarily terminated by the Company. This agreement automatically extends for one-year terms
unless either party gives advance notice of intent to terminate. In addition, Catalent may terminate the agreement either in its entirety or terminate the exclusive nature of this agreement on a
country-by-country basis if the Company fails to meet specified development timelines, which it may extend in certain circumstances. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In

carryforwards will be available to the Company for those losses. BVI has historically outsourced all of the research and clinical development for its programs under a master services agreement with
BPI (see Note&nbsp;18). As a result of providing services under this agreement, BPI was profitable during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2017 and 2016, and BPI is subject to taxation in the

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company's tax provision includes the effects of consolidating the results of operations of BPI, either as a variable interest entity for periods through the acquisition of BPI (see
Note&nbsp;18) or as of December&nbsp;31, 2017 and 2016 as the Company's wholly owned subsidiary. Due to BPI's history of
cumulative losses through September&nbsp;30, 2016, the Company had recorded no tax benefits for the losses incurred by BPI through that date and had recorded a full valuation allowance against BPI's
deferred tax assets, which consisted primarily of its U.S. net operating loss carryforwards for all periods through September&nbsp;30, 2016. As of December&nbsp;31, 2016, the Company fully
utilized BPI's remaining U.S. net operating loss carryforwards and recorded a full release of the valuation allowance, which did not result in a material impact to the Company's income tax provision. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
of December&nbsp;31, 2017, we evaluated our deferred tax assets and determined that a full valuation allowance on these assets was appropriate due to the generation of tax credits
in excess of forecasted taxes. The Company recorded an income tax provision during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2017 of $1,006 which primarily represents an alternative minimum tax liability and
certain state taxes for the period. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
December&nbsp;22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("The Act"), was signed into law, resulting in significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. These changes
include a federal statutory rate reduction from 35% to 21%, limitation on the amount of research and development expenses deductible per year beginning in years after 2021, reduction of the Orphan
Drug Credit from 50% to 25% of qualified clinical testing expenditures, increased limitations on certain executive compensation, elimination of the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax, and modifying or
repealing other business deductions and credits. The revaluation of our deferred tax assets due to The Act was not material. </FONT></P>

of the Credit Agreement (see Note&nbsp;7). In January 2017, the Company issued the warrants to the Guarantor and Co-Guarantor, pursuant to which each director received a warrant to
purchase 107,500 common shares at an exercise price of $9.2911 per share. These warrants are included in the table above for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2017. </FONT></P>

Company had also agreed under its agreements with AstraZeneca and BMS to issue common shares upon the achievement of specified milestones or upon the occurrence of specified events
(see Notes&nbsp;3 and 12). Because the necessary conditions for issuance of the shares had not been met as of December&nbsp;31, 2016, the Company excluded these shares from the table above and
from the calculation of diluted net loss per share for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016. In May 2017, in connection with the completion of its IPO, the Company issued 538,149 common shares to
AstraZeneca and 1,345,374 common shares to BMS in full satisfaction of its obligations to contingently issue equity securities pursuant to the license agreements. Accordingly, the table above does not
include any shares related to the agreements with AstraZeneca and BMS for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2017. </FONT></P>

Company's Chief Executive Officer is one of the inventors of the patents that the Company has licensed from Yale and, as such, is entitled to a specified share of the glutamate product-related royalty
revenues that may be received by Yale under the Yale Agreement. As partial consideration for the license under the Yale Agreement, on September&nbsp;30, 2013, the Company issued to Yale 250,000
common shares, representing 5.1% of the Company's then outstanding equity on a fully diluted basis. The fair value of the shares, totaling $152, was recognized as research and development expense at
the time of issuance of the shares. During the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized research and development expense under the Yale Agreement of $38, $4 and $84,

in BPI is insufficient to finance its operations. As a result, the Company is deemed to have had a variable interest in BPI, and BPI is deemed to be a variable interest entity ("VIE") of which the
Company is the primary beneficiary. Since the date of the Company's incorporation in September 2013, the Company has consolidated the results of BPI. Upon original consolidation, the Company applied
purchase accounting by recording the fair values of BPI's assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which were determined to be zero because BPI had not yet commenced any operations. For the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2016,
100% of the equity in BPI was reflected as a net loss attributable to non-controlling interest on the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
December&nbsp;31, 2016, the Company entered into stock purchase agreements with each of the stockholders of BPI, acquiring 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of BPI for
aggregate purchase consideration of $595, and as a result, for periods subsequent to the acquisition, the Company no longer reports any non-controlling interest related to BPI. </FONT></P>

18. Acquisition of Biohaven Pharmaceuticals,&nbsp;Inc. (Continued) </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company funded the acquisition through the issuance of promissory notes to each of the former stockholders of BPI. In May 2017, in connection with the completion of the IPO, the
notes became immediately due and payable, and the Company paid the notes, including principal and unpaid interest, in full. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because
the Company consolidated BPI as a VIE prior to the acquisition, the acquisition of all of the capital stock of BPI did not result in a change of control for accounting purposes
and was accounted for as an equity transaction. Accordingly, as of the acquisition date, the $86 carrying value of the non-controlling interest on December&nbsp;31, 2016 was derecognized and the
difference between the carrying value of the non-controlling interest of $86 and the purchase price of $595 was recorded as a $509 reduction to additional paid-in capital. There were no changes to
this accounting treatment of BPI during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2017. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2016 and 2015 when the Company consolidated BPI as a VIE, the Company recorded net income and a (loss) of $143 and $(4), respectively,
attributable to non-controlling interests. </FONT></P>

Catalent Agreement for Rimegepant  </I></B></FONT></P>

</UL>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January 2018, the Company entered into a development and license agreement with Catalent pursuant to which we obtained certain license rights
to the Zydis ODT technology for use with rimegepant. If Company obtains regulatory approval or launches a rimegepant product that utilizes the Zydis ODT technology, the Company is obligated to pay
Catalent up to $1,500 upon the achievement of specified regulatory and commercial milestones. If the Company commercializes a rimegepant product that utilizes the Zydis ODT technology, the agreement
permits the Company to purchase the commercial product from Catalent at a fixed price, inclusive of a royalty. Under the agreement, Catalent will not develop or manufacture a formulation of any oral
CGRP compound using Zydis ODT technology for itself or a third party until 2031, subject to certain minimum commercial revenues. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under
this agreement, the Company is responsible for conducting clinical trials and for preparing and filing regulatory submissions. The Company has the right to sublicense its rights
under the agreement subject to Catalent's prior written consent. Catalent has the right to enforce the patents covering the Zydis Technology and to defend any allegation that a formulation using Zydis
technology, such as BHV-3000, infringes a third party's patent. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This
agreement terminates on a country-by-country basis upon the later of (i)&nbsp;10&nbsp;years after the launch of the most recently launched product in such country and
(ii)&nbsp;the expiration of the last valid claim covering each product in such country, unless earlier voluntarily terminated by the Company. This agreement automatically extends for one-year terms
unless either party gives advance notice of intent to terminate. In addition, Catalent may terminate the agreement either in its entirety or terminate the exclusive nature of this agreement on a
country-by-country basis if the Company fails to meet specified development timelines, which it may extend in certain circumstances. </FONT></P>
