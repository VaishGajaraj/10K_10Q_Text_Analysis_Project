</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">OncoGenex is a biopharmaceutical company committed to the development and commercialization of new
cancer therapies that address treatment resistance in cancer patients. We have five product
candidates in our pipeline, custirsen, OGX-427, OGX-225, SN2310 and CSP-9222, each of which has a
distinct mechanism of action and represents a unique opportunity for cancer drug development. Of
the product candidates in our pipeline, custirsen, OGX-427 and SN2310 are clinical-stage assets.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>Product Candidates Overview and Recent Developments</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our product candidates custirsen, OGX-427 and OGX-225 focus on mechanisms for treating resistance
in cancer patients and are designed to address resistance by blocking the production of specific
proteins that we believe promote survival of tumor cells and are over-produced in response to a
variety of cancer treatments. Our aim in targeting these particular proteins is to disable the
tumor cell&#146;s adaptive defenses, thereby rendering the tumor cell more susceptible to attack with a
variety of cancer therapies, including chemotherapy. We believe this approach will increase the
time of survival and improve the quality of life for cancer patients. Product candidate SN2310 is a
novel camptothecin for treating cancer. Camptothecins are potent anticancer agents that belong to
the family of drugs called topoisomerase I inhibitors. These inhibitors bind reversibly to the
TOPO-I-DNA complex, thereby causing breaks in the DNA strands during replication that result in
cell death. Product candidate CSP-9222 is the lead compound from a family of caspase activators
that demonstrates activation of programmed cell death in pre-clinical models.

trial were presented during an oral presentation at the American Society of Clinical Oncology, or
ASCO, 2010 annual meeting.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">A second investigator-sponsored phase 1 clinical trial evaluating OGX-427 when administered
directly into the bladder in patients with bladder cancer was initiated in August&nbsp;2009. The trial,
which will enroll up to 36 patients with bladder cancer, is designed to determine the safety and
potential benefit of OGX-427 administered directly into the bladder using a catheter, an
administration procedure known as intravesical instillation. In addition, the trial will measure
the direct effect of OGX-427 on expression of Hsp27 in bladder tumor cells, as well as determine
the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of OGX-427 when delivered by intravesical instillation.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In September&nbsp;2010, we announced the initiation of a separate investigator-sponsored, randomized
phase 2 clinical trial evaluating OGX-427 when administered as a monotherapy to patients with CRPC.
This randomized, controlled phase 2 trial will enroll up to 72 patients who have minimally
symptomatic or asymptomatic advanced prostate cancer and who have not yet received chemotherapy,
and is designed to determine the potential benefit of OGX-427 by evaluating the number of patients
who are without disease progression at 12&nbsp;weeks post-trial treatment with or without OGX-427.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We expect to initiate a randomized phase 2 clinical trial of OGX-427 in approximately 180 patients
with metastatic bladder cancer in the second half of 2011. The proposed trial design is a
three-arm, randomized phase 2 in
combination with standard chemotherapy in the first-line metastatic setting. Each arm would enroll
approximately 60 patients and the trial would be initiated in sites throughout the United States,
Canada and Europe. We are consulting with external bladder cancer experts and anticipate initiating
this trial in the second half of 2011.

are currently exploring options to out-license this product candidate.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">OGX-225 is a product candidate in pre-clinical development that is designed to inhibit production
of both Insulin Growth Factor Binding Protein 2, or IGFBP-2, and Insulin Growth Factor Binding
Protein-5, or IGFBP-5. Increased IGFBP-2 or IGFBP-5 production is observed in many human cancers,
including prostate, non-small cell lung, breast, ovarian, bladder, pancreatic and colon, as well as
acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, neuroblastoma, glioma and melanoma. Increased
IGFBP-2 or IGFBP-5 production is linked to faster rates of cancer progression, treatment resistance
and shorter survival duration in humans.

or the Arrangement, of OncoGenex Technologies, a Canadian corporation, as contemplated by the
Arrangement Agreement between the companies dated May&nbsp;27, 2008. As a result of the Arrangement,
OncoGenex Technologies became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. As used in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K, the term &#147;Sonus&#148; refers to the business of the Company prior to August&nbsp;21,
2008. More information concerning the Arrangement is contained in Note 5 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We account for the Arrangement as a reverse acquisition and OncoGenex Technologies was treated as
the acquiring entity from an accounting perspective. The consolidated results of operations for the
years ended December&nbsp;31, 2010, December&nbsp;31, 2009 and December&nbsp;31, 2008 include the results of
operations of only OncoGenex Technologies for the time period of January&nbsp;1, 2008 through August&nbsp;20,
2008 and include the results of the combined company following the completion of the Arrangement on
August&nbsp;21, 2008. This treatment and presentation is in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standard, or SFAS, 141. Information relating
to the number of shares, price per share and per share amounts of common stock are presented on a

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Through our clinical trials, we are treating cancer patients with custirsen to reduce clusterin
production. Clusterin is a protein that is over-produced in several types of cancer and in response
to many cancer treatments, including hormone ablation therapy, chemotherapy and radiation therapy.
Preclinical and other data suggest that clusterin promotes cell survival. Increased clusterin
production has been linked to faster rates of cancer progression, treatment resistance and shorter
survival duration. Since increased clusterin production is observed in many human cancers,
including prostate, non-small cell lung, breast, ovarian, bladder, renal, pancreatic, colon,
anaplastic large cell lymphoma, and melanoma, we believe that custirsen may have broad market

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">A broad range of pre-clinical studies conducted by the Vancouver Prostate Centre and others have
shown that reducing clusterin production with custirsen (i)&nbsp;facilitates tumor cell death by
sensitizing human prostate, non-small cell lung, breast, ovarian, bladder, renal and melanoma tumor
cells to various chemotherapies and (ii)&nbsp;sensitizes prostate tumor cells to hormone ablation
therapy and sensitizes prostate and non-small cell lung tumor cells to radiation therapy.
Pre-clinical studies conducted by the Vancouver Prostate Centre also indicate that reducing
clusterin production with custirsen re-sensitizes docetaxel-resistant prostate tumor cells to
docetaxel.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our phase 1 clinical trials evaluated the safety and established a recommended dose of custirsen in
combination with docetaxel (two different schedules), a gemcitabine and a platinum chemotherapy
regimen and hormone ablation therapy. Docetaxel, gemcitabine and platinums (cisplatin and
carboplatin) are all examples of chemotherapy agents. The highest dose evaluated in all of our
phase 1 clinical trials was 640 mg, which dose was determined by the clinical investigators to be
well tolerated and therefore established as the recommended dose.

Breast Cancer</U>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In January&nbsp;2009, the results of the clinical trial in 15 patients with advanced breast cancer,
which evaluated custirsen in combination with docetaxel as first-line or second-line chemotherapy,
were published in the scientific journal Clinical Cancer Research. The authors&#146; conclusion was that
the combination of custirsen and docetaxel at 75 mg/m2 was well tolerated and some clinical
activity was seen in the patients with metastatic breast cancer.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><U>Summary of Preliminary Results of Custirsen Phase 2 Clinical Trial in Patients With CRPC
Receiving Hormone Ablation Therapy</U>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">This trial was an investigator-sponsored trial that evaluated weekly OGX-011 with androgen
withdrawal therapy for a three-month duration in patients with high-risk, localized prostate
carcinoma prior to radical prostatectomy. The results of the trial indicated that OGX-011 was
detectable in prostate tissue for 14&nbsp;days after the last administration, that clusterin expression
was decreased in cells from lymph nodes as well as from prostate specimens, and that more of the
cells in these patients were undergoing apoptosis (cell death) compared with patients who never
received androgen withdrawal therapy or who received only androgen withdrawal therapy.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><U>Overview of OGX-427</U>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">OGX-427 is product candidate that, in pre-clinical experiments, inhibits production of Hsp27, a
cell survival protein found at elevated levels in many human cancers, including prostate, lung,
breast, ovarian, bladder, renal, pancreatic, multiple myeloma and liver cancer. Many anti-cancer
therapies are known to further elevate Hsp27 levels. For example, Hsp27 levels increased four-fold
in prostate cancer patients after treatment with chemotherapy or hormone
therapy. Increased levels of Hsp27 in some human cancers are associated with metastases, poor
prognosis and resistance to radiation or chemotherapy.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">A number of pre-clinical studies conducted by the Vancouver Prostate Centre and others have shown
that inhibiting the production of Hsp27 in human prostate, breast, ovarian, pancreatic and bladder
tumor cells sensitizes the cells to chemotherapy. These preclinical studies have shown that
reducing Hsp27 production induces tumor cell death in prostate, breast, non-small cell lung,
bladder and pancreatic cancers, and indicates that reducing Hsp27 production sensitizes prostate
tumor cells to hormone ablation therapy.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><U>Summary of Results of OGX-427 Phase 1 Clinical Trial in Patients With Solid Tumors</U>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">OGX-427 has been evaluated in a phase 1 trial in patients with breast, prostate, ovarian, or
non-small cell lung cancer who have failed potentially curative treatments or for which a curative
treatment does not exist. Final results of this phase 1 trial were presented during an oral
presentation at the ASCO 2010 annual meeting. The phase 1 trial evaluated 36 patients treated with
OGX-427 as a single agent and 12 patients treated with OGX-427 in combination with docetaxel who
had failed up to six prior chemotherapy treatments. OGX-427 as a single agent administered weekly
was evaluated at doses from 200 mg up to 1000 mg in five cohorts of approximately six patients in
each cohort. Two further cohorts tested OGX-427 at the 800 and 1000 mg doses combined with
docetaxel. Patients could receive up to 10 21-day cycles.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">When OGX-427 was given as a single agent, a median of two cycles (range of 0 to 8) was
administered. Most adverse events were mild (grade 1 or 2) and mainly occurred during the three
&#147;loading doses&#148; given over nine days prior to weekly dosing. The majority of adverse events
determined to be related to OGX-427 consisted of grade 1 or 2 fever, chills, itching, or flushing
(associated with the infusion of OGX-427) and fatigue.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">When OGX-427 was combined with docetaxel, a median of six cycles (range of 1 to 10) was
administered. Infusion reactions continued to be the most common adverse events, followed by
chills, fatigue, nausea, back pain, itching, poor appetite and shortness of breath. Despite
evaluating OGX-427 at very high doses, a maximum tolerated dose for OGX-427 was not reached in this
trial.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">When OGX-427 was used as monotherapy, 3 of 17 evaluable patients had a decrease in measurable
disease of 20% or greater. In this heavily pretreated patient population, two of four patients with
ovarian cancer had a decrease of 25% or greater in CA-125 (an ovarian tumor marker) and 3 of 15
patients with prostate cancer had a decrease of 30% or greater in PSA (a prostate tumor marker).
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">At all doses and in all diseases evaluated in the trial decreases were observed for both total
circulating tumor cells, or CTCs, and CTCs which were positive for Hsp27, or Hsp27&#043;CTCs. Recent
studies have shown that the presence of CTCs in peripheral blood may be of prognostic significance
for patients with solid tumors, and patients with values of five tumor cells or less are generally
considered to have a more favorable prognosis. Hsp27&#043;CTCs decreases were noted in 89% of evaluable
patients and were observed at all dose levels and all diseases evaluated. In 9 of 26 (31%) patients
with &#8805;5 Hsp&#043;CTCs at baseline, Hsp27 &#043; CTCs had decreased to five tumor cells or less. In addition,
serum Hsp27 protein levels were decreased by 30% or greater over a period of at least six weeks in
approximately 25% of patients at the 800 and 1000 mg doses.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">When OGX-427 was combined with docetaxel, 5 of 10 patients had a decrease in measurable disease of
20% or greater. Five of nine patients with prostate cancer had a decrease of 30% or greater in PSA.
Again, decreases in both total CTCs and Hsp27 (&#043;) CTCs were observed. Hsp27&#043;CTCs were decreased in
71% of evaluable patients. In four of seven patients with &#8805;5 Hsp&#043;CTCs at baseline, Hsp&#043; CTCs had
decreased to five cells or less. Serum Hsp27 protein levels were decreased by 30% or greater over a
time period of at least six weeks in approximately 35% of patients.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In September&nbsp;2010, we announced the initiation of a second investigator-sponsored phase 2 clinical
trial evaluating OGX-427 when administered as a monotherapy to patients with CRPC. This randomized,
controlled phase 2 trial
will enroll up to 72 patients who have minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic advanced prostate
cancer and who have not yet received chemotherapy, and is designed to determine the potential
benefit of OGX-427 by evaluating the number of patients who are without disease progression at 12
weeks post-study treatment with or without OGX-427. This phase 2 trial will also measure the direct
effect of OGX-427 on PSA levels, time to progression by PSA or measurable disease, numbers of CTCs
and other relevant secondary endpoints.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">An investigator-sponsored phase 1 clinical trial evaluating OGX-427 when administered directly into
the bladder in patients with bladder cancer was initiated in August&nbsp;2009. The trial, which will
enroll up to 36 patients with bladder cancer, is designed to determine the safety and potential
benefit of OGX-427 administered directly into the bladder using a catheter, which is known as
intravesical instillation. In addition, the trial will measure the direct effect of OGX-427 on
expression of Hsp27 in bladder tumor cells, as well as determine the pharmacokinetics and
pharmacodynamics of OGX-427 when delivered by intravesical instillation. This
investigator-sponsored clinical trial is funded by the National Cancer Institute of Canada.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><U>Summary of Proposed OGX-427 Randomized Phase 2 Clinical Trial in Patients With Metastatic
Bladder Cancer</U>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We expect to initiate a phase 2 clinical trial of OGX-427 in approximately 180 patients with
metastatic bladder cancer in the second half of 2011. The proposed trial design is a three-arm,
randomized phase 2 in combination with standard chemotherapy in the first-line metastatic setting.
Each arm would enroll approximately 60 patients and the trial would be initiated in sites
throughout the United States, Canada and Europe. We are consulting with external bladder cancer
experts and anticipate initiating this trial in the second half of 2011.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Product candidate SN2310 is a novel camptothecin for treating cancer. Camptothecins are potent
anticancer agents that belong to the family of drugs called topoisomerase I inhibitors that bind
reversibly to the TOPO-I-DNA complex causing breaks in the DNA strands during replication, thereby
resulting in cell death. The phase 1 clinical trial evaluated safety in patients with advanced
cancer who have received on average three to five prior chemotherapy treatments. The phase 1
clinical trial was completed in 2008 and the dose-limiting toxicity that defined a maximum
tolerated dose in this heavily pretreated patient population was a significant decrease in the
number of neutrophils, or neutropenia, a type of white blood cell that is involved in the body&#146;s
defense against infections.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">SN2310 has been administered to 26 patients with various types of cancer in a phase 1 clinical
trial. Enrollment for this clinical trial has been completed. Some of the patients experienced
adverse events, which were considered unrelated to the trial drug and attributed to the underlying
disease. Of the adverse events associated with the administration of SN2310, most were mild and the
most common events were nausea, diarrhea, vomiting and fatigue. Mild to moderate reactions
(back/chest pain, flushing) have been observed during infusions. Significant neutropenia occurred
in some patients and was the dose-limiting toxicity observed, sometimes associated with fever or
septicemia. We have not defined additional development activities for this product candidate at
this time and are currently exploring options to out-license this product candidate.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>OGX-225</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The development program for our fourth product candidate, OGX-225, is focused on reducing the
production of both IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-5, thereby enhancing treatment sensitivity and delaying tumor
progression. Increased IGFBP-2 or IGFBP-5 production is observed in many human cancers and is
linked to faster rates of cancer progression, treatment resistance and shorter survival duration.
We believe that employing OGX-225 as a monotherapy will inhibit the production of both IGFBP-2 and
IGFBP-5 and result in the delay of disease progression in cancers that depend on insulin-like
growth factor 1, or IGF-1, for proliferation. we have completed pre-clinical proof of concept
studies with OGX-225.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We believe that because IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-5 are over-produced in a variety of cancers, OGX-225 may
have broad market potential to treat many cancer indications. We believe that the initial
opportunity for OGX-225 would be in breast and prostate cancer patients early in the course of
their recurrence after failed hormone ablation therapy.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We have identified the lead compound and completed numerous preclinical proof of concept studies
with OGX-225, which indicate that OGX-225 delays disease progression in prostate and breast cancer
model systems. We have not yet initiated the pre-Investigational New Drug, or IND, studies required
for a regulatory submission and initiation of phase 1 clinical trials.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>Second-Generation Antisense Technology</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Custirsen, OGX-427 and OGX-225 are based on second-generation antisense drug chemistry and belong
to the drug class known as antisense therapeutics. On a product-by-product basis, we have
collaborated with Isis Pharmaceuticals Inc., or Isis, and selectively licensed technology from Isis
to combine Isis&#146; second-generation antisense chemistry with our proprietary gene target sequences
to create inhibitors that are designed to down regulate certain proteins associated with cancer
resistance. In contrast to first-generation antisense chemistry, second-generation antisense
chemistry has improved target binding affinity, increased resistance to degradation and improved
tissue distribution. These improvements result in slower clearance of the therapies from the body,
which allow for less frequent dosing and thereby make treatment easier on patients at a lower
associated cost. For example, clinical data from our phase 1 clinical trial in prostate cancer
patients demonstrated that weekly intravenous administration of custirsen resulted in drug
distribution to prostate cancer tissue and over 92% inhibition of its target, clusterin mRNA, in
prostate tumor cells in these patients. These data demonstrate that following systemic
administration, custirsen entered tumor cells and effectively inhibited clusterin production.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In North America, cancer is expected to strike slightly fewer than one in two men and slightly more
than one in three women in their lifetimes and has recently surpassed heart disease as the leading
cause of death in the United States. The American Cancer Society estimated that in 2010
approximately 1,529,560 new patients in the United
States would be diagnosed with cancer and that there would be approximately 569,490 patient deaths
attributable to cancers.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Typically, cancer treatment is given sequentially and can include hormone therapy, surgery,
radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. Although a particular therapy may initially be effective,
tumor cells often react to therapeutic treatment by increasing the production of proteins that
afford them a survival advantage, which enable them to become resistant to therapy, multiply and
spread to additional organs. As a result, many patients progress rapidly through all available
therapies and ultimately die.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B>Our Strategy</B>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our objective is to develop and commercialize new cancer therapies that address resistance to
therapies in cancer patients. Key elements of our strategy include:

    <TD>Gaining market approval for custirsen by conducting registration trials that demonstrate
efficacy and safety, in both prostate and lung cancer, in collaboration with Teva. As a
result of the Collaboration Agreement with Teva, committed funding is available for phase 3
trials in patients with CRPC to evaluate custirsen in combination with docetaxel as
first-line chemotherapy, in patients with CRPC to evaluate custirsen in combination with
docetaxel retreatment as second-line chemotherapy, and in patients with NSCLC to evaluate
custirsen in combination with first-line chemotherapy. The prostate trials were initiated
in 2010 and the NSCLC trial is expected to begin in 2011. Currently, mitoxantrone,
docetaxel and cabazitaxel are approved for use in patients with advanced CRPC, but
docetaxel and cabazitaxel have shown improved patient survival when compared to
mitoxantrone. Currently, carboplatin, gemcitabine and cisplatin are approved for use in
patients with advanced NSCLC and bevacizumab in patients with non-squamous NSCLC;
bevacizumab in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin chemotherapy has shown to
improve patient survival when compared to carboplatin chemotherapy alone. Pemetrexed is
also approved as a single agent in patients with advanced NSCLC after initial chemotherapy
and in combination with cisplatin for the initial treatment and maintenance therapy
following platinum-based therapy.</TD>

expiration of Teva&#146;s obligation to pay royalties on sales of the Licensed Product in such country
(or earlier termination under its terms). Commencing after the completion of all three phase 3
clinical trials set forth in the Clinical Development Plan, or upon early termination due to a
material adverse change in our patent rights related to custirsen or safety issues or &#147;futility,&#148;
as defined in the Collaboration Agreement, Teva may terminate the Collaboration Agreement in its
sole discretion upon three months&#146; advance notice if notice is given prior to regulatory approval
of a Licensed Product, and upon six months&#146; advance notice if notice is given after such regulatory
approval. If Teva terminates the Collaboration Agreement for any reason other than an adverse
change in custirsen patent rights, safety issues or &#147;futility&#148; determination as previously
described, it will remain responsible for paying any remaining costs of all three phase 3 clinical
trials, except for specified company development expenses. Either party may terminate the
Collaboration Agreement for an uncured material breach by the other party or upon the bankruptcy of
either party. If the Collaboration Agreement is terminated other than for an uncured material
breach by Teva, we will pay Teva a
royalty on sales of Licensed Products. The percentage rates of such royalties (which are in the
single digits) depend on whether termination occurs prior to the first regulatory approval in the
United States or a primary European market or after one of these approvals. These royalties would
expire on a country-by-country basis on the earlier of 10&nbsp;years after the first commercial sale of

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In November&nbsp;2001, OncoGenex Technologies entered into an agreement with Isis, referred to as the
Original Isis Agreement, to jointly develop and commercialize custirsen. This strategic
relationship provided us with access to Isis&#146; proprietary position in second-generation antisense
chemistry for use in custirsen, and Isis&#146; expertise in developing antisense therapeutics, including
its manufacturing expertise, and allowed us to develop custirsen cost efficiently. Under the
Original Isis Agreement, we paid 65%, and Isis paid 35%, of the costs and revenue resulting from
the development and commercialization of custirsen. On July&nbsp;2, 2008, we and Isis amended the
Original Isis Agreement or the Amended Isis Agreement, pursuant to which we became solely
responsible for the costs and development of custirsen, and, in turn, assumed certain financial
obligations to Isis, primarily related to sharing revenue received by us from a third party as a
result of a licensing transaction.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Licensing revenue that are based on a percentage of net sales of a licensor are defined as Royalty
Revenue, while other licensing revenue, with the exception of fair market value of equity and
reimbursement of research and development expenses, are defined as Non-Royalty Revenue. We will pay
Isis royalties comprised of a base percentage of net sales of custirsen and a percentage of Royalty
Revenue we receive in excess of a certain threshold up to a certain cap. The amount of the
royalties payable to Isis depends on whether Isis owes royalty payments to third parties pursuant
to its license agreements with such parties. Based on the Royalty Revenue we are eligible to
receive as a result of the royalty rates established in our collaboration with Teva, our total
royalty obligations to Isis will range between 6.38% and 7.00% of net sales of custirsen by Teva
during the period Isis owes royalty payments to third parties, and between 3.88% and 4.50% when
those third-party obligations of Isis have expired, which we expect to occur in 2017.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We paid Isis $10&nbsp;million in January&nbsp;2010 as Isis&#146; share of Non-Royalty Revenue received by us in
December&nbsp;2009 in connection with our Collaboration Agreement with Teva. We do not anticipate
making any further payments to Isis in 2011 under the terms of the Amended Isis Agreement.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In addition, we are required to pay Isis 30% of all Non-Royalty Revenue we receive. Isis has
disclosed in its Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, filings that it is entitled to receive
30% of the up to $370&nbsp;million in milestone payments we may receive from Teva as part of the
Collaboration Agreement; however, we believe that certain of the milestone payments related to
sales targets may qualify as Royalty Revenue, and therefore be subject to the lesser payment
obligations discussed above. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be entitled to receive
these milestone payments or, if we are, that the applicable amount payable to Isis will be less
than 30%. Neither we nor Isis can pursue the development or commercialization of any antisense
compound for clusterin outside of the Amended Isis Agreement. This arrangement will continue until
custirsen is no longer being developed or commercialized or until the Amended Isis Agreement is
earlier terminated due to an uncured material breach.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">To facilitate the execution and performance of the Collaboration Agreement, we and Isis agreed to
amend the Amended Isis Agreement, which amendment provides that, among other things, if OncoGenex
is the subject of a change of control with a third party, where the surviving entity immediately
following such change of control has the right to develop and sell the product, then (i)&nbsp;a
milestone payment of $20&nbsp;million will be due and payable to Isis 21&nbsp;days following the first
commercial sale of the product in the United States and (ii)&nbsp;unless such surviving entity had
previously sublicensed the product and a royalty rate payable to Isis by us has been established,
the applicable royalty rate payable to Isis will thereafter be the maximum amount payable under the
Amended Isis Agreement. Any
non-royalty milestone amounts previously paid will be credited towards the $20&nbsp;million milestone if
not already paid. As a result of the $10&nbsp;million milestone payment paid to Isis in relation to the
Collaboration Agreement, the remaining amount owing in the event of change of control discussed
above is a maximum of $10&nbsp;million. As we have now licensed the product to Teva and established a
royalty rate payable to Isis, no royalty rate adjustments would apply if Teva acquires OncoGenex
and is the surviving entity.

activities for antisense compounds under this collaboration. This relationship provides OncoGenex
Technologies with access to Isis&#146; proprietary position in second generation antisense chemistry for
use in specified products. OncoGenex Technologies was permitted to designate up to two
collaboration gene targets for collaborative research, development and commercialization. In April,
2005, Hsp27 was confirmed as a collaboration gene target, and we and Isis jointly designed and
screened antisense compounds for this gene target. OncoGenex Technologies&#146; right to designate a
second collaboration gene target expired on January&nbsp;5, 2007.

a worldwide license or sublicense (as the case may be) of its relevant technology solely to develop
and commercialize OGX-427 in exchange for a royalty on Isis&#146; sales of OGX-427.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In consideration for the grant of rights related to OGX-427, on May&nbsp;5, 2005 OncoGenex Technologies

subsequently exchanged in the Arrangement for 53,200 shares of OncoGenex Pharmaceuticals common
stock. Under the terms of the agreement, OncoGenex Technologies may be obligated to make certain
milestone payments to Isis contingent upon the occurrence of certain clinical development and
regulatory events related to OGX-427. It is also obligated to pay to Isis certain milestone
payments, as well as certain royalties on net sales for OGX-427, with the amount of royalties
depending on whether third-party royalty payments are owed. We paid Isis $750,000 in 2010 upon the
initiation of a phase 2 clinical trial of OGX-427 in patients with CRPC. We do not anticipate
making any royalty payments to Isis under the terms of the agreement in 2011.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">As part of the regulatory health authority approval for each product, the drug-manufacturing
establishment is subject to inspection by the FDA and must comply with current Good Manufacturing
Practices, or cGMP, requirements applicable to the production of pharmaceutical drug products. The
facilities, procedures and operations of manufacturers must be determined to be adequate by the FDA
before product approval.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of the active drug substance and its formulation
in animals to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the drug and its formulation. Prior to
initiating the first clinical testing of a new drug product candidate, the results of the
pre-clinical studies are submitted to regulatory health authorities as part of an IND or CTA, and
must be accepted before the proposed clinical trial(s) can begin.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Clinical trials for cancer therapeutics involve the administration of the investigational drug to
patients with a defined disease state, under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Clinical trials are conducted in accordance with protocols that detail the parameters to be used to
monitor safety and efficacy. Each protocol is submitted to regulatory health authorities as part of
the IND or CTA in each country where clinical trials are to be conducted. Each clinical trial is
approved and monitored by independent Institutional Review Boards, or IRB, or Ethics Committees who
consider ethical factors, informed consent documents, the safety of human subjects and the possible
liability of the institutions conducting a clinical trial. The IRB or Ethics Committee may require
changes in the clinical trials protocol, which may delay initiation or completion of the trial.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases, although the phases may
overlap. In phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug to humans, the drug is tested for safety
and clinical pharmacology. Phase 2 trials involve more detailed evaluation of the safety and
efficacy of the drug in patients with a defined disease. Phase 3 trials consist of large-scale
evaluations of safety and efficacy of the investigational drug compared to accepted standard
therapy in a defined disease.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The process of completing clinical testing and obtaining regulatory approval for a new product
takes a number of years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources. The FDA, or another
regulatory authority, may not grant approval on a timely basis, if at all. We may encounter
difficulties in securing regulatory approval or unanticipated costs, which may delay or preclude
the commercialization of our product candidates. For instance, regulatory authorities may conclude
that the data submitted in a marketing authorization application, such as a NDA, are not adequate
to support approval of a pharmaceutical agent and may require further clinical and pre-clinical
testing, re-submission of the application, and further review. Even after initial approval has been
obtained, an indication may be limited or conditioned on the provision of further studies to
support an approved indication, and further studies will be required to gain approval for the use
of a product for clinical indications other than those for which the product was approved
initially. Also, regulatory authorities require post-marketing surveillance programs to monitor the
drug product&#146;s side effects.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The development and commercialization of new drugs is highly competitive. Our major competitors are
large pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in the United States,
Canada and abroad. Many oncology drugs in clinical trials are being developed for the four primary
cancer indications: lung, breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer. Certain of these drugs are, like
custirsen, OGX-427 and OGX-225, designed to interfere with mechanisms potentially involved with
treatment resistance. If new drugs targeting mechanisms of treatment resistance are approved for
sale for the indications that we are targeting in advance of our product candidates, or even after
their commercialization, it may reduce the market&#146;s interest in our product candidates. We are
aware of several other companies developing therapeutics, whether antisense or otherwise, that seek
to promote tumor cell death by inhibiting proteins believed to promote cell survival. Our
competitors may seek to identify gene sequences, protein targets or antisense chemistry different
from ours, and outside the scope of our intellectual property protection, to develop antisense
therapeutics that serve the same function as our product candidates. Our competitors may also seek
to use mechanisms other than antisense to inhibit the proteins that our product candidates are
designed to inhibit.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Some of our product candidates&#146; development plans include pursuing prostate cancer indications.
Substantial advancements in the treatment of prostate cancer have occurred in the past two years
and new products have been approved for marketing on the basis of showing a survival advantage.
Many of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial resources and
expertise in manufacturing and developing products, conducting clinical trials, obtaining
regulatory approvals, and marketing than we do. These entities also compete with us in recruiting
and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, as well as in acquiring products and
technologies complementary to our programs. Standard treatments vary considerably by cancer
indication, and new drugs may be more effective in treating one cancer indication than another. In
addition, cancer is a difficult disease to treat and it is likely that no one therapeutic will
replace all other therapies in any particular indication. Therapeutic strategies for treating
cancer are increasingly focused on combining a number of drugs in order to yield the best results.
Since custirsen and OGX-427 are intended to be used in multiple cancer indications and target the
tumors&#146; adaptive survival mechanisms, these drugs will potentially be synergistic with many new and
currently marketed therapies. Our ability to compete successfully will depend largely on our
ability and, where applicable, the ability of our collaborators to:

disclosed. If competitive products developed by third parties show significant benefit in the
cancer indications in which we are developing our product candidates, any planned supportive or
primary registration trials may be delayed, altered or not initiated and custirsen may never
receive regulatory approval. In order to market custirsen, we and Teva must, among other things,
conduct additional clinical trials, including phase 3 or registration clinical trials, to
demonstrate safety and efficacy. We have initiated two registration trials with custirsen and are
intending to initiate a third registration trial in 2011. OGX-427 and SN2310 have been evaluated in
humans, although we have very limited safety data and have not yet established efficacy in humans.
We have completed enrollment in the phase 1 clinical trial of SN2310 and the dose limiting toxicity
that defined a maximum tolerated dose in this heavily pretreated patient population, as expected,
was significant neutropenia. Additional clinical trials will be required for OGX-427 and SN2310 to
establish the safety and efficacy of this product candidate. Neither OGX-225 nor CSP-9222 has been
tested in humans. Our pre-clinical testing of these product candidates may not be successful and we
may not be able to clinically evaluate them. Our clinical development programs for our product
candidates may not receive regulatory approval either if such product candidates fail to
demonstrate that they are safe and effective in clinical trials and consequently fail to obtain
necessary approvals from the FDA, or similar non-U.S. regulatory agencies, or if we have inadequate
financial or other resources to advance these product candidates through the clinical trial
process. Any failure to obtain regulatory approval of custirsen or our other product candidates
could have a material and adverse effect on our business.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">To implement our product development strategies, we rely on third parties, such as collaborators,
contract research organizations, medical institutions, clinical investigators and contract
laboratories, to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates. In particular, we will have
limited control over the two custirsen phase 3 trials over which Teva will have primary oversight.
Although we rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials, we are responsible for ensuring
that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with our investigational plan and
protocol. Moreover, the FDA and non-U.S. regulatory authorities require us to comply with
regulations and standards, commonly referred to as Good Clinical Practices, or GCPs, for
conducting, monitoring, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to ensure that the
data and results are scientifically credible and accurate and that the clinical trial subjects are
adequately informed of the potential risks of participating in clinical trials. Our reliance on
third parties does not relieve us of these responsibilities and requirements. If the third parties
conducting our clinical trials do not perform their contractual duties or obligations, do not meet
expected deadlines or need to be replaced, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they
obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to GCPs or for any other reason, we may need to
enter into new arrangements with alternative third parties and our clinical trials may be extended,
delayed or terminated. In addition, a failure by such third parties to perform their obligations in
compliance with GCPs may cause our clinical trials to fail to meet regulatory requirements, which
may require us to repeat our clinical trials.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>We rely on third parties to manufacture and supply our product candidates.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities, and we depend on third-party contract
manufacturers for production of our product candidates. We lack the resources and the capability to
manufacture any of our product candidates ourselves. To date, our product candidates have been
manufactured in limited quantities for pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. All API for
custirsen has been manufactured for us by Isis or Avecia, and all drug product has been
manufactured for us by Formatech, Inc., Pyramid Laboratories, Inc. and Laureate Pharma, Inc., in
each case pursuant to a purchase order or short-term contract that has been fulfilled. Avecia is
our contract manufacturer for additional quantities of custirsen to complete our phase 3 clinical
trials.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">All API for OGX-427 for IND-enabling toxicology studies and initial clinical trials has been
manufactured for us by Avecia and all drug product has been manufactured for us by Laureate Pharma,
Inc., in each case pursuant to a purchase order or short-term contract which has been fulfilled.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">If, in the future, one of our product candidates is approved for commercial sale, we, or a
pharmaceutical partner that has licensed such product candidate, will need to manufacture that
product candidate in commercial quantities. We cannot provide assurance that the third-party
manufacturers with which we have contracted in the past will have sufficient capacity to satisfy
our future manufacturing needs, that we will be able to negotiate additional purchases of API or
drug product from these or alternative manufacturers on terms favorable to us, if at all, or that a
pharmaceutical partner that has licensed such product candidate will have sufficient capacity or
expertise to satisfy future needs.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Third-party manufacturers may fail to perform under their contractual obligations, or may fail to
deliver the required commercial quantities of bulk API or finished drug product on a timely basis
and at commercially reasonable prices. We have experienced manufacturing quality issues resulting
in an unusable lot of product candidate. Any performance failure on the part of our contract
manufacturers could delay clinical development or regulatory approval of our product candidates or
commercialization of our future product candidates, depriving us of potential product revenue and
resulting in additional losses. If we are required to identify and qualify an alternate
manufacturer, we may be forced to delay or suspend our clinical trials, regulatory submissions,
required approvals or commercialization of our product candidates, which may cause us to incur
higher costs and could prevent us from commercializing our product candidates successfully. If we
are unable to find one or more replacement manufacturers capable of production at a reasonably
favorable cost, in adequate volumes, of adequate quality, and on a timely basis, we would likely be
unable to meet demand for our product candidates and our clinical trials could be delayed or we
could lose potential revenue. Our ability to replace an existing API manufacturer may be difficult
because the number of potential manufacturers is limited to approximately five manufacturers, and
the FDA must inspect any replacement manufacturer and review information related to product
produced at the manufacturer before they can begin manufacturing our product candidates. It may be
difficult or impossible for us to identify and engage a replacement manufacturer on acceptable
terms in a timely manner, if at all. We expect to continue to depend on third-party contract
manufacturers for the foreseeable future.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our product candidates require precise, high-quality manufacturing. Any of our contract
manufacturers will be subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspection by the FDA and non-U.S.
regulatory authorities to ensure strict compliance with cGMP, and other applicable government
regulations and corresponding standards. If our contract manufacturers fail to achieve and maintain
high manufacturing standards in compliance with cGMP regulations, we may experience manufacturing
errors resulting in patient injury or death, product recalls or withdrawals, delays or
interruptions of production or failures in product testing or delivery, delay or prevention of
filing or approval of marketing applications for our product candidates, cost overruns or other
problems that could seriously affect our business.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Significant manufacturing scale-up may require additional validation studies, which the FDA must
review and approve. Additionally, any third-party manufacturers we retain to manufacture our
product candidates on a commercial scale must pass an FDA pre-approval inspection for conformance
to cGMP regulations before we can obtain approval of our product candidates. If we are unable to
successfully increase the manufacturing capacity for a product candidate in conformance with cGMP
regulations, the regulatory approval or commercial launch of any related products may be delayed or
there may be a shortage in supply.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>If our competitors develop and market products that are more effective, safer or less expensive
than our future product candidates, our clinical trials and commercial opportunities will be
negatively affected.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The life sciences industry is highly competitive, and we face significant competition from many
pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are researching and marketing
products designed to address cancer indications for which we are currently developing products or
for which we may develop products in the future. We are aware of several other companies which are
developing therapeutics that seek to promote tumor cell death by inhibiting proteins believed to
promote cell survival. Any products we may develop in the future are also likely to face
competition from other drugs and therapies. Many of our competitors have significantly greater
financial, manufacturing, marketing and drug development resources than we do. Large pharmaceutical
companies, in particular, have extensive experience in clinical testing and in obtaining regulatory
approvals for drugs. These companies also have significantly greater research and marketing
capabilities than we do. In addition, many universities and private and public research institutes
are, or may become, active in cancer research, which products may directly compete with ours. If
our competitors market products that are more effective, safer or less expensive than our future
product candidates, if any, or that reach the market sooner than our future product candidates, if
any, we may not achieve commercial success.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>If new therapies become broadly used, we may need to conduct clinical trials of our product
candidates in combination with these new therapies to demonstrate safety and efficacy of the
combination. Additional trials will delay the development of our product candidates and increase
our costs. The failure of certain of our product candidates to work in combination with these new
therapies would have an adverse effect on our business.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our intention is to combine certain of our product candidates with therapies that are broadly used
by clinicians and considered highly effective. As new therapies are developed, we will need to
assess these therapies to determine whether to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates in
combination with them to demonstrate safety and efficacy of the combination. If we determine that
it is appropriate to conduct additional clinical trials of our product candidates in combination
with these new therapies, the development of our product candidates will be delayed and our costs
will be increased. If these clinical trials generate safety concerns or lack of efficacy, our
business would be adversely affected.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">If our product candidates are approved in combination with a specific therapy that is broadly used
and that therapy is displaced by another product, the market for our product candidate may
decrease.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Custirsen was administered to 294 patients with various types of cancer in phase 1 and phase 2
clinical trials. Some patients experienced various adverse events, the majority of which are
associated with other treatments in the protocol and the disease. The majority of adverse events
were mild and the most common adverse events associated with custirsen consisted of flu-like
symptoms. The most common serious adverse events associated with custirsen were neutropenia,
vomiting, dehydration, pyrexia, pleural effusion and difficulty breathing (also known as
&#147;dyspnea&#148;), which occurred in greater than 2% of patients. In addition, we are conducting a phase 1
DDI study, the results of which may affect the development of custirsen in NSCLC.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">OGX-427 was administered to 59 patients with various types of cancer in a phase 1 clinical trial.
Enrollment is complete in five cohorts with dose-escalation of OGX-427 as monotherapy and in two
cohorts in which docetaxel was administered in combination with OGX-427. There was only one
dose-limiting toxicity; thus, the maximum tolerated dose was not reached. Of the 46 patients
presented at the ASCO 2010 annual meeting, the majority of the adverse events were infusion
reactions, which were documented in 72% of patients and increased in incidence with increasing
dose. The majority (93%) were grade 1 or 2. Grade 3/4 laboratory events, which occurred in
decreasing frequency, were lymphopenia, prolonged PTT, neutropenia, hyponatremia, anemia, elevated
creatinine and thrombocytopenia. During monotherapy and when OGX-427 was administered as
combination therapy, there was evidence of decreases in tumor markers (CA-125 and PSA), decreases
in Hsp27&#043; circulating tumor cells, and reduction of serum Hsp27 protein levels.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">SN2310 was administered to 26 patients with various types of cancer in a phase 1 clinical trial.
Data collection for this clinical trial has been completed. Some of the patients experienced
adverse events, which were considered unrelated to the study drug and attributed to the underlying
disease. Of the adverse events associated with SN2310, most were mild and the most common events
were nausea, diarrhea, vomiting and fatigue. Mild to moderate reactions (back/chest pain, flushing)
have been observed during infusions. Significant neutropenia has occurred in some patients and was
the dose-limiting toxicity observed, sometimes associated with fever or septicemia.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Since patients in our clinical trials have advanced stages of cancer, we expect that additional
adverse events, including serious adverse events, will occur.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Undesirable side effects caused by any of our product candidates could cause us or regulatory
authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in the denial of
regulatory approval by the FDA or non-U.S. regulatory authorities for any or all targeted
indications. This, in turn, could prevent us from commercializing our product candidates and
generating revenue from their sale. In addition, if our product candidates receive marketing
approval and we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by the product:

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our business strategy relies in part on potentially partnering successful product candidates with
larger companies to complement our internal development and commercialization efforts. While we
have successfully entered into a Collaboration Agreement with Teva with respect to custirsen, it
may be difficult for us to find third parties that are willing to enter into a collaboration on
acceptable economic terms, if at all, with respect to our other product candidates. We also will be
competing with many other companies as we seek partners for our other product candidates and may
not be able to compete successfully against those companies. If we are not able to enter into
collaboration arrangements for our other product candidates, we would be required to undertake and
fund further development, clinical trials, manufacturing and commercialization activities solely at
our own expense and risk. If we are unable to finance and/or successfully execute those expensive
activities, our business could be materially and adversely affected, and we may be forced to
discontinue clinical development of these product candidates.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We may be held liable if any of our products or operations cause injury or death or are found
otherwise unsuitable during product testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. These risks are
inherent in the development of pharmaceutical products. We currently maintain Commercial General
and Umbrella Liability policies with combined limits of $10&nbsp;million per occurrence and in the
aggregate, in addition to a $10&nbsp;million per claim and annual aggregate product liability insurance
policy related to our clinical trials consistent with industry standards. When necessary for our
products, we intend to obtain additional product liability insurance. Insurance coverage may be
prohibitively expensive, may not fully cover potential liabilities or may not be available in the
future. Inability to obtain sufficient insurance coverage at an acceptable cost or otherwise to
protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization
of our products. If we were to be sued for any injury caused by or associated with our products or
operations, the litigation could consume substantial time and attention of our management, and the
resulting liability could exceed our total assets.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We currently do not have internal discovery capabilities and depend on pharmaceutical and
biotechnology companies and other researchers to sell or license products or product candidates to
us. To date, three of our product candidates have been derived from technologies discovered by the
Vancouver Prostate Centre and licensed to us by UBC, and one candidate has been in-licensed from
Bayer. We intend to continue to rely on the Vancouver Prostate Centre, UBC and other research
institutions and other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies as sources of product candidates.
We cannot guarantee that the Vancouver Prostate Centre or UBC will continue to develop new product
candidate opportunities, that we will continue to have access to such opportunities or that we will
be able to purchase or license these product candidates on commercially reasonable terms, if at
all. If we are unable to purchase or license new product candidates from the Vancouver Prostate
Centre or UBC, we will be required to identify alternative sources of product candidates.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The success of our product pipeline strategy depends on our ability to identify, select and acquire
pharmaceutical product candidates. Proposing, negotiating and implementing an economically viable
product acquisition or license is a lengthy and complex process. We compete for partnering
arrangements and license agreements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and academic
research institutions. Our competitors may have stronger relationships with third parties with whom
we are interested in collaborating and/or may have more established histories of developing and
commercializing products. As a result, our competitors may have a competitive advantage in entering
into partnering arrangements with such third parties. In addition, even if we find promising
product candidates, and generate interest in a partnering or strategic arrangement to acquire such
product candidates, we may not be able to acquire rights to additional product candidates or
approved products on terms that we find acceptable, if at all. If we fail to acquire and develop
product candidates from others, we may be unable to grow our business.

authorities. Even if the product candidates are approved, we can make no assurance that we would be
capable of economically producing the product or that the product would be commercially successful.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We will need to expand and effectively manage our managerial, operational, financial, development
and other resources in order to successfully pursue our research, development and commercialization
efforts for our existing and future product candidates. Our success depends on our continued
ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified personnel, such as management,
pre-clinical and clinical personnel, including our executive officers Michelle Burris, Scott
Cormack, and Cindy Jacobs. In addition, although we have entered into employment agreements with
each of Ms.&nbsp;Burris, Mr.&nbsp;Cormack, and Dr.&nbsp;Jacobs, such agreements permit the executive to terminate
his or her employment with us at any time, subject to providing us with advance written notice.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Should custirsen receive marketing approval in the United States and Canada, or should we exercise
our co-promotion option, which is unlikely without sufficient funds, we would need to hire a
substantial number of specialized personnel, including field-based medical affairs representatives.
In turn, we would need to increase our administrative headcount to support such expanded
development and commercialization operations with respect to our product candidates. Our ability to
attract and retain qualified personnel in the future is subject to intense competition for
qualified personnel among biotechnology, pharmaceutical and other businesses and our current
financial position. The loss of the services of any of our senior management could delay or prevent
the development and commercialization of our product candidates, or have other adverse effects on
our business for an indefinite term. In particular, if we lose any members of our current senior
management team, we may not be able to find suitable replacements in a timely fashion, if at all
and our business may be harmed as a result. If any of such events were to occur, among other
things, we may not be able to comply with our contractual obligations to Teva under our
Collaboration Agreement or advance our product candidates, which could have a material adverse
effect on our business.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We have scientific and clinical advisors who assist us in formulating our development and clinical
strategies. These advisors are not our employees and may have commitments to, or consulting or
advisory contracts with, other entities that may limit their availability to us. In addition, our
advisors may have arrangements with other companies to assist those companies in developing
products or technologies that may compete with ours.

and clinical trials, we will need to develop or expand our development, regulatory, manufacturing,
marketing and sales capabilities or contract with third parties to provide these capabilities for
us. Maintaining additional relationships and managing our future growth will impose significant
added responsibilities on members of our management. We must be able to manage our development
efforts effectively, manage our clinical trials effectively, hire, train and integrate additional
management, development, administrative and sales and marketing personnel, improve our managerial,
development, operational and finance systems, and expand our facilities, all of which may impose a
strain on our administrative and operational infrastructure.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Under the Collaboration Agreement, Teva is responsible for the commercialization costs associated
with custirsen; however, if we were to exercise our co-promotion option, which we do not anticipate
having sufficient funds to do, we would need to expand our marketing and sales capabilities. In
addition, as we have primary responsibility for the oversight of the second-line trial in CRPC, we
must be able to manage our development responsibilities effectively, which may impose a strain on
our administrative and operational infrastructure.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We regularly review and update our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and
corporate governance policies. In addition, we are required under the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 to
report annually on our internal control over financial reporting. If it were to be determined that
our internal control over financial reporting is not effective, such shortcoming could have an
adverse effect on our business and financial results and the price of our common stock could be
negatively affected. This reporting requirement could also make it more difficult or more costly
for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including director and officer liability insurance,
and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher
costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. Any system of internal controls, however well
designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not
absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of the
controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulation concerning control and procedures
could have a material effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition. Any of
these events could result in an adverse reaction in the financial marketplace due to a loss of
investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which ultimately could
negatively affect the market price of our shares, increase the volatility of our stock price and
adversely affect our ability to raise additional funding. The effect of these events could also
make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of
directors and our board committees and as executive officers.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our commercial success will depend on our ability to obtain patents and/or regulatory exclusivity
and maintain adequate protection for our technologies and product candidates in the United States

technologies and product candidates, as we deem appropriate. We or our collaborators may, however,
fail to apply for patents on important technologies or product candidates in a timely fashion, if
at all. Our existing patents and any future patents we or our collaborators obtain may not be
sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing competing
products and technologies. In addition, we do not always control the patent prosecution of subject
matter that we license from others. Accordingly, we are sometimes unable to exercise a significant
degree of control over such intellectual property as we would over our own. Moreover, the patent
positions of biopharmaceutical companies are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual
questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. As a result, the validity and
enforceability of our patents cannot be predicted with certainty. In addition, we cannot guarantee

</TABLE>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country to
country and depends on many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the
availability of regulatory related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular
country and the validity and enforceability of the patents. Our ability or the ability of our
collaborators to maintain and solidify our proprietary position for our product candidates will
depend on our success in obtaining effective claims and enforcing those claims once granted. Our
issued patents and those that may issue in the future, or those licensed to us or our
collaborators, may be challenged, invalidated, unenforceable or circumvented, and the rights
granted under any issued patents may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive
advantages against competitors with similar products. Due to the extensive amount of time required
for the development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that,
before any of our product candidates can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain
in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of the
patent.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We and our collaborators, including Teva, also rely on trade secrets to protect some of our
technology, especially where it is believed that patent protection is appropriate or obtainable.
However, trade secrets are difficult to maintain. While we use reasonable efforts to protect our
trade secrets, our or our collaboration partners&#146; employees, consultants, contractors or scientific
and other advisors may unintentionally or willfully disclose our proprietary information to
competitors. Enforcement of claims that a third party has illegally obtained and is using trade
secrets is expensive, time consuming and uncertain. In addition, non-U.S. courts are sometimes less
willing than U.S. courts to protect trade secrets. If our competitors independently develop
equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how, we would not be able to assert our trade secrets
against them and our business could be harmed.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>We and our collaborators, including Teva, may not be able to protect our intellectual property
rights throughout the world.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Filing, prosecuting and defending patents on all of our product candidates and products, when and
if we have any, in every jurisdiction would be prohibitively expensive. Competitors may use our
technologies in jurisdictions where we or our licensors have not obtained patent protection to
develop their own products. These products may compete with our products, when and if we have any,
and may not be covered by any of our or our licensors&#146; patent claims or other intellectual property
rights.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The laws of some non-U.S. countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent
as the laws of the United States, and many companies have encountered significant problems in
protecting and defending such rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain
countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and
other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biotechnology and/or
pharmaceuticals, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents.
Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial cost
and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>The intellectual property protection for our product candidates depends on third parties.</I></B>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">With respect to custirsen, OGX-427 and OGX-225, we have exclusively licensed from UBC certain
issued patents and pending patent applications covering the respective antisense sequences
underlying these product candidates and their commercialization and use and we have licensed from
Isis certain issued patents and pending patent applications directed to product compositions and
chemical modifications used in product candidates for commercialization, use and the manufacturing
thereof, as well as some alternative antisense sequences. We have also received a sublicense from
Isis under certain third-party patent portfolios directed to such modifications. We have entered
into an exclusive in-licensing agreement with Bayer for development of caspase activators that are
presently being evaluated in pre-clinical studies.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The patents and pending patent applications underlying our licenses do not cover all potential
product candidates, modifications and uses. In the case of patents and patent applications licensed
from Isis, we do not have and have not had any control over the filing, prosecution or enforcement
of these patents or patent applications. In the case of patents and patent applications licensed
from Bayer, we did not have any control over the filing of the patents and patent applications
before the effective date of the Bayer license, and have had control over the filing and
prosecution of these patents and patent applications after the effective date of the Bayer license.
Under certain circumstances, we also have the right to enforce patents and patent applications
licensed from Bayer. We cannot be certain that such prosecution efforts have been or will be
conducted in compliance with applicable laws and regulations or will result in valid and
enforceable patents. We also cannot be assured that our licensors or their respective licensing
partners will agree to enforce any such patent rights at our request or devote sufficient efforts
to attain a desirable result. Any failure by our licensors or any of their respective licensing
partners to properly protect the intellectual property rights relating to our product candidates
could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation.

either case, could have a significant effect on our business.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Inventions discovered under research, material transfer or other such collaborative agreements,
including our Collaboration Agreement with Teva, may become jointly owned by us and the other party
to such agreements in some cases and the exclusive property of either party in other cases. Under
some circumstances, it may be difficult to determine who owns a particular invention, or whether it
is jointly owned, and disputes could arise regarding ownership of those inventions. These disputes
could be costly and time consuming and an unfavorable outcome could have a significant adverse
effect on our business if we were not able to protect or license rights to these inventions. In
addition, our research collaborators and scientific advisors generally have contractual rights to
publish our data and other proprietary information, subject to our prior review. Publications by
our research collaborators and scientific advisors containing such information, either with our
permission or in contravention of the terms of their agreements with us, may impair our ability to
obtain patent protection or protect our proprietary information, which could significantly harm our
business.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>The patent protection for our product candidates or products may expire before we are able to
maximize their commercial value, which may subject us to increased competition and reduce or
eliminate our opportunity to generate product revenue.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The patents for our product candidates have varying expiration dates and, when these patents
expire, we may be subject to increased competition and we may not be able to recover our
development costs. For example, certain of the U.S. patents directed to custirsen and its use that
have been licensed from UBC are scheduled to expire in 2020 and 2021. In some of the larger
economic territories, such as the United States and Europe, patent term extension/restoration may
be available to compensate for time taken during aspects of the product candidate&#146;s regulatory
review. We cannot, however, be certain that an extension will be granted or, if granted, what the
applicable time period or the scope of patent protection afforded during any extended period will
be. In addition, even though some regulatory agencies may provide some other exclusivity for a
product candidate under its own laws and regulations, we may not be able to qualify the product
candidate or obtain the exclusive time period.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">If we are unable to obtain patent term extension/restoration or some other exclusivity, we could be
subject to increased competition and our opportunity to establish or maintain product revenue could
be substantially reduced or eliminated. Furthermore, we may not have sufficient time to recover our
development costs prior to the expiration of our U.S. and non-U.S. patents.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>We may incur substantial costs as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to patent

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">If we choose to go to court to stop someone else from using the inventions claimed in our patents
or our licensed patents, that individual or company has the right to ask the court to rule that
these patents are invalid and/or should not be enforced against that third party. These lawsuits
are expensive and would consume time and other resources
even if we were successful in stopping the infringement of these patents. In addition, there is a
risk that the court will decide that these patents are invalid or unenforceable and that we do not
have the right to stop the other party from using the inventions. There is also the risk that, even
if the validity or unenforceability of these patents is upheld, the court will refuse to stop the
other party on the grounds that such other party&#146;s activities do not infringe our rights.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The biotechnology industry has produced a proliferation of patents, and it is not always clear to
industry participants, including us, which patents cover various types of products or methods of
use. The coverage of patents is subject to interpretation by the courts, and the interpretation is
not always uniform. If we are sued for patent infringement, we would need to demonstrate that our
product candidates or methods of use either do not infringe the patent claims of the relevant
patent, and/or that the patent claims are invalid, and/or that the patent is unenforceable and we
may not be able to do this. Proving invalidity, in particular, is difficult since it requires a
showing of clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption of validity enjoyed by issued
patents.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">U.S. patent laws as well as the laws of some foreign jurisdictions provide for provisional rights

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Because some patent applications in the United States may be maintained in secrecy until the
patents are issued, because patent applications in the United States and many foreign jurisdictions
are typically not published until 18&nbsp;months after filing, and because publications in the
scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that others have
not filed patent applications for technology covered by our licensors&#146; issued patents or our

invention similar to ours, we may elect to participate in or be drawn into an interference
proceeding declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to determine priority of invention in
the United States. The costs of these proceedings could be substantial, and it is possible that
such efforts would be unsuccessful, resulting in a loss of our U.S. patent position with respect to
such inventions. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent
litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. In
addition, any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could
have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our
operations. We cannot predict whether third parties will assert these claims against us or
against the licensors of technology licensed to us, or whether those claims will harm our business.
If we are forced to defend against these claims, whether they are with or without any merit and
whether they are resolved in favor of or against us or our licensors, we may face costly litigation
and diversion of management&#146;s attention and resources. As a result of these disputes, we may have
to develop costly non-infringing technology, or enter into licensing agreements. These agreements,
if necessary, may be unavailable on terms acceptable to us, if at all, which could seriously harm
our business or financial condition.

the licensed technology. If we fail to comply with any of these obligations or otherwise breach
these agreements, our licensors may have the right to terminate the license in whole or in part or

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The market prices for our common stock and that of emerging growth companies generally have
historically been highly volatile. Future announcements concerning us or our competitors may have a
significant effect on the market price of our common stock. The stock markets also experience
significant price and volume fluctuation unrelated to the operating performance of particular

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following
a decline in the market price of its securities. This risk is especially relevant for us because
our stock price and those of other biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies have experienced

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We have a stockholder rights plan that may have the effect of discouraging unsolicited takeover
proposals. Specifically, the rights issued under the stockholder rights plan could cause
significant dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms not approved in
advance by our board of directors. In addition, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain
provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that stockholders may consider to be
in their best interests. These provisions include the ability of our board of directors to
designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock and the ability of our board of
directors to amend our bylaws without stockholder approval. In addition, as a Delaware corporation,
we are subject to Section&nbsp;203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a
Delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for
a period of three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder,
unless certain specific requirements are met as set forth in Section&nbsp;203. Collectively, these
provisions could make a third-party acquisition of us difficult or could discourage transactions
that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our common

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our product candidates are in various stages of development and are prone to the risks of failure
inherent in drug development. We will need to complete significant additional clinical trials
before we can demonstrate that our product candidates are safe and effective to the satisfaction of
the FDA and non-U.S. regulatory authorities. Clinical trials are expensive and uncertain processes
that take years to complete. Failure can occur at any stage of the process, and successful early
clinical trials do not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful. Product candidates in
later-stage clinical trials may fail to show desired efficacy and safety traits despite having
progressed through initial clinical trials. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry
have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after obtaining promising
results in earlier clinical trials. In addition, a clinical trial may prove successful with respect
to a secondary objective, but fail to demonstrate clinically significant benefits with respect to a
primary objective. Failure to satisfy a primary objective in a phase 3 clinical trial (registration
trial) would generally mean that a product candidate would not receive regulatory approval.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>If government and third-party payors fail to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement rates for
our product candidates, our revenue and potential for profitability will be reduced.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In the United States and elsewhere, our product revenue will depend principally on the
reimbursement rates established by third-party payors, including government health administration
authorities, managed-care providers, public health insurers, private health insurers and other
organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, and examining the
cost-effectiveness, of medical products and services. In addition, significant uncertainty exists
as to the reimbursement status, if any, of newly approved drugs, pharmaceutical products or product
indications. We may need to conduct post-marketing clinical trials in order to demonstrate the
cost-effectiveness of our products, if any. Such clinical trials may require us to commit a
significant amount of management time and financial and other resources. If reimbursement of such
product is unavailable or limited in scope or amount or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels,
our revenue could be reduced.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In some countries other than the United States, particularly the countries of the European Union
and Canada, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control. In
these countries, obtaining pricing approval from governmental authorities can take six to 12&nbsp;months
or longer after the receipt of regulatory marketing approval of a product for an indication. To
obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a
clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of one of our product candidates to other
available therapies. If reimbursement of such product candidate is unavailable or limited in scope
or amount or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our revenue could be reduced.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Domestic and foreign governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reduce the
cost of healthcare, including drugs. In the United States, there have been, and we expect that
there will continue to be, federal and state proposals to implement similar governmental control.
In addition, increasing emphasis on managed care in the United States will continue to put pressure
on the pricing of pharmaceutical products. For example, the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement
and Modernization Act of 2003 reforms the way Medicare will cover and reimburse pharmaceutical
products. The legislation expands Medicare coverage for drug purchases by the elderly and
eventually will introduce a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for certain
drugs. In addition, the new legislation provides authority for limiting the number of outpatient
drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class. As a result of the new legislation and the
expansion of federal coverage of drug products, we expect that there will be additional pressure to
contain and reduce costs. The Medicaid program and state healthcare laws and regulations may also
be modified to change the scope of covered products and/or reimbursement methodology. Cost control
initiatives could decrease the established reimbursement rates that we receive for any products in
the future, which would limit our revenue and profitability. Legislation and regulations affecting
the pricing of pharmaceutical products, including custirsen, may change at any time, which could
further limit or eliminate reimbursement rates for custirsen or other product candidates.

many other non-North American markets, we must obtain separate regulatory approvals. We have had
limited interactions with non-North American regulatory authorities. Approval procedures vary among
countries and can involve additional testing, and the time required to obtain approval may differ
from that required to obtain FDA approval. Approval by the FDA or other regulatory authorities does
not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries, and approval by one or more
non-North American regulatory authorities does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in
other countries or by the FDA. The non-North American regulatory approval process may include all
of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. We may not obtain non-North American
regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all. We may not be able to file for non-North
American regulatory approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our existing
and future product candidates in any market.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In connection with the Arrangement, OncoGenex Technologies was considered to be the acquiring
company for accounting purposes. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of Sonus were recorded, as
of the effective time of the Arrangement, at their respective fair values and added to those of
OncoGenex Technologies. The results of the operations and balance sheet data for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2008 reflect the results of only OncoGenex Technologies for the time period of January
1, 2008 through August&nbsp;20, 2008 and the results of the combined company from August&nbsp;21, 2008
through December&nbsp;31, 2008. The historical results of operations and balance sheet data shown for
years ended December&nbsp;31, 2007 and 2006 reflect only those of OncoGenex Technologies prior to the
Arrangement, and do not reflect the results of Sonus. The historical results presented are not

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">OncoGenex is a biopharmaceutical company committed to the development and commercialization of new
cancer therapies that address treatment resistance in cancer patients. We have five product
candidates in our pipeline, custirsen, OGX-427, OGX-225, SN2310 and CSP-9222, each of which has a
distinct mechanism of action and represents a unique opportunity for cancer drug development. Of
the product candidates in our pipeline, custirsen, OGX-427 and SN2310 are clinical-stage assets.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our product candidates custirsen, OGX-427 and OGX-225 focus on mechanisms for treating resistance
in cancer patients and are designed to address treatment resistance by blocking the production of
specific proteins that we believe promote survival of tumor cells and are over-produced in response
to a variety of cancer treatments. Our aim in targeting these particular proteins is to disable the
tumor cell&#146;s adaptive defenses, thereby rendering the tumor cells more susceptible to attack with a
variety of cancer therapies, including chemotherapy. We believe this approach will increase
survival time and improve the quality of life for cancer patients. Product candidate SN2310 is a
novel camptothecin for treating cancer. Camptothecins are potent anticancer agents that belong to
the family of drugs called topoisomerase I inhibitors that bind reversibly to the TOPO-I-DNA
complex, thereby causing breaks in
the DNA strands during replication that result in cell death. Product candidate CSP-9222 is the
lead compound from a family of caspase activators that have been in-licensed from Bayer and
demonstrate activation of programmed cell death in pre-clinical models.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">OGX-427 is a product candidate that, in pre-clinical experiments, inhibits production of Hsp27, a
cell survival protein found at elevated levels in many human cancers, including prostate, lung,
breast, ovarian, bladder, renal, pancreatic, multiple myeloma and liver cancer. Many anti-cancer
therapies are known to further elevate Hsp27 levels. For example, Hsp27 levels increased four-fold
in prostate cancer patients after treatment with chemotherapy or hormone therapy. Increased levels
of Hsp27 in some human cancers are associated with metastases, poor prognosis and resistance to
radiation or chemotherapy.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">OGX-427 has been evaluated in a phase 1 trial in patients with breast, prostate, ovarian, or
non-small cell lung cancer who have failed potentially curative treatments or for which a curative
treatment does not exist. Final results of this phase 1 trial were presented during an oral
presentation at the ASCO 2010 annual meeting. The phase 1 trial evaluated 36 patients treated with
OGX-427 as a single agent and 12 patients with OGX-427 in combination with docetaxel who had failed
up to six prior chemotherapy treatments. OGX-427 as a single agent administered weekly was
evaluated at doses from 200 mg up to 1000 mg in five cohorts of approximately six patients in each
cohort. Two further cohorts tested OGX-427 at the 800 and 1000 mg doses combined with docetaxel.
Patients could receive up to 10 21-day cycles.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">OGX-427 was well tolerated both as a monotherapy and in combination with docetaxel. Most adverse
events were mild (grade 1 or 2) and mainly occurred during the three &#147;loading doses&#148; given over
nine days prior to weekly dosing. The majority of adverse events potentially related to OGX-427
consisted of grade 1 or 2 fever, chills, itching, or flushing (associated with the infusion of
OGX-427) and fatigue. Despite evaluating OGX-427 at very high doses, a maximum tolerated dose for
OGX-427 was not reached in this trial.

both total CTCs, and CTCs which were positive for Hsp27, Hsp27(&#043;) CTCs. Recent studies have shown
that the presence of CTCs in peripheral blood may be of prognostic significance for patients with
solid tumors, and patients with values of five tumor cells or less are generally considered to have
a more favorable prognosis.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">When OGX-427 was used as monotherapy, 3 of 17 evaluable patients had a decrease in measurable
disease of 20% or greater. In this heavily pretreated patient population, two of four patients with
ovarian cancer had a decrease of 25% or greater in CA-125 (an ovarian tumor marker) and 3 of 15
patients with prostate cancer had a decrease of 30% or greater in PSA (a prostate tumor marker).
Hsp27&#043;CTCs decreases were noted in 89% of evaluable patients and were observed at all dose levels
and all diseases evaluated. In 9 of 26 (31%) patients with &#8805;5 Hsp27&#043;CTCs at baseline, Hsp27 &#043; CTCs
had decreased to five tumor cells or less. In addition, serum Hsp27 protein levels were decreased
by 30% or greater over a period of at least six weeks in approximately 25% of patients at the 800
and 1000 mg doses.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">When OGX-427 was combined with docetaxel, 5 of 10 patients had a decrease in measurable disease of
20% or greater. Five of nine patients with prostate cancer had a decrease of 30% or greater in PSA.
Again, decreases in both total CTCs and Hsp27(&#043;) CTCs were observed. Hsp27&#043;CTCs were decreased in
71% of evaluable patients. In four of seven patients with &#8805;5 Hsp&#043;CTCs at baseline, Hsp&#043; CTCs had
decreased to five cells or less. Serum Hsp27 protein levels were decreased by 30% or greater over a
time period of at least six weeks in approximately 35% of patients.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">An investigator-sponsored phase 1 clinical trial evaluating OGX-427 when administered directly into
the bladder in patients with bladder cancer was initiated in August&nbsp;2009. We are in the process of
accruing patients for this trial, in which we will enroll up to 36 patients. The trial is designed
to determine the safety and potential benefit of OGX-427 administered directly into the bladder
using a catheter, which is known as intravesical instillation. In addition, the trial will measure
the direct effect of OGX-427 on expression of Hsp27 in bladder tumor cells, as well as determine
the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of OGX-427 when delivered by intravesical instillation.
This investigator-sponsored trial is funded by the National Cancer Institute of Canada.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In September&nbsp;2010, we announced the initiation of a separate investigator-sponsored, randomized
phase 2 clinical trial evaluating OGX-427 when administered as a monotherapy to patients with CRPC.
The randomized, controlled phase 2 trial will enroll up to 72 patients who have minimally
symptomatic or asymptomatic advanced prostate cancer and who have not yet received chemotherapy,
and is designed to determine the potential benefit of OGX-427 by evaluating the number of patients
who are without disease progression at 12&nbsp;weeks post-trial treatment with or without OGX-427. This
phase 2 trial will also measure the direct effect of OGX-427 on PSA levels, time to progression by
PSA or measurable disease, numbers of CTCs and other relevant secondary endpoints.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">As discussed under &#147;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#148; below, in October&nbsp;2010, we received $46.7
million in net proceeds from a public offering. We expect to use a portion of the net proceeds from
that offering to fund a phase 2 clinical trial of OGX-427 in patients with metastatic bladder
cancer. The proposed trial design is a three-arm, randomized phase 2 in combination with standard
chemotherapy in the first-line metastatic setting. Each arm would enroll approximately 60 patients
and the trial would be initiated in sites throughout the United States, Canada and Europe. We are
consulting with external bladder cancer experts and anticipate the final protocol to be completed
in early 2011. This trial, which is expected to begin in the second half of 2011, will complement
the phase 2 clinical trial in prostate cancer, and phase 1 clinical trial in superficial bladder
cancer.

1 clinical trial was completed and the dose-limiting toxicity that defined a maximum tolerated dose
in this heavily pretreated patient population was determined. We do
not intend to initiate additional trials for SN2310 but will seek to out-license or sell this

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B>Collaboration Revenue</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We recorded $13.6&nbsp;million of collaboration revenue in connection with our Collaboration Agreement
with Teva in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010, as compared to $25.5&nbsp;million in the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2009. At December&nbsp;31, 2010, an aggregate of $21.6&nbsp;million of the upfront payment was
included in the balance sheet line items Current and Long-term Deferred Collaboration Revenue,
which we are amortizing over the expected performance period of our deliverables under the
Collaboration Agreement. Management currently expects this performance period to end in the fourth
quarter of 2012. Further, we are eligible to receive payments of up to $370&nbsp;million upon the
achievement of developmental and commercial milestones. At present, we are unable to predict the
timing or likelihood of such milestone payments, although we do not expect to receive any milestone
payments from Teva in the year ending December&nbsp;31, 2011. Moreover, Isis has disclosed in its
Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, filings that it is entitled to receive 30% of the up to
$370&nbsp;million in milestone payments we may receive from Teva as part of the Collaboration Agreement.
We disagree with their assessment but believe there may be some lesser payment obligation. There
was no revenue in 2008. See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere
in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details on our collaboration with Teva.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B>Research and Development Expenses</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Research and development, or R&#038;D, expenses consist primarily of costs for milestone payments to
third parties, clinical trials, materials and supplies, facilities, personnel, including salaries
and benefits, regulatory activities, pre-clinical studies, and allocations of other R&#038;D-related
costs. External R&#038;D expenses include fees paid to universities, hospitals and other entities that
conduct certain R&#038;D activities and that manufacture our product candidates for use in our clinical
trials. Currently, we manage our clinical trials through independent medical investigators at their
sites and at hospitals and expect this practice to continue.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Under the Collaboration Agreement with Teva, we are required to spend $30&nbsp;million towards
development of custirsen, which will include our personnel costs for certain development
activities. Teva will fund all other expenses incurred pursuant to the Clinical Development Plan.
Costs that we incurred totaling $3.5&nbsp;million of in 2009 and $4.9&nbsp;million in 2010 have been applied
against our $30&nbsp;million funding commitment, resulting in a remaining funding commitment of $21.6
million at December&nbsp;31, 2010. We expect aggregate full-time equivalent reimbursement of between
$1.5 and $2.5&nbsp;million annually from 2011 to 2012, which will be applied against our funding
commitment, or reimbursed to us from Teva on a cash basis. We currently expect that we will incur
all remaining costs associated with the Clinical Development Plan by the fourth quarter of 2012.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">A majority of our expenditures to date have been related to the development of custirsen. Until
July&nbsp;2, 2008, custirsen was being co-developed with Isis and R&#038;D expenses for custirsen were shared
65% by us and 35% by Isis. On July&nbsp;2, 2008, we and Isis amended the agreement to provide for
unilateral development of custirsen by us. In connection with the Collaboration Agreement and
pursuant to the terms of agreements between us and Isis relating to custirsen, we paid $10&nbsp;million
to Isis in the first quarter of 2010, which was included in R&#038;D expenses in 2009. We also paid
$333,333 to UBC in the first quarter of 2010 pursuant to the terms of the license agreement
relating to custirsen, which was also included in R&#038;D expenses in 2009.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Several of our clinical trials have been supported by grant funding that was received directly by
the hospitals and/or clinical investigators conducting the clinical trials, thereby allowing us to
complete these clinical trials at a lower cost to us.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Since our drug candidates are in the early stages of development, we cannot estimate completion
dates for development activities or when we might receive material net cash inflows from our R&#038;D
projects, if ever.

our R&#038;D priorities and available resources.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We expect our R&#038;D expenses to increase in 2011 and into the future, likely significantly, as we
further expand development of custirsen, OGX-427 and our other programs. Our programs or
anticipated programs may be subject to change from time to time as we evaluate our R&#038;D priorities
and available resources.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B>General and Administrative Expenses</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">General and administrative, or G&#038;A, expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for
our personnel in executive, business development, human resources, external communications, finance
and other administrative functions, as well as consulting costs, including market research and
business consulting, and intellectual property. Other costs include professional fees for legal and
auditing services, insurance and facility costs. We believe that G&#038;A resources are sufficient to
carry on existing development activities. We anticipate that G&#038;A expenses will increase in the
future as we continue to expand our operating activities.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B>Restructuring Activities</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">On August&nbsp;21, 2008, immediately following the completion of the Arrangement, we reduced our
workforce by approximately 49%. Severance payable at the date of the Arrangement in connection with
former Sonus employees of $1.3&nbsp;million, and has been accounted for in accordance with EITF No.
95-3, &#147;Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination,&#148; as part of
the purchase price allocation. During 2008, we made payments totaling $1.2&nbsp;million and the amount
owing at December&nbsp;31, 2008 was $137,000. All remaining severance liabilities relating to
Arrangement-related workforce reductions were paid during 2009.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Prior to the Arrangement, Sonus entered into a non-cancellable lease arrangement for office space
located in Bothell, Washington, which is in excess of our current requirements. We are currently in
the process of evaluating opportunities to exit or sublet portions of the leased space and recorded
an initial restructuring charge of $2.1&nbsp;million in August&nbsp;2008 as part of the purchase price
allocation. The liability is computed as the present value of the difference between the remaining
lease payments due less the estimate of net sublease income and expenses, and has been accounted
for in accordance with EITF No.&nbsp;95-3 and represents our best estimate of the liability. Subsequent
changes in the liability due to accretion, or changes in estimates of sublease assumptions, will be
recognized as adjustments to restructuring charges in future periods.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In June&nbsp;2009, we revised our sublease income assumptions used to estimate the excess lease facility
liability. These assumptions were subsequently further revised in December&nbsp;2009 and September&nbsp;2010.
These changes in estimate resulted in increases in the value of the excess lease liability of $0.5
million, $3.5&nbsp;million, and $4.0&nbsp;million in expense recorded in June&nbsp;2009, December&nbsp;2009, and
September&nbsp;2010, respectively. In the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010, $1.2&nbsp;million was amortized into
income through R&#038;D expense, resulting in a remaining liability with respect to excess facilities of
$7.5&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2010.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B>Results of Operations</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our consolidated financial statements reflect the Arrangement between Sonus and OncoGenex
Technologies as a reverse acquisition and OncoGenex Technologies was deemed to be the acquiring
entity from an accounting perspective. Accordingly, for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, the
consolidated results of operations include only the results of operations of OncoGenex Technologies
for the time period of January&nbsp;1, 2008 through August&nbsp;21, 2008 and the results of the combined
company following the completion of the Arrangement on August&nbsp;21, 2008. This treatment and
presentation is in accordance with SFAS 141, &#147;Business Combinations.&#148; Pro forma results are

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Revenue for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2010 decreased to $13.6&nbsp;million, from $25.5&nbsp;million for the
year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009. The decrease in 2010 as compared to 2009 was due to
lower revenue
earned through our strategic collaboration with Teva for the
development of custirsen, which we
entered into in December&nbsp;2009. Revenue for 2010 includes recognition of $4.9&nbsp;million
from the $30.0
million upfront payment, as well as $8.7&nbsp;million earned through collaborative research,
which has
been reimbursed to us on a cash basis. At December&nbsp;31, 2010, $21.6&nbsp;million of the
upfront payment
received from Teva in December&nbsp;2009 was included on our consolidated balance sheet as Deferred
Collaboration Revenue, which we are amortizing over the expected performance period of our
deliverables under the Collaboration Agreement. Management currently expects this performance
period to end in the fourth quarter of 2012. See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements included elsewhere in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details on our
collaboration with Teva.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">R&#038;D expenses for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 decreased to $18.5&nbsp;million from $20.2&nbsp;million in
the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009. The decrease in 2010 as compared to 2009 was due primarily to
2009 milestones owed to Isis and UBC resulting from the Collaboration Agreement with Teva. This
decrease in milestone expense was offset by higher manufacturing costs, employee costs and clinical
trial costs associated with the custirsen phase 3 clinical trials. Costs for the custirsen phase 3
clinical trials are applied against the non-refundable upfront payments received from Teva in
December&nbsp;2009, while manufacturing costs are reimbursable from Teva on a cash basis. We expect R&#038;D
expenses to increase as we further develop our proprietary product candidates.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">G&#038;A expenses for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 increased to $5.8&nbsp;million from $4.0&nbsp;million for
the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009. The increase in 2010 was due primarily to higher employee
expenses, including severance charges, professional fees for legal and auditing services, employee
recruitment costs and stock-based compensation expense.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Restructuring expense for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 was $4.0&nbsp;million. In September&nbsp;2010, we
revised our sublease income assumptions used to estimate the value of the excess lease facility
liability. This change in estimate resulted in an increase in the value of our excess lease
liability and a $4.0&nbsp;million restructuring expense recorded in September&nbsp;2010 to reflect this
change in estimate. Similar changes in our sublease income assumptions resulted in $4.0&nbsp;million in
expense recorded in 2009.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We recorded $1.0&nbsp;million warrant issuance cost expense for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010,
relating to the issuance costs allocated to warrants as part of the October&nbsp;2010 financing. This
expense was offset by a $0.1&nbsp;million gain on revaluation of the warrants at December&nbsp;31, 2010 which
is included on our consolidated statement of loss as gain (loss)&nbsp;on warrants. We revalue the
warrants at each balance sheet date to fair value. If unexercised, the warrants will expire in
October&nbsp;2015. There was no comparable charge in 2009.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Interest income for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 increased to $86,000 from $47,000 for the year
ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 due to higher balances of interest-bearing securities in 2010 as compared
to 2009.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Other income for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 decreased to $6,000 from $70,000 for the year
ended December&nbsp;31, 2009. The income earned in 2010 relates to gains on the sales of equipment
offset by foreign exchange losses, while income earned in 2009 relates to gains on sales of
equipment and foreign exchange gains.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">An income tax recovery of $3.0&nbsp;million was recorded in the second quarter of 2010, as we received
approval from the Israeli Tax Authority, or ITA, for its request for a withholdings tax exemption
on amounts received from Teva in relation to the collaboration. Under the Collaboration Agreement,
Teva paid us $50&nbsp;million in upfront payments, of which $20&nbsp;million was for an upfront milestone
payment and subject to possible withholding taxes by the ITA. Prior to the receipt of the approval,
Teva was granted a temporary exemption for a transfer of $17&nbsp;million of the $20&nbsp;million upfront
milestone payment. This temporary exemption was conditioned upon Teva&#146;s depositing $3&nbsp;million,
which represented 15% of the upfront milestone payment paid according to the Collaboration
Agreement, in a trust account in favor of the ITA until a final decision would be made by the ITA
regarding the request. Accordingly, prior to the receipt of the approval, we had recorded a $3
million liability recognizing this amount as an uncertain tax position. Following this approval
from the ITA, this liability was released, and we recorded a $3&nbsp;million income
tax recovery. See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on our
collaboration with Teva.

the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, due primarily to higher custirsen and OGX-427 development costs,
milestone payments owed to Isis and UBC resulting from the Collaboration Agreement with Teva, an
increase in employee expenses and higher facility costs resulting from the Arrangement. The 2008
expense included a Scientific Research and Experimental Development, or SRED, claim of $0.6
million, which offset R&#038;D expenses in the period. Since OncoGenex Technologies ceased to be a
Canadian Controlled Private Company under Canadian tax laws as a result of the Arrangement, SRED

custirsen, payments associated with custirsen clinical trial activities, and payments made to Isis

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In December&nbsp;2009, OncoGenex Pharmaceuticals, Inc., through its wholly owned subsidiary, OncoGenex
Technologies, entered into a Collaboration Agreement with Teva for the development and global
commercialization of custirsen (and related compounds). Under the Collaboration Agreement, Teva
made upfront payments in the aggregate amount of $50&nbsp;million, up to $370&nbsp;million upon the
achievement of developmental and commercial milestones and royalties at percentage rates ranging
from the mid-teens to mid-twenties on net sales. We are required to contribute $30&nbsp;million in
direct and indirect costs towards the Clinical Development Plan. We incurred $8.4&nbsp;million of these
costs in 2009 and 2010, resulting in a remaining funding responsibility of $21.6&nbsp;million, which has
been recorded as deferred collaboration revenue. Teva will fund all other expenses under the
Clinical Development Plan.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement, we and Teva agreed to collaborate in the development and
global commercialization of custirsen. Teva received the exclusive worldwide right and license to
develop and commercialize products containing custirsen and related compounds. We have an option to
co-promote custirsen in the United States and Canada.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In addition to the development costs noted above, Teva is also responsible for all costs relating
to product commercialization, including costs incurred in relation to our co-promotion option,
except for start-up costs in advance of commercialization.

payments of up to CAD$1.6&nbsp;million and CAD$7.75&nbsp;million, respectively, upon achieving specified
product development milestones related to OGX-427 and OGX-225 and royalties on future product
sales.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In addition, we are required to pay to Isis 30% of all Non-Royalty Revenue we receive. Isis has
disclosed in its SEC filings that it is entitled to receive 30% of the up to $370&nbsp;million in
milestone payments we may receive from Teva as part of the Collaboration Agreement; however, we
believe that certain of the milestone payments related to sales targets may qualify as Royalty
Revenue, and therefore be subject to the lesser payment obligations. No assurance can be provided
that we will be entitled to receive these milestone payments or, if we are, that the applicable
amount payable to Isis will be less than 30%. We are also obligated to pay to UBC certain patent
costs and annual license maintenance fees for the extent of the patent life of CAD$8,000 per year.
We paid Isis and UBC $750,000 and CAD$100,000, respectively, in 2010 upon the initiation of a phase
2 clinical trial of OGX-427 in patients with CRPC. These payments were included in R&#038;D expense. We
do not anticipate making any royalty payments to Isis in 2011.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The UBC agreements have effective dates ranging from November&nbsp;1, 2001 to April&nbsp;5, 2005 and each
agreement expires upon the later of 20&nbsp;years from its effective date or the expiry of the last
patent licensed thereunder, unless otherwise terminated.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Unless otherwise terminated, the Isis agreements for custirsen and OGX-427 will continue for each
product until the later of 10&nbsp;years after the date of the first commercial product sale, or the
expiration of the last to expire of any patents required to be licensed in order to use or sell the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">To facilitate the execution and performance of the Collaboration Agreement with Teva, we and Isis
agreed to amend the Isis License Agreement and we and UBC agreed to amend the UBC License
Agreement, in each case, effective December&nbsp;19 and December&nbsp;20, 2009, respectively.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The amendment to the Isis License Agreement provides, among other things, that if we are the
subject of a change of control with a third party, where the surviving company immediately
following such change of control has the right to develop and sell the product, then (i)&nbsp;a
milestone payment of $20&nbsp;million will be due and payable to Isis 21&nbsp;days following the first
commercial sale of the product in the United States; and (ii)&nbsp;unless such surviving entity had
previously sublicensed the product and a royalty rate payable to Isis by us has been established,
the applicable royalty rate payable to Isis will thereafter be the maximum amount payable under the
Isis License Agreement. Any non-royalty milestone amounts previously paid will be credited towards
the $20&nbsp;million milestone if not already paid. As a result of the $10&nbsp;million milestone payment
payable to Isis in relation to the Collaboration Agreement, the remaining amount owing in the event
of change of control discussed above is a maximum of $10&nbsp;million. As we have licensed the product
to Teva and established a royalty rate payable to Isis, no royalty rate adjustments would apply if
Teva acquires us and is the surviving company. If we have not spent the $30&nbsp;million in advanced
reimbursement of development activities prior to the third anniversary of the Collaboration
Agreement with Teva, we will pay Isis an amount equal to 30% of any un-spent portion less $3.5
million.

exclusive rights to develop two core compounds for all prophylactic and therapeutic uses in humans.
Additionally, Sonus was granted rights to all other non-core compounds covered under the patents
for use in oncology.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Under the terms of the agreement, Bayer received an upfront license fee of $450,000. We will make
annual payments to Bayer on the anniversary date, or Anniversary Payments, with an initial payment
of $100,000 paid in 2008. The payments increase by $25,000 each year until the initiation of the
first phase 3 clinical trial, at which point the Anniversary Payments reset to $100,000 each year
and increase by $25,000 until we achieve either the first NDA filing in the United States or the
European Union. Anniversary payments are included in R&#038;D expense. We are obligated to pay royalties
on net future product sales in addition to aggregate milestone payments of up to $14&nbsp;million for
clinical development and regulatory milestones. No milestone payments are triggered prior to the
initiation of a phase 3 clinical trial. We have the option to terminate this contract upon 60&nbsp;days&#146;

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
reported in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. Estimates and assumptions principally relate to the performance period of our
deliverables under our Collaboration Agreement with Teva, estimates of the fair value and
forfeiture rates of stock options issued to employees and consultants, the resolution of uncertain
tax positions and estimates of the fair value of our excess lease facility liability.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be

greater than three months and less than one year. We consider our short-term investments as
available-for-sale and they are carried at market value with unrealized gains and losses, if any,
reported as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, which is a separate component of
stockholders&#146; equity (deficiency). Realized gains and losses on the sale of these securities are
recognized in net income or loss. The cost of investments sold is based on the specific
identification method.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities is based on quoted market prices
and trade data for comparable securities. Other financial instruments including amounts receivable,
accounts payable and accrued liabilities, are carried at cost, which we believe approximates fair
value because of the short-term maturities of these instruments.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The costs of acquiring intellectual property rights to be used in the research and development
process, including licensing fees and milestone payments, are charged to research and development
expense as incurred in situations where we have not identified an alternative future use for the

quarter of 2009 pursuant to our Collaboration Agreement with Teva, as well as cash reimbursements
from Teva for certain costs incurred by us under the Clinical Development Plan. Under the
Collaboration Agreement, we and Teva share certain custirsen-related development costs. We are
required to spend $30&nbsp;million in direct and indirect development costs, such as full-time
equivalent, reimbursement for time incurred by our personnel for the benefit of the Clinical
Development Plan, such contribution to be funded by the upfront payment provided by Teva as an
advanced reimbursement for our R&#038;D expenses, or reimbursed to us on a cash basis. Teva will fund
all other expenses under the Clinical Development Plan. When we have fulfilled our requirement to
spend $30&nbsp;million in direct and indirect development costs, including full-time equivalents, Teva
will, on a quarterly basis, reimburse all development expenses incurred in accordance with the
Clinical Development Plan. Our policy is to account for these reimbursements as collaboration
revenue.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">For a description of the Collaboration Agreement, see Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The Collaboration Agreement contains multiple elements and deliverables, and requires evaluation
pursuant to ASC 605-25, <I>Multiple-Element Arrangements, </I>or ASC 605-25. We evaluated the facts and
circumstances of the Collaboration Agreement to determine whether we had obligations constituting
deliverables under ASC 605-25. We concluded that we had multiple deliverables under the
Collaboration Agreement, including deliverables relating to the grant of a technology license, and
performance of manufacturing, regulatory and clinical development services in the United States and
Canada, and estimated that the period in which we would perform those deliverables began in the
fourth quarter of 2009 and will be completed in the fourth quarter of 2012. Because we were able to
establish vendor specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of the fair value of the maintenance,
regulatory, and clinical services, we concluded that these deliverables should be accounted as
separate units of accounting under ASC 605-25. In establishing VSOE for the manufacturing,
regulatory and clinical development services, our management relied on rates charged by other
service providers providing similar development services.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We will recognize $30&nbsp;million allocated to the manufacturing, regulatory and clinical development
services element as revenue over the estimated performance period, using the proportional
performance model, of which $8.4&nbsp;million has been recognized to date. Estimation of the
performance period of our deliverables required management&#146;s judgment. Significant factors
considered in management&#146;s evaluation of the estimated performance period include, but are not
limited to, our experience, along with Teva&#146;s experience, in conducting clinical development
activities. We will review the estimated duration of our performance period on a quarterly basis
and make any appropriate adjustments on a prospective basis. Future changes in estimates of the
performance period may materially impact the timing of the future revenue recognized under the
Collaboration Agreement.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Because management is not able to reliably estimate the fair value of the technology license, it
used the residual value approach to determine the amount of revenue to recognize. Based on this
approach, we recognized $22&nbsp;million in 2009 relating to this element.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Under the Collaboration Agreement, we are entitled to receive up to $370&nbsp;million upon the
achievement of developmental and commercial milestones. Management evaluated the nature of the
events triggering these contingent payments and concluded that these events constituted substantive
milestones. This conclusion was based primarily on the facts that each triggering event represents
a specific outcome that can be achieved only through successful performance by us of one or more of
our deliverables, and that achievement of each triggering event was subject to inherent risk and
uncertainty and would result in additional payments becoming due to us. Management concluded that
each of these milestones was substantive, based primarily on the facts that the payments they
trigger are non-refundable, that achievement of the milestone entails risk and was not reasonably
assured at inception of the Collaboration Agreement, that substantial effort is required to
complete each milestone, that the amount of each milestone payment is reasonable in relation to the
value created in achieving the milestone, that a substantial amount of time is expected to pass
between the upfront payment and the potential milestone payments, and that the milestone payments,
once received, relate solely to past performance. Based on the foregoing, we will recognize any
revenue from these milestone payments under the substantive milestone method in the period in which
the underlying triggering event occurs.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Under the Collaboration Agreement, we are also entitled to receive percentage royalties on sales of
custirsen ranging from the mid-teens to the mid-twenties. We will recognize any revenue from these
events based on the revenue recognition criteria set forth in ASC 605, <I>Revenue Recognition</I>. Based
on those criteria, we consider these potential payments to be contingent revenue, and will
recognize them as revenue in the period in which the applicable contingency is resolved.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Effective August&nbsp;21, 2008, we changed our functional currency from the Canadian dollar to the U.S.
dollar. Our primary economic environment changed from Canada to the United States following the
acquisition of Sonus. See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere
in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details on the Arrangement. This resulted in
significant changes in economic facts and circumstances that indicated that the functional currency
had changed. We accounted for the change in functional currency prospectively.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our consolidated financial statements for the period of January&nbsp;1, 2008 to August&nbsp;20, 2008, which
are based on the Canadian functional currency, has been translated into the U.S. reporting currency
using the current rate method as required by ASC 830, <I>Foreign Currency Matters, </I>or ASC 830, as
follows: assets and liabilities using the rate of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date;
stockholders&#146; equity using the applicable historic rate; and revenue and expenses using the monthly
average rate of exchange. Translation adjustments have been included as part of the accumulated
other comprehensive income.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>Income Taxes</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Income taxes are accounted for under the liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the differences between the carrying values of assets and liabilities and their
respective income tax bases and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. A valuation
allowance is provided for the portion of deferred tax assets that is more likely than not to be
unrealized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>Scientific Research and Development Tax Credits</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The benefits of tax credits for scientific research and development expenditures are recognized in
the year the qualifying expenditure is made provided there is reasonable assurance of
recoverability. The tax credits recorded are based on management&#146;s estimates of amounts expected to
be recovered and are subject to audit by taxation authorities. The refundable tax credit reduces
the carrying cost of expenditures for research and development expenses to which it relates. The
non-refundable tax credit reduces the tax provision. Following the completion of the Arrangement,
all qualifying expenditures are eligible for non-refundable tax credits only. See Note 4 of Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on the Arrangement.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>Therapeutic Discovery Research Grants</I>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The Internal Revenue Service&#146;s therapeutic discovery tax credit program, created under the Patient
Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 provides tax credits or grants representing up to 50% of
eligible qualified investments in therapeutic discovery projects during tax years 2009 and 2010. We
applied for and received funds under this program to support our custirsen and OGX-427 development
projects. The benefits of research grants under the Internal Revenue Service&#146;s therapeutic
discovery tax credit program are recognized in the year the qualifying expenditure is approved,
provided that there is reasonable assurance of recoverability. The tax grants recorded are based on
management&#146;s estimates of amounts expected to be received and are subject to audit by taxation
authorities. The research grants reduce the carrying cost of expenditures for research and
development expenses to which it relates.

are included in prepaid expenses.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Clinical trial expenses are a component of R&#038;D expenses. These expenses include fees paid to
contract research organizations and investigators and other service providers, which conduct
certain product development activities on our behalf. We use an accrual basis of accounting, based
on estimates of the amount of service completed. In the event payments differ from the amount of
service completed, prepaid expense or accrued liabilities amounts are adjusted on the balance
sheet. These expenses are based on estimates of the work performed under service agreements,
milestones achieved, patient enrollment and experience with similar contracts. We monitor each of
these factors to the extent possible and adjusts estimates accordingly.

(loss). Other comprehensive income (loss)&nbsp;consists of translation adjustments from the application
of U.S. dollar reporting until August&nbsp;21, 2008 and unrealized gains and losses on our
available-for-sale marketable securities. We have reported the components of comprehensive loss in
the statement of stockholders&#146; equity.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Basic loss per common share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the period adjusted to reflect the equivalent OncoGenex Pharmaceuticals shares
and equity structure. Prior to the completion of the Arrangement on August&nbsp;21, 2008, the weighted
average number of common shares represents OncoGenex Technologies only. Diluted loss per common
share is computed in accordance with the treasury stock method, which uses the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding during the period. The effect of potentially issuable common
shares from outstanding stock options, convertible preferred shares, and debentures is
anti-dilutive for all periods presented.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>Warrants</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We account for warrants pursuant to the authoritative guidance on accounting for derivative
financial instruments indexed to, and potentially settled in, a company&#146;s own stock, on the
understanding that in compliance with applicable securities laws, the warrants require the issuance
of registered securities upon exercise and do not sufficiently preclude an implied right to net
cash settlement. We classify warrants on the consolidated balance sheet as a liability which is
revalued at each balance sheet date subsequent to the initial issuance. Determining the appropriate
fair-value model and calculating the fair value of registered warrants requires considerable
judgment, including estimating stock price volatility and expected warrant life. The computation of
expected volatility was based on the historical volatility of comparable companies from a
representative peer group selected based on
industry and market capitalization. A small change in the estimates used may have a relatively
large change in the estimated valuation. We use the Black-Scholes pricing model to value the
warrants. Changes in the fair market value of the warrants are reflected in the consolidated
statement of loss as gain (loss)&nbsp;on revaluation of warrants.

The expenses associated with adjustments to sublease income assumptions relating to our Bothell
facility were reclassified during the third quarter of 2010 from research and development expenses
to restructuring expenses. See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further
details on our lease arrangements. This reclassification on the statements of loss was made in all

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In January&nbsp;2010, the FASB issued amended guidance on fair value measurements and disclosures. The
new guidance requires additional disclosures regarding fair value measurements, amends disclosures
about postretirement benefit plan assets, and provides clarification regarding the level of
disaggregation of fair value disclosures by investment class. This guidance is effective for
interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2009, except for certain &#147;Level
3&#148; activity disclosure requirements that will be effective for reporting periods beginning after
December&nbsp;15, 2010. Accordingly, we adopted this amendment in the quarter ended March&nbsp;31, 2010,

Revenue Recognition &#151; Milestone Method (Topic 605): Milestone Method of Revenue Recognition. This
standard provides guidance on defining a milestone and determining when it may be appropriate to
apply the milestone method of revenue recognition for certain research and development
transactions. Under this new standard, a company can recognize as revenue consideration that is
contingent upon achievement of a milestone in the period in which it is achieved, only if the
milestone meets all criteria to be considered substantive. This standard will be effective for us
on a prospective basis for periods beginning after January&nbsp;1, 2011. We are currently evaluating the
potential impact of this standard.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair values and future cash flows of financial instruments
will fluctuate because of the changes in market interest rates. We invest our cash in a variety of
financial instruments, primarily in short-term bank deposits, money market funds, and domestic and
foreign commercial paper and government securities. These investments are denominated in U.S.
dollars, and our exposure to interest rate changes is monitored. We have very limited interest
rate risk due to the few assets or liabilities subject to fluctuations in interests rates. Our
investment portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to
help ensure portfolio liquidity. Due to the nature of our highly liquid marketable securities, a
change in interest rates would not materially change the fair market value.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B>Foreign Currency Exchange Risk</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We are exposed to risks associated with foreign currency transactions on certain contracts and
payroll expenses related to our Canadian subsidiary, OncoGenex Technologies, denominated in
Canadian dollars and we have not hedged these amounts. As our unhedged foreign currency
transactions fluctuate, our earnings might be negatively affected. Accordingly, changes in the
value of the U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar might have an adverse effect on our
reported results of operations and financial condition, and fluctuations in exchange rates might
harm our reported results and accounts from period to period. We have estimated the effect on our
reported results of operations of a hypothetical increase of 10&nbsp;percent in the exchange rate of the
Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar to be $350,000 for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010.

<DIV align="center" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B>REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of<BR>
<B>OncoGenex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.</B>

</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We have audited <B>OncoGenex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.&#146;s </B>(the &#147;Company&#148;) internal control over financial
reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control&#151;Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the
&#147;COSO&#148; criteria). The Company&#146;s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management&#146;s Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#146;s internal control
over financial reporting based on our audit.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk,
and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (3)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In our
opinion, <B>OncoGenex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.</B> maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2010, based on the COSO criteria.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December&nbsp;31, 2010 and
2009, and the related consolidated statements of loss, shareholders&#146; equity, and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 and our report dated March&nbsp;10, 2011
expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">OncoGenex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148; or &#147;OncoGenex&#148;) is committed to the development and
commercialization of new therapies that address treatment resistance in cancer patients. The
Company was incorporated in the state of Delaware and, together with its subsidiaries, has a
facility in Bothell, Washington and an office in Vancouver, British Columbia (Canada).
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009, the Company exited the development stage. Previously from
its inception, the Company was a development stage company in accordance with Accounting Standards
Codification, or ASC, 915, Accounting and Reporting by Development Stage Enterprises.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B>Basis of Presentation</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States. The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of OncoGenex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and our wholly owned subsidiaries, OncoGenex
Technologies and OncoGenex, Inc. OncoGenex, Inc. ceased operations in 2009 and was subsequently
dissolved. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The Company has historically experienced recurring losses from operations that have generated an
accumulated deficit of $66.1&nbsp;million through December&nbsp;31, 2010. At December&nbsp;31, 2010, the Company
had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $85.1&nbsp;million.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with United States generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. Actual results
could differ from those estimates. Estimates and assumptions principally relate to the performance
period of the Company&#146;s deliverables under its Collaboration and License Agreement, or
Collaboration Agreement, with Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., or Teva, estimates of the
initial fair value and forfeiture rates of stock options issued to employees and consultants, the
resolution of uncertain tax positions and estimates of the fair value of our excess lease facility
liability.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>Cash Equivalents</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or
less to be cash equivalents, which the Company considers as available for sale and are carried at
market value with unrealized gains and losses, if any, reported as accumulated other comprehensive
income or loss, which is a separate component of shareholders&#146; equity (deficiency).
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>Short-Term Investments</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Short-term investments consist of financial instruments purchased with an original maturity of
greater than three months and less than one year. The Company considers its short-term investments
as available-for-sale and they are carried at market value with unrealized gains and losses, if
any, reported as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, which is a separate component of shareholders&#146; equity (deficiency). Realized gains
and losses on the sale of these securities are recognized in net income or loss. The cost of
investments sold is based on the specific identification method.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>Fair value of financial instruments</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The fair value of the Company&#146;s cash equivalents and marketable securities is based on quoted
market prices and trade data for comparable securities. Other financial instruments including
amounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, are carried at cost, which the
Company believes approximates fair value because of the short-term maturities of these instruments.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>Intellectual Property</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The costs of acquiring intellectual property rights to be used in the research and development
process, including licensing fees and milestone payments, are charged to research and development
expense as incurred in situations where the Company has not identified an alternative future use
for the acquired rights, and are capitalized in situations where it has identified an alternative
future use. No costs associated with acquiring intellectual property rights have been capitalized
to date. Costs of maintaining intellectual property rights are expensed as incurred.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>Revenue Recognition</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Revenue recognized to date is attributable solely to the upfront payment the Company received in
the fourth quarter of 2009 pursuant to its Collaboration Agreement with Teva, as well as cash
reimbursements from Teva for certain costs incurred by OncoGenex under the Clinical Development
Plan we and Teva developed under which three phase 3 clinical trials will be initiated. Under the
Collaboration Agreement, the Company and Teva share certain custirsen-related development costs.
The Company is required to spend $30&nbsp;million in direct and indirect development costs such as
full-time equivalent (FTE)&nbsp;reimbursement for time incurred by OncoGenex personnel for the benefit
of the custirsen development plan, such contribution to be funded by the upfront payment provided
by Teva as an advanced reimbursement for the Company Development Expenses, or reimbursed to
OncoGenex on a cash basis. Teva will fund all other expenses under the Clinical Development Plan.
When the Company has fulfilled its requirement to spend $30&nbsp;million in direct and indirect
development costs, including FTEs, Teva will, on a quarterly basis, reimburse all development
expenses incurred in accordance with the Clinical Development Plan. The Company&#146;s policy is to
account for these reimbursements as Collaboration Revenue.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">For a description of the Collaboration Agreement, see note 4.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The Collaboration Agreement contains multiple elements and deliverables, and requires evaluation
pursuant to ASC 605-25, <I>Multiple-Element Arrangements</I>, or ASC 605-25. The Company evaluated the
facts and circumstances of the Collaboration Agreement to determine whether it had obligations
constituting deliverables under ASC 605-25. The Company concluded that it had multiple deliverables
under the Collaboration Agreement, including deliverables relating to the grant of a technology
license, and performance of manufacturing, regulatory and clinical development services in the U.S.
and Canada, and estimated that the period in which the Company would perform those deliverables
began in the fourth quarter of 2009 and will be completed in the fourth quarter of 2012. Because
the Company was able to establish vendor specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of the fair value of
the maintenance, regulatory, and clinical services, the Company concluded that these deliverables
should be accounted as separate units of accounting under ASC 605-25. In establishing VSOE for the
manufacturing, regulatory, and clinical development services, management relied on rates charged by
other service providers providing similar development services.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The Company will recognize $30&nbsp;million allocated to the manufacturing, regulatory and clinical
development services element as revenue over the estimated performance period, using the
proportional performance model. Estimation of the performance period of the Company&#146;s deliverables
required the use of management&#146;s judgement. Significant factors considered in management&#146;s
evaluation of the estimated performance period include, but are not limited to its experience,
along with Teva&#146;s experience, in conducting clinical development activities. The Company will
review the estimated duration of its performance period on a quarterly basis and make any
appropriate adjustments on a prospective basis. Future changes in estimates of the performance period may
materially impact the timing of the future revenue recognized under the Collaboration Agreement.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Because management is not able to reliably estimate the fair value of the technology license, it
used the residual value approach to determine the amount of revenue to recognize. Based on this
approach, the Company recognized $22&nbsp;million in 2009 relating to this element.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Under the Collaboration Agreement, the Company is entitled to receive up to $370&nbsp;million upon the
achievement of developmental and commercial milestones. Management evaluated the nature of the
events triggering these contingent payments and concluded that these events constituted substantive
milestones. This conclusion was based primarily on the facts that each triggering event represents
a specific outcome that can be achieved only through successful performance by the Company of one
or more of its deliverables, and that achievement of each triggering event was subject to inherent
risk and uncertainty and would result in additional payments becoming due to the Company.
Management concluded that each of these milestones was substantive, based primarily on the facts
that the payments they trigger are non-refundable, that achievement of the milestone entails risk
and was not reasonably assured at inception of the Collaboration Agreement, that substantial effort
is required to complete each milestone, that the amount of each milestone payment is reasonable in
relation to the value created in achieving the milestone, that a substantial amount of time is
expected to pass between the upfront payment and the potential milestone payments, and that the
milestone payments, once received, relate solely to past performance. Based on the foregoing, the
Company will recognize any revenue from these milestone payments under the substantive milestone
method in the period in which the underlying triggering event occurs.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Under the Collaboration Agreement, the Company is also entitled to receive percentage royalties on
sales of custirsen ranging from the mid-teens to the mid-twenties. The Company will recognize any
revenue from these events based on the revenue recognition criteria set forth in ASC 605, Revenue
Recognition. Based on those criteria, the Company considers these potential payments to be
contingent revenue, and will recognize them as revenue in the period in which the applicable
contingency is resolved.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Effective August&nbsp;21, 2008, the Company changed its functional currency from the Canadian dollar to
the U.S. dollar. The Company&#146;s primary economic environment changed from Canada to the United
States following the acquisition of Sonus (note 5). This resulted in significant changes in
economic facts and circumstances that indicated that the functional currency had changed. The
Company accounted for the change in functional currency prospectively.

Matters&#148;, or ASC 830, as follows: assets and liabilities using the rate of exchange prevailing at
the balance sheet date; shareholders&#146; equity using the applicable historic rate; and revenue and
expenses using the monthly average rate of exchange. Translation adjustments have been included as
part of the accumulated other comprehensive income.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Income taxes are accounted for under the liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the differences between the carrying values of assets and liabilities and their
respective income tax bases and for operating losses and tax credit carry forwards. A valuation
allowance is provided for the portion of deferred tax assets that is more likely than not to be
unrealized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>Scientific Research and Development Tax Credits</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The benefits of tax credits for scientific research and development expenditures are recognized in
the year the qualifying expenditure is made provided there is reasonable assurance of
recoverability. The tax credits recorded are based on management&#146;s estimates of amounts expected to
be recovered and are subject to audit by taxation authorities. The refundable tax credit reduces
the carrying cost of expenditures for research and development expenses to which it relates. The
non-refundable tax credit reduces the tax provision, however no reduction to the tax provision has
been recorded to date as the Company records a full valuation allowance. Following the completion
of the Arrangement (note 5) all qualifying expenditures are eligible for non-refundable tax credits
only.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>Therapeutic Discovery Research Grants</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The Internal Revenue Service&#146;s therapeutic discovery tax credit program, created under the Patient
Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, provides tax credits or grants representing up to 50
percent of eligible qualified investments in therapeutic discovery projects during tax years 2009
and 2010. OncoGenex applied for and received funds under this program to support the company&#146;s
custirsen, and OGX-427 development projects. The benefits of research grants under the Internal
Revenue Service&#146;s therapeutic discovery tax credit program are recognized in the year the
qualifying expenditure is approved provided there is reasonable assurance of recoverability. The
tax grants recorded are based on management&#146;s estimates of amounts expected to be received and are
subject to audit by taxation authorities. The research grants reduce the carrying cost of
expenditures for research and development expenses to which it relates.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Research and development costs are expensed as incurred, net of related refundable investment tax
credits, with the exception of non-refundable advanced payments for goods or services to be used in
future research and development, which are capitalized in accordance with ASC 730, &#147;Research and
Development&#148; and included within Other Assets.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Clinical trial expenses are a component of research and development costs. These expenses include
fees paid to contract research organizations and investigators and other service providers, which
conduct certain product development activities on our behalf. The Company uses an accrual basis of
accounting, based upon estimates of the amount of service completed. In the event payments differ
from the amount of service completed, prepaid expense or accrued liabilities amounts are adjusted
on the balance sheet. These expenses are based on estimates of the work performed under service
agreements, milestones achieved, patient enrollment and experience with similar contracts. The
Company monitors each of these factors to the extent possible and adjusts estimates accordingly.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Basic loss per common share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the period adjusted to reflect the equivalent OncoGenex Pharmaceuticals shares
and equity structure. Prior to the completion of the Arrangement on August&nbsp;21, 2008 the weighted
average number of common shares represents OncoGenex Technologies only. Diluted loss per common
share is computed in accordance with the treasury stock method which uses the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding during the period. The effect of potentially issuable common
shares from outstanding stock options, convertible preferred shares, and debentures is
anti-dilutive for all periods presented.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We account for warrants pursuant to the authoritative guidance on accounting for derivative
financial instruments indexed to, and potentially settled in, a company&#146;s own stock, on the
understanding that in compliance with applicable securities laws, the warrants require the issuance
of registered securities upon exercise and do not sufficiently preclude an implied right to net
cash settlement. We classify warrants on the consolidated balance sheet as a liability which is
revalued at each balance sheet date subsequent to the initial issuance. Determining the appropriate
fair-value model and calculating the fair value of registered warrants requires considerable
judgment, including estimating stock price volatility and expected warrant life. The computation of
expected volatility was based on the historical volatility of comparable companies from a
representative peer group selected based on industry and market capitalization. A small change in
the estimates used may have a relatively large change in the estimated valuation. We use the
Black-Scholes pricing model to value the warrants. Changes in the fair market value of the warrants
are reflected in the consolidated statement of loss as gain (loss)&nbsp;on revaluation of warrants.

The expenses associated with adjustments to sublease income assumptions relating to our Bothell
facility (note 8) were reclassified during the third quarter of 2010 from research and development
expenses to restructuring expenses. This reclassification on the statements of loss was made in all
prior periods presented for comparability purposes. This reclassification had no effect on net
loss, shareholders&#146; equity, total assets and total liabilities, or the major categories of the cash

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In January&nbsp;2010, the FASB issued amended guidance on fair value measurements and disclosures. The
new guidance requires additional disclosures regarding fair value measurements, amends disclosures
about postretirement benefit plan assets, and provides clarification regarding the level of
disaggregation of fair value disclosures by investment class. This guidance is effective for
interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2009, except for certain &#147;Level
3&#148; activity disclosure requirements that will be effective for reporting periods beginning after
December&nbsp;15, 2010. Accordingly, we adopted this amendment in the quarter ended March&nbsp;31, 2010,

milestone and determining when it may be appropriate to apply the milestone method of revenue
recognition for certain research and development transactions. Under this new standard, a company
can recognize as revenue consideration that is contingent upon achievement of a milestone in the
period in which it is achieved, only if the milestone meets all criteria to be considered
substantive. This standard will be effective for us on a prospective basis for periods beginning
after January&nbsp;1, 2011. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of this standard, but do
not expect it to have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations.

</DIV>

<!-- xbrl,body -->
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">For certain of the Company&#146;s financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents, amounts
receivable, and accounts payable carrying values approximate fair value due to their short-term
nature. The Company&#146;s cash equivalents and short-term investments are recorded at fair value.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Financial risk is the risk to the Company&#146;s results of operations that arises from fluctuations in
interest rates and foreign exchange rates and the degree of volatility of these rates as well as
credit risk associated with the financial stability of the issuers of the financial instruments.
Foreign exchange rate risk arises as a portion of the Company&#146;s investments which finance
operations and a portion of the Company&#146;s expenses are denominated in other than U.S. dollars.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The Company invests its excess cash in accordance with investment guidelines, which limit the
credit exposure to any one financial institution or corporation other than securities issued by the
U.S. government. The Company only invests in A (or equivalent) rated securities with maturities of
one year or less. These securities generally mature within one year or less and in some cases are
not collateralized. At December&nbsp;31, 2010 the average days to maturity of the Company&#146;s portfolio of
cash equivalents and marketable securities was 172&nbsp;days. The Company does not use derivative
instruments to hedge against any of these financial risks.

</DIV>

<!-- xbrl,body -->
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">On December&nbsp;20, 2009, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, OncoGenex Technologies
Inc., entered into a Collaboration Agreement with Teva for the development and global
commercialization of custirsen (and related compounds), a pharmaceutical compound designed to
inhibit the production of clusterin, a protein we believe associated with cancer treatment
resistance, or the Licensed Product. Under the Collaboration Agreement, Teva paid the Company
upfront payments in the aggregate amount of $50&nbsp;million and has agreed to pay up to $370&nbsp;million
upon the achievement of developmental and commercial milestones and royalties at percentage rates
ranging from the mid-teens to mid-twenties on net sales, depending on aggregate annual net sales of
the Licensed Product.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">On the same date, the Company and Teva also entered into a stock purchase agreement, or Stock
Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which Teva made an additional $10&nbsp;million equity investment in the
Company at a 20% premium to a thirty-day average closing price, resulting in 267,531 shares
purchased at a price of $37.38 per share. The 20% share premium is included as consideration for
the custirsen license and has been included in collaboration revenue.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In connection with the Collaboration Agreement and pursuant to the terms of agreements between the
Company and Isis relating to custirsen, the Company paid Isis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Isis, $10
million which was recorded as research and development expense in 2009. The Company also paid
approximately $333,333 to the University of British Columbia, or UBC, pursuant to the terms of
their license agreement relating to custirsen, which has been recorded as research and development
expense in 2009. Pursuant to the terms of the third-party agreements, the Company anticipates that
it would be required to pay third-parties 31% of any milestone payments that are not based on a
percentage of net sales of the Licensed Product. Pursuant to the terms of third-party agreements,
the Company anticipates it will pay royalties to third-parties of 4.88% to 8.00% of net sales,
unless the Company&#146;s royalties are adjusted for competition from generic compounds, in which case
royalties to third-parties will also be subject to adjustment on a country-by-country basis. Certain third-party royalties are tiered based on the
royalty rate received by the Company. Minimum royalty rates payable by the Company assume certain
third-party royalties are not paid at the time that the Licensed Product is marketed due to the
expiration of patents held by such third-parties. Maximum royalty rates assume all third-party
royalty rates currently in effect continue in effect at the time the Licensed Product is marketed.

expiration of the obligation of Teva to pay royalties on sales of the Licensed Product in such
country (or earlier termination under its terms). Commencing after the completion of all three
phase 3 clinical trials set forth in the Clinical Development Plan, or upon early termination due
to a material adverse change in the Company&#146;s patent rights related to custirsen or safety issues
or &#147;futility&#148; as defined in the Collaboration Agreement, Teva may terminate the Collaboration
Agreement in its sole discretion upon three months&#146; notice if notice is given prior to regulatory
approval of a Licensed Product and upon six months&#146; notice if notice is given after such regulatory
approval. If Teva terminates the Collaboration for any reasons other than an adverse change in
custirsen patent rights, safety issues or &#147;futility&#148; determination as previously described, it will
remain responsible for paying for any remaining costs of all three phase 3 clinical trials, except
for Company Development Expenses. Either party may terminate the Collaboration Agreement for an
uncured material breach by the other party or upon the bankruptcy of either party. If the
Collaboration Agreement is terminated by the Company for other than an uncured material breach by
Teva, the Company will pay Teva a royalty on sales of Licensed Products. The percentage rates of such

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Upon entering into the Collaboration Agreement, the Company assessed whether withholdings taxes
were owed to the Israeli Tax Authority, or ITA, resulting from the Collaboration Agreement. It was
the Company&#146;s position that withholdings taxes were not owed, and a claim was issued to the ITA
accordingly. For accounting purposes, management concluded that the withholdings tax claim was an
uncertain tax position, and $3&nbsp;million, which represented the potential withholdings tax
obligation, once received from Teva was initially recorded as Restricted Cash pending the Israeli
Tax Authorities review of our claim and a corresponding liability of $3&nbsp;million was included in
Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities. In June&nbsp;2010, the Company received approval from the ITA
for our request for a withholdings tax exemption on amounts received from Teva in relation to the
Collaboration Agreement. Following receipt of this approval from the ITA the $3&nbsp;million was
released to the Company from escrow. Subsequently, the Company released the $3&nbsp;million liability
and recorded a $3&nbsp;million income tax recovery in the second quarter of 2010.

custirsen phase 3 development plan under our Collaboration Agreement with Teva and custirsen
manufacturing costs incurred by OncoGenex in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 that are reimbursable

up-front payment was recorded in deferred collaboration revenue, and $0.6&nbsp;million was reimbursable

Agreement, in each case, effective December&nbsp;19 and December&nbsp;20, 2009, respectively.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The amendment to the Isis License Agreement provides, among other things, that if the Company is
the subject of a change of control with a third party, where the surviving company immediately
following such change of control has the right to develop and sell the product, then (i)&nbsp;a
milestone payment of $20&nbsp;million will be due and payable to Isis 21&nbsp;days following the first
commercial sale of the product in the United States; and (ii)&nbsp;unless such surviving entity had
previously sublicensed the product and a royalty rate payable to Isis by the Company has been
established, the applicable royalty rate payable to Isis will thereafter be the maximum amount
payable under the Isis License Agreement. Any non-royalty milestone amounts previously paid will be
credited toward the $20&nbsp;million milestone if not already paid. As a result of the $10&nbsp;million
milestone payment payable to Isis in relation to the Collaboration Agreement, the remaining amount
owing in the event of change of control discussed above is a maximum of $10&nbsp;million. As the Company
has now licensed the product to Teva and established a royalty rate payable to Isis, no royalty
rate adjustments would apply if Teva acquires the Company and is the surviving company. If the $30
million in advanced reimbursement of development activities has not been spent by OncoGenex prior
to the third anniversary of the Collaboration Agreement between OncoGenex and Teva, OncoGenex will
pay Isis an amount equal to 30% of any un-spent portion less $3.5&nbsp;million.

securities are valued by benchmarking model-derived prices to quoted market prices and trade data

the spread data does not reference the issuer, then data that reference a comparable issuer are
used. When observable price quotations are not available, fair value is determined based on cash
flow models with yield curves, bond or single name credit default swap spreads and recovery rates
based on collateral values as significant inputs. Corporate bonds and commercial paper are
generally categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy; in instances where prices, spreads or
any of the other aforementioned key inputs are unobservable, they are categorized in Level 3 of the

</DIV>

<!-- xbrl,body -->
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Prior to the Arrangement, Sonus entered into a non-cancellable lease arrangement for office space
located in Bothell, Washington, which was considered to be in excess of the Company&#146;s current
requirements. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating opportunities to exit or sublet
portions of the leased space and recorded an initial restructuring charge of $2,084,000 on August
21, 2008 as part of the purchase price allocation. The liability is computed as the present value
of the difference between the remaining lease payments due less the estimate of net sublease income
and expenses and has been accounted for in accordance with the then effective EITF No.&nbsp;95-3,
&#147;Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination&#148;. This represents
the Company&#146;s best estimate of the liability. Subsequent changes in the liability due to accretion,
or changes in estimates of sublease assumptions are recognized as adjustments to restructuring
charges in future periods.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In June&nbsp;2009, the Company revised its sublease income assumptions used to estimate the excess lease
facility liability. These assumptions were subsequently revised again in December&nbsp;2009 and
September&nbsp;2010. These changes in estimate resulted in increases in the value of the excess lease
liability of $494,000, $3,457,000, and $4,038,000 in expense recorded in June&nbsp;2009, December&nbsp;2009,
and September&nbsp;2010, respectively, to reflect these changes in estimate. In the year ended December
31, 2010, with respect to excess facilities, $1,216,000 was amortized into income through research
and development expense, resulting in a remaining liability of $7,467,000 at December&nbsp;31, 2010.

anniversary of the date of issuance at an exercise price of $20, and includes a cashless exercise
feature. The Company accounts for warrants issued in October&nbsp;2010 under the authoritative guidance
on accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to, and potentially settled in, a
company&#146;s own stock, on the understanding that in compliance with applicable securities laws, the
registered warrants require the issuance of registered securities upon exercise and do not
sufficiently preclude an implied right to net cash settlement. The Company classifies warrants on
the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as a liability which is revalued at each balance sheet
date subsequent to the initial issuance. The Company uses the Black-Scholes pricing model to value
the warrants. Determining the appropriate fair-value model and calculating the fair value of
registered warrants requires considerable judgment. On the date of issuance, the Black-Scholes
value of the warrant was based on an assumed risk-free rate of 1.17%, volatility of 75% and an
expected life of 5&nbsp;years. A small change in the estimates used may have a relatively large change
in the estimated valuation. Changes in the fair market value of the warrants are reflected in the
consolidated statement of loss as gain (loss)&nbsp;on warrant.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The net proceeds to OncoGenex, after underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering
expenses, from the sale of the units were $46.7&nbsp;million, of which $32.3&nbsp;million was allocated to
common shares and included in Additional paid-in capital, $15.4&nbsp;million was allocated to Warrant
liability. $1&nbsp;million of underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses
allocated to the value of Warrants was expensed in warrant issuance expense on our consolidated
statement of loss.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">At the 2010 Annual Meeting of Stockholders of the Company held on June&nbsp;8, 2010, stockholders of the
Company approved the 2010 Performance Incentive Plan. Following the approval of the 2010
Performance Incentive Plan, we are no longer able to issue additional equity awards under any of
our other equity compensation plans. Under the plan, the Company may grant options to purchase
common shares in the Company to employees, directors, officers and consultants of the Company. The
exercise price of the options is determined is determined by the Board but generally will be at
least equal to the fair value of the common shares at the grant date. The options vest in
accordance with terms as determined by the Board, typically over three to four years for options
issued to employees, and over one to three years for members of the Board of Directors. The expiry
date for each option is set by the Board with a maximum expiry date of ten years from the date of
grant.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Options remain outstanding under a number of share option plans that had been approved by
shareholders prior to the approval of the 2010 Performance Incentive Plan: (a)&nbsp;the Incentive Stock
Option, Nonqualified Stock Option and Restricted Stock Purchase Plan &#151; 1991 (1991 Plan), (b)&nbsp;the
1999 Nonqualified Stock Incentive Plan (1999 Plan), (c)&nbsp;the 2000 Stock Incentive Plan (2000 Plan),
(d)&nbsp;the 2007 Performance Incentive Plan (2007 Plan), and (e)&nbsp;the OncoGenex Technologies Inc. Stock
Option Plan (OncoGenex Technologies Plan).

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>ASC 718 Compensation &#151; Stock Compensation</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The Company recognizes expense related to the fair value of our stock-based compensation awards
using the provisions of ASC 718. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model as the
most appropriate fair value method for its awards and recognizes compensation expense for stock
options on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. In valuing its options using
the Black-Scholes option pricing model, the Company makes assumptions about risk-free interest
rates, dividend yields, volatility and weighted average expected lives, including estimated
forfeiture rates of the options.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The expected life was calculated based on the simplified method as permitted by the SEC&#146;s Staff
Accounting Bulletin 110, <I>Share-Based Payment</I>. The Company considers the use of the simplified
method appropriate because of the lack of sufficient historical exercise data following the reverse
takeover of Sonus. The computation of expected volatility was based on the historical volatility of
comparable companies from a representative peer group selected based on industry and market
capitalization. The risk-free interest rate was based on a U.S. Treasury instrument whose term is
consistent with the expected life of the stock options. In addition to the assumptions above, as
required under ASC 718, management made an estimate of expected forfeitures and is recognizing
compensation costs only for those equity awards expected to vest. Forfeiture rates are estimated
using historical actual forfeiture rate that resulted over the estimated life of the option grant
for options granted as of the beginning of the forfeiture measurement period. These rates are
adjusted on a quarterly basis and any change in compensation expense is recognized in the period of
the change. The Company has never paid or declared dividends on our common stock and do not expect
to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The estimated fair value of stock options granted in the respective periods was determined using
the Black-Scholes option pricing model using the following weighted average assumptions:

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Prior to January&nbsp;2009, the Company had an employee stock purchase plan whereby employees were
permitted to contribute up to 15% of their compensation to purchase shares of the Company&#146;s common
stock at 85% of the stock&#146;s share price at the lower of the beginning or end of each six-month
offering period. 222 shares purchased under the plan in 2008. The plan was terminated in January
2009 and no shares were purchased under the plan in 2009.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The Company has a Shareholder Rights Plan which was adopted in July&nbsp;1996 and subsequently amended
in July&nbsp;2002, October&nbsp;2005 and August&nbsp;2006 (the &#147;Rights Plan&#148;). Under the Plan the Company&#146;s Board
of Directors declared a dividend of one Preferred Stock Purchase Right (Right) for each outstanding
common share of the Company. Subject to the Rights Plan, each Right entitles the registered holder
to purchase from the Company one one-hundredth of a share of Series&nbsp;A Junior Participating
Preferred Stock at a exercise price of $140, subject to adjustment. These Rights provide the
holders with the right to purchase, in the event a person or group acquires 15% or more of the
Company&#146;s common stock, additional shares of the Company&#146;s common stock having a market value equal
to two times the exercise price of the Right. Pursuant to the Rights Plan, the one-for-eighteen
reverse stock split caused a proportionate adjustment of the number of Rights associated with each
share of common stock. Currently, eighteen (18)&nbsp;Rights are associated with each share of common
stock.

contributions. Following the Arrangement, the Board of Directors of OncoGenex amended and restated
the 401(k) plan whereas securities of the Company are no longer offered as an investment option.
This amendment prohibits the inclusion of OncoGenex shares in the 401(k) plan, as well as any match
of Company shares to employee contributions. No shares of the Company were issued subsequent to the
Arrangement, and as such no related expense was incurred.

achievement of developmental and commercial milestones and royalties at percentage rates ranging
from the mid-teens to mid-twenties on net sales. The Company is required to contribute $30&nbsp;million
in direct and indirect costs towards the Clinical Development Plan. $8.4&nbsp;million of these costs
have been incurred by OncoGenex in 2009 and 2010, resulting in a remaining funding responsibility
of $21.6&nbsp;million which has been recorded under Current and Long-term Deferred Collaboration
Revenue. Teva will fund all other expenses under the Clinical Development Plan.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement, OncoGenex and Teva agreed to collaborate in the
development and global commercialization of custirsen. Teva received the exclusive worldwide right
and license to develop and commercialize products containing custirsen and related compounds (the
&#147;Licensed Products&#148;). OncoGenex has an option to co-promote custirsen in the United States and
Canada.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In addition to the development costs noted above, Teva is also responsible for all costs relating
to product commercialization including costs incurred in relation to the Company&#146;s co-promotion
option, except for start-up costs in advance of commercialization.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>Isis Pharmaceuticals Inc. and University of British Columbia</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Pursuant to license agreements the Company has with the UBC and Isis, the Company is obligated to
pay milestone payments of up to CAD $1.6&nbsp;million and $7.75&nbsp;million, respectively, upon the
achievement of specified product development milestones related to OGX-427 and OGX-225 and
royalties on future product sales.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In addition, we are required to pay to Isis 30% of all Non-Royalty Revenue we receive. Isis has
disclosed in its SEC filings that it is entitled to receive 30% of the up to $370&nbsp;million in
milestone payments we may receive from Teva as part of the Collaboration Agreement; however, we
believe that certain of the milestone payments related to sales targets may qualify as Royalty
Revenue, and therefore be subject to the lesser payment obligations. No assurance can be provided
that we will be entitled to receive these milestone payments or, if we are, that the applicable
amount payable to Isis will be less than 30%. We are also obligated to pay to UBC certain patent
costs and annual license maintenance fees for the extent of the patent life of CAD $8,000 per year.
We paid Isis and UBC $750,000 and CAD 100,000, respectively, in 2010 upon the initiation of a phase
2 clinical trial of OGX-427 in patients with CRPC. We do not anticipate making any royalty payments
to Isis in 2011.

patent licensed thereunder, unless otherwise terminated.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Unless otherwise terminated, the Isis agreements for custirsen and OGX-427 will continue for each
product until the later of 10&nbsp;years after the date of the first commercial product sale, or the
expiration of the last to expire of any patents required to be licensed in order to use or sell the
product, unless OncoGenex Technologies abandons either custirsen or OGX-427 and Isis does not elect
to unilaterally continue development. The Isis agreement for OGX-225 will continue into perpetuity
unless OncoGenex Technologies abandons the product and Isis does not elect to unilaterally continue
development.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">To facilitate the execution and performance of the Collaboration Agreement with Teva, OncoGenex and
Isis agreed to amend the Isis License Agreement and the Company and UBC agreed to amend the UBC
License Agreement, in each case, effective December&nbsp;19 and December&nbsp;20, 2009, respectively.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The amendment to the Isis License Agreement provides, among other things, that if the Company is
the subject of a change of control with a third party, where the surviving company immediately
following such change of control has the right to develop and sell the product, then (i)&nbsp;a
milestone payment of $20&nbsp;million will be due and payable to Isis 21&nbsp;days following the first
commercial sale of the product in the United States; and (ii)&nbsp;unless such surviving entity had
previously sublicensed the product and a royalty rate payable to Isis by the Company has been
established, the applicable royalty rate payable to Isis will thereafter be the maximum amount
payable under the Isis License Agreement. Any non-royalty milestone amounts previously paid will be
credited toward the $20&nbsp;million milestone if not already paid. As a result of the $10&nbsp;million
milestone payment payable to Isis in relation to the Collaboration Agreement, the remaining amount
owing in the event of change of control discussed above is a maximum of $10&nbsp;million. As the Company
has now licensed the product to Teva and established a royalty rate payable to Isis, no royalty
rate adjustments would apply if Teva acquires the Company and is the surviving company. If the $30
million in advanced reimbursement of development activities has not been spent by OncoGenex prior
to the third anniversary of the Collaboration Agreement between OncoGenex and Teva, OncoGenex will
pay Isis an amount equal to 30% of any un-spent portion less $3.5&nbsp;million.

for the right to develop, commercialize or sublicense a family of compounds known as caspase
activators presently in pre-clinical research. Under terms of the agreement, Sonus was granted
exclusive rights to develop two core compounds for all prophylactic and therapeutic uses in humans.
Additionally, Sonus was granted rights to all other non-core compounds covered under the patents
for use in oncology.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Under the terms of the agreement, Bayer received an upfront license fee of $450,000. OncoGenex will
make annual payments to Bayer on the anniversary date (Anniversary Payments), with an initial
payment of $100,000 paid in 2008. The payments increase by $25,000 each year until the initiation
of the first phase 3 clinical trial, at which point the Anniversary Payments reset to $100,000 each
year and increase by $25,000 until the Company achieves either the first New Drug Application
filing in the United States or the European Union. OncoGenex is obligated to pay royalties on net
future product sales in addition to aggregate milestone payments of up to $14,000,000 for clinical
development and regulatory milestones. No milestone payments are triggered prior to the initiation
of a phase 3 clinical trial. OncoGenex has the option to terminate this contract upon 60&nbsp;days
written notice to Bayer.

</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that material
information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports filed or submitted under the Exchange
Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC&#146;s
rules and forms. Our disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is
accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management,
including the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer, of the effectiveness
of the design and operation of the disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive
officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were
effective as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We have not made any changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 that
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over
financial reporting.
</DIV>


<DIV align="center" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B>Management&#146;s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our
financial reporting, as defined in Rule&nbsp;13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of our principal executive and
principal financial officers to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external reporting purposes in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">As of December&nbsp;31, 2010, management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting based on the framework established in &#147;Internal Control&#151;Integrated Framework&#148;
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on
this evaluation, management has determined that our internal control over financial reporting was
effective as of December&nbsp;31, 2010.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
</DIV>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2010 has been
audited by Ernst &#038; Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their
report which is included above.
