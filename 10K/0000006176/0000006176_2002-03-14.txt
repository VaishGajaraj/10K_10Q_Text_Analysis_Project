                                    PART I

ITEM 1 - BUSINESS

(a)  GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS

     Ampco-Pittsburgh Corporation (the "Corporation") was incorporated in
Pennsylvania in 1929.

     The Corporation classifies it's businesses in three segments - Forged and
Cast Rolls, Air and Liquid Processing, and Plastics Processing Machinery.

     In 2001, following a review of its global roll making facilities, the
Corporation permanently closed the forged steel roll finishing plant in Belgium.
However, the European sales and engineering group remains headquartered in that
country.

     The Registrant, individually or together with its consolidated
subsidiaries, is also referred to herein as the Corporation.

(b)  FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT SEGMENTS

     The sales and operating profit of the Corporation's three segments and the
identifiable assets attributable to each segment for the three years ended
December 31, 2001 are set forth in Note 16 (Business Segments) on page 19 of the
Annual Report to Shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2001, which is
incorporated herein by reference.

(c)  NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

     Forged and Cast Rolls Segment
     -----------------------------

     Union Electric Steel Corporation produces forged hardened steel rolls for

                                       2
<PAGE>

producers of steel, aluminum and other metals throughout the world.  It is
headquartered in Carnegie, Pennsylvania with three manufacturing facilities in
Pennsylvania and one in Indiana.  Union Electric Steel Corporation is considered
one of the largest producers of forged hardened steel rolls in the world.  In
addition to several domestic competitors, several major European and Japanese
manufacturers also compete in both the domestic and foreign markets.

     The Davy Roll Company Limited produces cast rolls for hot and cold strip
mills, medium/heavy section mills and plate mills in a variety of iron and steel
qualities. It is located in Gateshead, England and is a major European supplier
of cast rolls to the metal working industry worldwide. It primarily competes
with one British company and several European and American companies in both the
domestic and foreign markets.

     Formet Limited custom forges special stock alloys principally used in the
oil and gas, petrochemical, marine and general engineering industries.  It is
located in New Castle, England and competes with several other companies.

     Air and Liquid Processing Segment
     ---------------------------------

     Aerofin Corporation produces finned tube and plate finned heat exchange
coils for the commercial and industrial construction, process and utility
industries and is headquartered in Lynchburg, Virginia.

     Buffalo Air Handling Company produces large standard and custom air
handling systems used in commercial and industrial buildings and is
headquartered in Amherst, Virginia.

     Buffalo Pumps, Inc. manufactures a line of centrifugal pumps for the
refrigeration,

                                       3
<PAGE>

power generation and marine defense industries and is headquartered in North
Tonawanda, New York.

     All three of the companies in this segment compete with several major
competitors.

     Plastics Processing Machinery Segment
     -------------------------------------

     New Castle Industries, Inc. and its subsidiaries primarily produce feed
screws, barrels and chill rolls for use principally in the plastics processing
industry and is headquartered in New Castle, Pennsylvania. The New Castle
Industries group competes with a number of small regional companies.

     F. R. Gross Company, located in Stow, Ohio, manufactures heat transfer
rolls and chill rolls for use by original equipment machinery manufacturers and
processors principally serving the plastics industry but also the paper,
packaging, printing and converting industries. Keystone Rolls Company
manufactures heat transfer rolls for the sheet, film, paper coating and textile
industries. Both of these companies compete with a number of small regional
companies.

     In all three segments, the products are dependent on engineering,
principally custom designed and are sold to sophisticated commercial and
industrial users in the United States and countries outside of the United
States.

     No one customer's purchases in any segment were material to the
Corporation.  Contracts that may be subject to renegotiation or termination are
not material to the Corporation.  The Corporation's businesses are not seasonal
but are subject to the cyclical nature of the industries and markets served.

     For additional information on the products produced and financial
information

                                       4
<PAGE>

about each segment, see page 4 and Note 16 (Business Segments) on page 19 of the
Annual Report to Shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2001, which are
incorporated herein by reference.

Raw Materials
-------------

     Raw materials used in all segments are generally available from many
sources and the Corporation is not dependent upon any single supplier for any
raw material.  Certain of the raw materials used by the Corporation have
historically been subject to variations in price.  The Corporation generally
does not purchase or arrange for the purchase of a major portion of raw
materials significantly in advance of the time it requires them.

Patents
-------

     While the Corporation holds some patents, trademarks and licenses, in the
opinion of management, they are not material to any segment of the Corporation's
business other than in protecting the goodwill associated with the names under
which products are sold.

Working Capital
---------------

     Each of the Corporation's businesses maintains levels of inventory, which
generally reflect normal requirements and are believed to reflect the practices
of its industries.  Production in all segments is generally to custom order and
requires inventory levels of raw materials or semi-finished products with only a
limited level of finished products.  The Corporation extends credit terms
consistent with practices of the industries served.

Backlog
-------

     The backlog of orders at December 31, 2001 was approximately $107,608,000
compared to a backlog of $115,552,000 at year-end 2000.  Most of those orders
are

                                       5
<PAGE>

expected to be filled in 2002.

Competition
-----------

      The Corporation faces considerable competition from a large number of
companies in each segment. The Corporation believes, however, that it is a
significant factor in each of the principal markets which it serves. Competition
in all segments is based on quality, service, price and delivery.

Research and Development
------------------------

      As part of an overall strategy to develop new markets and maintain
leadership in each of the industry niches served, each of the Corporation's
businesses in all three segments incur expenditures for research and
development. The activities that are undertaken are designed to develop new
products, improve existing products and processes, enhance product quality,
adapt products to specific customer requirements and reduce costs. In the
aggregate, these expenditures approximate $1,000,000 per year.

Environmental Protection Compliance Costs
-----------------------------------------

      Expenditures for environmental control matters were not material to any
segment in 2001 and such expenditures are not expected to be material in 2002.

Employees
---------

      In December 2001, the Corporation had 1,618 active employees.

      (d)  FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT GEOGRAPHIC AREAS

      The Corporation had, until mid 2001, manufacturing operations in Belgium
and the United Kingdom.  However, the Belgium roll finishing plant was
permanently closed in May, 2001, leaving only a European sales and engineering
support group in that country.

________________
*     Facility is leased.
**    Available for sale

      The Corporate office space is leased as are several small sales offices.
All of the owned facilities are adequate and suitable for their respective
purposes.

      The Corporation estimates that all of its facilities were operated within
65% to 95% of their normal capacity during 2001. Normal capacity is defined as
capacity under approximately normal conditions with allowances made for
unavoidable interruptions, such as lost time for repairs, maintenance,
breakdowns, set-up, failure, supply delays, labor shortages and absences,
Sundays, holidays, vacation, inventory taking, etc. The number of work shifts is
also taken into consideration.

ITEM 3 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

      The Corporation has been involved in various claims and lawsuits
incidental to its

                                       9
<PAGE>

business, including alleged exposure to asbestos containing components in
certain products. In the opinion of management, the Corporation has appropriate
insurance coverage and/or meritorious defenses in those cases and believes that,
in the aggregate, any liability will not have a material effect on the financial
position of the Corporation.

      The Corporation is currently performing remedial activities in connection
with real estate previously owned or operated by certain discontinued
operations. In addition, the Corporation has been designated as a Potentially
Responsible Party ("PRP") at a third party landfill site used by a former
operation. However, the Corporation believes that based on information known to
date for all environmental matters considered in the aggregate, the liability to
the Corporation would not be material.

ITEM 4 - SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

      No matter was submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth
quarter.

(b)  COMPENSATION PURSUANT TO PLANS

     Stock Option Plan

     The Corporation's 1997 Stock Option Plan, as amended, permits the grant of
options exercisable for shares of Common Stock to corporate officers and other
key employees of the Corporation and its subsidiaries upon such terms, including
exercise price and conditions and timing of exercise, as may be determined by
the Stock Option Committee. The Stock Option Plan authorizes the grants of
awards up to a maximum of 600,000 shares of the Corporation's Common Stock,
however, the maximum number of Shares with respect to which stock options may be
granted to any one Participant in any fiscal year may not exceed 150,000. No
options were granted in 2001.

     Pension Benefits

     The Corporation has a tax qualified retirement plan (the "Plan") applicable
to the Executive Officers and other employees, to which the Corporation makes
annual contributions, as required, in amounts determined by the Plan's
actuaries. The Plan does not have an offset for Social Security and is fully
paid for by the Corporation. Under the Plan, employees become fully vested after
five years of participation and normal retirement age under the Plan is age 65
but actuarially reduced benefits may be available for early retirement at age
55. The primary benefit formula is 1.1% of the highest consecutive five year
average earnings in the final ten years, times years of service. Federal law
requires that 5% owners start receiving a pension no later than April 1
following the calendar year in which the age 70-1/2 is reached. Louis Berkman is
currently receiving $6,164 a month pursuant to the Plan. As an active employee,
Mr. Berkman continues to receive credit for

                                       17
<PAGE>

additional service rendered after age 70-1/2.

     The Corporation adopted a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) in
1988 (amended and restated in 1996) for certain officers and key employees
covering retirement after completion of ten years of service and attainment of
age 55. All officers listed in the compensation table are Participants in the
SERP, except Louis Berkman. The combined retirement benefit at age 65 or older
provided by the Plan and the SERP is 50% of the highest consecutive five year
average earnings in the final ten years of service. The participants are
eligible for reduced benefits for early retirement at age 55. A benefit equal to
50% of the benefit otherwise payable at age 65 is paid to the surviving spouse
of any participant, who has had at least five years of service, commencing on
the later of the month following the participant's death or the month the
participant would have reached age 55. In addition, there is an offset for
pensions from other companies. Certain provisions, applicable if there is a
change of control, are discussed below under Termination of Employment and
Change of Control Arrangement.

     The following shows the estimated annual pension that would be payable,
without offset, under the Plan and the SERP, if applicable, to the individuals
named in the compensation table assuming continued employment to retirement at
age 65 or older, and assuming the compensation stated in the table is the final
five year average:

           Louis Berkman                       (1)
           Robert A. Paul                $200,000
           Ernest G. Siddons             $180,000
           Terrence W. Kenny             $ 89,250
           Robert F. Schultz             $ 76,500

<PAGE>

(1) Mr. Berkman is currently receiving a pension pursuant to the Plan as
    described above.

     (c) COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS

     In 2001, each Director who was not employed by the Corporation received an
annual retainer of $6,000 (payable quarterly), $1,000 for each Board meeting
attended and $500 for each Committee meeting attended. Attendance can be either
in person or by telephonic connection. Directors do not receive a fee for either
Board or Committee meetings if they do not attend.

     (d) TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT AND CHANGE OF CONTROL ARRANGEMENTS

     Mr. Berkman, Mr. Paul and Mr. Siddons have two year contracts (which
automatically renew for one year periods unless the Corporation chooses not to
extend) providing for compensation equal to five times their annual compensation
(with a provision to gross up to cover the cost of any federal excise tax on the
benefits) in the event their employment is terminated following a change of
control (including a voluntary departure for good cause) and the right to
equivalent office space and secretarial help for a period of one year after a
change in control. Mr. Schultz, Mr. Kenny, the two remaining Vice Presidents and
one other employee have two year contracts providing for three times their
annual compensation in the event their employment is terminated following a
change in control (including a voluntary departure for good cause). All of the
contracts provide for the continuation of employee benefits, for three years for
the three senior executives and two years for the others, and the right to
purchase the leased car used by the covered individual at the Corporation's then
book value. The same provisions concerning change

                                       19
<PAGE>

in control that apply to the contracts apply to the SERP and vest the right to
that pension arrangement. A change of control triggers the right to a lump sum
payment equal to the present value of the vested benefit under the SERP if
applicable.

     (e)  SALARY COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION IN COMPENSATION
          DECISIONS

     A Salary Committee is appointed each year by the Board of Directors. The
Salary Committee for the year 2001 was comprised of three Directors: William D.
Eberle (Chairman), Leonard M. Carroll and Carl H. Pforzheimer, III. None of the
Committee members is now, or ever has been, an officer or employee of the
Corporation.

     (f)  SALARY COMMITTEE REPORT ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

     The Salary Committee approves salaries for executive officers within a
range from $150,000 up to $200,000 and increases in the salary of any executive
officer, which would result in such officer earning a salary within such range.
Salaries of $200,000 per year and above must be approved by the Board of
Directors, after a recommendation by the Salary Committee. Salaries for
executive officers below the level of $150,000 are set by the Chairman,
President and Executive Vice President of the Corporation.

     The compensation reported for the last completed fiscal year for the Chief
Executive Officer of the Corporation, as well as the other applicable executive
officers, was based on an analysis conducted by the Salary Committee. The
Committee does not specifically link remuneration solely to quantitative
measures of performance because of the cyclical nature of the industries and
markets served by the Corporation. In setting compensation, the

                                       20
<PAGE>

Committee also considers various qualitative factors, including competitive
compensation arrangements of other companies within relevant industries,
individual contributions, leadership ability and an executive officer's overall
performance.   In this way, it is believed that the Corporation will attract and
retain quality management, thereby benefiting the long-term interest of
shareholders.

     The Salary Committee had previously approved an incentive program for 2001
covering Louis Berkman, Robert A. Paul and Ernest G. Siddons.  Incentive
payments were to be determined, based exclusively on the Corporation's 2001
income from operations performance as compared to the Corporation's business
plan.   These payments were to be limited to 30% of base salary of participants.
In 2001, no incentive payments were earned by the participants.

     This report of the Salary Committee shall not be deemed incorporated by
reference by any general statement incorporating by reference this 10-K report
into any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, except to the extent that the Corporation specifically
incorporates this report and the information contained herein by reference, and
shall not otherwise be deemed filed under such Acts.

by subsidiaries of the Corporation made it difficult to match to any one
product-based peer group.  The Steel Industry was chosen because it is impacted
by some of the same end markets that the Corporation ultimately serves, such as
the automotive, appliance and construction industries.  Historical stock price
