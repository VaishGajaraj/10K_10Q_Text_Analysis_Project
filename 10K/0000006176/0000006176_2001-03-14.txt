                                    PART I

ITEM 1 - BUSINESS

        (a)  GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS

        Ampco-Pittsburgh Corporation (the "Corporation") was incorporated in
Pennsylvania in 1929.

        In 2000, a subsidiary of the Corporation acquired the stock of The
Keystone Roll Company, a small, modern machining, welding and fabricating
company, which manufactures heat transfer rolls. The Corporation believes that
this acquisition will complement the existing plastics processing machinery
segment.

        The Corporation's businesses are classified in three segments - Forged
and Cast Rolls, Air and Liquid Processing, and Plastics Processing Machinery.

        The Registrant, individually or together with its consolidated
subsidiaries, is also referred to herein as the Corporation.

        (b)  FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT SEGMENTS

        The sales and operating profit of the Corporation's three segments and
the identifiable assets attributable to each segment for the three years ended
December 31, 2000 are set forth in Note 15 (Business Segments) on page 21 of the
Annual Report to Shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2000, which is
incorporated herein by reference.

        (c)  NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

Forged and Cast Rolls Segment
-----------------------------

        Union Electric Steel Corporation produces forged hardened steel rolls
for the producers of steel, aluminum and other metals throughout the world. It
is headquartered in Carnegie, Pennsylvania with manufacturing facilities in
Carnegie, Burgettstown and Erie, Pennsylvania; Valparaiso, Indiana; and
Tessenderlo, Belgium. Union Electric Steel Corporation is considered one of the
largest producers of forged hardened steel rolls in the United States. In
addition to several domestic competitors, several major European and Japanese
manufacturers also compete in both the domestic and foreign markets.

        The Davy Roll Company Limited produces cast rolls for hot and cold strip
mills, medium/heavy section mills and plate mills in a variety of iron and steel
qualities. It is located in Gateshead, England and is a major European supplier
of cast rolls to the metal working industry worldwide. It primarily competes
with one British company and several European and American companies in both the
domestic and foreign markets.

        Formet Limited custom forges special stock alloys principally used in
the oil and gas, petrochemical, marine and general engineering industries. It is
located in New Castle, England and competes with several other companies.

        Turner Chilled Rolls Limited is located in Ipswich, England and
manufactures high quality cast rolls used by the food and animal feed processing
industries. It also competes with several other companies.

                                       3
<PAGE>

Air and Liquid Processing Segment
---------------------------------

        Aerofin Corporation produces finned tube and plate finned heat exchange
coils for the commercial and industrial construction, process and utility
industries and is headquartered in Lynchburg, Virginia.

        Buffalo Air Handling Company produces large standard and custom air
handling systems used in commercial and industrial buildings and is
headquartered in Amherst, Virginia.

        Buffalo Pumps, Inc. manufactures a line of centrifugal pumps for the
refrigeration, power generation and marine defense industries and is
headquartered in North Tonawanda, New York.

        All three of the companies in this segment compete with several major
competitors.

Plastics Processing Machinery Segment
-------------------------------------

        New Castle Industries, Inc. and its subsidiaries primarily produce feed
screws, barrels and chill rolls for use principally in the plastics processing
industry and is headquartered in New Castle, Pennsylvania. The New Castle
Industries group competes with a number of small regional companies.

        F. R. Gross Company, located in Stow, Ohio, manufactures heat transfer
rolls and chill rolls for use by original equipment machinery manufacturers and
processors principally serving the plastics industry but also the paper,
packaging, printing and converting industries. Keystone Rolls Company
manufactures heat transfer rolls for the sheet, film, paper coating and textile
industries. Both of these companies compete with a number of small regional
companies.

                                       4
<PAGE>

        In all three segments, the products are dependent on engineering,
principally custom designed and are sold to sophisticated commercial and
industrial users in the United States and countries outside of the United
States.

        No one customer's purchases in any segment were material to the
Corporation. Contracts that may be subject to renegotiation or termination are
not material to the Corporation. The Corporation's businesses are not seasonal
but are subject to the cyclical nature of the industries and markets served.

        For additional information on the products produced and financial
information about each segment, see pages 2 through 6 and Note 15 (Business
Segments) on page 21 of the Annual Report to Shareholders for the year ended
December 31, 2000, which are incorporated herein by reference.

Raw Materials
-------------

        Raw materials used in all segments are generally available from many
sources and the Corporation is not dependent upon any single supplier for any
raw material. Certain of the raw materials used by the Corporation have
historically been subject to variations in price. The Corporation generally does
not purchase or arrange for the purchase of a major portion of raw materials
significantly in advance of the time it requires them.

Patents
-------

        While the Corporation holds some patents, trademarks and licenses, in
the opinion of management, they are not material to any segment of the
Corporation's business other than in protecting the goodwill associated with the
names under which products are sold.

Working Capital
---------------

        Each segment of the Corporation's business maintains levels of
inventory, which

                                       5
<PAGE>

generally reflect normal requirements and are believed to reflect the practices
of its industries. Production in all segments is generally to custom order and
requires inventory levels of raw materials or semi-finished products with only a
limited level of finished products. The Corporation extends credit terms
consistent with practices of the industries served.

Backlog
-------

        The backlog of orders at December 31, 2000 was approximately
$115,552,000 compared to a backlog of $119,491,000 at year-end 1999. Most of
those orders are expected to be filled in 2001.

Competition
-----------

        The Corporation faces considerable competition from a large number of
companies in each segment. The Corporation believes, however, that it is a
significant factor in each of the principal markets which it serves. Competition
in all segments is based on quality, service, price and delivery.

Research and Development
------------------------

        As part of an overall strategy to develop new markets and maintain
leadership in each of the industry niches served, each of the Corporation's
businesses in all three segments incur expenditures for research and
development. The activities that are undertaken are designed to develop new
products, improve existing products and processes, enhance product quality,
adapt products to specific customer requirements and reduce costs. In the
aggregate, these expenditures approximate $1,500,000 per year.

Environmental Protection Compliance Costs
-----------------------------------------

        Expenditures for environmental control matters were not material to any
segment in

                                       6
<PAGE>

2000 and such expenditures are not expected to be material in 2001.

Employees
----------

        In December 2000, the Corporation had 1,817 active employees.

        (d)  FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT GEOGRAPHIC AREAS

        The Corporation has foreign operations in Belgium and the United
Kingdom. For financial information relating to foreign and domestic operations
see Note 15 (Business Segments) on page 21 of the Annual Report to Shareholders
for the year ended December 31, 2000, which is incorporated herein by reference.

*      Facility is leased.

      The Corporate office space is leased as are several small sales offices.
All of the owned facilities are adequate and suitable for their respective
purposes.

      The Corporation estimates that all of its facilities were operated within
75% to 95% of their normal capacity during 2000. Normal capacity is defined as
capacity under approximately normal conditions with allowances made for
unavoidable interruptions, such as lost time for repairs, maintenance,
breakdowns, set-up, failure, supply delays, labor shortages and absences,
Sundays, holidays, vacation, inventory taking, etc. The number of work shifts
are also taken into consideration.

ITEM 3 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

        The Corporation has been involved in various claims and lawsuits
incidental to its business. In the opinion of management, the Corporation has
meritorious defenses in those cases and believes that, in the aggregate, any
liability will not have a material effect on the financial position of the
Corporation.

        A lawsuit was commenced in May, 1991 against the Corporation and its
subsidiary, Vulcan, Inc. ("Vulcan"), arising out of the filing of a petition
under Chapter 11 of the

                                       10
<PAGE>

United States Bankruptcy Code in October, 1990 by Valley-Vulcan Mold Company
(the "Partnership"), a 50/50 partnership formed in September, 1987 between
Vulcan and Valley Mould Corporation, a subsidiary of Microdot, Inc. Microdot and
Valley are unrelated to the Corporation and were also defendants in the lawsuit.
The Partnership acquired the ingot mold businesses of each of the partners. On
June 10, 1993, Microdot also filed a Petition under Chapter 11 of the United
States Bankruptcy Code. In October 1994, Microdot's Chapter 11 case was
converted to a Chapter 7 liquidation.

        In the lawsuit, Official Unsecured Creditors' Committee of Valley-Vulcan
                        --------------------------------------------------------
Mold Company v. Microdot, Inc., Valley Mould Corporation, Ampco-Pittsburgh
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Corporation and Vulcan, Inc., the plaintiff, allegedly on behalf of the debtor
----------------------------
Partnership, filed a proceeding in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the
Northern District of Ohio against Microdot, Valley, Vulcan and the Corporation,
seeking to set aside the Corporation's liens on the Partnership's assets, to
hold all defendants liable for the debts of the Partnership, and return of all
money received by any of the defendants from the Partnership and out of the
proceeds of a loan to the Partnership by a third-party lender, alleged to be at
least $9.35 million. The Corporation's liens secure a guaranty that it was
required to give with respect to a Vulcan obligation that was assumed by the
Partnership, and a $500,000 loan made to the Partnership.

        The trial of this lawsuit was held the week of October 4, 1993. In April
1994, the Court issued a judgment in favor of the Corporation. Under the Court's
decision, all claims against the Corporation were denied. All claims against
Vulcan were also denied except for its liability as a general partner. Vulcan's
only asset is its interest in the partnership, which has no value and
accordingly the judgment will not have any adverse effect on the

                                       11

Corporation. In May 1994, plaintiff appealed to the United States District
Court, Northern District of Ohio, Eastern Division. In 1998, upon stipulation of
the parties, the Court ordered this appeal transferred to the Bankruptcy
Appellate Panel for the Sixth Circuit ("BAP"). In August 1999, the BAP affirmed
all of the trial court's rulings and the plaintiff/appellant appealed this
decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit ("Court of
Appeals"). In February 2001 the Court of Appeals also affirmed the judgment
issued by the trial court.

        The Corporation is currently performing remedial activities in
connection with the sale of real estate owned or used by discontinued
operations. In addition, the Corporation has been designated as a Potentially
Responsible Party ("PRP") at a third party landfill site used by a former
operation. However, the Corporation believes that based on information known to
date for all environmental matters considered in the aggregate, the liability to
the Corporation would not be material.

Footnotes to Option Grants in 2000 Table:

(1)  Option grants for Named Executive Officer who received grants in 2000 were
not exercisable prior to June 1, 2000, at which time they were exercisable in
full.

(2)  The expiration date will occur on the sooner of the date noted or (i) 30
days following termination of employment without cause or (ii) the date of
termination of employment by the Corporation for cause or by the Named Executive
Officer for any reason other than retirement.

(3)  In accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission rules, the estimated
grant date present values were determined using the Black-Scholes model. The use
of this model is not an endorsement of the model's accuracy in valuing options.
The material assumptions and adjustments incorporated in the model include: an
option life of 5 years, dividend yield of 3.7%, volatility of 33.93%, and a risk
free rate of return of 6.4%. The ultimate value of the options in this table
will depend on the actual performance of the Corporation's stock and the timing
of exercises.

Pension Benefits.

        The Corporation has a tax qualified retirement plan (the "Plan")
applicable to the Executive Officers and other employees, to which the
Corporation makes annual contributions, as required, in amounts determined by
the Plan's actuaries. The Plan does not have an offset for Social Security and
is fully paid for by the Corporation. Under the Plan, employees become fully
vested after five years of participation and normal retirement age under the
Plan is age 65 but actuarially reduced benefits may be available for early
retirement at age 55. The benefit formula is 1.1% of the highest consecutive
five year average earnings in the final ten years, times years of service.
Federal law requires that 5% owners start receiving a pension no later than
April 1 following the calendar year in which the age 70-1/2 is reached. Louis
Berkman is currently receiving $5,867 a month pursuant to the Plan. As an active
employee, Mr. Berkman continues to receive credit for additional service
rendered after age 70-1/2.

        The Corporation adopted a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP)
in 1988

                                       19
<PAGE>

(amended and restated in 1996) for certain officers and key employees covering
retirement after completion of ten years of service and attainment of age 55.
All officers listed in the compensation table are Participants in the SERP,
except Louis Berkman. The combined retirement benefit at age 65 or older
provided by the Plan and the SERP is 50% of the highest consecutive five year
average earnings in the final ten years of service. The participants are
eligible for reduced benefits for early retirement at age 55. A benefit equal to
50% of the benefit otherwise payable at age 65 is paid to the surviving spouse
of any participant, who has had at least five years of service, commencing on
the later of the month following the participant's death or the month the
participant would have reached age 55. In addition, there is an offset for
pensions from other companies. Certain provisions, applicable if there is a
change of control, are discussed below under Termination of Employment and
Change of Control Arrangement.

        The following shows the estimated annual pension that would be payable,
without offset, under the Plan and the SERP, if applicable, to the individuals
named in the compensation table assuming continued employment to retirement at
age 65 or older, and assuming the compensation stated in the table is the final
five year average:

                Louis Berkman                                  (1)

                Ernest G. Siddons                         $196,560
                Robert F. Schultz                         $ 82,500
                Terrence W. Kenny                         $ 75,000

_______________

(1)  Mr. Berkman is currently receiving a pension pursuant to the Plan as
described above.

        (c)  COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS

        In 2000, each Director who was not employed by the Corporation received
an annual retainer of $6,000 (payable quarterly), $1,000 for each Board meeting
attended and $500 for

                                       20
<PAGE>

each Committee meeting attended. Attendance can be either in person or by
telephonic connection. Directors do not receive a fee for either Board or
Committee meetings if they do not attend.

     (d)  TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT AND CHANGE OF CONTROL ARRANGEMENTS

     Mr. Berkman, Mr. Paul and Mr. Siddons have two year contracts (which
automatically renew for one year periods unless the Corporation chooses not to
extend) providing for compensation equal to five times their annual compensation
(with a provision to gross up to cover the cost of any federal excise tax on the
benefits) in the event their employment is terminated following a change of
control (including a voluntary departure for good cause) and the right to
equivalent office space and secretarial help for a period of one year after a
change in control. Mr. Schultz and one other employee have two year contracts
providing for three times their annual compensation in the event their
employment is terminated following a change in control (including a voluntary
departure for good cause). In addition, Mr. Kenny and the remaining two Vice
Presidents have two year contracts providing for two times their annual
compensation in the event their employment is terminated following a change in
control (including a voluntary departure for good cause). All of the contracts
provide for the continuation of employee benefits, for three years for the three
senior executives and two years for the others, and the right to purchase the
leased car used by the covered individual at the Corporation's then book value.
The same provisions concerning change in control that apply to the contracts
apply to the SERP and vest the right to that pension arrangement. A change of
control triggers the right to a lump sum payment equal to the present value of
the vested benefit under the SERP if applicable.

       (e)  SALARY COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION IN
            COMPENSATION DECISIONS

        A Salary Committee is appointed each year by the Board of Directors.
Committee members abstain from voting on matters which involve their own
compensation arrangements. The Salary Committee for the year 2000 was comprised
of four Directors: William D. Eberle (Chairman), Louis Berkman, Leonard M.
Carroll and Carl H. Pforzheimer, III.

        Louis Berkman is Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Executive
Committee. He is also the President and a Director of The Louis Berkman Company.
The Corporation's President and Chief Executive Officer is also an officer and
director of The Louis Berkman Company.

        The Louis Berkman Company had certain transactions with the Corporation,
which are more fully described under Item 13 "Certain Relationships and Related
Transactions."

        (f)  SALARY COMMITTEE REPORT ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

        The Salary Committee approves salaries for executive officers within a
range from $150,000 up to $200,000 and increases in the salary of any executive
officer, which would result in such officer earning a salary within such range.
Salaries of $200,000 per year and above must be approved by the Board of
Directors, after a recommendation by the Salary Committee. Salaries for
executive officers below the level of $150,000 are set by the Chairman,
President and Executive Vice President of the Corporation.

        The compensation of the Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation, as
well as the other applicable executive officers, is based on an analysis
conducted by the Salary Committee. The Committee does not specifically link
remuneration solely to quantitative measures of performance because of the
cyclical nature of the industries and markets served

                                       22
<PAGE>

by the Corporation. In setting compensation, the Committee also considers
various qualitative factors, including competitive compensation arrangements of
other companies within relevant industries, individual contributions, leadership
ability and an executive officer's overall performance. In this way, it is
believed that the Corporation will attract and retain quality management,
thereby benefiting the long-term interest of shareholders.

        In 2000, the Salary Committee reviewed and approved salary increases and
had previously approved an incentive program for 2000 covering Louis Berkman,
Robert A. Paul and Ernest G. Siddons. Incentive payments were to be determined,
based exclusively on the Corporation's 2000 income from operations performance
as compared to the Corporation's business plan. These payments were to be
limited to 30% of base salary of participants. In 2000, the participants earned
incentives of $63,750, $63,750 and $57,120, respectively.

        This report of the Salary Committee shall not be deemed incorporated by
reference by any general statement incorporating by reference this 10-K report
into any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, except to the extent that the Corporation specifically
incorporates this report and the information contained herein by reference, and
shall not otherwise be deemed filed under such Acts.

(Integrated) Index for its peer comparison. The diversity of products produced
by subsidiaries of the Corporation made it difficult to match to any one
product-based peer group. The Steel Industry was chosen because it is impacted
by some of the same end markets that the Corporation ultimately serves, such as
the automotive, appliance and construction industries. Historical stock price
