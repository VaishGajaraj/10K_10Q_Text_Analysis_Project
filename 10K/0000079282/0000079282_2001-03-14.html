<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Brown &amp; Brown, Inc. (the "Company") is a general insurance agency headquartered in Daytona Beach and Tampa, Florida that resulted from an April 28, 1993 business combination involving Poe &amp; Associates, Inc. ("Poe") and
Brown &amp; Brown, Inc. ("Brown").  Poe was incorporated in 1958 and Brown commenced business in 1939.   The name of the Company following the 1993 combination was Poe &amp; Brown, Inc. and was changed to Brown &amp; Brown, Inc. in 1999.  </TD>

<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Company is a diversified insurance brokerage and agency that markets and sells primarily property and casualty insurance products and services to its clients.  Because the Company does not engage in underwriting activities, it
does not assume underwriting risks.  Instead, it acts in an agency capacity to provide its customers with targeted, customized risk management products.</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">&nbsp;</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The Company is compensated for its services primarily by commissions paid by insurance companies and fees for administration and benefit consulting services.  The commission is usually a percentage of the premium paid by an
insured.  Commission rates generally depend upon the type of insurance, the particular insurance company, and the nature of the services provided by the Company.  In some cases, a commission is shared with other agents or brokers who have acted jointly
with the Company in a transaction.  The Company may also receive from an insurance company a contingent commission that is generally based on the profitability and volume of business placed with it by the Company over a given period of time.  Fees are
principally generated by the Company's Service Division, which offers administration and benefit consulting services primarily in the workers' compensation and employee benefit markets.  The amount of the Company's income from commissions and fees is a
function of, among other factors, continued new business production, retention of existing customers, acquisitions, and fluctuations in insurance premium rates and insurable exposure units.</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">&nbsp;</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Premium pricing within the property and casualty insurance underwriting industry has been cyclical and has displayed a high degree of volatility based on prevailing economic and competitive conditions.  Since the mid-1980s, the
property and casualty insurance industry has been in a "soft market" during which the underwriting capacity of insurance companies expanded, stimulating an increase in competition and a decrease in premium rates and related commissions and fees.
Significant reductions in premium rates occurred during the years 1987 through 1989 and continued, although to a lesser degree, through 1999.  The effect of this softness in rates on the Company's revenues had been somewhat offset by the Company's
acquisitions and new business production.  As a result of increasing loss ratios of insurance carriers through 1999, there was a general increase in premium rates beginning in the first quarter of 2000 and continuing through the fourth quarter of 2000.
Although the premium increases varied by line of business, geographical region, insurance carrier and specific underwriting factors, it was the first time since 1987 that the Company operated in an environment of increased premiums for four consecutive
quarters.  The Company cannot predict the timing or extent of premium pricing changes as a result of market fluctuations or their effect on the Company's operations in the future.</TD>

<FONT FACE="Courier"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;</FONT>On January 3, 2001, the Company completed its acquisition of all of the insurance agency business-related assets of Riedman Corporation ("Riedman"), based in Rochester, New York.  Simultaneously with
this transaction, Brown &amp; Brown of Wyoming, Inc. ("Brown &amp; Brown-Wyoming"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, acquired all of the insurance agency business-related assets of Riedman Insurance of Wyoming, Inc. ("Riedman-Wyoming"), a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Riedman with an office in Cheyenne, Wyoming.  Collectively, Riedman and Riedman-Wyoming had over 60 offices in 13 states.  These acquisitions, recorded using the purchase method of accounting, were made pursuant to an asset
purchase agreement among the Company, Riedman, and Riedman's shareholders, a purchase agreement between the Company and Andrew Meloni, a key employee of Riedman, and a general assignment and bill of sale from Riedman-Wyoming to Brown &amp; Brown-Wyoming.
The aggregate consideration for these assets, which is payable in cash in three installments by the Company and Brown &amp; Brown-Wyoming, was equal to approximately 1.55 times Riedman's revenues for the year 2000 less certain Riedman debt related to its
prior acquisitions, which was assumed by the Company.  The cash consideration paid by the Company and Brown &amp; Brown-Wyoming at closing was approximately $61,566,572.</TD>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;As of December 31, 2000, the Company's activities were conducted in 39 locations in 12 states; however, with the acquisitions consummated in 2001 (including Riedman), the Company currently has 108 locations in 24 states.  Of the
108 locations, 28 are in Florida; 19 in New York; nine in Minnesota; eight in Virginia; seven in Louisiana; five in Colorado; four in South Carolina; three each in Arizona, Georgia and North Dakota; two each in California, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico
and Texas; and one each in Indiana, Iowa, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.  Because a significant amount of the Company's business is concentrated in Arizona, Florida, and New York, the occurrence of adverse
economic conditions or an adverse regulatory climate in these states could have a materially adverse effect on its business, although the Company has not encountered such conditions in the past.</TD>

independent agencies and agents across the United States.  The Company receives an override on the commissions generated by these independent agencies.  The Service Division provides insurance-related services such as third-party administration,
consultation for workers' compensation and employee benefit markets, and certified managed care and utilization management reviews.  The Brokerage Division markets and sells excess and surplus commercial insurance, as well as certain niche programs,

subsidiaries and affiliates, and two of their employees, as defendants.  The complaint alleges, among other things, that the Company tortiously interfered with the contractual relationship between the plaintiff and certain of its employees.  The plaintiff
alleges that the Company hired such persons and actively encouraged them to violate the restrictive covenants contained in their employment agreements with plaintiff.  The complaint seeks compensatory damages from the Company with respect to each of the
two employees in amounts "not less than $750,000," and seeks punitive damages for alleged intentional wrongdoing in an amount "not less than $10,000,000."  The complaint also sought a declaratory judgment regarding the enforceability of the restrictive
covenants in the employment agreements and an injunction prohibiting the violation of those agreements.  The plaintiff subsequently dismissed these claims, as well as its claims of breach of contract against the two individual employees named as
defendants.  Those individuals, and Peachtree Special Risk Brokers, LLC, an affiliate of the Company named as a defendant in this action, have filed counterclaims against the plaintiff, seeking damages, and seeking a declaratory judgment holding that the
