clinical stage immunotherapeutics company focused on the development of products to stimulate robust and durable immune responses for the prevention and treatment of diseases. We have two proprietary platform technologies, RespirVec and Densigen,
each of which has been shown, in preclinical studies and early clinical trials, to activate the immune system in distinctly different ways than traditional vaccine methods. Using these technologies, we have generated clinical product candidates
which potentially represent an entirely new approach to harnessing the immune system. We have two programs using the Respirvec recombinant adenovirus technology. NasoVAX, an intranasally administered recombinant influenza vaccine, uses an
adenovector to achieve expression of the influenza antigen in the target cell, thereby potentially stimulating a broader and more rapid immune response than traditional influenza vaccines. Our planned Phase 2 program for NasoVAX started in September
2017. Initial data, released in March 2018, indicated that NasoVAX was well tolerated at all doses tested, and achieved 100% seroprotection with the two higher doses. Final data from this study will be available in the third quarter of 2018 and we
expect to move forward with continued development of a quadrivalent NasoVAX product candidate which we expect will be ready for clinical evaluation in the first half of 2019. The second RespirVec product, NasoShield, is an anthrax vaccine designed
to provide rapid, stable protection after one intranasal administration. We launched a Phase 1 trial for NasoShield in the first quarter of 2018 and anticipate topline data in the third quarter of 2018. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">With the support of NIAID, we are developing an alternative anthrax vaccine candidate, SparVax-L, a recombinant protein-based anthrax vaccine
designed to require fewer doses and have a longer shelf-life than the only currently licensed anthrax vaccine. The shelf life of the liquid formulation was insufficient to meet the government standards and the product was reformulated in a
lyophilized (dry powder) formulation. We have demonstrated a significant improvement (at least two years at room temperature and at least six years at refrigerated temperatures) with the lyophilized formulation. Recent preclinical experiments have
shown it to be 100% protective with a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">two-dose</FONT> regiment (zero and 14 days) with higher toxin neutralizing antibodies than the currently licensed vaccine. </P>

currently in a Phase 1 trial in the United Kingdom and South Korea in patients with chronic HBV. Preliminary results from this trial were inconclusive. We are awaiting the six month follow up results, which we expect will be available in the third
quarter of 2018, to determine whether to continue with further development of HepTcell, including any further clinical trials. Oncosyn, a cancer immunotherapeutic is in preclinical development. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The human immune system consists of a series of specialized structures and cell types that work together to protect the body from disease. The
immune system can respond to pathogens in two different ways&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;via the innate immune response or via the adaptive immune response. Adaptive immunity is developed in response to antigens expressed by a particular pathogen, is highly
specific to those antigens, and takes from one to several weeks upon initial recognition of the pathogen to mount an effective response. The adaptive immune system responds to a pathogen through both antibody-mediated and T cell-mediated immunity.
The antibody-mediated humoral response is primarily directed toward the neutralization of extracellular pathogens (including viruses), which renders them harmless. T cell-mediated cellular immunity functions to recognize cells that need to be
destroyed either because they harbor a pathogen or because the cell has transformed into a cancer cell. The adaptive immune response also includes the mucosal immune system, which is localized to mucosal tissues like the lining of the respiratory
tract. The mucosal immune system uses a specialized type of antibody called IgA to block pathogens at the site of entry into the body. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In
contrast to the slower, highly specific responses of the adaptive immune response, the innate immune system is designed to provide a rapid and broad response to attacking pathogens. There are numerous types of innate immune cells with specialized
functions. Their principal characteristic is the ability to respond quickly when a pathogen is encountered. The innate immune system can recognize viruses, bacteria and fungi, and is </P>

pathogen threat, the innate immune system facilitates and improves the adaptive immune response. Together, the adaptive and innate immune systems provide a concerted response to the control and clear the pathogen from the host. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Influenza is one of the most common viral respiratory infections, leading to significant morbidity and mortality. In particular, young
children, adults over 65, pregnant women and individuals in long-term care facilities are vulnerable to developing <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">flu-related</FONT> complications. People with underlying medical conditions such as asthma, obesity,
neurological disorders, and chronic lung, heart, liver or kidney problems are also at high risk for complications. The World Health Organization reports that up to 650,000
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">(http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2017/seasonal-flu/en/)</FONT> of those infected with the flu each year die as a result of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">influenza-related</FONT> complications. The
number of deaths associated with seasonal influenza vary from year to year, based on the severity of circulating strains and the effectiveness of that year&#146;s influenza vaccine The CDC has posted estimates of seasonal flu deaths and estimates
that from the 2010-2011 flu season to the 2013-2014 flu season <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">influenza-associated</FONT> deaths in the United States ranged from a low of 12,000 (during 2011-2012) to a high of 56,000 (during 2012-2013) <FONT

index2018.html), from February&nbsp;16, 2018, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (&#147;CDC&#148;), confirmed previous findings that as many as 59% of hospitalizations
and 85% of deaths occur among adult age <FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:SYMBOL">&#179;</FONT>65 years. However, the heightened risk based on age is not confined to senior citizens&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;for example, a 2014 MMWR report on <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">influenza-associated</FONT> intensive care unit admissions in the 2013&nbsp;&#150;&nbsp;2014 flu season showed that persons aged 41&nbsp;&#150;&nbsp;64 years had six times the risk of death and almost four times the risk
of intensive care unit admission as those aged 40 or younger, demonstrating that influenza is a real concern for much of the adult population. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There are many influenza strains in circulation during a given flu season and the individual strains are systematically named by: (i)&nbsp;the
type of influenza virus, either A or B; (ii)&nbsp;the geographical location where the strain was isolated; (iii)&nbsp;which isolate of potentially many from that location it represents (starting with the number &#147;01&#148;); and (iv)&nbsp;the
year it was isolated. For example, an isolate from the pandemic influenza virus known as the swine flu might be called A/California/04/2009. This system of naming virus strains sometimes includes information on the subtype of influenza virus as a
suffix at the end of the name, such as A/California/04/2009 (H1N1), where the familiar designation &#147;H1N1&#148; reveals the subunit structure of the virus, designating an influenza subtype comprised of hemagglutinin protein H1 and neuraminidase
protein N1. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Vaccination against influenza virus can be an effective way to prevent infections. However, the effectiveness of vaccination
can vary greatly from year to year, and the overall level of protection is suboptimal. According to the CDC, the average overall adjusted vaccine effectiveness for influenza seasons has been approximately 40% from 2005&nbsp;&#150;&nbsp;2018
(https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/vaccination/effectiveness-studies.htm). One reason for vaccine ineffectiveness is the constantly changing nature of influenza virus strains. The viral protein hemagglutinin (HA) is an important target of
vaccination, and each type of HA protein, such as H1 or H3, has multiple forms which can vary from year to year. Because the process used to produce over 99% of influenza vaccine doses today requires six months of advance planning, regulatory
agencies must commit to the strains to be used well in advance of the start of the flu season. Since each strain is different, an immune response generated against one form of H1 protein may not protect against infection with a virus containing
another form of H1 protein. The low estimated 19% overall efficacy of the 2014&nbsp;&#150;&nbsp;2015 flu vaccine in the United&nbsp;States was attributed to the fact that more than <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">two-thirds</FONT> of the H3N2
viruses circulating that season were of a different form than the H3N2 strain included in vaccine production. Worse still, a more dramatic change in influenza virus makeup occasionally arises when an entirely new HA protein emerges, which can result
in a human pandemic. Because humans have never encountered the new HA protein they are likely to have little or no immunity, leaving them at much greater risk for serious complications or death. Current vaccines are suboptimal because of their
narrow strain specific responses and the long lead times needed for vaccine production that results in mismatches between strains represented in the vaccine and the predominant circulating strains. We have demonstrated in repeated preclinical
studies that NasoVAX may provide the type of cross-protection necessary to address a broad variety of HA proteins and has a more rapid production time than the vast majority of currently approved vaccines. Additionally, recent data suggest that
glycosylation patterns may also be an important component of increasing vaccine efficacy. It was noted that vaccines that were manufactured in chicken eggs were less efficacious than similar vaccines manufactured in cell culture-based manufacturing
processes. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The CDC recommends that everyone in the United States over six months of age receive an annual influenza vaccination.
According to the CDC, vaccine manufacturers have projected that the market for influenza vaccines in the United States will be approximately 151 to 166&nbsp;million doses for the 2017&nbsp;&#150;&nbsp;2018 flu season, and have reported approximately
154.7&nbsp;million doses distributed as of February 17, 2018. Through other market sources we estimate that the substantial majority of these vaccines contain inactivated virus produced in eggs. According to World Health Organization estimates, the
U.S. influenza market is expected to be approximately $2.0&nbsp;billion in 2018. Despite observations of limited efficacy, the CDC estimates that influenza vaccination prevented approximately 7.2&nbsp;million illnesses, 3.1&nbsp;million medically
attended illnesses and 90,000 hospitalizations in 2013&nbsp;&#150;&nbsp;2014. However, in 2014&nbsp;&#150;&nbsp;2015, the CDC estimates that influenza vaccination prevented only 1.9&nbsp;million illnesses, 966,000 medically attended illnesses and
67,000 hospitalizations, </P>

significantly lower than previous seasons because of the reduced effectiveness of the 2014&nbsp;&#150; 2015 vaccine against the predominant circulating influenza viruses. New vaccines with
improved clinical efficacy and effectiveness are needed to further reduce <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">influenza-related</FONT> morbidity and mortality. One of the most important improvements needed for influenza vaccines is the ability to
provide cross-protection between different HA protein types, which would address the issue created with changing viruses mentioned above. Many companies and laboratories have attempted to develop &#147;universal&#148; influenza vaccines that are
directed against viral proteins that are highly conserved in sequence among all viral genetic subtypes of influenza; however, it is not clear that the type of immune response generated against those proteins will be sufficiently effective for

antibody-based response triggered by traditional vaccines, but also mucosal immunity to provide a first line of defense and cellular immunity to help control and clear the infection. In addition to this adaptive immunity, NasoVAX stimulates the
rapidly acting innate immune response. The innate immune response generally occurs within hours of a pathogen invading, as the body&#146;s first line of defense, and complements the longer-lasting pathogen-specific immunity generated by the other
components of the immune system. Vaccine developers have long known of the importance of triggering innate immunity. Typically, this is accomplished through the use of adjuvants, which are often crude mixtures that are unrelated to the vaccine
product itself. Because it is designed to activate the innate immune response, NasoVAX may act as its own adjuvant, potentially obviating the need for an additional adjuvant component to the vaccine. By triggering innate immunity, NasoVAX may confer
rapid protection that complements the longer-lasting protection based on antibodies and cellular immunity. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Clinical Data </I></B></P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver usually caused by a viral infection. There are five main unrelated hepatitis viruses, referred to as
types A, B, C, D and E. Hepatitis is categorized as acute when it lasts less than six months and chronic when it persists longer. In particular, types B and C lead to chronic disease in hundreds of millions of people and, together, are the most
common cause of liver cirrhosis and liver cancer. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">HBV is the most common cause of viral hepatitis and is spread through blood products,
contaminated needles or sexual contact, and from mother to infant. HBV infections are particularly endemic in Southeast Asia, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">sub-Saharan</FONT> Africa, the Amazon basin, parts of the Middle East and in some Eastern
European countries, where 70%&nbsp;&#150;&nbsp;90% of the population is infected before the age of 40. Even though prophylactic vaccination programs have led to declines in HBV infections in many countries, chronic infection remains a significant
problem in certain areas. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Most adults infected with HBV recover naturally; however, according to the Hepatitis B Foundation, five to ten
percent of infected adults go on to develop chronic infections. CHB infection is a major worldwide health care challenge with approximately 257&nbsp;million people worldwide chronically infected, resulting in 857,000
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">HBV-related</FONT> deaths per year due to cirrhosis, liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The
management of CHB has improved dramatically in the last 20 years, owing to the development of new small molecule antivirals directed against the HBV polymerase protein. While these therapies can effectively suppress HBV replication, they do not
result in eradication of the virus and therefore their administration can rarely be discontinued. They reduce but do not eliminate the risk of HBV related complications. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Therapeutic vaccination is a promising immunotherapeutic approach to induce immune control over the disease. CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses
have been shown to be critical for clearance of acute HBV infection and immune control can be linked to the strength and quality of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">HBV-specific</FONT> T cell responses. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">CHB patients are known to have profound defects in
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">anti-HBV-specific</FONT></FONT> T cell immune responses, termed immunotolerance, thereby compromising critical protective and disease control mechanisms. We believe that a treatment
like HepTcell, which has been shown in preclinical studies to stimulate the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">HBV-specific</FONT> T cell response, could help destroy infected cells and clear chronic HBV infections. </P>

HepTcell, specific viral peptide sequences, chosen for their ability to elicit broad human leukocyte antigen (&#147;HLA&#148;) type-independent immune responses, are coupled to a fluorocarbon chain so that, upon administration, the immunotherapy
creates a short-term depot, which we believe will lead to a strong and sustained activation of the immune system. The final study product consists of a mixture of nine peptides between 32 and 40 amino acids long that are designed to be effective
across the full spectrum of HBV genotypes. The peptides were selected using bioinformatics and validated using <I>in vitro</I> screening of immune responses from blood of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">HBV-infected</FONT> patients. We believe that
our synthetic HepTcell product candidate, if approved, could be produced by commodity peptide manufacturers around the world according to a robust and cost-effective process. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Everyone&#146;s immune system responds differently to stimuli due to innate differences in HLA type, a shorthand expression for the proteins

determines how each person&#146;s unique immune system will react to immunotherapy, leading to differing levels of efficacy. The discovery of the Densigen technology, on which HepTcell is based,
has potentially solved the problem of HLA restriction, with the possibility that nearly all patients may benefit from immunotherapy without a need for matching. In addition, we believe that HepTcell has potential advantages over therapeutic vaccines
under development for CHB because it is based on the incorporation of highly antigenic sequences that appear to be constant across multiple HBV strains or genotypes. </P>

effectively eliminate <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">HBV-infected</FONT> cells. By combining HepTcell together with the adjuvant IC31, we increased the magnitude of the immune response up to three-fold. We chose IC31 because it is a fully
synthetic adjuvant consistent with the synthetic nature of HepTcell itself. A synthetic adjuvant provides consistent quality and has a better controlled manufacturing process, in contrast to many adjuvants that, while effective, are comprised of
undefined mixtures of natural substances. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">HBV replicates only in humans and other primates. Accordingly, we conducted an <I>in vivo</I>

controlled disease under standard of care. The primary objective of the trial was to assess the safety and tolerability of HepTcell. As a secondary objective, the trial measured the immune response induced by HepTcell following administration. The
trial evaluated two dose levels, both with and without a novel adjuvant, compared to placebo and adjuvant alone. Each cohort received three doses of HepTcell, at days 1, 29 and 57, and assessed T cell response and HBsAg and HBsAg-antibody levels
over a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">six-month</FONT> period. We are also measuring the phenotype of cell-mediated immune response that is induced by the immunotherapy. The vaccine was well tolerated and was not associated with hepatic flares.
Although the blinded results available at the end of 2017 demonstrated increases in Tcell response in higher dose cohorts, which both contained controls, the unblinded data was inconclusive, with similar results between treated patients and
controls. We plan to complete evaluation of additional immunologic and virologic data from these subjects by the end of 2018. There can be no assurances we will continue the development of HepTcell or any other Densigen based product candidate. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Anthrax is a disease that arises from infection with a bacterial pathogen, <I>Bacillus anthracis</I>. Anthrax can be spread by inhalation of
bacterial spores which can be released from infected livestock or livestock products; however, this is extremely rare. The greater fear, and key driver for development of anthrax vaccines, is the potential use of anthrax spores by bioterrorists. The
bacterial spores are readily aerosolized and could be used against the military or civilian population. Without timely treatment, inhalation anthrax is almost always fatal, and antibiotic treatment is significantly less effective if not initiated
shortly after infection. The U.S. government has made significant investments in ensuring that appropriate countermeasures are in place to prevent and treat these infections. Individuals at high risk, such as active duty military personnel, are
routinely vaccinated as a preventative measure, and the government stockpiles adequate doses of vaccine for distribution to the broader population in case of a bioterrorism attack. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Anthrax Vaccine Absorbed trade name BioThrax, is a protein-based vaccine produced from culture filtrates of an avirulent, <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-encapsulated</FONT> strain of <I>Bacillus anthracis</I>. For <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-exposure</FONT> prophylaxis, it is given as a series of three intramuscular injections at zero, one and six months, at
which point the vaccinated subject is considered protected. These initial injections are followed by two additional injections over the next year and yearly booster immunizations thereafter. BioThrax is the only anthrax vaccine approved by the FDA
and had sales of $287&nbsp;million in 2017. In a BioThrax study, approximately 60% to 80% of recipients experienced injection site adverse events following the first dose of the vaccine, primarily tenderness, erythema (skin rash), edema (fluid
accumulation under the skin), warmth, induration (skin thickening), pain and itching. BioThrax is currently only given to high risk individuals, such as U.S. military personnel, and a significant number of those individuals have refused the vaccine
in past voluntary programs, presumably because of the lengthy immunization procedure and documented adverse events. Thus, we believe that there is a market opportunity for a more effective, safer and more convenient anthrax vaccine to expand beyond
the current market. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Our Solution, NasoShield </I></B></P>

candidates are derived from our RespirVec platform, in which rapid as well as long-term immune protection is elicited by intranasal delivery of adenovectored pathogen sequences. We are targeting chronic diseases using our Densigen platform which
recruits T cells to generate a sustained response to intracellular targets. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>RespirVec </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our RespirVec platform consists of our proprietary process related to intranasal delivery of replication-deficient adenoviruses and is
comprised of patents that we own or license. RespirVec is a viral vector based on a modified version of adenovirus that is used to deliver selected antigens to the immune system so that a robust response can occur. Our RespirVec technology has
important potential advantages compared to other vaccine platforms. The ability of vaccines based on the RespirVec platform to induce mucosal immunity, as shown in our preclinical studies, is an important differentiator, as mucosal immunity is
generally considered to be desirable for protection against respiratory pathogens. In addition, by using an adenovirus to enter the cell, we trigger the activation of local innate immunity, further boosting the immune recognition and response to the
antigen expressed by the vector, essentially creating an adjuvant-like effect. Because the innate immune response can occur very quickly and is broad in its specificity, this immune response has the potential to provide a rapidly developing line of
protection against divergent strains of a virus. Unlike most other vaccines, immunotherapies based on RespirVec enter the cells of the upper respiratory tract and express the antigen intracellularly, just as occurs during an actual respiratory
infection. This allows the immune system to recognize the pathogen in the same context as a natural infection and as a result a more natural and robust immune response may be elicited that includes not only the humoral response of traditional
vaccines, but also activation of the T cell and mucosal components of the immune system. Traditional vaccines are based on proteins rather than a viral vector and consequently rely primarily on the immune system&#146;s antibody response, rather than
the type of broad immune involvement seen with RespirVec technology. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Key aspects of our RespirVec technology, supported by our

causes of the common cold and as such it is well-suited for delivery of antigens using the intranasal route of delivery. One potential disadvantage associated with the use of adenovirus-based vectors is that
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-existing</FONT> antibodies against the vector, either as a result of previous natural infections or prior therapy with the vector, may interfere with the ability of the vector to express the pathogen.
Importantly, these negative effects have been primarily observed following intramuscular injection of similar vectors. Utilizing the intranasal route of delivery seems to bypass this effect, as demonstrated by us and others in preclinical models. We
have also observed this in our Phase 1 seasonal influenza trial, where there was no correlation between the amounts of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-existing</FONT> adenoviral antibodies in study subjects and the ability of those subjects to
generate <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">influenza-specific</FONT> antibodies when NasoVAX was dosed intranasally. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The graph above plots the level of anti-adenovirus titer versus hemagglutinin inhibition, a measure of vaccine activity. If a correlation
existed between the level of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-existing</FONT> anti-vector antibody and vaccine activity, one would expect the data points in the graph to follow a trend where a point with a high anti-adenovirus titer would also
have a low fold HI, yet this was not observed. For example, the two data points with the highest anti-adenovirus antibody level had the highest vaccine activity in one case and one of the lowest vaccine activities in the other case, indicating a
lack of association. These results suggest that the presence of adenovirus neutralizing antibodies may not negatively impact the efficacy of intranasally delivered RespirVec-based vaccines. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our experience suggests that vaccines based on the RespirVec technology can be developed through a simple, fast, safe and relatively
inexpensive manufacturing process, which would be an advantage over most other <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">influenza-based</FONT> vaccine products. Because the manufacturing process uses recombinant DNA to synthesize pathogen-optimized
products, manufacturing RespirVec-based products can be done potentially more rapidly than other vaccine types without the need to grow or handle dangerous pathogens. We believe that our RespirVec technology also lends itself to manufacture in
smaller scale bioreactors, which may yield millions of doses without the need for large cell culture or <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">egg-based</FONT> production facilities. The ability to manufacture in cell culture instead of chicken eggs is
proving to provide increased efficacy with influenza vaccines. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Densigen </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We developed antigens consisting of 30&nbsp;&#150;&nbsp;40 amino acid long synthetic peptides that encode a high density of CD4 and CD8 T cell
epitopes that are selected to broaden the HLA class reactivity of the product. We refer to these high-density antigens as Densigens, which are covered by patents owned by us. Immunotherapeutic product candidates based on our Densigen technology
contain a collection of carefully selected Densigens that are designed to elicit activity across multiple targets for the disease. Synthetic peptide-based antigens have potential advantages over viral or recombinant protein antigens because they may
be able to be manufactured at large scale with high purity. However, the development of peptide-based vaccines has been limited due their relatively low immunogenicity in the absence of adjuvants. As demonstrated in preclinical studies, we have
enhanced the ability of Densigen peptides to elicit an immune response by attaching a biologically inert fluorocarbon chain to each peptide, resulting in a depot effect. This effect can be seen in the figure below where the T cell immune response is
significantly greater in animals treated with the fluorocarbon-containing peptide than in those treated with peptide without the fluorocarbon chain (native peptide). </P>

change in the chemical structure, in turn, drives the aggregation of these peptides into micelles, which are more stable and longer-lasting structures than naked peptides. This conformational shift into micelles provides a depot for these peptide
antigens and protects them from proteolytic degradation and diffusion, thereby prolonging exposure to the immune system. Our studies also indicate that the aggregation-inducing properties of the fluorocarbon chain can be modified by pH and salt

potentially applicable to our product candidates, such as FDA fast track approval processes for certain new drugs with the potential to address unmet medical needs for certain serious or life-threatening conditions, may potentially expedite approval

countermeasures. Data obtained from clinical activities is not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all,
and we may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our efforts to secure necessary governmental approvals, which could delay or preclude us from marketing our product candidates. In addition, the FDA may limit the indications for use or

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Before testing any biological product candidate in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical study stage. Preclinical studies
include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of certain preclinical studies must comply with federal
regulations and requirements including GLPs. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The clinical trial sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical studies, together with
manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical studies may continue even after the IND is submitted. The FDA requires a <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">30-day</FONT> waiting period after the filing of each IND before clinical trials may begin. The FDA may also place the clinical trial on a clinical hold within that <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">30-day</FONT> time
period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a biological product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due
to safety concerns or <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-compliance.</FONT> If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, studies may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. Accordingly, we cannot be sure
that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such studies. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Clinical trials involve the administration of the biological product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of
qualified investigators. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject
safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events (&#147;AEs&#148;), should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical
trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA&#146;s regulations comprising the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and
approved by an IRB at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals
participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject or his or her legal
representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential

monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly
submitted to the FDA, the National Institute of Health (&#147;NIH&#148;) and the investigators for serious and unexpected AEs, any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or <I>in vitro</I> testing and other sources that suggest a
significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar
days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor&#146;s initial
receipt of the information. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a
finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance
with the IRB&#146;s requirements or if the biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Concurrent
with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies, develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biological product and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in
accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the PHS Act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely
defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the
final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">After the completion of clinical trials of a biological product, the FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before commercial marketing of the
biological product. The BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal studies, human studies, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. In addition,
under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and
administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort and
there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the BLA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. In addition, BLAs for seasonal influenza vaccines are currently required to be submitted
annually, and we would expect the same requirement to be applicable to our influenza product candidate. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the Prescription Drug User
Fee Act (&#147;PDUFA&#148;), as amended, each BLA must be accompanied by a significant user fee. PDUFA also imposes an annual product fee for biologics and an annual establishment fee on facilities used to manufacture prescription biologics. Fee
waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Following submission of the application, the FDA reviews the BLA to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for

not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application
also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">in-depth</FONT> substantive review of the BLA. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among
other things, whether the proposed product is safe and potent, or effective, for its intended use, and has an acceptable purity profile, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product&#146;s
identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel biological products or biological products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that
includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers
such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the biological product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (&#147;REMS&#148;), is necessary to assure the safe use of the
biological product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the BLA without a REMS, if required. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless
it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will
typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND study requirements and GCP requirements. To assure cGMP, cGTP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure
of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production and quality control. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Notwithstanding the submission of
relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data
differently than how we interpret the same data. If the agency decides not to approve the BLA in its present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the
FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes; or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might
take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for
use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and
conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a risk management plan, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post-marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4
clinical trials, designed to further assess a biological product&#146;s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. </P>

regulatory approval of a product is obtained, there may be a number of post-approval requirements. For example, as a condition of approval of a BLA, the FDA may require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the product&#146;s safety or
efficacy. In addition, holders of an approved BLA are required to keep extensive records, to report certain adverse reactions and production problems to the FDA, to provide updated safety and efficacy information and to comply with requirements
concerning advertising and promotional labeling for their products. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP regulations and practices, as well as the manufacturing conditions of approval set forth in the

facilities or at the facilities of third-party suppliers that may disrupt production or distribution or require substantial resources to correct and prevent recurrence of any deficiencies and could result in fines or penalties by regulatory

MCM application, the FDA will award a PRV provided certain criteria are met. When a marketing application receives a priority review designation, the FDA&#146;s goal is to take action on that application within 6 months. To be considered a material

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In 2002, the FDA amended its requirements applicable to BLAs to permit the approval of certain biologics that are intended to reduce or prevent
serious or life-threatening conditions based on evidence of safety from trial in healthy subjects and effectiveness from appropriate animal studies when human efficacy studies are not ethical or feasible. These regulations, also known as the
&#147;Animal Rule,&#148; and published in the Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR 601 Subpart H), authorize the FDA to rely on evidence from animal studies to provide evidence of a product&#146;s effectiveness under circumstances where there is a
reasonably well-understood mechanism for the toxicity of the agent. Under these requirements, and with FDA&#146;s prior agreement, biologics used to reduce or prevent the toxicity of chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear substances may be
approved for use in humans based on evidence of effectiveness derived from appropriate animal studies and any additional supporting data. Products evaluated for effectiveness under this rule are evaluated for safety under preexisting requirements
for establishing the safety of new drug and biological products, including Phase 1 through Phase 2 clinical trials. Under certain circumstances a single animal species may be acceptable if that animal model is sufficiently well-characterized for
predicting a response in humans. The animal study endpoint must be clearly related to the desired benefit in humans and the information obtained from animal studies must allow for selection of an effective dose in humans. The Animal Rule also
requires post-marketing studies, such as field studies, to verify and describe the product&#146;s clinical benefit and assess its safety should an exigency exists that leads to the product being used in humans; the nature of these studies will be
discussed with FDA as part of the BLA process. Products approved under the Animal Rule are subject to additional requirements, such as restrictions imposed on marketing or distribution or requirements to provide information to patients. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As part of the ongoing efforts of governmental authorities to lower health care costs by facilitating generic competition to pharmaceutical
products, the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (&#147;BPCIA&#148;), enacted as part of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act in 2010 (&#147;Health Care Reform Law&#148;), created a new abbreviated regulatory approval
pathway in the United States for biological products that are found to be &#147;biosimilar&#148; or &#147;interchangeable&#148; with a biological &#147;reference product&#148; previously licensed under a BLA. This abbreviated approval pathway is
intended to permit a biosimilar to come to market more quickly and less expensively by relying to some extent on the data generated by the reference product&#146;s sponsor, and the FDA&#146;s previous review and approval of the reference product.
Under the BPCIA, a biosimilar sponsor&#146;s ability to seek or obtain approval through the abbreviated pathway is limited by periods of exclusivity granted by the FDA to the holder of the reference product&#146;s BLA, and no biosimilar application
may be accepted by the FDA for review until 4 years after the date the reference product was first licensed by the FDA, and no biosimilar application, once accepted, may receive final approval until 12 years after the reference product was first
licensed by the FDA. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">While we would expect to be granted this <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">12-year</FONT> period of exclusivity for

There is also risk that the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">12-year</FONT> period of biological reference product exclusivity could be shortened due to congressional action, or that the FDA will not consider our product candidates, if they are
approved, to be reference products for competing products, potentially creating the opportunity for competition sooner than anticipated. Once approved, biosimilars likely would compete with, and in some circumstances may be deemed under the law to
be &#147;interchangeable with,&#148; the previously approved reference product. The extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, will be substituted for any one of our product candidates, if approved, in a way that is similar to traditional generic
substitution for <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-biological</FONT> products is not yet clear, and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing. Although there is uncertainty regarding the impact of
this new program, it seems likely that if any of our product candidates are approved by the FDA, there is risk that the approval of a biosimilar competitor to one of our products could have an adverse impact on our business. In particular, a
biosimilar could be significantly less costly to bring to market and priced significantly lower than our product, if approved by the FDA. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>FDA Fast

potentially apply to our product candidates, although this cannot be assured, and we do not currently have any products with fast track designation. The FDA fast track programs, one of which is fast track designation, are designed to facilitate the
development and review of new drugs that are intended to treat serious or life-threatening conditions and that demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the conditions. Fast track designation applies to a combination of the
product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. Thus, it is the development program for a specific drug for a specific indication that receives fast track designation. The sponsor of a product designated as being in a fast track
drug development program may engage in close early communication with the FDA, including through timely meetings and feedback on clinical trials. Products in fast track drug development programs also may be eligible for FDA priority review or
accelerated approval, if relevant criteria are met; in other words, the review cycle may have a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">six-month</FONT> review clock instead of a twelvemonth review clock). Sponsors may also be able to submit completed
portions of an application before the entire application is completed; however, the review clock will not officially begin until the entire completed BLA is submitted to and filed by the FDA. The FDA may notify a sponsor that its program is no
longer classified as a fast track development program if the fast track designation is no longer supported by emerging data, the designated drug development program is no longer being pursued, or another product that meets the unmet medical need for
the same indication. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Pediatric Exclusivity </I></B></P>

exclusivity, an incentive intended to encourage medical product research for children. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods applicable to biological products under the BPCIA&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;namely, the
four-year period during which the FDA will not consider an application for a biosimilar product, and the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">12-year</FONT> period during which the FDA will not approve a biosimilar application. This <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">six-month</FONT> exclusivity, which runs from the end of these exclusivity protection periods, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">FDA-issued</FONT> &#147;written request&#148; for such a trial. It is possible, but not assured, that certain of our current or future product candidates may be targeted to pediatric populations, such as our

United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for such a disease or condition will be recovered from
sales in the United States for that drug. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation can provide opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax
advantages and FDA user fee exemptions. In addition, if a product that has an orphan drug designation subsequently receives FDA approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product may be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity,
which means the FDA would not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan
exclusivity or a meaningfully different mode of administration. It is possible, but not assured, that certain of our current or future product candidates may be targeted to rare diseases or conditions, such as with respect to our cancer vaccine

and Medicaid </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Pharmaceutical manufacturers with products that are reimbursed by U.S. federally funded programs such as Medicare and
Medicaid are subject to regulation by the Centers for Medicare&nbsp;&amp; Medicaid Services (&#147;CMS&#148;) and enforcement by HHS the Office of the Inspector General (&#147;OIG&#148;), and in the event our product candidates are approved,
regulation by CMS and enforcement by HHS OIG would be relevant to the Company. Some of these laws, referred to as &#147;false claims laws,&#148; prohibit the submission or causing the submission of false or fraudulent claims for reimbursement to
federal, state and other health care payers and programs. Other laws, referred to as &#147;anti-kickback laws,&#148; prohibit soliciting, offering, receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient or ordering,
purchasing, leasing or arranging for, or recommending ordering, purchasing or leasing of, items or services that are paid for by federal, state and other health care payers and programs. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The federal Anti-Kickback Law prohibits providers and others from directly or indirectly soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any
remuneration with the intent of generating referrals or orders for services or items covered by a government health care program. Many states have enacted similar laws. Courts have interpreted this law very broadly, including by holding that a
violation has occurred if even one purpose of the remuneration is to generate referrals, even if there are other lawful purposes. There are statutory and regulatory exceptions, or safe harbors, that outline arrangements that are deemed lawful.
However, the fact that an arrangement does not fall within a safe harbor does not necessarily render the conduct illegal under the Anti-Kickback Law. In sum, even common business arrangements, such as discounted terms and volume incentives for
customers in a position to recommend or choose drugs for patients, such as physicians and hospitals, can result in substantial legal penalties, including, among others, exclusion from Medicare and Medicaid programs, and arrangements with referral
sources must be structured with care to comply with applicable requirements. Also, certain business practices, such as payment of consulting fees to health care providers, sponsorship of educational or research grants, charitable donations,
interactions with health care providers that prescribe products for uses not approved by the FDA and financial support for continuing medical education programs, must be conducted within narrowly prescribed and controlled limits to avoid the
possibility of wrongfully influencing health care providers to prescribe or purchase particular products or as a reward for past prescribing. Violations of the Anti-Kickback Law may be punished by civil and criminal penalties or exclusion from
participation in federal health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Federal False Claims Act (&#147;FCA&#148;) is
violated by any entity that &#147;presents or causes to be presented&#148; knowingly false claims for payment to the federal government. In addition, the Health Care Reform Law amended the FCA to create a cause of action against any person who
knowingly makes a false statement material to an obligation to pay money to the government or knowingly conceals or improperly decreases an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the government. For the purposes of these recent
amendments, an &#147;obligation&#148; includes an identified overpayment, which is defined broadly to include &#147;any funds that a person receives or retains under Medicare and Medicaid to which the person, after applicable reconciliation, is not
entitled&#133;&#148; The FCA is commonly used to sue those who submit allegedly false Medicare or Medicaid claims, as well as those who induce or assist others to submit a false claim. &#147;False claims&#148; can result not only from

heightened enforcement activity over the past few years, and significant enforcement activity has been the result of &#147;relators,&#148; who serve as whistleblowers by filing complaints in the name of the United States (and if applicable,
particular states) under federal and state false claims laws. Under the federal FCA, relators can be entitled to receive up to 30% of total recoveries. Violations of the FCA can result in treble damages, and each false claim submitted can be subject
to a civil penalty, which, for penalties assessed after January 29, 2018 whose associated violations occurred after November 2, 2015, ranges from a minimum of $11,181 to a maximum of $22,363 per claim. Most states have adopted similar state false
claims laws, and these state laws have their own penalties which may be in addition to federal FCA penalties. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Health Care Reform Law
significantly strengthened the federal FCA and federal Anti-Kickback Law provisions, which could lead to the possibility of increased whistleblower or relator suits, and among other things made clear that a federal Anti-Kickback Law violation can be
a basis for federal FCA liability. The bringing of any FCA action, even if unsuccessful could require us to devote resources to investigate and defend the action, as well as result in reputational harm. Failure to comply with fraud and abuse laws
could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and costs, including the loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state health care programs, and could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, many
of these laws are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts and have been subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation by prosecutorial and regulatory authorities, increasing the risk of noncompliance. We cannot
predict whether changes in applicable law, or interpretation of laws, or changes in our services or marketing practices in response to changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws, could have a material adverse effect on our business. </P>

financial prospects could be affected by changes in health care spending and policy in the United States and abroad. We operate in a highly regulated industry and new laws or judicial decisions, or new interpretations of existing laws or decisions,
related to health care availability, the method of delivery or payment for health care products and services could negatively impact our business, operations and financial condition. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For example, in the United States there is significant interest in promoting health care reform, as evidenced by the enactment in the United
States of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the companion Health Care Reform Law. The Health Care Reform Law increased federal oversight of private health insurance plans and included a number of provisions designed to reduce
Medicare expenditures and the cost of health care generally, to reduce fraud and abuse, and to provide access to increased health coverage. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Health Care Reform Law has also imposed substantial changes to the U.S. system for paying for health care, including programs to extend
medical benefits to millions of individuals who have lacked insurance coverage. Generally, implementation of the Health Care Reform Law has thus far included significant cost-saving, revenue and payment reduction measures with respect to, for
example, several government health care programs that might cover our products in the United States, should they be commercialized, including Medicaid and Medicare. Additional downward pricing pressure associated with the Health Care Reform Law
includes that the Health Care Reform Law established and provided significant funding for a Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to coordinate and fund Comparative Effectiveness Research, as those terms are defined in the Health Care Reform
Law. While the stated intent of Comparative Effectiveness Research is to develop information to guide providers to the most efficacious therapies, outcomes of Comparative Effectiveness Research could influence the reimbursement or coverage for
therapies that are determined to be less cost effective than others. Should any of our products be approved for sale, but then determined to be less cost effective than alternative therapies, the levels of reimbursement for these products, or the
willingness to reimburse at all, could be impacted, which could materially impact our financial results. </P>

replace legislation was passed in the House of Representatives, but did not obtain the necessary votes in the Senate. Subsequently, the President has affirmed his intention to repeal and replace the Health Care Reform Law and has taken a number of
administrative actions to materially weaken the Health Care Reform Law. For example, on January 20, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the Health Care Reform Law to
waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the Health Care Reform Law that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of
pharmaceuticals or medical devices. Further, on December 22, 2017, President Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act into law, which repealed the individual mandate of the Health Care Reform Law. The uncertain status of the Health Care Reform Law
limits our ability to forecast changes that may occur in the future, and its repeal without adequate replacement may have a negative impact on our business. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Another provision of the Health Care Reform Law, generally referred to as the Physician Payment Sunshine Act or Open Payments Program, has
imposed new reporting and disclosure requirements for pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers and distributors with certain <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">FDA-approved</FONT> products, such as approved vaccines, with regard to payments or
other transfers of value made to certain U.S. health care practitioners, such as physicians and academic medical centers, and with regard to certain ownership interests held by physicians in reporting entities. The CMS publishes information from
these reports on a publicly available website, including amounts transferred and the physician and teaching hospital identities. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under
the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, should any of our products be approved for sale, we may be required to collect and report detailed information regarding certain financial relationships we have with physicians and teaching hospitals. Our

member states have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently. This has led to significant variations in the regimes of the different member states. Under the current regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated it must
be approved in each of the European Union countries where the trial is to be conducted by the relevant National Competent Authority (NCA), and one or more Ethics Committees (ECs), and a Clinical Trial Authorization must be obtained. </P>

governing preclinical testing of biologics. Sponsors usually must conduct pharmacodynamic (PD) studies, such as <I>in vitro</I> binding assays and <I>in vivo</I> studies that assess the product&#146;s pharmacologic activity and define its mechanism
of action. Biologics typically undergo single- and repeat-dose toxicity studies using relevant species. Safety pharmacology studies, which evaluate the product&#146;s functional effects on major body systems and specific organs, and local tolerance
testing can be done separately or subsumed in toxicity testing. Sponsors also usually conduct single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetic (PK) and/or toxicokinetic studies to assess absorption, disposition, exposure and clearance (in particular,
antibody-mediated clearance), and explore dose-response relationships. This information is used to predict margins of safety for human studies. Immunogenicity testing might include screening and mechanistic studies. </P>

Trials </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Clinical trials of biologics must comply with GCP, as described in Directive 2005/28/EC on Good Clinical Practice and the
ICH E6 guideline, which the CHMP has adopted. The directive and guideline describe general governing principles for clinical trials. The rights, safety and well-being of trial subjects must prevail over the interests of science and society.
Investigators must obtain freely given informed consent from every trial subject before each subject is enrolled. Clinical trial information must be handled, recorded and stored with respect for relevant confidentiality and privacy rules. Trials
must comply with the ethical principles of the World Medical Association&#146;s Declaration of Helsinki. Specific GCP guidelines apply to trials of advanced therapy medicinal products. These guidelines regulate issues such as the donation,
procurement and testing of human tissues and cells; the implementation of a traceability system; and specific rules on safety reporting and long-term <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">follow-up.</FONT> Under the Clinical Trials Directive, special
requirements apply to clinical trials conducted on minors and other persons not able to give informed legal consent. These requirements are intended to preserve the dignity of the trial subjects, confirm that the benefits of the trial outweigh the
risks and ensure that subjects&#146; representatives give consent with as much involvement of the subject as possible. Competent authorities must record information regarding trials in the European database of clinical trials which is accessible
only to other competent authorities, the European Medicines Agency (&#147;EMA&#148;), and the European Commission. CHMP has issued a guideline on quality requirements during the clinical trial period for investigational medicinal products containing
biological or biotechnology-derived substances. The guideline describes quality documentation that should be submitted to the competent authority as part of the sponsor&#146;s investigational medicinal product dossier (&#147;IMPD&#148;). The IMPD
should include, among other things, (i)&nbsp;an adequate description of the process and process controls, including a flow chart of all successive steps and details of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">in-process</FONT> testing and (ii)&nbsp;a
description and justification of &#147;any reprocessing during manufacture of the drug substance.&#148; The guideline also recognizes that sponsors will improve and optimize their manufacturing processes during clinical development and describes the
steps sponsors should take following these changes. Specifically, the sponsor must compare the quality attributes of the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-</FONT> and post-change biological active substances and relevant intermediates, and
conduct a comparability exercise where necessary. For <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">first-in-human</FONT></FONT> clinical trials, sponsors should use product representative of the material used during the <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-clinical</FONT> testing phase. Finally, with regard to characterization, the guideline requires details on the biological activity to be provided, recognizing that the extent of characterization data will further
increase in later phases. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Study Design Considerations </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">General regulatory guidance on study design applies to biologics as well as small molecule medicines. According to the guidance, there is a
&#147;close, but variable correlation&#148; between phase of development and type of study, but one type of trial can occur in several different phases. The guidance therefore identifies the most typical kind of study for each phase. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Phase 1 usually involves the initial introduction of the investigational product into human subjects, and studies in this phase usually have <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-therapeutic</FONT> objectives. Specifically, Phase 1 studies typically investigate initial safety and tolerability, PK, PD and/or drug activity, to preliminarily determine the potential therapeutic benefit of a
medicine. Phase 1 studies may be conducted in healthy volunteers or certain types of patients. If the medicine has significant potential toxicity (e.g., cytotoxic products), the trial will usually be conducted in patients. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The most typical Phase 2 study is a therapeutic exploratory study that explores efficacy in narrowly defined, relatively homogenous groups of

and comparisons with baseline status). Subsequent Phase 2 trials usually are randomized and concurrently controlled, allowing for evaluation of the medicine&#146;s safety and efficacy for a
particular indication. A major goal of this phase is to determine the dose(s) for Phase 3 trials. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Phase 3 typically involves therapeutic
confirmatory studies that are designed to verify the preliminary evidence obtained in Phase 2 and to provide a sufficient basis for marketing authorization. Phase 3 studies may also further explore the dose response relationship, or explore the
drug&#146;s use in wider populations, in different stages of disease, or in combination with another drug. With regard to medicines administered for long periods, extended exposure trials ordinarily occur during Phase 3, although the sponsor may
start them in Phase 2. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">To ensure that clinical trials in all three phases of development will be adequate to support a Marketing
Authorization Application (&#147;MAA&#148;), sponsors should design these trials with the MAA requirements in mind. Biologics in general need to comply with the requirements set out in Part III of the Annex I to Directive 2003/63/EC, and advanced
therapy medicinal products need to comply with the requirements described in Part&nbsp;IV. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Consultation with the European Medicines Agency
</I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A sponsor may obtain, from the EMA, scientific advice regarding clinical trial protocols. Although this advice does not bind the
ethics committees or NCAs and is not binding for purposes of a future MAA, it can be useful to guide revisions to the protocol. The agency&#146;s remarks will only address scientific issues and will generally focus on matters such as the selection
of endpoints and comparator, the duration of treatment or <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">follow-up</FONT> and the design of pivotal studies. Advice also might address a sponsor&#146;s proposal to deviate from a CHMP guideline. If the applicant
decides not to follow the EMA&#146;s advice, it should justify this decision in its MAA. EMA guidance details the procedures for requesting scientific advice. The fact that an applicant requests advice from EMA does not preclude it from also seeking
advice from national competent authorities or from foreign regulators, such as the FDA. The process of obtaining advice from the national competent authorities is often less formal than requesting advice from the EMA, and such advice can prove
helpful. Consequently, seeking such advice is a common choice among applicants. Applicants also may seek parallel scientific advice from the EMA and FDA. Generally, the parallel scientific procedure is available for &#147;important breakthrough
drugs,&#148; that is, products that the EMA and FDA have identified as falling within therapeutic areas of overlapping interest (e.g., oncology products, vaccines and blood products). The goal of these meetings is to provide clarity regarding the
regulatory requirements of each region and the reasons for any differences between them. A sponsor requesting parallel scientific advice should authorize the agencies to exchange all information about the product, including trade secrets. After the
parallel scientific advice procedure, each agency will provide its own independent advice on the questions at issue. There is no guarantee of harmonized advice or identical regulatory decisions on the approvability of the product. </P>

biotechnological methods, such as recombinant DNA technology; controlled expression of genes coding for biologically active proteins in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, including transformed mammalian cells; and hybridoma and mAb methods. For example,
cell therapy, gene therapy, vaccines from strains developed through recombinant DNA technology (including gene deletion), and &#147;any medicinal product for which a monoclonal antibody is used at any stage in the manufacturing process&#148; are all
subject to the Centralized Procedure. Nonetheless, some biologics are still approved at the member state level. For example, many vaccines do not fall within the scope of the Centralized Procedure. The EMA has published a guideline intended to
harmonize the summaries of product characteristics and patient information leaflets for human vaccines. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">With respect to the Centralized
Procedure, the approval standards for biotechnology products are the same as for chemically synthesized medicines. Both types of products must be safe and effective and have appropriate quality. Because of their special characteristics, however,
biotechnology products must comply with several additional dossier requirements. The MAA for a biotechnology product must meet the standard dossier submission requirements, as described in Article 8 of the Medicines Directive (2001/83/EC).
Consequently, the MAA must generally comply with the Common Technical Document format, including with respect to Module I (administrative information, including labeling and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">mock-ups),</FONT> Module 2 (various
summaries), Module 3 (chemical, pharmaceutical and biological information), Module 4 <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">(non-clinical</FONT> reports) and Module 5 (clinical study reports). MAAs for biologics also must meet special requirements. The

the transmission of animal spongiform encephalopathies; (iii)&nbsp;if cell banks are used, demonstrate that cell characteristics remain unchanged at the passage level for production (and beyond); (iv) provide information as to whether there are
adventitious agents in seed materials, cell banks, pools of serum or plasma, and all other materials of biological origin, and, if it is not possible to avoid the presence of potentially pathogenic adventitious agents, show that further processing
ensures elimination or inactivation of the agents; (v)&nbsp;if possible, base vaccine production on a seed lot system and established cell banks; (vi)&nbsp;in case of medicines derived from human blood or plasma, describe the origin, criteria and
procedures for the collection, transportation and storage of the starting material; and (vii)&nbsp;describe the manufacturing facilities and equipment. Other special rules apply certain types of biological medicines. For example, for plasma-derived

implemented and reported based on principles equivalent to those of the Clinical Trials Directive with regard to good clinical practice and ethical principles. Moreover, they should comply with
the ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. The applicant must submit a statement declaring such compliance as part of the MAA. In December 2008, the EMA published a strategy paper on the acceptance of data from foreign clinical
trials conducted in &#147;third countries,&#148; particularly those outside the &#147;&#145;traditional&#146; Western European and North American research areas.&#148; According to this strategy paper, there is a &#147;growing concern both among
regulators and in public debate about how well these trials are conducted from an ethical and scientific/organizational standpoint.&#148; The EMA has called for increased cooperation between international regulatory authorities involved in the
supervision of clinical trials and has put forth other proposals to address these issues. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Manufacturing and Source of Supply </B></P>

yet generated revenues from product sales. To date, substantially all of our revenues have been derived from grants and contracts with governmental agencies, primarily our BARDA contract for our anthrax vaccine product candidate. We have incurred
net losses in most periods since our inception, including a net loss of $46.4&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2017 and a net loss of $ 11.1&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016. As of December&nbsp;31, 2017, we
have an accumulated deficit of $77.9&nbsp;million. To date, we have not received regulatory approvals for any products or generated any revenues from the sale of products, and we do not expect to generate any product revenues in the foreseeable
future. We do not know whether or when we will generate product revenues or become profitable. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have devoted most of our financial
resources to research and development, including preclinical and clinical development of product candidates. We have not completed pivotal clinical trials for any product candidate. Our leading product candidates remain in early stage clinical
development, and it will be several years, if ever, before we have a product candidate ready for commercialization. Even if we obtain regulatory approval to market a product candidate, our future revenues will depend upon the size of any markets in
which our product candidates have received approval, our ability to achieve sufficient market acceptance, reimbursement from third-party payers and other factors. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The net losses we incur may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year, such that a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">period-to-period</FONT></FONT> comparison of our results of operations may not be a good indication of our future performance. In any particular quarter or quarters, our operating results could be below the expectations of

commercialize our current and future product candidates. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">To become and remain profitable, we must succeed in developing and
eventually commercializing products that generate significant revenue. This will require us to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including completing preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates, discovering
additional product candidates, obtaining regulatory approval for these product candidates, forming strategic partnerships and alliances with third parties and manufacturing, marketing and selling any products for which we may obtain regulatory
approval. We are only in the preliminary stages of most of these activities. We may never succeed in these activities and, even if we do, we may never generate revenues that are significant enough to achieve profitability. If some or all of our
product candidates do not prove to be safe, pure and efficacious, then we may have to abandon those product candidates altogether and we will be unable to generate revenues from sales of such products. </P>

amended.&nbsp;The TJCA, among other things, contains significant changes to corporate taxation, including reduction of the corporate tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%, limitation of the tax deduction for interest expense
to 30% of adjusted earnings (except for certain small businesses), limitation of the deduction for net operating losses to 80% of current year taxable income in respect of net operating losses generated during or after 2018 and elimination of net
operating loss carrybacks, one time taxation of offshore earnings at reduced rates regardless of whether they are repatriated, elimination of U.S. tax on foreign earnings (subject to certain important exceptions), immediate deductions for certain
new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, and modifying or repealing many business deductions and credits.&nbsp;Notwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, the overall impact of the new federal tax
law is uncertain and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected.&nbsp;In addition, it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the newly enacted federal tax law.&nbsp;The impact of this tax reform on

also eliminates the ability to carry back net operating losses to prior years, but allows net operating losses generated after 2017 to be carried forward indefinitely. As such, there is a risk that due to such items, our existing net operating

Clinical trials with this product candidate showed that it was well tolerated and able to induce robust T cell responses against the viral sequences represented, but a comparison of the entire study population in later-stage clinical trials showed

which is uncertain. In order to obtain regulatory approval for the commercial sale of any product candidate, we must demonstrate through extensive preclinical studies and clinical trials that the product candidate is safe and effective for use in
each target indication. Even if we obtain regulatory approval, that approval may be for indications or patient populations that are not as broad as intended or desired or may require labeling that includes significant use or distribution
restrictions or safety warnings. Also, we may gain regulatory approval for our leading product candidates or our other preclinical product candidates in some but not all of the jurisdictions we seek to obtain regulatory approval. For example,
failure to obtain regulatory approval of our products in any of the U.S., European or Japanese markets would materially and adversely affect the Company. Failure to obtain regulatory approval of some but not all of the target indications may result
in limited commercial opportunity for the approved product. We may never obtain regulatory approval for these product candidates in any jurisdiction. We also may be required to perform additional or unanticipated clinical trials to obtain approval
or be subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements to maintain regulatory approval. In addition, regulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the product or impose restrictions on its distribution in the form of a modified risk
evaluation and mitigation strategy. </P>

product candidates using our proprietary RespirVec and Densigen platforms, including our leading product candidates, NasoVAX and HepTcell, and to progress those product candidates through clinical development for the treatment of different types of
diseases. We are also focused on SparVax L acquired in connection with the Mergers. We may not be able to develop products that are safe and effective for all or any of the indications that we target. Even if we are successful in building a product
pipeline, the potential product candidates that we identify may not be suitable for clinical development for a number of reasons, including causing harmful side effects or demonstrating other characteristics that indicate a low likelihood of
receiving marketing approval or achieving market acceptance. If our methods of identifying potential product candidates fail to produce a pipeline of potentially viable product candidates, then our success as a business will be dependent on the
success of fewer potential product candidates, which introduces risks to our business model and potential limitations to any success we may achieve. </P>

fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future discovery and preclinical development programs and product candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially
viable products. Furthermore, until such time as we are able to build a broader product candidate pipeline, if ever, any adverse developments with respect to our leading product candidates, NasoVAX and HepTcell, would have a more significant adverse

with our approaches to vaccines and immunotherapy may prevent further development or approval of our product candidates. Because of the novelty of our approaches, there may be unknown safety risks associated with the vaccines that we develop or the
clinical endpoints that we establish in trials may not be generally accepted by regulatory agencies, which may therefore require us to perform large field studies to demonstrate efficacy. There can be no assurance that any development problems we

pose an increased safety risk to patients. Adjuvants are compounds that are added to vaccine antigens to enhance the activation and improve immune response and efficacy of vaccines. Development of vaccines with novel adjuvants requires evaluation in
larger numbers of patients prior to approval than would be typical for therapeutic drugs. Guidelines for evaluation of vaccines with novel adjuvants have been established by the FDA and other regulatory bodies and expert committees. The safety of
any vaccine, because of the presence of an adjuvant, may have side effects considered to pose too great a risk to patients to warrant approval of the vaccine. Traditionally, regulatory authorities have required extensive study of novel adjuvants
because vaccines typically get administered to healthy populations, in particular infants, children and the elderly, </P>

vaccines. For example, GSK pulled from the market an approved vaccine to prevent Lyme disease (Lymerix) in February 2002 after anecdotal evidence of joint pain resulted in subjects&#146; unwillingness to receive the vaccine. The FDA found no
evidence that the vaccine caused a safety risk; however, GSK pulled the vaccine due to low sales resulting from the negative public perception associated with the reports on joint pain. In addition, parental aversion to new vaccines or vaccines in

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our reliance on these third parties for research and development activities will reduce our control over these activities but will not relieve
us of our responsibilities. For example, the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities require compliance with applicable law, regulations and standards, including GCP, for designing, conducting, monitoring, recording, analyzing and reporting the
results of clinical trials to assure that the data and results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial participants are protected. Although we rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials, we are

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Furthermore, if these third parties do not successfully carry out their duties under their agreements, if the quality or accuracy of the data
they obtain is compromised due to their failure to adhere to clinical trial protocols or to regulatory requirements, or if they otherwise fail to comply with clinical trial protocols or meet expected deadlines, then the clinical trials of our
product candidates may not meet regulatory requirements. If clinical trials do not meet regulatory requirements or if these third parties need to be replaced, then preclinical development activities or clinical trials may be extended, delayed,
suspended or terminated. If any of these events occur, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates on a timely basis or at all. </P>

and development efforts, conducting testing and clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals to market products, manufacturing such products on a broad scale and marketing approved products. These companies also have significantly greater
research and marketing capabilities than we do and may also have products that have been approved or are in late stages of development, and have collaborative arrangements in our target markets with leading companies and research institutions.
Established pharmaceutical companies may also invest heavily to accelerate discovery and development of novel compounds or to <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">in-license</FONT> novel compounds that could make the products that we develop obsolete.

competing products more rapidly than we do. A number of companies of varying sizes are also pursuing the development of a &#147;universal&#148; flu vaccine. In addition, we have substantial competition for government funding, particularly for our
anthrax vaccine program. As a result of all of these factors, our competitors may succeed in obtaining patent protection and/or FDA approval or discovering, developing and commercializing products before we do. In addition, any new product that we

The loss of the services of our executive officers or other key employees could impede the achievement of our research, development and commercialization objectives and seriously harm our ability to successfully implement our business strategy.
Furthermore, replacing executive officers and key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in our industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to successfully

numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for similar personnel. We also experience competition for the hiring of scientific and clinical personnel from universities and research institutions. In addition, we rely on consultants and
advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating our research and development and commercialization strategy. Our consultants and advisors may be employed by employers other than the Company and may have commitments

requirements or policies, or not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that may have been obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our business. </P>

or if any product approvals we obtain do not provide us with the exclusivity periods we hope to achieve, the sales of our products could be adversely affected. </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As part of the ongoing efforts of governmental authorities to lower health care costs by facilitating generic competition to pharmaceutical
products, the BPCIA enacted as part of the Health Care Reform Law, created a new abbreviated regulatory approval pathway in the United States for biological products that are found to be &#147;biosimilar&#148; to or &#147;interchangeable&#148; with
a biological &#147;reference product&#148; previously licensed under a BLA. This abbreviated approval pathway is intended to permit a biosimilar to come to market more quickly and less expensively by relying to some extent on the data generated by
the reference product&#146;s sponsor and the FDA&#146;s previous review and approval of the reference product. Under the BPCIA, a biosimilar sponsor&#146;s ability to seek or obtain approval through the abbreviated pathway is limited by periods of
exclusivity granted by the FDA to the holder of the reference product&#146;s BLA, and no biosimilar application may be accepted by the FDA for review until four years after the date the reference product was first licensed by the FDA, and no
biosimilar application, once accepted, may receive final approval until 12 years after the reference product was first licensed by the FDA<I>.</I> </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Once approved, biosimilars likely would compete with, and in some circumstances may be deemed under applicable laws to be
&#147;interchangeable with,&#148; the previously approved reference product. The extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, will be substituted for any one of our product candidates, if approved, in a way that is similar to traditional generic
substitution for <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-biological</FONT> products is not yet clear, and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing. Although there is uncertainty regarding the impact of
this new program, it seems likely that if any of our product candidates are approved by the FDA, there is risk that the approval of a biosimilar competitor to one of our products could have an adverse impact on our business. In particular, a
biosimilar could be significantly less costly to bring to market and priced significantly lower than our product, if approved by the FDA. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We may also be subject to competition from biosimilar products in Europe. To date, 27 biosimilar products have been authorized by the EMA. As
in the United States the regulatory approval pathway for biosimilar products in Europe is abbreviated. A biosimilar sponsor must however still provide all of the preclinical and clinical data required to demonstrate the similarity of their product
with the reference product. The level of data required is assessed on a case by case basis but it will be less than that required for an original biological product. The pathway is more complex than the abridged procedure that may be followed to
obtain authorization of a generic version of a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-biological</FONT> product but it would still allow the biosimilar product to be brought to market more quickly and less expensively than our original product. That
said, in Europe applications for marketing authorizations in relation to biosimilar products are subject to the same data and market exclusivity as apply to generic <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-biologic</FONT> products so no biosimilar
product could be approved or placed on the market during the periods such exclusivity applies to our product. Marketing authorization of a biosimilar product in Europe does not guarantee that the biosimilar product may be substituted for the
reference product. Interchangeability of a biosimilar product with the reference product is not assessed by the EMA but this determination is left to each of the member states. We cannot know at this stage the extent to which any biosimilar product
would be interchangeable with our reference product, and this may vary between member states. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Pediatric exclusivity is another type of
regulatory market exclusivity our competitors may pursue. In the United States, the FDA has the authority to award additional exclusivity for approved products where the sponsor conducts specified testing on pediatric or adolescent populations upon
the written request of the FDA. If granted, pediatric exclusivity adds six months to existing exclusivity periods applicable to biological products under the </P>

BPCIA&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;namely, the four-year period during which the FDA will not consider an applicable for a biosimilar product, and the twelve-year period during which the FDA will not approve
a biosimilar application. This <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">six-month</FONT> exclusivity, which runs from the end of these exclusivity protection periods, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with
an FDA-issued &#147;written request&#148; for such trial. In Europe, as well, pediatric studies are incentivized by the reward of additional exclusivity. Pediatric Investigation Plans (&#147;PIPs&#148;), are determined by the Pediatric Committee of
the EMA. Where an application for a marketing authorization is submitted in respect of a medicinal product designated as an orphan medicinal product and that application contains the results of the PIP studies, market exclusivity for that orphan
medicinal product is extended by two years if the product is authorized across Europe. We may pursue pediatric exclusivity for one or more of our product candidates but may not succeed in obtaining it. There is also a risk that a competitor may
achieve pediatric exclusivity that would delay any potential approvals of our product candidates. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Orphan drug designation presents yet
another regulatory incentive that may be available to us and our competitors. The FDA may grant orphan drug designation to products intended to treat a &#147;rare disease or condition&#148; that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United
States, or affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for such disease or condition will be recovered from
sales in the United States of such drug. Organ drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation can provide opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax
advantages and FDA user fee exemptions. In addition, if a product that has an orphan drug designation subsequently receives FDA approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product may be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity,
which means the FDA would not approve any other application to market the same drug for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity or a meaningfully
different mode of administration. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the European Union, orphan drug status offers similar but not identical benefits as those in the
United States. We may pursue orphan drug designation for one or more of our product candidates but obtaining such designation cannot be assured. Additionally, should a competitor receive orphan drug designation for a product to treat the same
disease and same indication as one of our product candidates, there is a risk that the FDA or a comparable European regulatory body could delay approving our product candidate. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Developing a drug product, such as NasoShield, to address biological warfare involves special considerations, including compliance with the
&#147;Animal Rule,&#148; that may increase drug development delays and costs, and result in a longer and more uncertain regulatory approval process. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under a special FDA procedure available for studying certain biological warfare products, such as NasoShield, our anthrax vaccine product
candidate, the FDA makes available a research pathway known as the &#147;Animal Rule,&#148; which permits the conduct of clinical trials without exposing human subjects to deadly substances, such as anthrax. These regulations authorize the FDA to
rely on evidence from animal studies to provide evidence of a product&#146;s effectiveness under circumstances where there is a reasonably well-understood mechanism for the toxicity of the agent. Under these requirements, and with the FDA&#146;s
prior agreement, biologics used to reduce or prevent the toxicity of chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear substances may be approved for use in humans based on evidence of effectiveness derived from appropriate animal studies and any
additional supporting data. Products evaluated for effectiveness under this rule are evaluated for safety under preexisting requirements for establishing the safety of new drug and biological products, including Phase 1 through Phase 2 clinical
trials. Under certain circumstances a single animal species may be acceptable if that animal model is sufficiently well-characterized for predicting a response in humans. The animal study endpoint must be clearly related to the desired benefit in
humans and the information obtained from animal studies must allow for selection of an effective dose in humans. The Animal Rule also requires post-marketing studies, such as field studies, to verify and describe the product&#146;s clinical benefit
and assess its safety should an exigency exist that leads to the product being used in humans; the nature of these studies will be discussed with FDA as part of the BLA process. Products approved under the Animal Rule are subject to additional
requirements, such as restrictions imposed on marketing or distribution or requirements to provide information to patients. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Compliance with the Animal Rule, would generally require us to utilize animal model studies
for efficacy and provide certain animal and human safety data in order to obtain FDA approval for our anthrax vaccine product candidate. The Animal Rule drug development pathway typically involves costs and delays in excess of what would be expended
in conducting human vaccine clinical trials not requiring compliance with the Animal Rule. Although there is an alternative regulatory pathway available for biological warfare drug candidates, called Emergency Use Authorization, which avoids the
Animal Rule&#146;s reliance on animal models focused on efficacy, there can be no assurance that this alternative model will apply to our anthrax vaccine product candidate. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Developing appropriate animal models in compliance with the Animal Rule is a time-consuming and expensive research effort. Further, we may not
be able to sufficiently demonstrate the animal correlation to the satisfaction of the FDA, as these corollaries are difficult to establish and are often unclear. The FDA may decide that our data is insufficient for approval and require additional <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-clinical,</FONT> clinical or other studies, refuse to approve our products, or place restrictions on our ability to commercialize those products. As a general matter, complying with the Animal Rule involves a more
uncertain pathway to regulatory approval, as relatively few products have been approved in this manner. This means that it may be particularly difficult for us to predict the timing or ultimate success of receiving FDA approval for NasoShield.
Further, other countries have not, at this time, established criteria for review and approval of these types of products outside their normal review process; i.e., there is no Animal Rule equivalent, and consequently there can be no assurance that
we will be able to make a submission for marketing approval in foreign countries based on such animal data. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Additionally, few facilities
in the United States and internationally have the capability to perform animal testing with anthrax or otherwise assist us in qualifying the requisite animal models. We compete with other biodefense companies for access to this limited pool of
highly specialized resources. We therefore may not be able to secure contracts to conduct testing of our anthrax vaccine product candidate in a predictable timeframe or at all. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Additionally, under the Project BioShield Act of 2004 (&#147;Project BioShield&#148;), the Secretary of HHS may, with the concurrence of the
Secretary of DHS and upon the approval of the President, contract to purchase unapproved medical countermeasures for the SNS, in specified circumstances. The U.S. Congress is notified of a recommendation for a stockpile purchase after Presidential
approval. Project BioShield specifies that a company supplying the countermeasure to the SNS is paid on delivery of a substantial portion of the countermeasure. To be eligible for purchase under these provisions, the Secretary of HHS must determine
that there are sufficient and satisfactory clinical results or research data, including data, if available, from preclinical studies and clinical trials, to support a reasonable conclusion that the countermeasure will qualify for approval or

primarily British pounds, into U.S. dollars for our consolidated financial statements. During periods of a strengthening U.S. dollar, our reported revenues and net income could be reduced because foreign currencies may translate into fewer U.S.

as to its impact may adversely affect business activity and economic conditions in Europe and globally and could continue to contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets. Brexit could also have the effect of disrupting

the rights necessary to prevent competition from third parties, which may impair the commercial success of any product candidate that we may develop. There is no assurance that all potentially relevant prior art relating to our patents and patent
applications or those of our licensors has been found, and prior art that we have not identified could be used by a third party to invalidate a patent or prevent a patent from issuing from a pending patent application. Furthermore, even if they are
unchallenged, our patents and patent applications, or those of our licensors, may not adequately protect our technology, provide exclusivity for our product candidates, prevent others from designing around our patents with similar products, or

intellectual property rights in some foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of
our patents generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or
interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing, and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be
commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license. The earliest any

of a patent is 20 years from the date that the application for the patent is filed. In some cases, the term of a U.S. patent is shortened by a terminal disclaimer that reduces its term to that of an earlier-expiring patent. Various extensions of
patent term may be available in particular countries; however, in all circumstances the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, has a limited term. If we encounter delays in obtaining regulatory approvals, the period of time during which we
could market a product under patent protection could be reduced. We expect to seek extensions of patent terms where these are available in any countries where we are prosecuting patents. Such possible extensions include those permitted under the
Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 in the United States, which permits a patent term extension of up to five years to cover an <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">FDA-approved</FONT> product. The actual length of the
extension will depend on the amount of patent term lost while the product was in clinical trials. However, the applicable authorities, including the USPTO and FDA in the United States, and any equivalent regulatory authority in other countries, may
not agree with our assessment of whether such extensions are available, and may refuse to grant extensions to our patents, or may grant more limited extensions than we request. If this occurs, our competitors may be able to take advantage of our
investment in development and clinical trials by referencing our clinical and preclinical data, and then may be able to launch their product earlier than might otherwise be the case. </P>

issued, the risk increases that our product candidates may be subject to claims of infringement of the patent rights of third parties. We may not have identified all U.S. and foreign patents or published patent applications that affect our business

November&nbsp;29, 2000 and certain patent applications filed after that date that will not be filed outside the United States remain confidential until issued as patents. Except for the preceding exceptions, patent applications in the United States
and elsewhere are generally published only after a waiting period of approximately 18 months after the earliest filing. Therefore, patent applications covering our platform technology or our product candidates could have been filed by others without
our knowledge. Additionally, pending patent applications which have been published can, subject to certain limitations, be later amended in a manner that could cover our platform technologies or product candidates and/or the use, analysis and/or
manufacture of our product candidates. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If any third-party patents are held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover aspects of our

may be substantial and may include treble damages and attorneys&#146; fees for willful infringement. An award of injunctive relief could block our ability to develop and commercialize the applicable product candidate until such patent expired or
unless we obtain a license. Such licenses may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, the rights may be <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-exclusive,</FONT> which could result in our competitors

compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to manage any future growth effectively. To that end, we must be able to manage our development efforts and clinical trials effectively and hire, train and integrate additional management,

Any future acquisitions also could result in the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or future write-offs of intangible assets or goodwill, any of which could have a negative impact on our cash flows, financial condition and results of

Alternatively, it may be necessary for us to raise additional funds for these activities through public or private financings or through the issuance of debt. Additional funds may not be available on terms that are favorable to the Company, or at

However, there is often significant competition for these contracts, grants and loans, and the process of obtaining government and other contracts, grants and loans is lengthy and uncertain. Entities offering contracts, grants or loans may have

an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities, it may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or prohibition

in the United States there is significant interest in promoting health care reform, as evidenced by the enactment in the United States of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care Reform Law. The Health Care Reform Law

Reform Law includes that the Health Care Reform Law established and provided significant funding for a Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to coordinate and fund Comparative Effectiveness Research, as those terms are defined in the Health
Care Reform Law. While the stated intent of Comparative Effectiveness Research is to develop information to guide providers to the most efficacious therapies, outcomes of Comparative Effectiveness Research could influence the reimbursement or
coverage for therapies that are determined to be less cost effective than others. Should any of our products be approved for sale, but then determined to be less cost effective than alternative therapies, the levels of reimbursement for these
products, or the willingness to reimburse at all, could be impacted, which could materially impact our financial results. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">President Trump
is seeking to repeal and replace the Health Care Reform Law. Repeal and replace legislation was passed in the House of Representatives, but did not obtain the necessary votes in the Senate. Subsequently, President Trump affirmed his intention to
repeal and replace the Health Care Reform Law and has taken a number of administrative actions to materially weaken the Health Care Reform Law. For example, on January 20, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies
with authorities and responsibilities under the Health Care Reform Law to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the Health Care Reform Law that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states,
individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. Further, on December 22, 2017, President Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act into law, which repealed the individual mandate of the Health
Care Reform Law. The uncertain status of the Health Care Reform Law affects our ability to plan, and its repeal without replacement could have a material adverse effect on our United States operations. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Another provision of the Health Care Reform Law, generally referred to as the Physician Payment Sunshine Act or Open Payments Program, has
imposed new reporting and disclosure requirements for pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers and distributions with certain <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">FDA-approved</FONT> products, such as approved vaccines, with regard to payments or
other transfers of value made to certain U.S. health care practitioners, such as physicians and academic medical centers, and with regard to certain ownership interests held by physicians in reporting entities. The CMS publishes information from

the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, should any of our products be approved for sale, we may be required to collect and report detailed information regarding certain financial relationships we have with physicians and teaching hospitals. Our

Company. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The laws that would govern our conduct in the United States upon the commercialization of our product candidates are
enforceable by criminal, civil and administrative penalties. Violations of laws such as the FD&amp;C Act, the FCA, the PHS Act, or provisions of the U.S. Social Security Act known as the &#147;Anti-Kickback Law&#148; and the &#147;Civil Monetary
Penalties Law,&#148; or any regulations promulgated under their authority, may result in jail sentences, fines or exclusion from federal and state programs, as may be determined by Medicare, Medicaid, the Department of Defense, other regulatory
authorities and the courts. There can be no assurance that our activities will not come under the scrutiny of regulators and other government authorities or that our practices will not be found to violate applicable laws, rules and regulations or
prompt lawsuits by private citizen &#147;relators&#148; under federal or state false claims laws. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Some of these laws, referred to as
&#147;false claims laws,&#148; prohibit the submission or causing the submission of false or fraudulent claims for reimbursement to federal, state and other health care payers and programs. Other laws, referred to as &#147;anti-kickback laws,&#148;
prohibit soliciting, offering, receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient or ordering, purchasing, leasing or arranging for, or recommending ordering, purchasing or leasing of, items or services that are paid for
by federal, state and other health care payers and programs. For example, the federal Anti-Kickback Law prohibits companies such as the Company from directly or indirectly soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration with the intent of
generating referrals or orders for services or items covered by a government health care program. Many states have enacted similar laws. Courts have interpreted this law very broadly, including by holding that a violation has occurred if even one
purpose of the remuneration is to generate referrals, even if there are other lawful purposes. There are statutory and regulatory exceptions, or safe harbors, that outline arrangements that are deemed lawful. However, the fact that an arrangement
does not fall within a safe harbor does not necessarily render the conduct illegal under the Anti-Kickback Law. In sum, even common business arrangements, such as discounted terms and volume incentives for customers in a position to recommend or
choose drugs for patients, such as physicians and hospitals, can result in substantial legal penalties, including, among others, exclusion from Medicare and Medicaid programs, and arrangements with referral sources must be structured with care to
comply with applicable requirements. Also, certain business practices, such as payment of consulting fees to health care providers, sponsorship of educational or research grants, charitable donations, interactions with health care providers that
prescribe products for uses not approved by the FDA and financial support for continuing medical education programs, must be conducted within narrowly prescribed and controlled limits to avoid the possibility of wrongfully influencing health care
providers to prescribe or purchase particular products or as a reward for past prescribing. Violations of the Anti-Kickback Law may be punished by civil and criminal penalties or exclusion from participation in federal health care programs,
including Medicare and Medicaid. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The FCA is violated by any entity that &#147;presents or causes to be presented&#148; knowingly false
claims for payment to the federal government. In addition, the Health Care Reform Law amended the FCA to create a cause of action against any person who knowingly makes a false statement material to an obligation to pay money to the government or
knowingly conceals or improperly decreases an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the government. For the purposes of these recent amendments, an &#147;obligation&#148; includes an identified overpayment, which is defined broadly to
include &#147;any funds that a person receives or retains under Medicare and Medicaid to which the person, after applicable reconciliation, is not entitled&#133;&#148; </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The FCA is commonly used to sue those who submit allegedly false Medicare or Medicaid claims, as well as those who induce or assist others to

been subject to varying interpretations, as well as heightened enforcement activity over the past few years. Significant enforcement activity has been the result of actions brought by relators,
who file complaints in the name of the United States (and if applicable, particular states) under federal and state FCA statutes. The qui tam and whistleblower provisions of the FCA allow private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the
government alleging that the government was defrauded, with tremendous potential financial gain (up to 30% of the government&#146;s recovery plus legal fees) to private citizens who prevail. Violations of the FCA can result in treble damages and
each false claim submitted can be subject to a civil penalty, which for penalties assessed after January 29, 2018 whose violations occurred after November 2, 2015, ranges from a minimum of $11,181 to a maximum of $22,363 per claim. Most states have
adopted similar state false claims laws, and these state laws have their own penalties which may be in addition to federal FCA penalties. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The bringing of any FCA action, even if unsuccessful, could require us to devote resources to investigate and defend the action, as well as
result in reputational harm. Failure to comply with the fraud and abuse laws could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and costs, including the loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state health care programs,
and could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, many of these laws are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts, and have been subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation by prosecutorial
and regulatory authorities, increasing the risk of noncompliance. We cannot predict whether changes in applicable law, or interpretation of laws, or changes in our services or marketing practices in response to changes in applicable law or
interpretation of laws could have a material adverse effect on our business. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, in
addition to prohibiting the promotion of the safety or effectiveness of product candidates not yet approved for commercialization, an act known as <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-approval</FONT> promotion, also generally restrict companies from
promoting approved products for indications other than those indications for which a product is approved, which is also referred to as <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">off-label</FONT> use. This means, for example, that we may not make claims about
the use of our products, should they be approved for sale, outside of their approved indications, and we may not proactively discuss or provide information regarding any of their <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">off-label</FONT> uses subject to very
specific and limited exceptions. In the United States, pharmaceutical companies have, to a limited extent, been recognized by the FDA as permitted to disseminate to physicians certain truthful and accurate information regarding unapproved uses of
approved products, or results of studies involving investigational products. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If we or our business partners fail to comply with
applicable laws and regulations governing <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">off-label</FONT> uses of our product candidates, if approved, then we could be subject to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions, including, but not limited to:
(i)&nbsp;enforcement proceedings by regulatory agencies; (ii)&nbsp;reduced demand for our products; and (iii)&nbsp;civil or criminal sanctions. Furthermore, actions under the FCA have recently been brought against companies for allegedly promoting <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">off-label</FONT> uses of drugs, because such promotion induces the use and subsequent claims for reimbursement under Medicare and other federal programs. Similar actions for
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">off-label</FONT> promotion have been initiated by several states for Medicaid fraud. The Health Care Reform Law significantly strengthened provisions of the FCA, Medicare and Medicaid Anti-Kickback provisions, and
other health care fraud provisions, leading to the possibility of greatly increased qui tam suits by relators for perceived violations. Violations or allegations of violations of the foregoing restrictions could materially and adversely affect our
business. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If our product candidates are commercialized, then we would also be required to report detailed and complex pricing

For example, the federal law, HIPAA, as amended by HITECH and its implementing regulations, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information, such as information that

A person may be a data controller even if the information is held by a third party. If we are the data controllers for any personal data, including, for example, with respect to clinical trials carried out in the United Kingdom, we will need to

exposed to the risk of fraudulent or other illegal activity by our employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, consultants, commercial partners and vendors. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless and/or
negligent conduct that fails to comply with the laws of the FDA and similar foreign regulatory bodies; fails to comply with manufacturing standards we have established, or with federal, state and foreign health care fraud and abuse laws and
regulations; fails to report financial information or data accurately, including to our regulators, such as the FDA and similar foreign regulatory bodies; or fails to disclose unauthorized activities to the Company. In particular, the promotion,
sale and marketing of health care items and services, as well as certain business arrangements in the health care industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent misconduct, including fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and
other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and, structuring and commissions, certain customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Activities subject to
these laws also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of patient recruitment for clinical trials. We have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics Policy and other policies and practices that are designed to help ensure
that the Company, our employees, officers, agents, intermediaries and other third parties comply with applicable laws, but it is not always possible to identify and deter such misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this
activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any
such actions are instituted against the Company, and in some cases regardless of the merits of those actions, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the costs of investigation, settlement arrangements, imposition of
civil, criminal and administrative penalties (such as Corporate Integrity Agreements and other arrangements, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, and possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health care
programs), contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Public Readiness Act creates general immunity for manufacturers of drug products used to address bioterrorism attacks, when the Secretary
of HHS issues a declaration for their manufacture, administration or use. The declaration is meant to provide general immunity from all claims under state or federal law for loss arising out of the administration or use of a covered drug product,
generally referred to as a &#147;countermeasure.&#148; Manufacturers are excluded from this protection in cases of willful misconduct. Although we believe that our anthrax vaccine product candidate is covered under the general immunity provisions of
the Public Readiness Act, there can be no assurance that this coverage will continue, or that the Secretary of HHS will make other declarations in the future that would cover any of our other product candidates, or that the U.S. Congress will not
act in the future to reduce coverage under the Public Readiness Act or to repeal it altogether. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, under the Public Readiness

injuries&#148; to which the program applies are defined as serious physical injuries or death. Individuals are permitted to bring a willful misconduct action against a manufacturer after they

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Additionally, we are considering applying for liability protection under the Support Anti-terrorism by the SAFETY Act, which provides certain
protections that would limit the damages potentially faced by companies who provide certain &#147;qualified&#148; anti-terrorism products. However, we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain or maintain coverage under the SAFETY Act. If the
U.S. Department of Homeland Security limits the scope of any coverage awarded to the Company, denies it coverage or continued coverage for a particular product or product candidate, or delays in making decisions about whether to grant it coverage,
we may become exposed to legal claims. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We are required to comply with certain export control laws which may limit our ability to sell our products

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our product candidates are subject to the Export Administration Regulations (&#147;EAR&#148;), administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce
and are, in certain instances subject to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (&#147;ITAR&#148;), administered by the U.S. Department of State. EAR restricts the export of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">dual-use</FONT> products and
technical data to certain countries, while ITAR restricts the export of defense products, technical data and defense services. In addition, EAR and ITAR may also regulate the disclosure to certain foreign nationals in the United States, such as
research staff, of technical data about controlled commodities. The U.S. government agencies responsible for administering EAR and ITAR have significant discretion in the interpretation and enforcement of these regulations. Failure to comply with
these regulations can result in criminal and civil penalties and may harm our ability to enter into contracts with the U.S. government. It is also possible that these regulations could adversely affect our ability to sell our products to <FONT

such laws could adversely affect our ability to sell to customers in certain countries and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-compliance</FONT> can result in civil and criminal penalties. Such restrictions exist across the European Union and

environmental, occupational health and safety and export control laws and regulations, we could be held liable for any resulting damages and any such liability could exceed our assets and resources. In addition, we may be required to pay damages or

with the redeemable preferred stock have rights that may restrict our ability to operate our business or raise additional capital, and which may be adverse to holders of our common stock. </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Certificate of Designations governing the redeemable preferred stock, as filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on
August&nbsp;21, 2017, contains a covenant that until the redeemable preferred stock is no longer outstanding, the Company shall maintain an unrestricted cash balance equal to the lower of $3,500,000 or the amount of preferred outstanding at any
given time. Further, additional provisions contained in the Certificate of Designations limit the Company&#146;s ability to: (i)&nbsp;issue stock senior to or on parity with the redeemable preferred stock, (ii)&nbsp;incur indebtedness, with certain
narrow exceptions, (iii)&nbsp;amend, modify, alter or supplement our articles of incorporation or the Certificate of Designations in a manner that would adversely affect the rights, preferences or privileges of the redeemable preferred stock, and
(iv)&nbsp;pay distributions on, purchase or redeem our common stock or other capital stock. These restrictions could have a material adverse impact on our ability to operate and sufficiently fund our business. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Additionally, the redeemable preferred shares and the warrants are each subject to full ratchet anti-dilution protection. Accordingly, to the
extent we were to issue additional common stock or securities convertible into common stock at an issuance price lower than the conversion price of the redeemable preferred stock or the exercise price of the warrants, the conversion price of the
redeemable preferred stock and the exercise price of, and the number of shares underlying, the warrants would be adjusted accordingly. These provisions may prevent us from raising additional capital on favorable terms during the period of time the
redeemable preferred stock or the warrants are outstanding, or at all. If we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms, we may not be able to repay debt or other liabilities, develop our products, execute our business plan, take advantage of future
opportunities, or respond to competitive pressures. Any of these events could adversely affect our ability to achieve our development and commercialization goals and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Our ability to raise capital may be limited by applicable laws and regulations. </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">During 2017, we completed the sale of our redeemable preferred shares under our &#147;shelf&#148; registration statement on Form S-3. Using a
shelf registration statement on Form S-3 to raise additional capital generally takes less time and is less expensive than other means, such as conducting an offering under a Form S-1 registration statement. However, our ability to raise capital
using a shelf registration statement may be limited by, among other things, SEC rules and regulations. Under SEC rules and regulations, if our public float (the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates) is less than $75.0 million,
then the aggregate market value of securities sold by us or on our behalf under our Form S-3 in any 12-month period is limited to an aggregate of one-third of our public float. Our public float is currently below $75.0 million and therefore we are
currently subject to this limitation. If our ability to utilize a Form S-3 registration statement for a primary offering of our securities is limited to one-third of our public float, we may conduct such an offering pursuant to an exemption from
registration under the Securities Act or under a Form S-1 registration statement, and we would expect either of those alternatives to increase the cost of raising additional capital relative to utilizing a Form S-3 registration statement. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, under current SEC rules and regulations, our common stock must be listed and registered on a national securities exchange in

securities by persons other than us (i.e., a resale offering). While currently our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Market, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain such listing. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our ability to timely raise sufficient additional capital also may be limited by NASDAQ&#146;s stockholder approval requirements for
transactions involving the issuance of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock. For instance, NASDAQ requires that we obtain stockholder approval of any transaction involving the sale, issuance or potential issuance by us of
our common stock (or securities convertible into our common stock) at a price less than the greater of book or market value, which (together with sales by our officers, directors and principal stockholders) equals 20% or more of our then outstanding
common stock, unless the transaction is considered a &#147;public offering&#148; by NASDAQ. In addition, certain prior sales by us may be aggregated with any offering we may propose in the future, further limiting the amount we could raise in any
future offering without stockholder approval. NASDAQ also requires that we obtain stockholder approval if the issuance or potential issuance of additional shares will be considered by NASDAQ to result in a change of control of our company. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Obtaining stockholder approval is a costly and time-consuming process. If we are required to obtain stockholder approval for a potential
transaction, we would expect to spend substantial additional money and resources. In addition, seeking stockholder approval would delay our receipt of otherwise available capital or alter the terms of the transaction, which may materially and
adversely affect our ability to execute our business strategy, and there is no guarantee our stockholders ultimately would approve a proposed transaction. </P>

respective affiliated entities beneficially own, in the aggregate, approximately 60% of our outstanding common stock (after giving effect to the maximum ownership limits in the Certificate of Designations and our outstanding warrants). As a result,
these stockholders, acting together, may have control over matters that require approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. Corporate actions might be taken even if other
stockholders oppose them. This concentration of ownership might also have the effect of delaying or preventing a corporate transaction that other stockholders may view as beneficial. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>If we do not meet the continued listing standards of The NASDAQ Global Market our common stock could be delisted from trading, which could limit

stock is listed on NASDAQ, a national securities exchange, which imposes continued listing requirements with respect to listed shares. If we fail to satisfy the continued listing standards, including with respect to the maintenance of a minimum
share price, or if NASDAQ in its discretion, determines that a condition exists that makes further dealings of our Company on the exchange unwarranted, NASDAQ may issue a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-compliance</FONT> letter or initiate

stage immunotherapeutics company focused on the development of products to stimulate robust and durable immune responses for the prevention and treatment of diseases. We have two proprietary platform technologies, RespirVec and Densigen, each of
which has been shown, in preclinical studies and early clinical trials, to activate the immune system in distinctly different ways than traditional vaccine methods. Using these technologies, we have generated clinical product candidates which
potentially represent an entirely new approach to harnessing the immune system. We have two programs using the Respirvec recombinant adenovirus technology. NasoVAX, an intranasally administered recombinant influenza vaccine, uses an adenovector to
achieve expression of the influenza antigen in the target cell, thereby potentially stimulating a broader and more rapid immune response than traditional influenza vaccines. Our planned Phase 2 program for NasoVAX started in September 2017. Initial
data, released in March 2018, indicated that NasoVAX was well tolerated at all doses tested, and achieved 100% seroprotection with the two higher doses. Final data from this study will be available in the third quarter of 2018 and we expect to move
forward with continued development of a quadrivalent NasoVAX product candidate which we expect will be ready for clinical evaluation in early 2019. The second RespirVec product, NasoShield, is an anthrax vaccine designed to provide rapid, stable
protection after one intranasal administration. We launched a Phase 1 trial for NasoShield in the first quarter of 2018 and anticipate topline data the third quarter of 2018. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">With the support of NIAID, we are developing an alternative anthrax vaccine candidate, SparVax-L, a recombinant protein-based anthrax vaccine
designed to require fewer doses and have a longer shelf-life than the only currently licensed anthrax vaccine. The shelf life of the liquid formulation was insufficient to meet the government standards and the product was reformulated in a
lyophilized (dry powder) formulation. We have demonstrated a significant improvement (two years at room temperature and six years at refrigerated temperatures) with the lyophilized formulation. Recent preclinical experiments have shown it to be 100%

business is the result of a merger between PharmAthene and Private Altimmune. In May of 2017, Private Altimmune merged with PharmAthene pursuant to the Merger Agreement dated January&nbsp;18, 2017, among Private Altimmune, PharmAthene, its wholly
owned acquisition subsidiaries Merger Sub Corp and Merger Sub LLC. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub LLC to acquire 100% of the outstanding capital stock of Private Altimmune in the Mergers. Prior to the Mergers, PharmAthene was a
publicly traded biodefense company engaged in Phase 2 clinical trials in developing a next generation anthrax vaccine. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On May&nbsp;4,
2017, Private Altimmune and PharmAthene closed the Mergers in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement. Upon the closing of the Mergers, (i)&nbsp;Merger Sub Corp merged with and into Private Altimmune, with Private Altimmune remaining as
the surviving corporation; (ii)&nbsp;Private Altimmune then merged with and into Merger Sub LLC, with Merger Sub LLC (renamed as &#147;Altimmune LLC&#148;) remaining as the surviving entity; and (iii)&nbsp;PharmAthene was renamed as &#147;Altimmune,

private placement of the Notes for $8.6&nbsp;million at 6% to be issued in two separate closings. The initial closing dated March&nbsp;9, 2017 resulted in $3,150,630 of gross proceeds. The initial closing also included $196,496 of certain existing
outstanding notes payable and $881,044 of certain accrued expenses that were modified and became a component of the Notes on February&nbsp;28, 2017. The second closing contemplated by the Note Agreement was satisfied by the completion of the
offering of redeemable preferred stock (&#147;redeemable preferred stock&#148;) in August of 2017. In connection with the offering of the Notes, Private Altimmune issued warrants to purchase 49,776 shares of Private Altimmune common stock to certain
noteholders, with an exercise price of $0.01 per share. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, PharmAthene issued 0.749106

convertible preferred stock, redeemable preferred stock, common stock warrants, restricted stock, and stock options &#151; has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the impact of the share exchange ratio. In addition, Private Altimmune stock
options and warrants were also replaced with options and warrants to purchase PharmAthene&#146;s common stock at the same exchange ratio of 0.749106 share. Immediately prior to closing, 599,285 shares of our Series B convertible preferred
(&#147;convertible preferred&#148;) stock were converted into Private Altimmune common stock on a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">1-for-1</FONT></FONT> basis. In addition, outstanding principal and accrued interest
on the Notes were converted into 316,734 shares of Private Altimmune common stock. Further, 39,758 shares of Private Altimmune common stock were issued pursuant to the accelerated vesting of restricted stock, and 660,715 shares of Private Altimmune
common stock were issued as a result of warrant exercises, both in accordance with their original terms. Upon the closing of the Mergers, all outstanding shares of Private Altimmune common stock were exchanged for 6,883,498 shares of PharmAthene
common stock. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Following the closing, shareholders of Private Altimmune held 58.2% of the equity interest of the combined entity and
assumed control of the combined entity. As a result, the transaction has been accounted for as a reverse merger, and the assets and liabilities of PharmAthene will be recorded at their estimated fair value. The unadjusted purchase price to be

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On August&nbsp;16, 2017, we issued 15,656 shares of $0.0001 par value, redeemable preferred stock and warrants to purchase up to 2,345,427
shares of our common stock for total gross proceeds of $14,716,370, and incurred issuance costs totaling $1,697,800. The redeemable preferred stock matures on August&nbsp;16, 2018. The maturity date may be extended at the option of the holders to
ten trading days after the curing of a triggering event (as defined in the Certificate of Designations), or ten business days after the consummation of a change of control. In addition, the redeemable preferred agreements require that we reserve a
sufficient number of common shares to cover at least 150% of the common shares expected to be issued upon the conversion of the redeemable preferred stock at the then current conversion price, and the exercises of common stock warrants issued in
connection with the redeemable preferred stock. The redeemable preferred stock will be redeemed in nine specified installments. On each of the nine monthly specified installment dates beginning in December 2017 through maturity, we are required to
convert, redeem, or a combination, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">one-ninth</FONT> of the originally issued number of redeemable preferred share at their stated value of $1,000 per share, for an aggregate value of $1,739,524 for each installment.
If we elect to convert the installment shares, the conversion price is determined based on the lowest of (i)&nbsp;the then applicable conversion price (initially $2.67 per share), (ii) 85% of the average of the three lowest weighted-average prices
of the common stock during the ten trading days up to the installment date, and (iii) 85% of the weighted average price of common stock on the trading day immediately before the installment date. If we elect cash redemption, the redemption amount is
$1,000 per share, plus any accrued but unpaid dividends and any accrued but unpaid late charges. As of December&nbsp;31, 2017, there are 12,177 shares of redeemable preferred stock still outstanding and we had issued an aggregate of 2,474,480 shares
of common stock in connection with the redemption of 3,479 shares of redeemable preferred stock. As of March 30, 2018, there are 6,958 shares of redeemable preferred stock still outstanding. </P>

primary basis for determining technological feasibility of these projects is obtaining regulatory approval. The valuation of IPR&amp;D assets is determined using the discounted cash flow method. In determining the value of IPR&amp;D assets, the

priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described
below: </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Level&nbsp;1 &#151; Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we can access at the

observable. If the asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term, a Level&nbsp;2 input must be observable for substantially the full term. </P>

the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by the Company in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in Level&nbsp;3. A financial instrument&#146;s level within the
fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Fair value is a
market-based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant rather than an entity-specific measure. Therefore, even when market assumptions are not readily available, our own assumptions are set to reflect those that market
participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. We use prices and inputs that are current as of the measurement date, including during periods of market dislocation. In periods of market dislocation, the
observability of prices and inputs may change for many instruments. This condition could cause an instrument to be reclassified within levels in the fair value hierarchy. There were no transfers within the fair value hierarchy during the years ended
December&nbsp;31, 2017 and 2016. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">When awards are modified, we compare the fair value of the affected award measured immediately prior to modification to its value after
modification. To the extent that the fair value of the modified award exceeds the original award, the incremental fair value of the modified award is recognized as compensation on the date of modification for vested awards, and over the remaining
vesting period for unvested awards. We estimate the number of stock-based awards expected to vest, rather than electing to account for forfeitures as they occur to determine the amount of compensation cost to be recognized in each period. </P>

income taxes using the asset and liability approach, which requires the recognition of future tax benefits or liabilities on the temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities. Deferred tax<B><I>
</I></B>assets and liabilities represent future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement<B><I> </I></B>carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and for loss carryforwards using enacted tax
rates<B><I> </I></B>expected to be in effect in the years in which the differences reverse. A valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. We also recognize a tax benefit
from uncertain tax positions only if it is &#147;more likely than not&#148; that the position is sustainable based on its technical merits. We account for interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of our provision for income
taxes. To date, we have not incurred interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Should such costs be incurred, they would be classified as a component of provision for income taxes. In March 2017, the Internal Revenue Service
notified the Company regarding its plans to examine PharmAthene&#146;s tax return for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016. </P>

cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2017 were $3.0&nbsp;million in net proceeds received from the issuance of the Notes, $13.7&nbsp;million in cash assumed from the Mergers, and $13.0&nbsp;million in net
proceeds from the issuance of the redeemable preferred stock and warrants. Our primary source of cash during the comparable period in 2016 was $5.7&nbsp;million in net proceeds received from the issuance of our convertible preferred stock. Our cash,
cash equivalents, and restricted cash were $12.3&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2017. We believe, based on the operating cash requirements and capital expenditures expected for 2018, our cash on hand at December&nbsp;31, 2017, expected tax
refunds, and revenue from our government sponsored contracts, are insufficient to fund operations for a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">12-month</FONT> period from the date our consolidated financial statements are expected to be issued, and only
provide cash into the first quarter of 2019. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to raise additional debt and equity capital. There can be no assurance that such capital will be available in sufficient amounts or
on terms acceptable to us. The current terms of our financing arrangements may make it more difficult to raise additional capital in the future. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our consolidated
financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of the recorded assets or the classification of liabilities that may be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. </P>

Our sources of revenue consist of revenues under our contract with BARDA and NIAID for the development of NasalShield and SparVax-L, respectively, and to a lesser degree from other licensing arrangements. We have incurred significant losses since we
commenced operations. As of December&nbsp;31, 2017, we had accumulated losses of $77.7&nbsp;million since our inception. In addition, we have not generated positive cash flows from operations. We have had to rely on a variety of financing sources,

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Altimmune, Inc., headquartered in Gaithersburg, Maryland, United States, together with its subsidiaries (collectively, the &#147;Company&#148; or
&#147;Altimmune&#148;) is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware. The Company is focused on discovering and developing immunotherapies and vaccines to address significant unmet medical needs.
Since its inception, The Company has devoted substantially all of its efforts to business planning, research and development, recruiting management and technical staff, and raising capital, and has financed its operations through the issuance of
common and convertible preferred stock, long-term debt, and proceeds from research grants and government contracts. The Company has not generated any revenues from the sale of any products to date, and there is no assurance of any future revenues
from product sales. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company&#146;s business is a result of a merger between PharmAthene, Inc. (&#147;PharmAthene&#148;) and the business previously
known as Altimmune, Inc. (&#147;Private Altimmune&#148;). In May of 2017, Private Altimmune merged with PharmAthene pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the &#147;Merger Agreement&#148;) dated January&nbsp;18, 2017 among
Private Altimmune, PharmAthene, its wholly owned acquisition subsidiaries Mustang Merger Sub Corp I Inc. (&#147;Merger Sub Corp&#148;) and Mustang Merger Sub II LLC (&#147;Merger Sub LLC&#148;). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub LLC
agreed to acquire 100% of the outstanding capital stock of Private Altimmune in a reverse triangular merger and reorganization pursuant to section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (the &#147;Mergers&#148;) (see Note 3). Prior to the Mergers,
PharmAthene was a publicly traded biodefense company engaged in Phase 2 clinical trials in developing a next generation anthrax vaccine. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Prior to and as
a condition for the Mergers, in January 2017, Private Altimmune entered into a Convertible Promissory Note Purchase Agreement (the &#147;Note Agreement&#148;) for the private placement of $8.6&nbsp;million of 6% convertible notes (the
&#147;Notes&#148;) (See Note 12) to be issued in two separate closings. The initial closing dated March&nbsp;9, 2017 resulted in $3,150,630 of gross proceeds. The initial closing also included $196,496 of certain existing outstanding notes payable
and $881,044 of certain accrued expenses that were modified and became a component of the Notes on March&nbsp;9, 2017. In connection with the Notes, Private Altimmune issued warrants to purchase 49,776 shares of Private Altimmune common stock to
certain noteholders, with an exercise price of $0.01 per share. These warrants are classified as permanent equity (see Note 16). The second closing under the Note Agreement was satisfied in connection with the sale of Series B redeemable convertible
preferred stock (&#147;redeemable preferred stock&#148;) that closed on August&nbsp;16, 2017 (see Note 14). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On May&nbsp;4, 2017, Private Altimmune and
PharmAthene closed the Mergers in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement. Upon the closing of the Mergers, (i)&nbsp;Merger Sub Corp merged with and into Private Altimmune, with Private Altimmune remaining as the surviving corporation;

had not experienced any losses related to these indemnification obligations, and no claims were outstanding. The Company does not expect significant claims related to these indemnification obligations and, consequently, concludes that the fair value
of these obligations is negligible, and no related reserves are established. </P> <P STYLE="font-size:18pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has experienced recurring losses in past years. The Company incurred a net loss of $46,425,390 and used $20,214,079 in cash to fund operations during 2017 and had an accumulated deficit of
$77,684,839 as of December&nbsp;31, 2017. The Company expects to incur additional losses in the future in connection with research and development activities. Since inception, the Company has financed its activities principally from the issuance of
equity and debt securities. The Company&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company&#146;s ability to raise additional debt and equity capital. There can be no assurance that such capital will be available in
sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to the Company. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments
relating to the recoverability of the recorded assets or the classification of liabilities that may be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. As of December&nbsp;31, 2017, the Company does not have sufficient capital
to fund its plan of operations for a twelve-month period from the date the 2017 consolidated financial statements are expected to be issued. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In order to
address its capital needs, including its planned clinical trials, the Company must continue to actively pursue additional equity or debt financing. The Company has been in ongoing discussions with institutional investors and investment banks with
respect to such financing. Adequate financing opportunities might not be available to the Company, when and if needed, on acceptable terms, or at all. If the Company is unable to obtain additional financing in sufficient amounts or on acceptable
terms under such circumstances the Company&#146;s operating results and prospects will be adversely affected. As more fully described in Note 12, in January 2017, in connection with the Mergers, the Company entered into a private placement of the
Notes. In addition, as more fully described in Note 14, in August 2017, the Company issued shares of redeemable preferred stock and the related common stock warrants for an aggregate net proceeds of $13,018,570. The Company expects that the
combination of the net proceeds from the Notes, cash assumed from the Mergers, the anticipated receipt of tax refunds (Note 17), redeemable preferred financing, and revenue from our government sponsored contracts will be insufficient to fund our
operations and research and development efforts for at least twelve months from the expected issuance date of our 2017 financial statements. </P> <P STYLE="font-size:18pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

also replaced with options and warrants to purchase PharmAthene&#146;s common stock at the same share exchange ratio of 0.749106 share. Immediately prior to closing, 599,285 shares of Series B
convertible preferred stock (&#147;convertible preferred stock&#148;) converted into Private Altimmune common stock on a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">1-for-1</FONT></FONT> basis. Due to the convertible preferred
stock having unique terms and conditions, the convertible preferred stock outstanding in periods prior to the Mergers continues to be presented separately on our balance sheet for periods prior to conversion. In addition, outstanding principal and
accrued interest on the Notes converted into 316,734 shares of Private Altimmune common stock. Further, 39,758 shares of Private Altimmune common stock were issued pursuant to the accelerated vesting of restricted stock, and 660,715 shares of
Private Altimmune common stock were issued as a result of warrant exercises, both in accordance with their original terms. Upon the closing of the Mergers, Private Altimmune common stock totaling 6,883,498 shares were exchanged for 6,883,498 shares
of PharmAthene common stock. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Although PharmAthene was the issuer of the shares and considered the legal acquirer in the Mergers, following the closing,
shareholders of Private Altimmune held 58.2% of the equity interest of the combined entity and assumed control of the combined entity. As a result, the transaction has been accounted for as a reverse merger, with Private Altimmune considered the
accounting acquirer, and the assets and liabilities of PharmAthene have been recorded at their estimated fair value. The unadjusted purchase price allocated to PharmAthene&#146;s assets and liabilities was estimated to be $44,742,737 as of the
closing date and consisted of the shares of the combined company retained by PharmAthene shareholders, and the estimated fair value of vested PharmAthene stock options and warrants which remained outstanding as of the closing date. Also at the
closing, 7,569 outstanding unvested options of PharmAthene with an estimated fair value of $15,173 remained subject to vesting and service requirements. These unvested options will be recorded as operating expense in future periods as the services
are delivered and the options vest. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Headquartered in Annapolis, Maryland, PharmAthene was incorporated in Delaware in April 2005. PharmAthene was a
biodefense company engaged in Phase 2 clinical trials in developing a next generation anthrax vaccine. The next generation vaccine is intended to have more rapid time to protection, fewer doses for protection and less stringent requirements for
temperature-controlled storage and handling than the currently used vaccine. The Mergers enable the combined company to become a fully integrated, commercially-focused immunotherapeutics company with the ability to create more value than either
company could achieve individually. As a publicly listed entity, the Mergers also provide us with additional capital financing alternatives to support the combined entity&#146;s planned research and development activities. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition to the operating assets and liabilities of PharmAthene, Private Altimmune also acquired PharmAthene&#146;s tax attributes, which primarily
consisted of a tax refund receivable and $965,583 of net operating losses (&#147;NOLs&#148;) which were limited under Section&nbsp;382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and were fully reserved, which will expire in 2023. The Company recorded a
deferred tax liability related to future tax benefits arising from an <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">in-process</FONT> research and development asset (&#147;IPR&amp;D&#148;) acquired in the Mergers. Goodwill generated from the Mergers is not
expected to be deductible for tax purposes.</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For accounting purposes, the historical financial statements of Private Altimmune have not been adjusted to
reflect the Mergers, other than adjustments to the capital structure of Private Altimmune to reflect the historical capital structure of PharmAthene. Private Altimmune incurred $2,183,671 of transaction costs, which have been expensed as incurred in
the accompanying consolidated financial statements. </P>

assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of and during the reporting period. The Company bases estimates and assumptions on historical experience when available and on various factors that
it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Significant estimates relied upon in preparing the accompanying consolidated financial statements related to revenue recognition, the fair value of common stock and other equity instruments,
accounting for stock-based compensation, income taxes, collectability of accounts receivable, useful lives of long lived assets, fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets, and
accounting for project development and certain accruals. The Company assesses the above estimates on an ongoing basis; however, actual results could differ materially from those estimates. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the
acquisition date. The Company&#146;s estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments to the fair value of these
tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. In addition, uncertain tax positions and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">tax-related</FONT> valuation allowances are initially established
in connection with a business combination as of the acquisition date. The Company collects information and reevaluates these estimates and assumptions quarterly and records any adjustments to the Company&#146;s preliminary estimates to goodwill
during the measurement period. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the Company&#146;s
consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Amounts paid for acquisitions are allocated to the tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The Company allocates
the purchase price in excess of net tangible assets acquired to identifiable intangible assets, including purchased research and development. The fair value of identifiable intangible assets is based on detailed valuations that use information and
assumptions provided by management. The Company allocates any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired to goodwill. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company&#146;s purchased research and development represents the estimated fair value as of the acquisition date of substantive <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">in-process</FONT> projects that have not reached technological feasibility. The primary basis for determining technological feasibility of these projects is obtaining regulatory approval. The valuation of IPR&amp;D assets
is determined using the discounted cash flow method. In determining the value of IPR&amp;D assets, the Company considers, among other factors, the stage of completion of the projects, the technological feasibility of the projects, whether the
projects have an alternative future use and the estimated residual cash flows that could be generated from the various projects and technologies over their respective projected economic lives. The discount rate used is determined at the time of
acquisition and includes a rate of return which accounts for the time value of money, as well as risk factors that reflect the economic risk that the cash flows projected may not be realized. </P>

impairment until the project is completed or abandoned. Upon completion of the project, the indefinite-lived intangible asset will be accounted for as a finite-lived intangible asset and
amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life. If the project is abandoned, the indefinite-lived intangible asset will be charged to expense. Intangible assets acquired in other transactions are recorded at cost. Intangible
assets with finite useful lives consist of legal costs incurred in the course of obtaining patents and license issuance fees for the use of proprietary technologies. Costs incurred for obtaining patents are amortized on a straight-line basis over
the estimated useful lives of the assets from the time of approval of the patent. Prior to approval, these costs are carried on the balance sheets and not amortized. In the event approval is denied, the cost of the denied application is expensed.
License issuance fees are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the underlying licensed technology. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are being amortized over 6 to 20 years and are evaluated separately from
indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. </P>

primarily professional fees and are classified as general and administrative expenses. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Impairment of Long-lived Assets and Goodwill </I></P>

circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Impairment of long-lived assets other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles is assessed by comparing the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated
by the asset to its carrying value. Goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of our single reporting unit to its carrying value. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our IPR&amp;D assets are currently <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-amortizing.</FONT> Until such time as the projects are either completed or abandoned,
we test those assets for impairment at least annually at year end, or more frequently at interim periods, by evaluating qualitative factors which could be indicative of impairment. Qualitative factors being considered include, but are not limited
to, the current project status, forecasted changes in the timing or amounts required to complete the project, forecasted in timing or changes in the future cash flows to be generated by the completed products, and changes to other market-based
assumptions, such as discount rates. If impairment indicators are present as a result of our qualitative assessment, we test those assets for impairment by comparing the fair value of the assets to their carrying value. Upon completion or
abandonment, the value of the IPR&amp;D assets will be amortized to expense over the anticipated useful life of the developed products, if completed, or charged to expense when abandoned if no alternative future use exists. As of December&nbsp;31,
2017, our projects continue to progress as originally anticipated, and no significant changes to the estimated timing or amount of cash flows or any other market assumptions have occurred. We believe our assumptions to be reasonable, however
development of IPR&amp;D assets are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future progress may differ from our initial expectations. We performed qualitative assessments of our long-lived assets, including IPR&amp;D, and have determined that
our long-lived assets, including IPR&amp;D, are not impaired as of and during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2017. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Goodwill represents the excess of
the purchase price of an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to assets and liabilities assumed in a business combination. We test goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if impairment indicators
arise. During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2017, we early adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) Accounting Standards Update (&#147;ASU&#148;) <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">No.&nbsp;2017-04,</FONT><I> Simplifying

December&nbsp;21, 2017, by estimating our average market capitalization using a volume weighted average price (&#147;VWAP&#148;) (a Level&nbsp;2 input and non-recurring fair value measurement) as of the testing dates and applying a control premium
of 35% (a Level&nbsp;2 input). Based on the results of our impairment tests, the carrying value of our reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value by more than the goodwill carrying value. As a result, we have concluded that our goodwill was
impaired and the full amount of its carrying value of $35,919,695 was written off as an impairment charge which was classified as a component of operating expenses. </P>

determination of fair value requires more judgment. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by the Company in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in Level&nbsp;3. A financial instrument&#146;s level within the fair
value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Fair value is a market-based measure
considered from the perspective of a market participant rather than an entity-specific measure. Therefore, even when market assumptions are not readily available, the Company&#146;s own assumptions are set to reflect those that market participants
would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. The Company uses prices and inputs that are current as of the measurement date, including during periods of market dislocation. In periods of market dislocation, the observability
of prices and inputs may change for many instruments. This condition could cause an instrument to be reclassified within levels in the fair value hierarchy. There were no transfers within the fair value hierarchy during the years ended
December&nbsp;31, 2017 and 2016. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Financial Instruments </I></P>

accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses approximate their fair value due to the short-term nature of those financial instruments. The carrying amounts of notes payable
approximate their fair value because their stated interest rates approximate the market rates and due to the short-term nature of the notes. BPI France notes are recorded at their repayment value which approximates fair value. Redeemable convertible
preferred stock is classified as temporary equity and its carrying amount is accreted over the term of the instrument up to its liquidation and redemption value. Common stock warrant classified as equity and convertible preferred stock classified as
permanent equity are initially recorded at their grant date fair value but are not subsequently remeasured. Common stock warrants classified as a liability and the embedded derivative are recorded at fair value and are remeasured every reporting
period with the changes in fair value recorded as a component of other income (expenses), net. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>License Revenue </I></P>

included nonrefundable upfront fees, annual license maintenance fees, and potential royalties from the licensee&#146;s sale of the licensed products. The <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-refundable</FONT> upfront fees are deferred and recognized
over the license term, which represents the service period, is considered to extend to the expiration of all licensed patents included in the license. Annual license maintenance fees are recognized when due and payable if collection is reasonably

obligation. In addition, until all the redeemable preferred stock shares have been converted, redeemed, or otherwise satisfied in accordance with their terms, the Company is required to maintain cash on deposit in an unrestricted account with an
aggregate amount not less than the lower of $3,500,000 or the redeemable preferred stock outstanding conversion amount. The Company has elected to record this amount within restricted cash. Restricted cash is classified as a component of cash, cash
equivalents, and restricted cash in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Accounts Receivable

provides an allowance for receivables when collection becomes doubtful. Provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices and the overall quality and age of those invoices not specifically reviewed. The
Company&#146;s receivables represent amounts reimbursed under its government grants and contracts. The Company believes that credit risks associated with these government grants and contracts is not significant. To date, the Company has not
experienced any losses associated with accounts receivable and do not maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Concentrations of Credit Risk

restricted cash, and accounts receivable. Periodically, the Company maintains deposits in financial institutions in excess of government insured limits. Management believes that the Company is not exposed to significant credit risk as the
Company&#146;s deposits are held at financial institutions that management believes to be of high credit quality. The Company has not experienced any losses in these deposits. The Company recognizes research grants and contracts earned in connection
with the services provided on research and development projects. The Company provides credit in the normal course of providing such services based on evaluations of the grantors&#146; financial condition and generally does not require collateral. To
manage accounts receivable credit risk, the Company monitors the creditworthiness of its grantors. Grantors that represented 10% or more of research grants and contracts for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2017 and 2016 and grantors that accounted
for 10% or more of accounts receivable at December&nbsp;31, 2017 and 2016, are presented below: </P> <P STYLE="font-size:12pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

event, the convertible preferred stock terms permitted holders to vote as a single class to either liquidate or redeem their shares. Upon such an election, all of the Company&#146;s stockholders, including the common stock holders, would always be
entitled to receive the same form of consideration. As a result, the Company&#146;s convertible preferred stock met the limited exception allowed for shares containing such liquidation rights to be classified as permanent equity with net issuance
price in excess of par value recorded as additional <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">paid-in</FONT> capital. In connection with the Mergers, all outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock converted into Private Altimmune common stock on a <FONT

August 2017 represented the second closing under the Note Agreement (see Notes 1 and 12). Redeemable preferred stock was classified as temporary equity and was initially recorded at its original issuance price, net of issuance costs and discounts.
Such discounts included common stock warrants issued as part of the financing which were required to be classified as a liability and recorded at fair value (Note 16), an embedded derivative related to certain redemption features which was
classified as a liability and recorded at fair value (Note 14), and the intrinsic value of a beneficial conversion feature present in the instrument at issuance (Note 14). The carrying value of the redeemable preferred stock will be accreted over
the term of the redeemable preferred stock up to its redemption value, using the straight-line method which approximates the interest method due to the short-term nature of the redeemable preferred stock terms with the amount of the accretion

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Common stock warrants issued in connection with the convertible preferred stock and the Notes were classified as a component of permanent equity because they
were freestanding financial instruments that were legally detachable and separately exercisable from other debt and equity instruments, were contingently exercisable, did not embody an obligation for the Company to repurchase our own shares, and
permitted the holders to receive a fixed number of common shares upon exercise. In addition, such warrants required physical settlement and did not provide any guarantee of value or return. These warrants were initially recorded at their issuance

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Common stock warrants issued in connection with redeemable preferred stock are classified as a liability
because these warrants contain terms which could, in certain circumstances, require the Company to settle the instruments for cash and such circumstances are outside the Company&#146;s control. Common stock warrants classified as a liability are
initially recorded at their issuance date fair value and are remeasured on each subsequent balance sheet date with changes in fair value recorded as a component of other income (expenses), net. These common stock warrants were valued using the Monte

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company accounts for all stock-based compensation granted to employees and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-employees</FONT> using a fair value method.
Stock-based compensation awarded to employees is measured at the grant date fair value of stock option grants and is recognized over the requisite service period of the awards, usually the vesting period, on a straight-line basis, net of estimated
forfeitures. Stock-based compensation awarded to <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-employees</FONT> are subject to revaluation over their vesting terms. For performance-based awards where the vesting of the options may be accelerated upon the
achievement of certain milestones, vesting and the related stock-based compensation is recognized as an expense when it is probable the milestone will be met. For awards containing a market condition, the effect of the market condition is reflected
in measuring the grant date fair value of the award and is recognized over the requisite service period, which is usually the vesting period, on a straight-line basis, net of estimated forfeitures. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">When awards are modified, the Company compares the fair value of the affected award measured immediately prior to modification to its value after
modification. To the extent that the fair value of the modified award exceeds the original award, the incremental fair value of the modified award is recognized as compensation on the date of modification for vested awards, and over the remaining
vesting period for unvested awards. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company adopted FASB&#146;s ASU <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">No.&nbsp;2016-09,</FONT><I> Compensation &#150;

statements. The Company elected to adopt the cash flow presentation of the excess tax benefits prospectively, commencing with our statement of cash flows for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2017. We have elected to continue to estimate the
number of stock-based awards expected to vest, rather than electing to account for forfeitures as they occur to determine the amount of compensation cost to be recognized in each period. There was no impact to our computation of dilutive EPS as all

necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. We also recognize a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions only if it is &#147;more likely than not&#148; that the position is sustainable based on its technical
merits. The Company accounts for interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of its provision for income taxes. To date, the Company has not incurred interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Should such costs
be incurred, they would be classified as a component of provision for income taxes. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Net Loss per Share </I></P>

ceases the development of these assets, the carrying value would be written off at that time. IPR&amp;D assets are periodically assessed for impairment by considering the state of completion of the projects, the remaining activities required to
complete development, the anticipated market for the completed products, and anticipated future cash required to complete development. </P>

condition for the Mergers as described in Note 3, the Company entered into the Note Agreement on January&nbsp;18, 2017. The Notes bore interest at a rate of 6% per annum, compounded annually. On February&nbsp;28, 2017, $196,496 of the Notes were
issued upon the conversion of outstanding principal of the EDPA and the Alex Choi promissory notes (see Note 11), and $174,594 of the Notes were issued upon the conversion of accrued interest on the EDPA, Alex Choi, and Hammond promissory notes. The
conversion of these promissory notes and accrued interest into the Notes was accounted for as an extinguishment with no resulting gains or losses being recognized. On March&nbsp;9, 2017, the remainder of the initial closing of the Notes was issued
for an aggregate of $3,150,630 in gross proceeds. In connection with the issuance of the Notes, we granted a warrant for the purchase of up to 49,776 shares of our common stock to one noteholder. The allocated fair value of the warrant on the
issuance date of $566,793 was accounted for as a debt issuance discount and was accreted over the term of the Notes using the interest method. On May&nbsp;4, 2017, upon the close of the Mergers, outstanding principal and accrued interest of the
Notes, net of unamortized discount and deferred financing costs, totaling $3,645,424 were converted into 316,734 shares of our common stock. Interest expense incurred on the Notes during 2017 totaled $136,629. </P>

straight-line basis over the lease term as a reduction of rent expense. Through December&nbsp;31, 2017, $350,076 of construction costs have been incurred and recorded as lease incentive obligation with $29,854 of amortization recorded as a reduction
of rent expense during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2017. </P>

redeemed, or (ii)&nbsp;the amount to be redeemed multiplied by the quotient of the highest closing sale price during the period from the earlier of consummation or public announcement of the change of control to the date of the redemption notice,

stock. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Late charges &#151;</I> We may be required to pay a late charge for any amounts due to the holders of redeemable preferred stock that are not
paid timely, at 12% per annum on the unpaid amount, until it is paid in full. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Affirmative covenants</I> &#151; Until all the redeemable preferred
stock shares have been converted, redeemed, or otherwise satisfied in accordance with their terms, the Company is required to meet certain affirmative covenants that include maintaining its existence as a Delaware corporation, and maintaining cash
on deposit in an unrestricted account with an aggregate amount not less than the lower of $3,500,000 or the redeemable preferred stock outstanding conversion amount. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Because the securities contain contingencies which could require the Company to redeem the shares for cash, and such contingencies are outside the control of
the Company, the redeemable preferred stock is classified outside of permanent equity. Because a substantive conversion feature is present at issuance, the redeemable preferred stock is only contingently redeemable and therefore is classified as
temporary equity and carried on the balance sheet in between liabilities and equity at its accreted redemption value. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, certain features
present in the redeemable preferred stock require separate recognition. For purposes of this evaluation, we have determined that the redeemable preferred instrument is more akin to a debt host because the installment conversion feature, as the
primary settlement mechanism, is indexed to an underlying other than interest rates or credit risk and settles in variable shares. Because the potential contingent redemption price contains a significant premium over the issuance price, the
redemption feature is considered to be not clearly and closely related to the debt-like host instrument. All redemption features (including the change of control redemption, triggering event redemption, mandatory redemption, and installment
redemption) have been determined to be a single, compound embedded derivative financial instrument to be bifurcated and separately accounted for as a liability. The embedded derivative financial instrument was initially recorded at its fair value on
the redeemable preferred stock issuance date and is being remeasured on each subsequent balance date with changes in fair value classified as a component of other income (expenses), net. The embedded derivative is classified as a component of other
long-term liabilities. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The redeemable preferred stock also contains a beneficial conversion feature at issuance. The conversion feature was <FONT

than the effective conversion price. The beneficial conversion feature, measured as the intrinsic value of the feature, totaled $1,506,196 on the redeemable preferred stock issuance date, and is

redeemable preferred stock installments. Through December&nbsp;31, 2017, $167,356 of the beneficial conversion feature has been released within components of additional <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">paid-in</FONT> capital with a balance of

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In October 2016, the Company authorized and granted a restricted stock award of 79,516 shares at an aggregate purchase price of $1,067. The weighted average
grant date fair value of the restricted stock award was $10.36 per share. The restricted stock vests ratably at the end of each quarter over four years starting on December&nbsp;31, 2016 with 50% of the original issued shared subject to accelerated
vesting upon a deemed liquidation event. Fair value of restricted shares that vested during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2017 totaled $331,076. Under certain conditions, the Company has the right to repurchase any unvested shares at a price of
$0.01 per share. Accordingly, the aggregate repurchase price is recorded as a long-term liability to be amortized over the vesting period with the amortization classified as a component of additional <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">paid-in</FONT>
capital. As more fully described in Note 3, in connection with the Mergers, all historical restricted stock information has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effect of the share exchange ratio (Note 3). </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company assesses the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets and considers both
positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets to determine, based on the weight of available evidence, whether it is <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">more-likely-than-not</FONT> that some or all
of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. This determination requires significant judgment, including assumptions about future taxable income that are based on historical and projected information. The $3,814,411 net change in the valuation
allowance during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2017 primarily relates to the Mergers, goodwill impairment, and the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">re-measurement</FONT> of our deferred income taxes to the new U.S. statutory tax rate. The Company
has recorded a valuation allowance against the majority of its gross U.S. net deferred tax assets it believes are not more likely than not realizable and the net <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-U.S.</FONT> deferred tax assets. Deferred tax
liabilities, consist primarily of indefinite life IPR&amp;D assets located in the U.S. and the U.K., will be applied in the future to offset against NOLs generated after 2017 which will have an unlimited life. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">At December&nbsp;31, 2017, the Company had U.S. federal NOLs totaling approximately $24,499,476, that will begin to expire in 2020, and U.S. state NOLs of
approximately $18,043,782 that will begin to expire in 2023. Also at December&nbsp;31, 2017, NOLs for the Company&#146;s U.K. subsidiaries and France subsidiary totaled $18,819,106 and $845,651, respectively, which do not expire as long as the U.K.
and France subsidiaries continue to engage in the same trade or business. Under Section&nbsp;382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, substantial changes in the Company&#146;s ownership may limit the amount of NOLs that can be utilized
annually in the future to offset its U.S. federal and state taxable income. Specifically, this limitation may arise in the event of a cumulative change in ownership of the Company of more than 50% within any three-year period. The amount of the
annual limitation is determined based on the value of the Company immediately before the ownership change. Subsequent ownership changes may further affect the limitation in future years. The Company believes that as of December&nbsp;31, 2017, there
was no material limitation on our ability to utilize NOLs and other tax attributes in the future. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of December&nbsp;31, 2017 and 2016, we do not have
any material unrecognized tax benefits. We file income tax returns in the United States, various U.S. states, U.K., and France. The Company is still open to examination by the applicable taxing authorities from 2009 forward, although tax attributes
that were generated prior to 2009 may still be adjusted upon examination by federal, state, foreign, or local tax authorities if they either have been or will be used in a future period. In March 2017, the Internal Revenue Service notified the
Company regarding its plans to examine PharmAthene&#146;s tax return for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016. </P> <P STYLE="font-size:18pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

laboratory space in the United States under <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-cancelable</FONT> operating leases, which expire at various dates through October 2018. The leases require a security deposit of $22,248. The Company also leases office

the Company entered into a new lease agreement for our new U.S. headquarters that includes 14,141 square foot of office and laboratory facilities under a noncancelable operating lease commencing on November&nbsp;1, 2017 for an initial lease term of
90 months. The lease requires a security deposit of $34,174 which is recorded as a component of other assets. The lease provides for six months of free rent with the first base rent payment of $17,087 due on May&nbsp;1, 2018. The base rent is
subject to an annual 3% escalation effective on May&nbsp;1 of each year during lease term. The Company is also required to pay our share of operating expenses billable by the landlord. Aggregate rent over the lease term plus free rent and rent
escalation are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term with the difference between rent expense and rent payment recorded as deferred rent. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, the lease agreement provides the Company tenant improvement incentives and allowances that
include an upfront payment to the Company of $282,820, and up to $1,060,575 of additional tenant improvement allowances to be reimbursed by the landlord for construction costs incurred by the Company. Additional tenant improvement allowances, up to
the maximum amount of $1,060,575, will be amortized and added to monthly rent payment beginning on May&nbsp;1, 2018 and over the remaining lease term, regardless of whether the construction is complete, plus interest at 8.5% per annum. Additional
monthly rent payment resulting from additional tenant improvement allowance is not subject to the annual 3% rent escalation applicable to the base rent. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Construction costs incurred are recorded as construction in progress with a corresponding lease incentive obligation which is classified as a component of
deferred rent. The amounts to be reimbursed by the landlord are recorded as a component of prepaid expenses and other current assets when billed. Through December&nbsp;31, 2017, the Company has incurred $350,076 in construction costs and recorded
$29,854 of amortization of lease incentive obligation as a reduction of rent expense. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Rent expense under all of the Company&#146;s operating leases was
