CAPITAL INVESTMENTS

         The current 2003 capital expenditure plan is approximately $70 million
for operational necessities and for completion of capital programs which
commenced in 2002.

COMPETITION

         Markets for both our high value and commodity products and services in
each of our principal business segments are highly competitive. We compete with
many manufacturers which, depending on the product involved, range from large
diversified enterprises to smaller companies specializing in particular
products. Factors that affect our competitive position are manufacturing costs,
industry manufacturing capacity, the quality of our products, services and
delivery capabilities, our capabilities to produce a wide range of specialty
materials in various unique grades, alloys and product forms, our technology
capabilities including our research and development efforts, our marketing
strategies and price.

         We face competition from domestic and foreign competitors, a number of
which are government subsidized. In 1999, the United States imposed antidumping
and countervailing duties on dumped and subsidized imports of stainless steel
sheet and strip in coils and stainless steel plate in coils from companies in
ten foreign countries. Current administrative reviews by the U.S. Commerce
Department are revising the findings at lower duty rates. We continue to monitor
unfairly traded imports from foreign producers for appropriate action.

         On March 5, 2002, President Bush announced a decision imposing tarriffs
on certain steel imports resulting from his June 5, 2001 order for an
investigation by the U.S. International Trade Commission ("ITC") under Section
201 of the 1974 Trade Act ("Section 201") related to certain specialty steel
products. Section 201 allows the President to restrict imports or impose tariffs
on imports that are seriously injuring a domestic industry. Specialty steel
products under investigation for the years 1996 through 2000 included stainless
steel bar, rod and wire, and tool steel. The Section 201 tariffs imposed on
certain steel imports have had minimal impact on our business because of limited
applicability to our products.

RAW MATERIALS AND SUPPLIES

         Substantially all parts and materials required in the manufacture of
our products are available from more than one supplier and the sources and
availability of raw materials essential to its businesses are adequate.

         The principal raw materials we use in the production of our specialty
materials are scrap (including nickel-, chromium-, titanium- and
molybdenum-bearing scrap), nickel, titanium sponge, zirconium sand and sponge,
ferrochromium, ferrosilicon, molybdenum and molybdenum alloys, ammonium
paratungstate, manganese and manganese alloys, cobalt, niobium and other
alloying materials.

         Purchase prices of certain critical raw materials are volatile. As a
result, our operating results could be subject to significant fluctuation. For
example, since we generally use in excess of 40,000 tons of nickel each year, a
hypothetical change of $1.00 per pound in nickel prices would result in
increased costs of approximately $80 million.

         In addition, certain of these raw materials, such as nickel, cobalt,
ferrochromium and titanium sponge, can be acquired by us and our specialty
materials industry competitors, in large part, only from foreign sources. Some
of these foreign sources are located in countries that may be subject to
unstable political and economic conditions, which might disrupt supplies or
affect the price of these materials.

         We purchase our nickel requirements principally from producers in
Australia, Canada, Norway, Russia, and the Dominican Republic. Zirconium sponge
is purchased from a source in France, while zirconium sand is purchased from
both U.S. and Australian sources. Cobalt is purchased primarily from producers
in Canada. More than 80% of the world's reserves of ferrochromium are located in
South Africa, Zimbabwe, Albania, and Kazakhstan. We also purchase titanium
sponge from sources in Kazakhstan, Japan and Russia.

         See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market
Risk and Other Matters -Forward Looking Statements - Volatility of Energy
Prices; Availability of Energy Resources" and " - Volatility of Prices of
Critical Raw Materials; Unavailability of Raw Materials" on pages 26 through 27
of the 2002 Annual Report.

EXPORT SALES AND FOREIGN OPERATIONS

         International sales represented approximately 23%, 23%, and 18% of our
total sales in 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. These figures include export
sales by U.S. operations to customers in foreign countries, which accounted for
approximately 15%, 15%, and 12% of our total sales in each of 2002, 2001, and
2000, respectively. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure
About Market Risk and Other Matters - Forward Looking Statements - Export Sales"
on page 28 of the 2002 Annual Report. Our overseas sales, marketing and
distribution efforts are aided by international marketing offices or
representatives located at various locations throughout the world. See Note 10
of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 49 through 51 of the
2002 Annual Report for more information regarding international sales activity.


                                       7
<PAGE>

         For 2002, our sales in the United States and Canada represented 77% and
2%, respectively, of total 2002 sales. Within Europe, our sales to the United
Kingdom, France and Germany represented 5%, 3% and 5%, respectively, of total
sales.

         Our Metalworking Products business manufactures high precision
threading, milling, boring and drilling systems for the European market from
locations in the United Kingdom, Spain, France, Germany and Switzerland. Our
Allvac Ltd business has manufacturing capabilities in the United Kingdom and has
enhanced service to customers by improving the sales and distribution network
for our nickel-based alloys, specialty steel and titanium in Europe. The STAL
joint venture in the People's Republic of China produces Precision Rolled
Strip(R) products, which enables us to offer our Precision Rolled Strip(R)
products more effectively to markets in China and other Asian countries.

BACKLOG, SEASONALITY AND CYCLICALITY

         Our backlog of confirmed orders was approximately $412.1 million at
December 31, 2002 and $488.9 million at December 31, 2001. We expect that
approximately 88% of confirmed orders on hand at December 31, 2002 will be
fulfilled during the year ending December 31, 2003. Backlog of confirmed orders
of the Flat-Rolled Products segment was $76.3 million at December 31, 2002 and
$105.2 million at December 31, 2001. We expect that approximately 100% of the
confirmed orders on hand at December 31, 2002 for this segment will be fulfilled
during the year ending December 31, 2003. Backlog of confirmed orders of the
High Performance Metals segment was approximately $300.0 million at December 31,
2002 and $377.9 million at December 31, 2001. We expect that approximately 84%
of the confirmed orders on hand at December 31, 2002 for this segment will be
fulfilled during the year ending December 31, 2003.

        Generally, our sales and operations are not seasonal. However, demand
for our products are cyclical over longer periods because specialty materials
customers operate in cyclical industries and are subject to changes in general
economic conditions. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure
About Market Risk and Other Matters - Forward Looking Statements - Cyclical
Demand for Products" on page 26 of the 2002 Annual Report.

RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND TECHNICAL SERVICES

         We believe that our research and development capabilities give us an
edge in developing new products and manufacturing processes that contribute to
the profitable growth potential of our businesses on a long-term basis. We
conduct research and development at our various operating locations both for our
own account and, on a limited basis, for customers on a contract basis.
Estimates of the components of research and development for each of our three
segments for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000 included the
following:

</TABLE>

         With respect to the Flat-Rolled Products and High Performance Metals
segments, our research, development and technical service activities are closely
interrelated and are directed toward cost reduction, process improvement,
process control, quality assurance and control, system development, the
development of new manufacturing methods, the improvement of existing
manufacturing methods, the improvement of existing products, and the development
of new products.

         We own several hundred United States patents, many of which are also
filed under the patent laws of other nations. Although these patents, as well as
our numerous trademarks, technical information, license agreements, and other
intellectual property, have been and are expected to be of value, we believe
that the loss of any single such item or technically related group of such items
would not materially affect the conduct of our business.

ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY MATTERS

         We are subject to various domestic and international environmental laws
and regulations that govern the discharge of pollutants into the air or water,
and the disposal of hazardous substances, and which may require that we
investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at
sites associated with past and present operations, including sites at which we
have been identified as a potentially responsible party ("PRP") under the
Federal Superfund laws, and comparable state laws. We could incur substantial
cleanup costs, fines, and civil or criminal sanctions, third party property
damage or personal injury claims as a result of violations or liabilities under
these laws or non-compliance with environmental permits required at our
facilities. We are currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a
number of our current and former sites as well as third party locations sites
under these laws.

         With respect to proceedings brought under the Federal Superfund laws,
or similar state statutes, we have been identified as a PRP at approximately 31
of such sites, excluding those at which we believe we have no future liability.
Our involvement is limited or de minimis at approximately 13 of these sites, and
the potential loss exposure with respect to any of the remaining 18 individual
sites is not considered to be material.

         We are a party to various cost-sharing arrangements with other PRPs at
the sites. The terms of the cost-sharing arrangements are subject to
non-disclosure agreements as confidential information. Nevertheless, the
cost-sharing arrangements generally require all PRPs to post financial assurance
of the performance of the obligations or to pre-pay into an escrow or trust


                                       9
<PAGE>


account their share of anticipated site-related costs. In addition, the Federal
government, through various agencies, is a party to several such arrangements.

         At December 31, 2002, our reserves for environmental remediation
totaled approximately $41.0 million. Based on currently available information,
we do not believe that there is a reasonable possibility that a loss exceeding
the amount already accrued for any of the matters with which we are currently
associated (either individually or in the aggregate) will be an amount that
would be material to a decision to buy or sell our securities. Future
developments, administrative actions or liabilities relating to environmental
matters, however, could have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition and results of operation.

         See the discussion of related matters in Item 3. Legal Proceedings.
Additional related information is presented under the caption "Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -

pages 24 through 25 of the 2002 Annual Report and in Notes 1 and 14 of the Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 35 through 36, and pages 58
through 60, respectively, of the 2002 Annual Report.

EMPLOYEES

         We have approximately 9,650 employees. A portion of our workforce is
covered by various collective bargaining agreements, principally with the United
Steelworkers of America ("USWA"), including: approximately 3,450 Allegheny
Ludlum production and maintenance employees covered by collective bargaining
agreements between Allegheny Ludlum and the USWA, which are effective through
June 2007; approximately 165 Oremet employees covered by a collective bargaining
agreement with the USWA, which are effective through June 2007; and
approximately 600 Wah Chang employees covered by a collective bargaining
agreement with the USWA, which continues through March 2008. Negotiations are
ongoing for a new collective bargaining agreement with the USWA affecting
approximately 140 full and part-time employees at various Allegheny Ludlum
facilities in Western Pennsylvania. Also, negotiations are expected to begin for
a new collective bargaining agreement with the USWA affecting approximately 104
employees at the Casting Service facility in LaPorte, Indiana.

         Generally, agreements that expire may be terminated after notice by the
union. After termination, the union may authorize a strike. A strike by the
employees covered by one or more of the collective bargaining agreements could
materially adversely effect our operating results. There can be no assurance
that we will succeed in concluding collective bargaining agreements with the
unions to replace those that expire.

Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -

         We also own or lease production facilities in a number of foreign
countries, including the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Spain, Switzerland,
and the People's Republic of China. We own and/or lease and operate
625,000-square foot facilities for melt and remelt, machining and bar mill
operations, laboratories and offices located on a 25-acre site in Sheffield,
England, and a 40,000-square foot leased facility in Sheffield, England for
computer numerically controlled milling and machine operations. Through our STAL
joint venture, we operate a 130,000-square foot facility for finishing Precision
Rolled Strip(R) products in the Xin-Zhuang Industrial Zone, Shanghai, China.

         Our executive offices, located at PPG Place in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
are leased. These facilities are modern and sufficient for us to carry on our
current activities.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

         We become involved from time to time in various lawsuits, claims and
proceedings relating to the conduct of our business, including those pertaining
to environmental, government contracting, product liability, patent
infringement, commercial, employment, employee benefits, and stockholder
matters.

         In June 1995, the U.S. Government commenced an action against Allegheny
Ludlum in the United States District Court for the Western District of
Pennsylvania, alleging multiple violations of the Federal Clean Water Act. The
trial of this matter concluded in February 2001.



                                       14
<PAGE>

In February 2002, the Court issued a decision imposing a penalty of $8.2 million
for incidents at five facilities that occurred over a period of approximately
six years which Allegheny Ludlum had reported to the appropriate environmental
agencies. We asked the Court to reconsider its decision, which the Court denied
in October 2002. We appealed the Court's decision. At December 31, 2002, we had
adequate reserves for this matter.

         Allegheny Ludlum and the United Steelworkers of America ("USWA") are
parties to various collective bargaining agreements which set forth a "Profit
Sharing Plan". We were involved in litigation with the USWA regarding Profit
Sharing Pool calculations for 1996, 1997, 1998 and 1999. The USWA claimed
adjustments that alleged we owed to USWA-represented employees approximately $32
million. We maintained that our certified determinations of the Profit Sharing
Pool calculations were made as prescribed by the Profit Sharing Plan. On January
13, 2003, we formalized a settlement agreement with the USWA that provided for
an aggregate $5 million distribution to eligible employees. At December 31,
2002, we had adequate reserves for this matter.

         In March 1995, Kaiser Aerospace & Electronics Corporation ("Kaiser")
filed a civil complaint against Teledyne Industries, Inc. (now TDY Industries,
Inc. ("TDY")), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and Dimeling Schreiber &
Park ("DS&P"), DS&P's general partners, and New Piper Aircraft, Inc. in the
state court for Miami-Dade County, Florida. The complaint alleged that TDY
breached a Cooperation and Shareholder's Agreement with Kaiser under which the
parties agreed to cooperate in the filing and promotion of a proposed plan for
acquiring out of bankruptcy the assets of Piper Aircraft, a manufacturer of
general aviation aircraft. TDY and Kaiser are engaged in discovery and have
agreed to participate in a mediation. Kaiser requests that the court impose a
constructive trust on TDY's equity interest in privately held New Piper
Aircraft, Inc., which represents approximately 30% of the equity of New Piper
Aircraft, Inc. In the alternative, Kaiser also seeks unspecified damages in an
amount "to be determined at trial." The trial for this matter is not set. While
the outcome of the litigation cannot be predicted, and we believe that the
claims are not meritorious, an adverse resolution of this matter could have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

         TDY and the San Diego Unified Port District ("Port District") entered
into a lease of property located in San Diego, California ("San Diego facility")
on October 1, 1984. TDY operated its Teledyne Ryan Aeronautical division
("Ryan") at the San Diego facility until May 1999, when substantially all the
assets and business of Ryan were sold to Northrop Grumman Corporation
("Northrop"). Northrop subleased a portion of the property with the approval of
the Port District until early 2001. TDY also entered into three separate
sublease arrangements for portions of the property subject to the approval of
the Port District, which the Port District refused. After its administrative
appeal to the Port District was denied, TDY commenced a lawsuit against the Port
District. The complaint, filed in December 2001 in state court in San Diego,
alleges breach of contract, inverse condemnation, tortious interference with a
prospective economic advantage and other causes of action relating to the Port
District's failure to consent to subleases of the space. The Complaint seeks at
least $4 million for damages from the Port District and declaratory relief. The
trial for this matter is scheduled for October 2003.

         Despite the Port District's failure to consent to the three subleases,
TDY continued its marketing efforts to sublease the San Diego facility. The
rental payments and other expenses for the property amounted to approximately
$0.4 million per month. At December 31, 2002, we had a reserve of approximately
$3 million to cover the costs of occupying the San Diego facility.



                                       15
<PAGE>

TDY and the Port District discussed resolution of this matter but did not reach
any agreement even after court-sponsored mediation. In June 2002 TDY ceased
paying rent on the grounds that the Port District had rescinded the Lease when
it refused to allow TDY to sublease the property and that the Port District's
condemnation of the property voided the lease. In September 2002, the Port
District demanded that rent be paid or possession of the property be returned to
the Port District. TDY returned possession to the Port District on October 31,
2002 and denied that any remaining amounts were due under the lease.

         The Port District filed a cross-complaint against TDY in March 2003.
The Complaint alleges breach of contract for failure to pay rent and for certain
environmental contamination on the property. The Port District seeks $1.2
million in past rent, along with future rent and an unspecified sum of damages
for failure to remedy. The Port District also alleges anticipatory breach
relating to removal of structures and debris from the San Diego facility and
seeks specific performance or reimbursement to the Port District. The Port
District further alleges that it is entitled to indemnity for potential
liability related to environmental matters at the San Diego facility, and seeks
a declaratory judgment in its favor. TDY has various defenses to the allegations
in the Port District's Complaint and denies that it has any obligation to the
Port District.

         In another matter related to the San Diego facility, the Port District
requested that the California Department of Toxic Substances Control ("DTSC")
evaluate whether the property is regulated as a hazardous waste transportation,
storage, or disposal facility under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
("RCRA") and similar state laws. DTSC recognizes that the information pertaining
to the RCRA permitting status of the property is ambiguous and referred the
issue of the property's RCRA permitting status to DTSC's Legal Office for
further consideration. TDY discussed this matter directly with DTSC's Legal
Office and DTSC agreed to refrain from taking action regarding this issue until
after completion of DTSC's Legal Office review. To the extent the facility is
subject to RCRA permitting and corrective action is required at the property,
DTSC has agreed that the San Diego Regional Water Quality Control Board
("Regional Board") is the appropriate agency to oversee the corrective action
work. The Regional Board is currently overseeing other investigative work at the
site, the costs of which are included in our environmental reserves.

         We are conducting an environmental assessment of portions of the San
Diego facility at the request of the Regional Board. At this stage of the
assessment, we cannot predict if any remediation will be necessary. We
remediated in 1998 and continue to monitor a lagoon near the San Diego facility.
Also, we are seeking approval from the San Diego Department of Public Health for
the 1996 closure of four underground storage tanks at the San Diego facility. We
are evaluating potential claims we have against neighboring property owners and
other PRPs related to the environmental condition of the San Diego facility.

         TDY and another wholly-owned subsidiary, among others, have been
identified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as PRPs at the Li
Tungsten Superfund Site in Glen Cove, New York. We believe that most of the
contamination at the Site resulted from work done while the United States
government either owned or controlled operations at the Site, or from processes
done for various agencies of the United States, and that the United States is
liable for a substantial portion of the remediation costs at the Site. In
November 2000, TDY filed a cost recovery and contribution action against the
United States government. Discovery is ongoing but no trial date has been set.
In March 2003, the Court ordered the parties, including the United States
government, to fund a portion of the remediation costs at the Site. An adverse
resolution


                                       16
<PAGE>

of this matter could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations
and financial condition.

         A number of other lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been or may be
asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business, including those
pertaining to product liability, patent infringement, commercial, employment,
employee benefits, environmental and stockholder matters. While the outcome of
litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, and some lawsuits, claims or
proceedings may be determined adversely to the Company, we do not believe that
the disposition of any such pending matters is likely to have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition or liquidity, although the resolution in any
reporting period of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse
effect on our results of operations for that period.

Financial Statements on pages 58 through 60 of the 2002 Annual Report.
