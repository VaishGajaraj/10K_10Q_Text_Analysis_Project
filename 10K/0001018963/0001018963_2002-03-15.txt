commercial production in 2000. The remaining 40% interest in STAL is owned by
the Baosteel Group, a state authorized investment company whose equity
securities are publicly traded in the People's Republic of China.

        As compared with carbon steel, stainless steel and nickel-based alloys
contain elements such as chromium, nickel and molybdenum for strength and
corrosion and heat resistance; titanium and titanium-based alloys provide higher
strength-to-weight ratios and are corrosion-resistant; tool steel alloys, which
contain more carbon than stainless steel, include tungsten, molybdenum and other
metals to make them both hard and malleable; and electrical steel contains
silicon to minimize electrical energy loss when in use. We offer these
flat-rolled products in a broad selection of grades, sizes and finishes designed
to meet international specifications. Finishing capabilities include plasma arc
cutting, shearing, abrasive cutting, sawing and machining. We provide technical
support for material selection. Our wide array of alloys and product forms
provides customers with choices from which to select the optimum alloy for their
application.

         Sheet. Stainless steel, nickel-based alloy and titanium alloy sheet
products are used in a wide variety of consumer and industrial applications such
as food preparation, appliance, automotive, aerospace and medical applications
that require cleanability, fabricability and corrosion resistance. Approximately
70% by volume of the Company's sheet products are sold to service centers, which
have slitting, cutting or other processing facilities, with the remainder sold
directly to end-use customers.

         Strip. Stainless steel, nickel-based alloy and titanium alloy strip
products are used in a variety of consumer and industrial products and a wide
range of automotive components. We also offer very thin Precision Rolled

         Silicon Electric Steel. The Company's grain-oriented silicon electrical
steel products are used generally in applications in which electrical
conductivity and magnetic properties are important. These products are sold
directly to end-use customers, including manufacturers of transformers and
communications equipment.

High Performance Metals Segment

         The Company's High Performance Metals segment produces, converts and
distributes a wide range of high performance alloys, including nickel- and
cobalt-based alloys and superalloys, titanium and titanium-based alloys, exotic
alloys such as zirconium, hafnium, niobium, tantalum, and their related alloys,
and other specialty materials, primarily in slab, ingot, billet, bar, rod, wire,
coil and seamless tube forms, and zirconium chemicals. Our High Performance
Metals segment consists of Allvac, Allvac Ltd (U.K.) and Wah Chang.

         Nickel-, Cobalt- and Titanium-Based Alloys and Superalloys. Our
nickel-, iron-, cobalt- and titanium-based alloys and superalloys are engineered
to retain exceptional strength and corrosion resistance at temperatures through
2,000 degrees Fahrenheit (1,093 degrees Celsius) and are used in critical,
high-stress applications. These products are designed for the high performance
requirements of aerospace, oil and gas, power generation, chemical processing,
transportation, biomedical, marine and nuclear industries. The Company
permanently idled its high cost titanium sponge facility in the first half of
2001. The Company now purchases titanium sponge in the open market.

         Exotic Alloys - Zirconium, Hafnium, Niobium and Tantalum. We are a
leading U.S. producer of zirconium, a highly corrosion-resistant metal that is
transparent to neutrons. Zirconium is used for fuel tubes and structural parts
in nuclear power reactors and for corrosion-resistant chemical industry
applications, and is also used in the jewelry and personal hygiene industries.
Hafnium, derived as a by-product of zirconium, is principally used for control
rods in nuclear reactors due to its ability to absorb neutrons, and as an
alloying addition in aerospace applications. The Company also produces niobium,
also known as columbium, in various forms and alloys. The higher quality grades
the Company produces are used as an alloying addition in superalloys for jet
engines and for aerospace applications such as rocket and fuel nozzles. Niobium
and related alloys are used in applications requiring superconducting
characteristics for high-strength magnets, including in medical devices for
body-scanning, accelerators for high-energy physics, and fusion energy projects
for the generation of electricity. The Company also produces tantalum, one of
the most corrosion-resistant metals, which is used for medical implants,
chemical process equipment and aerospace engine components.

Industrial Segment

         The Industrial Products segment's principal business includes the
production of tungsten powder, tungsten heavy alloys, tungsten carbide materials
and carbide cutting tools. The segment also produces large grey and ductile iron
castings and carbon alloy steel forgings. The companies in this segment are
Metalworking Products, Casting Service and Portland Forge.

         Cutting Tools and Tungsten Carbide Products. The Company produces a
line of sintered tungsten carbide products that approach diamond hardness for
the metalworking, mining, oil and gas, and other industries requiring tools with
extra hardness. Cemented carbide products, which may be coated or uncoated, are
used as super-hard cutters in the high-speed machining and cutting of steel,
high temperature alloys and other applications where hardness and wear



                                       5
<PAGE>

resistance are important. Technical developments related to ceramics, coatings
and other disciplines are incorporated in these products.

         The Company also produces tungsten for worldwide markets, starting with
numerous and varied tungsten-bearing raw materials and resulting in tungsten and
tungsten carbide powders. Previously used cemented carbide parts are also
recycled into tungsten carbide powder.

         Forgings and Castings. The Company forges carbon alloy steels into
finished forms that are used in a diverse number of industries. With the latest
screw-type forging presses, the Company produces carbon alloy steel forgings in
sizes ranging from one pound to more than 200 pounds.

         The Company also casts grey and ductile iron metals in sizes ranging
from 1,000 pounds to 160,000 pounds and in forms ranging from diesel locomotive
engine blocks to housings and parts for power generation equipment, tools, and
automobiles.

CAPITAL INVESTMENTS

         The current 2002 capital expenditure plan is approximately $50 million
for operational necessities and for completion of capital programs which
commenced in 2001.

COMPETITION

         Markets for the Company's products and services in each of its
principal business segments are highly competitive. The Company competes with
many manufacturers which, depending on the product involved, range from large
diversified enterprises to smaller companies specializing in particular
products. Factors that affect the Company's competitive posture are the quality
of its products, services and delivery capabilities, its capabilities to produce
a wide range of specialty materials in various unique grades, alloys and product
forms, its technology capabilities including its research and development
efforts, and its marketing strategies and price.

         Our companies face competition from domestic and foreign competitors, a
number of which are government subsidized. In 1999, the United States imposed
antidumping and countervailing duties on dumped and subsidized imports of
stainless steel sheet and strip in coils and stainless steel plate in coils from
companies in ten foreign countries. Current administrative reviews by the U.S.
Commerce Department are revising the findings at lower duty rates. The Company
continues to monitor unfairly traded imports from foreign producers for
appropriate action.

         On March 5, 2002, President Bush announced a decision imposing tariffs
on certain steel imports resulting from his June 5, 2001 order for an
investigation by the U.S. International Trade Commission ("ITC") under Section
201 of the 1974 Trade Act ("Section 201") related to certain specialty steel
products. Section 201 allows the President to restrict imports or impose tariffs
on imports that are seriously injuring a domestic industry. Specialty steel
products under investigation for the years 1996 through 2000 include stainless
steel bar, rod and wire, and tool steel. The ITC found that certain imported
products were seriously injuring the domestic industry and in December 2001 made
its recommendations to the President for consideration. The Company believes
that this decision has minimal impact on its business because of limited
applicability to the Company's products.



                                       6

RAW MATERIALS AND SUPPLIES

         Substantially all parts and materials required in the manufacture of
the Company's products are available from more than one supplier and the sources
and availability of raw materials essential to its businesses are adequate.

         The principal materials used by the Company in the production of its
specialty materials are scrap (including nickel-, chromium-, titanium- and
molybdenum-bearing scrap), nickel, titanium sponge, zirconium sand and sponge,
ferrochromium, ferrosilicon, molybdenum and molybdenum alloys, ammonium
paratungstate, manganese and manganese alloys, cobalt, niobium and other
alloying materials.

         Purchase prices of certain critical raw materials are volatile. As a
result, the Company's operating results could be subject to significant
fluctuation. For example, since the Company generally uses in excess of 40,000
tons of nickel each year, a hypothetical change of $1.00 per pound in nickel
prices would result in increased costs of approximately $80 million.

         In addition, certain of these raw materials, such as nickel, cobalt,
ferrochromium and titanium sponge, can be acquired by the Company and its
specialty materials industry competitors, in large part, only from foreign
sources. Some of these foreign sources are located in countries that may be
subject to unstable political and economic conditions, which might disrupt
supplies or affect the price of these materials.

         The Company purchases its nickel requirements principally from
producers in Australia, Canada, Norway, Russia, and the Dominican Republic.
Zirconium sponge is purchased from a source in France, while zirconium sand is
purchased from both U.S. and Australian sources. Cobalt is purchased primarily
from producers in Canada. More than 80% of the world's reserves of ferrochromium
are located in South Africa, Zimbabwe, Albania, and Kazakhstan. The Company also
purchases titanium sponge from sources in Kazakhstan, Japan and Russia.

         See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations - Other Matters -Forward Looking Statements - Volatility
of Energy Prices; Availability of Energy Resources" and " - Volatility of Prices
of Critical Raw Materials; Unavailability of Raw Materials" on pages 22 through
23 of the 2001 Annual Report.

EXPORT SALES AND FOREIGN OPERATIONS

         International sales represented approximately 23%, 18%, and 20% of the
Company's total sales in 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively. These figures
include export sales by U.S. operations to customers in foreign countries, which
accounted for approximately 15%, 12%, and 13% of the Company's total sales in
each of 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively. See "Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -Other Matters -
Forward Looking Statements - Export Sales" on page 23 of the 2001 Annual Report.
The Company's overseas sales, marketing and distribution efforts are aided by
international marketing offices or representatives located at various locations
throughout the world. See Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements on pages 41 through 43 of the 2001 Annual Report for more information
regarding international sales activity.


                                       7
<PAGE>


         For 2001, external sales in the United States and Canada represented
77% and 3%, respectively, of total 2001 external sales. Within Europe, external
sales to the United Kingdom, France and Germany represented 5%, 4% and 4%,
respectively, of total external sales.

         The Company's Metalworking Products unit manufactures high precision
threading, milling, boring and drilling systems for the European market from
locations in the United Kingdom, Spain, France, Germany and Switzerland. The
Company's Allvac Ltd unit has manufacturing capabilities in the United Kingdom
and has enhanced service to customers by improving the sales and distribution
network for the Company's nickel-based alloys, specialty steel and titanium in
Europe. In 2000, the STAL joint venture in the People's Republic of China began
commercial production of Precision Rolled Strip(R) products. This venture
enables the Company to offer its Precision Rolled Strip(R) products more
effectively to markets in China and other Asian countries.

BACKLOG, SEASONALITY AND CYCLICALITY

         The Company's backlog of confirmed orders was approximately $488.9
million at December 31, 2001 and $559.5 million at December 31, 2000. It is
anticipated that approximately 90% of confirmed orders on hand at December 31,
2001 will be fulfilled during the year ended December 31, 2002. Backlog of
confirmed orders of the Flat-Rolled Products segment was $105.2 million at
December 31, 2001 and $143.5 million at December 31, 2000. It is anticipated
that approximately 100% of the confirmed orders on hand at December 31, 2001 for
this segment will be fulfilled during the year ending December 31, 2002. Backlog
of confirmed orders of the High Performance Metals segment was $377.9 million at
December 31, 2001 and $353.5 million at December 31, 2000. It is anticipated
that approximately 86% of the confirmed orders on hand at December 31, 2001 for
this segment will be fulfilled during the year ending December 31, 2002.

        Generally, sales and operations of the Company's businesses are not
seasonal. However, demand for products of the Company's businesses are cyclical
over longer periods because specialty materials customers operate in cyclical
industries and are subject to changes in general economic conditions. See
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations - Other Matters - Forward Looking Statements - Cyclical Demand for
Products" on page 22 of the 2001 Annual Report.

RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND TECHNICAL SERVICES

         The Company's management believes that the Company's research and
development capabilities give it an edge in developing new products and
manufacturing processes that contribute to the profitable growth potential of
the Company on a long-term basis. The Company conducts research and development
at its various operating locations both for its own account and, on a limited
basis, for customers on a contract basis. Estimates of the components of
research and development for each of the Company's segments for the years ended
December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999 included the following:

</TABLE>

         With respect to the Flat-Rolled Products and High Performance Metals
segments, the Company's research, development and technical service activities
are closely interrelated and are directed toward cost reduction, process
improvement, process control, quality assurance and control, system development,
the development of new manufacturing methods, the improvement of existing
manufacturing methods, the improvement of existing products, and the development
of new products.

         The Company owns several hundred United States patents, many of which
are also filed under the patent laws of other nations. Although these patents,
as well as the Company's numerous trademarks, technical information, license
agreements, and other intellectual property, have been and are expected to be of
value, management believes that the loss of any single such item or technically
related group of such items would not materially affect the conduct of its
business.

ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY MATTERS

         The Company is subject to various domestic and international
environmental laws and regulations that govern the discharge of pollutants into
the air or water, and the management and disposal of hazardous substances, and
which may require that it investigate and remediate the effects of the release
or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations,
including sites at which the Company has been identified as a potentially
responsible party ("PRP") under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund, and comparable
state laws. The Company could incur substantial cleanup costs, fines and civil
or criminal sanctions, third party property damage or personal injury claims as
a result of violations or liabilities under these laws or non-compliance with
environmental permits required at its facilities. The Company is currently
involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of Company current and
former sites as well as third party locations sites under these laws. The
Company's reserves for environmental remediation totaled approximately $46.7
million at December 31, 2001. Based on currently available information,
management does not believe that future environmental costs in excess of those
accrued with respect to sites with which the Company has been identified are
likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition or
liquidity. The resolution in any reporting period of one or more of these
matters could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of
operations for that period. In addition, there can be no assurance that
additional future developments, administrative actions or liabilities relating
to environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on the
Company's financial condition or results of operation.



                                       9
<PAGE>

         With respect to proceedings brought under the federal Superfund laws,
or similar state statutes, the Company has been identified as a PRP at
approximately 31 of such sites, excluding those at which it believes it has no
future liability. The Company's involvement is very limited or de minimis at
approximately 13 of these sites, and the potential loss exposure with respect to
any of the remaining 18 individual sites is not considered to be material.

         The Company is a party to various cost-sharing arrangements with other
PRPs at the sites. The terms of the cost-sharing arrangements are subject to
non-disclosure agreements as confidential information. Nevertheless, the
cost-sharing arrangements generally require all PRPs to post financial assurance
of the performance of the obligations or to pre-pay into an escrow or trust
account their share of anticipated site-related costs. In addition, the Federal
government, through various agencies, is a party to several such arrangements.

         See the discussion of related matters in Item 3. Legal Proceedings.
Additional related information is presented under the caption "Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Other
Matters - Forward Looking Statements - Risks Associated with Environmental
Matters" on page 21 of the 2001 Annual Report and in Notes 1 and 13 of the Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 30 through 32, and pages 49
through 51, respectively, of the 2001 Annual Report.

EMPLOYEES

         The Company has approximately 10,700 employees. A portion of the
Company's workforce is covered by various collective bargaining agreements,
principally with the United Steelworkers of America ("USWA"), including:
approximately 3,700 Allegheny Ludlum production and maintenance employees
covered by collective bargaining agreements between Allegheny Ludlum and the
USWA, which are effective through June 2007; approximately 325 Oremet employees
covered by a collective bargaining agreement with the USWA, which are effective
through June 2007; and approximately 660 Wah Chang employees covered by a
collective bargaining agreement with the USWA, which expired in October 2000.

         Generally, agreements that expire may be terminated after notice by the
USWA. After termination, the USWA may authorize a strike. A strike by the
employees covered by one or more of the collective bargaining agreements could
materially adversely affect the Company's operating results. There can be no
assurance that the Company will succeed in concluding collective bargaining
agreements with the USWA or other unions to replace those that expire.

         See the discussion of related matters under the caption "Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Other
Matters - Forward Looking Statements - Labor Matters" on page 23 of the 2001
Annual Report.

joint venture, the Company operates a 130,000-square foot facility for finishing
Precision Rolled Strip(R) products in the Xin-Zhuang Industrial Zone, Shanghai,
China.

         The Company's executive offices, located at PPG Place in Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania are leased. These facilities are modern and sufficient for the
Company to carry on its current activities.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

         The Company becomes involved from time to time in various lawsuits,
claims and proceedings relating to the conduct of its business, including those
pertaining to environmental, government contracting, product liability, patent
infringement, commercial, employment, employee benefits, and stockholder
matters.

         In June 1995, the U.S. Government commenced an action against Allegheny
Ludlum in the United States District Court for the Western District of
Pennsylvania, alleging multiple


                                       14
<PAGE>


violations of the federal Clean Water Act. The trial of this matter concluded in
February 2001 with a favorable jury verdict for Allegheny Ludlum on
approximately 85 percent of the claims. In February 2002, the Court issued a
decision imposing a penalty of $8.2 million for approximately 160 incidents at
five facilities that occurred over a period of about six years which Allegheny
Ludlum had reported to the appropriate environmental agencies. The Company has
filed a post-trial motion seeking a reduction in the penalty and is reviewing
options for appealing the Court's decision.

         On October 1, 2001, the Company received an Administrative Complaint
from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency alleging that Allegheny Rodney
failed to file required Toxic Chemical Release Reports for its Waterbury,
Connecticut facility for the years 1996 through 1999. The EPA has proposed the
imposition of a civil penalty of $330,000 on account of this failure. The
Company has denied the allegations and set forth its defenses.

         On March 20, 1995, Kaiser Aerospace & Electronics Corporation
("Kaiser") filed a civil complaint against Teledyne Industries, Inc. (now TDY
Industries, Inc. ("TDY")), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company) and
Dimeling Schreiber & Park ("DS&P"), DS&P's general partners, and New Piper
Aircraft, Inc. in the state court for Miami-Dade County, Florida. The complaint
alleged that TDY breached a Cooperation and Shareholder Agreement with Kaiser
under which the parties agreed to cooperate in the filing and promotion of a
proposed plan for acquiring out of bankruptcy the assets of Piper Aircraft, a
manufacturer of general aviation aircraft. Kaiser alleged that TDY breached
contractual and fiduciary duty obligations under the agreement by instead
entering into a proposed plan with another party, DS&P, and sought damages as
well as a constructive trust over the shares of New Piper Aircraft. In a related
action in the Federal Court for the Southern District of Florida, TDY sought to
enjoin continuation of the state lawsuit. Both parties appealed to the Court of
Appeals for the 11th Circuit in Florida. In May 2001, the Court permitted Kaiser
to proceed in the Florida State lawsuit. TDY and the other parties are engaged
in discovery and have agreed to participate in a mediation. This matter is
tentatively scheduled for trial during the fourth quarter 2002.

         Allegheny Ludlum and the United Steelworkers of America ("USWA") are
parties to various collective bargaining agreements which set forth a "Profit
Sharing Plan". The USWA disputes the Company's Profit Sharing Pool calculations
for 1996, 1997, 1998 and 1999. The USWA's outside accountant, KPMG LLP,
identified certain adjustments it believed should be made to those calculations
and that the net effect of those adjustments would result in additional amounts
allegedly owed to USWA-represented employees of approximately $20 million. The
Company maintains that its certified determinations of the Profit Sharing Pool
calculations were made as prescribed by the Profit Sharing Plan. On November 20,
2001, the USWA filed a Complaint to compel the arbitration in this matter. The
Complaint has been filed in the United States District Court for the Western
District of Pennsylvania and is captioned United Steelworkers of America,
AFL-CIO CLC v. Allegheny Ludlum Corporation, Civil Action No. 01-2196. The
Company denies that any adjustments to the Profit Sharing Pool calculations are
required and intends to contest the USWA's claim vigorously.

         TDY Industries, Inc. and the San Diego Unified Port District ("Port
District") entered into a lease of property located in San Diego, California on
October 1, 1984. TDY operated its Teledyne Ryan Aeronautical division ("Ryan")
at the property until May 1999, when substantially all the assets and business
of Ryan were sold to Northrop Grumman Corporation ("Northrop"). Northrop
subleased a portion of the property until early 2001. TDY also entered into
three separate sublease arrangements for portions of the property. TDY sought
Port District


                                       15
<PAGE>

consent to the subleases, which the Port District refused. After its
administrative appeal to the Port District was denied, TDY Industries, Inc.
commenced a lawsuit against the Port District. The complaint, filed in December
2001 in state court in San Diego, alleges breach of contract, inverse
condemnation, tortious interference with a prospective economic advantage and
other causes of action relating to the Port District's failure to consent to
subleases of the space. The Complaint seeks at least $4 million for damages from
the Port District and declaratory relief.

         TDY is obligated to continue to pay rent to the Port District, in an
amount of approximately $400,000 per month. Due to the Port District's failure
to consent to subleases, TDY is unable to mitigate its costs related to the
property. While TDY is continuing its marketing efforts to sublease the
property, TDY and the Port District continue to discuss a resolution to the
matter.

         In another matter related to the property, the Port District has
requested that the California Department of Toxic Substances Control ("DTSC")
evaluate whether the property is regulated as a hazardous waste transportation,
storage, or disposal facility under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
("RCRA") and similar state laws. DTSC recognizes that the information pertaining
to the RCRA permitting status of the property is ambiguous and has agreed to
refer the issue of the property's RCRA permitting status to DTSC's Legal Office
for further consideration. TDY has an opportunity to discuss this matter
directly with DTSC's Legal Office and DTSC will refrain from taking action
regarding this issue until after completion of DTSC's Legal Office review and
discussions with TDY. To the extent the facility is subject to RCRA permitting
and corrective action is required at the property, DTSC has agreed that the San
Diego Regional Water Quality Control Board ("Regional Board") is the appropriate
agency to oversee the corrective action work. The Regional Board is currently
overseeing other investigative work at the site.

         A number of other lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been or may be
asserted against the Company relating to the conduct of its business, including
those pertaining to product liability, patent infringement, commercial,
employment, employee benefits, environmental and stockholder matters. While the
outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, and some lawsuits,
claims or proceedings may be determined adversely to the Company, management
does not believe that the disposition of any such pending matters is likely to
have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition or
liquidity, although the resolution in any reporting period of one or more of
these matters could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of
operations for that period.
