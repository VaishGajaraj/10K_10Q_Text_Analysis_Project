Overview  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a globally focused, clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to becoming a leader in the discovery and development of
innovative, molecularly targeted and immuno-oncology drugs for the treatment of cancer. We believe the next generation of cancer
treatment will utilize therapeutics both as monotherapies and in combination to attack multiple underlying mechanisms of cancer cell growth and survival. We further believe that discovery of
next-generation cancer therapies requires new research tools. To that end, we have developed a proprietary cancer biology platform that addresses the importance of tumor-immune system interactions and
the value of primary biopsies in developing new models to support our drug discovery effort. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
strategy is to develop a pipeline of drug candidates with the potential to be best-in-class monotherapies and also important components of multiple-agent combination regimens. Over
the last six years, using our cancer biology platform, we have developed clinical-stage drug candidates that inhibit the important oncology targets Bruton's tyrosine kinase, or BTK, RAF dimer protein
complex and PARP family of proteins, and an immuno-oncology agent that inhibits the immune checkpoint protein receptor PD-1. For each of our molecularly targeted drug candidates, we have achieved
proof-of-concept by observing objective responses in defined patient populations. Our BTK inhibitor is currently in pivotal studies in North America, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and China. Our
PD-1, PARP and RAF dimer inhibitors are currently in the dose-expansion phases of their respective clinical trials. As of March&nbsp;20, 2017, trials of our four clinical-stage drug candidates, as
monotherapies and in combination, have enrolled a total of over 980 patients. We have Investigational New Drug, or IND, Applications in effect for our BTK, PD-1 and PARP inhibitors with the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration, or FDA. All four of our drug candidates are in the clinic in China, including our BTK drug candidate being in two pivotal studies. We believe that each of our clinical-stage
drug candidates is the first in their respective classes being developed in China under the Category&nbsp;1.1 domestic regulatory pathway to enter into human testing and to present clinical data. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
research operations are in China, which we believe confers several advantages including access to a deep scientific talent pool and proximity to extensive preclinical study and
clinical trial resources through collaborations with leading cancer hospitals in China. Beyond the substantial market opportunities we expect to have globally, we believe our location in China
provides us the opportunity to bring best-in-class and/or first-in-class monotherapies and combination therapeutics to our home market where many global standard-of-care therapies are not currently
approved or available. We have assembled a team of 348 individuals in China, the United States, and Australia with deep scientific talent and extensive global pharmaceutical experience who are deeply
committed to advancing our mission to become a global leader in next-generation cancer therapies. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
believe that oncology treatment has entered an era of revolutionary change in which cancer drugs will be used both as monotherapy and in combination to attack multiple underlying
mechanisms of cancer cell growth and survival. Due to breakthroughs in gene sequencing and methods of tumor characterization, cancer is rapidly being redefined from a paradigm of classification based
on tissue of origin to molecular characteristics. As a result, this ability to better classify cancers has enabled the development of molecularly targeted drugs that address specific cancer
subpopulations and provide high response rates in tumors with particular mutations. In addition, the development of immuno-oncology agents such as antibodies targeting the CTLA-4 and PD-1 protein
receptors and the PD-L1 protein has demonstrated the importance of the human immune system in cancer therapy and the potential for </FONT></P>

durable responses from agents that activate the immune system to identify and eliminate tumors. We believe that the future of cancer therapy will involve combinations of molecularly targeted and
immuno-oncology drugs tailored to particular tumor sub-groups and have directed our research efforts at both types of drugs. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
belief that this fundamental shift was about to occur in cancer research led us early in our history to develop a cancer biology platform that addresses the importance of
tumor-immune system interactions and the value of primary tumor biopsies in developing new models. Our proximity to leading cancer treatment centers in Beijing and our close relationships with
clinicians who treat patients and perform biopsies and surgeries at those centers have allowed us to develop an extensive collection of </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>in vivo</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>ex vivo</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>
and </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>in vitro</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> cancer models. Given our belief that the human immune system can play an important
role in combating cancer and that future treatments will involve combination therapies, we have introduced elements of a functional immune system into these models. Our proprietary models allow our
research team to better select targets and to screen and evaluate therapeutic agents that we believe have significant potential alone or in combination for treating a variety of cancers. Our models
are a key component in the screening cascade we follow in our drug discovery effort and permit us to evaluate potential drug candidates in conditions that much better approximate a patient's cancer at
the time of treatment. This is particularly significant when drug discovery requires evaluation not only of monotherapies but also multiple combinations and regimens targeting specific mutations while
simultaneously immobilizing the defenses cancer cells mount against the human immune system. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since
our inception in 2010, we have raised approximately $170&nbsp;million in private equity financing and $10&nbsp;million in non-convertible debt financings. On February&nbsp;8,
2016 and November&nbsp;23, 2016, we completed our initial and follow-on public offerings, and received net proceeds of $166&nbsp;million and $199&nbsp;million, respectively, after deducting
underwriting discounts and offering expenses. </FONT></P>

Next Generation of Cancer Treatment  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that oncology treatment is rapidly evolving, offering patients the promise of more frequent and more durable responses that improve
survival from months to years while avoiding the severe toxicities typically associated with chemotherapy. While these outcomes may occasionally be achieved with monotherapy, we believe that the
emergence of resistance is a major problem and that better outcomes will be achievable by combining multiple drugs as it is done in treating infectious diseases. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
next generation of cancer therapies will be based, we believe, on advances in four areas: </FONT></P>

tumor classification based on originating tissue type, such as lung, colorectal or ovarian, to one of characterization based on the genetic aberrations and signature gene expression patterns, such as
in HER2, BRCA, BRAF, ALK and EGFR. As a result, many more disease subpopulations can be specifically targeted, resulting in more effective treatment than was possible in the past. Disease
classifications are substantially more sophisticated than 10&nbsp;years ago, and we believe they will become increasingly so in the future.  </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2>

checkpoints&#151;i.e.,&nbsp;mechanisms by which cancer cells evade the surveillance of the immune system. Inhibitors of the immune checkpoints CTLA-4 and PD-1 have shown success in the
clinic. Two PD-1 monoclonal antibodies, nivolumab and pembrolizumab, and one PD-L1 monoclonal antibody, atezolizumab, have been approved by the FDA. To date, the FDA has approved immune checkpoint
inhibitors as monotherapy in a number of cancers, including melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, kidney cancer, Hodgkin's lymphoma, bladder cancer, and head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma, or HNSCC. Microsatellite instability-high, or MSI-h cancers and Merkel cell carcinoma are also under FDA review for approval. In addition to these indications, immune checkpoint inhibitors
are being studied as monotherapy in clinical trials in a wide spectrum of cancers. Some of these trials have advanced to the pivotal stage, such as gastric cancer, glioblastoma, liver cancer,
esophageal cancer, small cell lung cancer, or SCLC, triple negative breast cancer, or TNBC, and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. Among these indications, immune checkpoint inhibitors have
demonstrated superior overall survival in melanoma, NSCLC, kidney cancer, bladder cancer, HNSCC, and gastric cancer in large randomized controlled clinical trials. Although certain distinct toxicities
associated with PD-1 and PD-L1 antibodies have been observed, these agents have been generally well-tolerated.  </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2>

remains difficult in most cancer types. In addition, objective responses to checkpoint inhibitor monotherapies including PD-1, PD-L1 and CTLA-4 antibodies have been achieved in still small portions of
unselected, solid tumor patients. Although the biological mechanisms underlying combinations are being explored in the field, recent third-party clinical studies have demonstrated the potential of
combination therapy to achieve high tumor response rates, as are often seen with targeted therapy, but with greater durability, as is seen with immuno-therapy agents. The combination of targeted and

Next-Generation Cancer Biology Platform  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fundamental changes in cancer research led us early in our history to develop a cancer biology platform that incorporates improved models and
processes better suited to drug discovery in the new world of immuno-oncology combinations and addresses the importance of
tumor-immune system interactions and the value of primary biopsies. Conventional models for oncology drug discovery have used cultured cell lines that are often decades old and have characteristics
that are not representative of the tumors in actual cancer patients. In addition, tumors from these cell lines have been transplanted in immune-compromised hosts in commonly-used xenograft tumor
models. Therefore, animal models utilizing these cell lines have limited predictive value for new therapies. While animal models derived from surgical samples, such as patient-derived xenograft
models, or PDX models, are an improvement over the old cell lines, a surgical sample is unlikely to represent the state of the cancer at the time of intended treatment. Because conventional models,
including PDX models, require the use of immune-deficient animals, they cannot mimic interactions between the tumor and the host immune system. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>BGB-3111</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> is a potent and highly selective small molecule BTK inhibitor. We are currently
developing BGB-3111 as a monotherapy and in combination with other therapies for the treatment of a variety of lymphomas. BGB-3111 has demonstrated higher selectivity against BTK than ibrutinib, the
only BTK inhibitor currently approved by the FDA and the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, based on biochemical assays and higher exposure than ibrutinib based on their respective Phase&nbsp;1
experience. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
of March&nbsp;20, 2017, we have enrolled over 340 patients in monotherapy and combination trials of BGB-3111. In January 2017, we initiated a global, multi-center randomized
Phase&nbsp;3 trial in Waldenstr&ouml;m's Macroglobulinemia, or WM that will enroll approximately 170 patients at clinical sites in North America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand.
Subsequently, in March 2017, we initiated two single-arm, open-label, multi-center, pivotal studies in China in relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or CLL, or small lymphocytic
lymphoma, or SLL, and in relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma, or MCL, respectively. In addition, we have completed the dose-escalation phase of our Phase&nbsp;1 trial in Australia, and we
are continuing the dose-expansion phase in patients with select lymphoid malignancies including CLL, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, or DLBCL, follicular lymphoma, or FL, MCL, marginal zone lymphoma,
or MZL, WM, hairy cell lymphoma, or HCL. In the completed dose-escalation phase of our clinical trial, no protocol-defined dose-limiting toxicities were observed. BGB-3111 achieved several-fold higher
exposure levels compared to that seen for the approved doses of ibrutinib. Proof-of-concept has been established for BGB-3111 with clinical data indicating that BGB-3111 is a potent BTK inhibitor with
anti-tumor activity observed in multiple types of lymphomas starting at the lowest dose tested, 40 mg once daily, or QD. We have also initiated a combination study in Australia and the United States
with obinutuzumab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody approved for CLL. </FONT></P>

Mechanism of Action  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BTK is a key component of the B-cell receptor, or BCR, signaling pathway and is an important regulator of cell proliferation and cell survival
in various lymphomas. BTK inhibitors block BCR-induced BTK activation and its downstream signaling, leading to growth inhibition and cell death in certain malignant white blood cells called B-cells.
BGB-3111 is an orally active inhibitor of BTK that covalently binds to the cysteine Cys-481 of BTK, resulting in irreversible inactivation of the kinase. It has also been shown that BTK inhibitors can
inhibit solid tumor growth by regulating the tumor microenvironment in preclinical animal models. </FONT></P>

Market Opportunity  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lymphomas are a group of blood-borne cancers involving lymphatic cells of the immune system. They can be broadly categorized into non-Hodgkin's
lymphomas, chronic B-cell leukemias, predominantly CLL, and acute B-cell leukemias. Depending on the origin of the cancer cells, lymphomas are also characterized as B-cell or T-cell lymphomas. B-cell
lymphomas make up approximately 85% of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and comprise a variety of specific diseases involving B-cells at differing stages of maturation or differentiation. Preliminary data from
animal models
involving BGB-3111 and third-party BTK inhibitors also suggest potential applications in solid tumors and inflammatory diseases, which could substantially expand our market opportunity. </FONT></P>

Current Therapies and Limitations  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conventional methods of treatment of lymphomas vary according to the specific disease or histology, but generally include chemotherapy,
antibodies directed at CD20, and, less frequently, radiation. Recently, significant progress has been made in the development of new therapies for lymphomas, including BCR signaling inhibitors,
primarily with the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib and the PI3K delta inhibitor idelalisib. In addition, there are other inhibitors of BCR signaling pathways in development, such as PI3K delta/gamma, IRAK4
and SYK. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
BTK inhibitor ibrutinib was first approved by the FDA in 2013 for the treatment of patients with MCL who have received at least one prior therapy. Since 2013, ibrutinib has received
supplemental FDA approvals for the treatment of patients with CLL, CLL patients with 17p&nbsp;deletion, patients with WM, and MZL patients who have received at least one prior anti-CD20-based
therapy. Ibrutinib is also approved by the EMA for treatment of patients with MCL, CLL, or WM. Ibrutinib has subsequently been approved in over 40 countries, but not China. Reported global sales of
ibrutinib were approximately $2&nbsp;billion in 2016. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite
the clinical and commercial success of ibrutinib, we believe based on its product profile that meaningful differentiation is possible in at least the following

life-threatening. These adverse reactions&#151;including diarrhea, thrombocytopenia, or low blood platelet count, bleeding and AF&#151;are believed to be due to ibrutinib's broad

Potential Advantages of BGB-3111  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe, based on our preclinical and clinical data, that BGB-3111 has the potential to be differentiated from ibrutinib in the following
respects: </FONT></P>

believe BGB-3111 is more selective than ibrutinib in the inhibition of BTK and has less off target inhibition of other kinases, including EGFR, ITK, JAK3, HER2 and TEC, which we believe are associated
with ibrutinib toxicity. Results from our preclinical biochemical and cellular assays show that BGB-3111 has similar potency for BTK as compared to ibrutinib while being less active against other
kinase targets than ibrutinib, as reflected by the higher dose required to inhibit half the enzymatic activity, or IC <SUB>50</SUB> . Based on the selectivity of BGB-3111 relative to ibrutinib, a 2-
to 70-fold higher concentration of BGB-3111 is required to achieve similar levels of inhibition in these other targets as compared to ibrutinib. Therefore, BGB-3111 has the potential to be associated
with fewer toxicities.  </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2>

studies, BGB-3111 has demonstrated favorable pharmacokinetic properties. The comparatively high drug level of BGB-3111 in disease originating tissue as demonstrated in the clinic could potentially
translate into a more complete and sustainable inhibition and a better quality of response than ibrutinib. Ibrutinib demonstrated a dose-dependent BTK occupancy in PBMCs, during its dose-escalation
study. However, even at 420 mg, its approved dose for CLL, ibrutinib did not achieve complete or sustained target occupancy in PBMCs in a significant proportion of patients. In addition, BGB-3111's
favorable safety profile may allow higher drug exposure, which could result in more sustained target inhibition. Available data from our completed dose-escalation trial suggest that BGB-3111 achieved
several fold higher exposure levels compared to that achieved by the approved doses of ibrutinib in its Phase&nbsp;1 study. Paired biopsy data from our Phase&nbsp;1 study in Australia indicate
that BGB-3111 is able to sustainably inhibit BTK in the lymph node, especially with 160 mg twice daily, or BID dosing.  </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2>

25&#150;47% in our preclinical animal studies. Based on human data generated in our dose-escalation trial compared to reported data for ibrutinib, BGB-3111 has better oral bioavailability than
ibrutinib. Pharmacokinetic data from our clinical studies show a robust and dose-dependent increase in drug exposure and the drug exposure of BGB-3111 at 80 mg QD was comparable to that reported for
ibrutinib at 560 mg QD. In addition, the free drug concentration of BGB-3111 at 40 mg QD was comparable to that reported for ibrutinib at 560 mg QD. Lastly, pharmacokinetics data for BGB-3111 suggest
that there appears to be far less interpatient variability in drug exposure as compared to ibrutinib.  </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2>

Summary of Clinical Results  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of March&nbsp;20, 2017, over 340 patients have been enrolled in monotherapy and combination trials of BGB-3111. Preliminary data from our
Phase&nbsp;1 trial suggest that BGB-3111 is well-tolerated. The multi-center, open-label Phase&nbsp;1 trial is being conducted in Australia, New Zealand, the United States and South Korea to
assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic properties and preliminary activity of BGB-3111 as a monotherapy in patients with different subtypes of B-cell malignancies, including CLL, DLBCL, FL,
MCL, MZL, WM, and HCL. We have completed the dose-escalation phase, and we are currently in the dose-expansion phase. The initial results of the dose-escalation phase and dose-expansion phase of our
clinical trial show that, consistent with BGB-3111's pharmacokinetic profile, complete and sustained 24-hour BTK occupancy in the blood was observed in all tested patients, starting at the lowest dose
of 40 mg QD. In addition, sustained full BTK occupancy was observed in the lymph node especially for the 160 mg BID dosing regimen. No protocol-defined dose-limiting toxicities were observed and only
one treatment discontinuations due to drug-related adverse events, or AES was reported as of October&nbsp;3, 2016, the most recent data analysis. Based on the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics,
safety and efficacy evaluation of BGB-3111 in the dose-escalation phase, 160 mg BID has been selected as the Phase&nbsp;3 dose. Proof-of-concept has been established for BGB-3111 with clinical data
suggesting that BGB-3111 is a potent BTK inhibitor with objective anti-tumor activity observed in multiple types of lymphomas including CLL, MCL, and WM. </FONT></P>

serious adverse events, or SAEs, were assessed as possibly related to BGB-3111, including one case each of grade 3 cryptococcal meningitis, grade 3 pneumonia, grade 2 atrial fibrillation, or AF, and
grade 2 vomiting. Other grade 3 or greater events considered possibly related to BGB-3111 included two cases of neutropenia and one case each of diarrhea, hypertension, increased liver function test,
pulmonary hypertension, and vomiting. In total, three cases of AF were reported (all grade 1 or 2), and two of the three occurred in patients with pre-existing AF. No serious hemorrhage
(<FONT FACE="SYMBOL">&#179;</FONT> grade 3 hemorrhage or central nervous system, or CNS, hemorrhage of any grade) was reported. The only treatment discontinuation was due to exacerbation of
pre-existing bronchiectasis in a patient who achieved a very good partial response, or VGPR, on BGB-3111, and the subsequent death of this patient was also the only fatal event in the study and was
assessed by the investigator to be unrelated to study treatment. </FONT></P>

January 2017 we initiated a global, multi-center randomized Phase&nbsp;3 pivotal trial in WM in which we plan to enroll approximately 170 patients at clinical sites in North
America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand to determine whether the quality of response with BGB-3111 in WM is superior to that of ibrutinib. The study will compare BGB-3111 with ibrutinib in
relapsed or refractory WM patients or treatment-na&iuml;ve WM patients who are inappropriate for chemo-immunotherapy. Patients will be tested for mutation status of the </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>MYD88</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> gene and assigned to
</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>MYD88</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> mutation and wildtype cohorts accordingly. We expect to enroll 150
patients in the </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>MYD88</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> mutation cohorts, who will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either BGB-3111 160 mg orally BID or ibrutinib 420 mg orally QD
until progression. The primary endpoint is combined rate of complete responses, or CRs, and VGPRs. Secondary endpoints include major response rate, progression-free survival, duration of response, and
symptom resolution. The randomization will be stratified by </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>CXCR4</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> mutational status and number of lines of prior therapy. Approximately 20 patients with </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>MYD88</I></FONT><FONT
SIZE=2> wildtype status will be enrolled in the second cohort and receive BGB-3111. The patients will be evaluated for the combined rate of CRs and VGPRs,
major response rates, and safety. Below schematic shows the design of the Phase&nbsp;3 pivotal trial in WM. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover,
we are evaluating BGB-3111 in combination clinical trials. Our preclinical data show that BGB-3111 has less off-target inhibition for ITK than ibrutinib in biochemical and cell
models. BGB-3111 displayed a more limited inhibitory effect on rituximab-induced ADCC than ibrutinib in cell-based studies. As shown in the graph below, in a human MCL xenograft model the addition of
rituximab to ibrutinib did not improve tumor activity as compared to ibrutinib as a monotherapy. However, the combination of rituximab and BGB-3111 demonstrated improved anti-tumor activity as
compared to either as a monotherapy. We believe this may translate into better activity in patients when BGB-3111 is combined with rituximab or other ADCC-dependent antibody therapies. We initiated
the combination trial with CD20 antibody obinutuzumab in patients with B-cell malignancies in January 2016, and this trial is currently in its dose-expansion phase. </FONT></P>

both PD-L1 positive and PD-L1 negative models. A combination clinical trial of BGB-3111 with BGB-A317 was initiated in June 2016 and is in its dose-escalation phase. </FONT></P>

BGB-A317, PD-1 Antibody  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>BGB-A317</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> is an investigational humanized monoclonal antibody against the immune checkpoint
receptor PD-1. We are developing BGB-A317 as a monotherapy and as a combination agent for various solid-organ and blood-borne cancers. PD-1 is a cell surface receptor that plays an important role in
down-regulating the immune system by preventing the activation of certain types of white blood cells called T-cells. PD-1 inhibitors remove the blockade of immune activation by cancer cells. We
believe BGB-A317 may be differentiated from the currently approved PD-1 antibodies with the ability to bind Fc gamma receptor I specifically engineered out, and we believe this could potentially
result in improved activities. In addition, BGB-A317 has a unique binding signature to PD-1 with high affinity and superior target specificity. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
are evaluating BGB-A317 in the ongoing dose-escalation phase of our clinical trial in relapsed or refractory solid tumor patients and combination trials with our PARP inhibitor,
BGB-290 and with our BTK inhibitor, BGB-3111 respectively, in Australia. As of March&nbsp;20, 2017, we have dosed over 400 patients with BGB-A317 in monotherapy and combination trials. BGB-A317 is
the first drug candidate produced from our immuno-oncology biologic programs, and we believe it could serve as one of the cornerstones for our immuno-oncology combination platform. </FONT></P>

Mechanism of Action  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cells called cytotoxic T-cells provide humans an important self-defense mechanism against cancer, patrolling the body, recognizing cancer cells
due to immunogenic features that differ from normal cells, and killing cancer cells by injecting poisonous proteins into them. T-cells have various mechanisms built into them that prevent them from
damaging normal cells, among which is a protein called PD-1 receptor, which is expressed on the surface of T-cells. The most important signaling protein that could engage PD-1 is called PD-L1, which
binds the PD-1 receptor and sends an inhibitory signal inside the T-cell, stopping it from making more poisonous proteins and killing the cells sending the signal via PD-L1 and other cells nearby.
Many types of cancer cells have hijacked the PD-L1 expression system that normally exists in healthy cells. By expressing PD-L1, cancer cells protect themselves from being killed by cytotoxic T-cells.
BGB-A317 is a monoclonal antibody designed to specifically bind to PD-1, thereby preventing PD-L1 from engaging PD-1. Therefore, we believe BGB-A317 has the potential to restore the cytotoxic T-cell's
ability to kill cancer cells. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forecasts of the market for monotherapy PD-1 and PD-L1 antibodies have increased as new tumor types responding to these antibodies have been
identified and data has accumulated regarding their potential efficacy. It is estimated that these inhibitors will have sales in excess of $36&nbsp;billion by 2023 across 10 tumors that are the
focus of current immune-oncology studies (i.e., melanoma, renal cell cancer, lung cancer, gastric cancer, bladder cancer, HNSCC, triple-negative breast cancer, Hodgkin's lymphoma, Merkel cell
carcinoma, and liver cancer). </FONT></P>

Potential Advantages of BGB-A317  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe BGB-A317 may be differentiated from the currently approved PD-1 antibodies. Specifically, its ability to bind
Fc<FONT FACE="SYMBOL">g</FONT>RI has been engineered out, resulting in a cell biology differentiation compared to the currently approved PD-1 antibodies. Our preclinical data and published
literature findings, Dahan et al., 2015, suggest that engagement of Fc<FONT FACE="SYMBOL">g</FONT>RI may compromise the efficacy of anti-PD-1 antibodies by attracting immune suppressive
cells and depleting the T-cell population necessary for attacking the tumor cells. With limited to no ability to bind to the receptor, we believe BGB-A317 could potentially have improved activities.
In addition, BGB-A317 has a unique binding signature to PD-1 with high affinity and superior target specificity. In preclinical studies, BGB-A317 showed better cellular functional activities in
blocking PD-1 mediated reverse signal transduction and in activating human T-cells and primary PBMCs and improved tumor growth inhibition compared to currently approved PD-1 antibodies. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
believe there could be a large commercial opportunity in China for PD1 antibodies as currently available clinical data suggest that some of the most prevalent cancers in China such as
lung, gastric, liver and esophageal cancers are responsive to this class of agents. We believe we are well positioned to take advantage of this opportunity. In addition, the potential to combine
BGB-A317 with our multiple clinical-stage and preclinical drug candidates provides us with additional shots on goal. Based on our preclinical data, we believe a strong rationale exists for combining
BGB-A317 with our drug candidates BGB-290, BGB-3111, and BGB-283. In addition, we are developing several immuno-oncology candidates that we intend to combine with BGB-A317. </FONT></P>

Summary of Clinical Trials  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of March&nbsp;20, 2017, we have dosed over 400 patients with BGB-A317 in either monotherapy or combination trials. In April 2016, we
completed the enrollment for the ongoing dose-escalation phase, and in May 2016, we initiated the dose-expansion phase of our Phase&nbsp;1 clinical trial in relapsed or refractory solid tumor
patients in Australia, New Zealand, the United States, Korea, and Taiwan. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
November&nbsp;11, 2016, we presented updated data from the dose escalation phase of our ongoing Phase&nbsp;1 trial for a total of 103 patients with advanced solid tumors at the
Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer, or SITC, 31<SUP>st</SUP>&nbsp;Annual meeting. The preliminary clinical data showed that BGB-A317 was well-tolerated with AEs in keeping with the class effect.
Among 103 patients evaluable for safety at the time of the data cutoff for the current safety analysis on August&nbsp;15, 2016, the most common
treatment-related AEs (<FONT FACE="SYMBOL">&#179;</FONT> 5%) were fatigue (19%), diarrhea (13%), rash (11%), pruritus (11%), nausea (8%), hypothyroidism (7%), and infusion related reaction
(6%). Treatment-related SAEs included four cases of colitis, two cases of hypotension, and one case each of diarrhea, diabetes mellitus, diabetic ketoacidosis, dyspnea, hypoxia, infusion-related
reaction, and pneumonitis. Among these, grade 3 treatment-related SAEs included the two cases of hypotension and one case each of colitis, diabetes mellitus, diabetic ketoacidosis, dyspnea, hypoxia,
and pneumonitis. Other treatment-related grade 3 AEs included two cases each of fatigue and hyperglycemia, and one case each of back pain, elevated alanine aminotransferase and elevated gamma-glutamyl
transferase. The table below summarizes the AE events. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To

escalation portion of the study is currently enrolling subjects with TNBC, ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer, peritoneal cancer, SCLC, and tumors likely to have DNA damage repair deficiencies
susceptible to PARP inhibition or likely to respond to a PD-1 blockade. In June 2016, we initiated a Phase&nbsp;1 clinical trial with BGB-3111 in combination with BGB-A317 for the treatment of

BGB-290, PARP Inhibitor  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>BGB-290</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> is a molecularly targeted, orally available, potent and highly selective inhibitor of
PARP1 and PARP2. We are currently developing BGB-290 as a monotherapy and in combination with other therapies for the treatment of homologous recombination deficient cancers, which are cancers that
contain abnormalities in their DNA molecule repair mechanisms, making these cancers particularly sensitive to PARP inhibitors. We believe BGB-290 has the potential to be differentiated from other PARP
inhibitors in terms of brain penetration, selectivity, DNA-trapping activity, and oral bioavailability. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
have completed the dose-escalation phase of our clinical trial in Australia and are conducting the dose-expansion phase of our clinical trial. We have dosed over 110 patients with
BGB-290 in monotherapy and combination trials as of March&nbsp;20, 2017. Initial analysis of data from this trial has shown BGB-290 to be well-tolerated. Proof-of-concept has also been established,
with anti-tumor activity seen starting at the lowest tested dose and data suggestive of a wide therapeutic window. </FONT></P>

Mechanism of Action  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PARP family members PARP1 and PARP2 are involved in DNA replication and transcriptional regulation and play essential roles in cell survival in
response to DNA damage. PARP1 and PARP2 are key base-excision-repair proteins that function as DNA damage sensors by binding rapidly to the site of damaged DNA and modulating a variety of proteins in
DNA repair processes. Inhibition of PARPs prevents the repair of common single-strand DNA breaks which leads to formation of double-strand breaks during DNA replication. Double-strand DNA breaks in
normal cells are repaired by homologous recombination, and normal cells are relatively tolerant of PARP inhibition. On the other hand, cancer cells with mutations in breast cancer susceptibility gene,
or BRCA1/2 genes, key players in homologous recombination, are highly sensitive to PARP inhibition, a phenomenon called "synthetic lethality" that is the foundation of the therapeutic utility of PARP
inhibitors as a monotherapy for BRCA mutant cancers. In addition to hereditary BRCA1/2 mutations, the synthetic lethal concept has been broadened to include sporadic tumors that display homologous
recombination deficiency, or HRD, a gene expression profile that resembles that of a BRCA deficient tumor. HRD can stem from somatic mutation of BRCA1/2, epigenetic silencing of BRCA genes or genetic
or epigenetic loss of function of other genes in homologous recombination DNA damage repair pathways. Recent third-party clinical studies have published results demonstrating that sensitivity to
platinum-based chemotherapies confers sensitivity to </FONT></P>

inhibitors in ovarian cancers. Thus, this trial finding may provide an additional possibility to identify and enrich patient populations that could respond to PARP inhibitors. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another
potential therapeutic utility of PARP inhibitors is rational combination therapy. PARP proteins are key factors in DNA repair pathways, in particular, base-excision-repair, which
is critical for the repair of DNA lesions caused by some chemotherapeutic agents and by radiation. PARP inhibitors are hypothesized to potentiate cytotoxicity of DNA-alkylating agents such as platinum
compounds, temozolomide and ionizing radiation and may be used in combination with these agents in treating various cancers. PARP inhibitors are also considered good potential combination partners
with checkpoint inhibitors in part due to increased mutations in tumor as a result of the blockade of DNA repair by PARP inhibitors. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe the market opportunity for PARP inhibitors is large and expanding in various tumor histology, settings and patient segments. Many
tumor types have been shown to be responsive to PARP inhibitors, including ovarian cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, SCLC, and gastric cancer. PARP inhibitors have also been explored in settings
beyond late lines with encouraging results, such as maintenance setting. Clinical trials have also shown that PARP inhibitors are active beyond the initial population of patients with </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>BRCA</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> mutations. In
ovarian cancer and other cancers, there is growing understanding and increasing clinical data indicating that multiple DNA repair
defects or HRD, other than </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>BRCA</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> mutations could render the tumor cell to be susceptible to PARP inhibition. Collectively, we believe the addressable
patient population for PARP inhibitors is fast expanding. </FONT></P>

Summary of Clinical Results  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of March&nbsp;20, 2017, we have dosed over 110 patients with BGB-290 in either monotherapy or combination trials. We have completed the
dose-escalation phase and are evaluating BGB-290 in the ongoing dose-expansion phase of our clinical trial in Australia. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At
the 2015 AACR-NCI-EORTC International Conference on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics, we presented clinical data from our Phase&nbsp;1 clinical trial. As of June&nbsp;30,
2015, 29 relapsed or refractory solid tumor patients were enrolled in seven cohorts receiving monotherapy BGB-290 in doses ranging from 2.5 mg BID to 80&nbsp;mg&nbsp;BID. Initial analysis of data
from this trial suggests that BGB-290 is well-tolerated. Few AEs of myelosuppression, no liver toxicity signal, and few drug-related grade&nbsp;3/4 AEs were observed in the dose-escalation phase.
The most common drug-related AEs were grade 1 and 2 nausea&nbsp;(38%) and fatigue&nbsp;(28%). Drug-related grade&nbsp;3/4 AEs include one each (3%) of neutropenia, anemia, hypophosphatemia and
hypokalemia, all grade&nbsp;3. As of January&nbsp;19, 2016, drug-related SAEs reported by investigators were three cases of grade&nbsp;3 anemia and one case of shortness of breath. </FONT></P>

February 2016, we initiated a Phase&nbsp;1 clinical trial of BGB-290 in combination with BGB-A317. The dose-escalation phase of the trial is currently enrolling subjects with TNBC,
ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer, peritoneal cancer, SCLC, and tumors likely to have DNA damage repair deficiencies susceptible to PARP inhibition or likely to respond to a PD-1 blockade. The

BGB-283, RAF Dimer Inhibitor  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>BGB-283</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> is a small molecule inhibitor of both the monomer and dimer forms of the RAF kinase. We
are currently developing BGB-283 for the treatment of cancers with aberrations in the mitogen-activated protein kinase, or MAPK, pathway, including BRAF gene mutations and KRAS/NRAS gene mutations
where first generation BRAF inhibitors are not effective. The MAPK pathway is a chain of proteins in the cell that communicates a signal from a receptor on the surface of the cell to the DNA in the
nucleus of the cell. This pathway plays an essential role in regulating cell proliferation and survival. We intend to develop BGB-283 to treat various malignancies, including melanoma, colorectal
cancer, NSCLC, endometrial cancer, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer and papillary thyroid carcinoma. Currently approved first-generation BRAF inhibitors, vemurafenib and dabrafenib, are only active
against the BRAF monomer. BGB-283 inhibits not only the monomer but also the dimer forms of BRAF. We believe BGB-283 has the potential to be a first-in-class RAF dimer inhibitor globally. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As

Mechanism of Action  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MAPK pathway is a chain of proteins that communicates a signal from a receptor on the surface of a cell to the DNA in the nucleus of the
cell. The pathway includes a small G protein (RAS) and three protein kinases (RAF, MEK, and ERK). A kinase is an enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from a donor molecule to an
acceptor. This process often acts as an "on" or "off" switch to regulate cellular signaling. The MAPK pathway plays an essential role in regulating cell proliferation and survival. Activation of the
RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK kinase cascade by
external stimuli transduces signals from the plasma membrane into the cell nucleus to control gene expression and determine cell fate. Aberrant activation of the MAPK signal transduction pathway is
frequently found in different types of cancers, contributing to increased cell division, suppressed apoptosis, and enhanced cell motility and invasion. In many cancers, a defect in the MAPK pathway
leads to uncontrolled tumor growth. The two key components of the MAPK pathway, BRAF and RAS, are two of the most frequently mutated genes in human cancers. BRAF is one of the three kinases that
belong to the RAF kinase family. There are three members: ARAF, BRAF and CRAF. BRAF is the most frequently mutated oncogene in this kinase superfamily. Mutated BRAF and RAS lead to activation of the
MAPK pathway and promote tumor development and growth. Functions of BRAF in the MAPK pathway are key to cell proliferation and survival. Mutations that lead to activation of BRAF promote cell
transformation and proliferation and thus positively correlate with tumor development and growth. The most frequent BRAF mutation, BRAF V600E, causes constitutive activation of the kinase as well as
insensitivity to negative feedback mechanisms. The mutated BRAF signals as a monomer, independent of upstream growth stimuli. It has been found that RAF kinases can homo- and heterodimerize and form
homodimer or heterodimer of RAF proteins. Dimerization has been reported to be one of the key mechanisms of resistance to first-generation BRAF inhibitors, such as vemurafenib and dabrafenib. The
three most common molecular mechanisms of acquired resistance of BRAF V600E melanomas to RAF inhibitors&#151;NRAS mutation, splicing of BRAF V600E that produce a truncated BRAF kinase, and
BRAF&nbsp;V600E overexpression due to gene amplification&#151;all result in dimerization of BRAF&nbsp;V600E. First-generation BRAF inhibitors only inhibit the BRAF&nbsp;V600E monomer form
at physiologically meaningful concentrations. In contrast, BGB-283 has been shown to inhibit both BRAF&nbsp;V600E monomer and RAF dimer in BRAF inhibitor sensitive and resistant melanoma cell </FONT></P>

Market Opportunity  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe BGB-283 has applications in both BRAF mutated cancers and RAS, including KRAS and NRAS, mutated cancers. The oncogenic BRAF V600E
mutation was detected in approximately 8% of all human solid tumors, including approximately 45% of papillary thyroid cancers. Mutations in any one of the three RAS genes, HRAS, NRAS or KRAS, are
among the most common events in human tumorigenesis. KRAS mutations are detected prominently in colorectal cancer, NSCLC and pancreatic cancer. Additionally, notable KRAS or NRAS mutation rates have
been reported in melanoma, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, bladder cancer, biliary cancer, thyroid cancer, leukemia and multiple myeloma. The first-generation FDA-approved BRAF inhibitors have
limited activity outside of melanoma, NSCLC and thyroid cancers. In addition, these first-generation BRAF inhibitors do not exhibit activity against KRAS and NRAS mutations. </FONT></P>

Potential Advantages of BGB-283  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BGB-283 is a novel inhibitor of RAF, in both monomeric and dimeric forms. BGB-283 has demonstrated potent and reversible inhibitory activities
against RAF family kinases, including wild-type ARAF, BRAF, CRAF and BRAF V600E, in biochemical assays. In addition, BGB-283 has shown potent inhibitory activity against EGFR in biochemical assays
using EGFR kinases, cancer cell lines, and xenograft models. In BRAF wild-type cells that harbor the KRAS mutations, treatment with BGB-283 resulted in much reduced up-regulation of pERK, a
phosphorylated form of ERK, compared with vemurafenib in cancer cell models. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
preclinical testing, BGB-283 also retained inhibitory activity in vemurafenib-resistant BRAF splicing isoform p61-BRAF V600E. Data generated in preclinical studies using biochemical,
cell-based and animal studies suggest that BGB-283 could offer significant patient benefit in inhibiting tumors with aberrations in the RAF MAPK/ERK pathway, including BRAF mutations and KRAS/NRAS
mutations as either monotherapy or in combination with other cancer therapies. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
believe BGB-283 has the potential to be differentiated from other drug candidates currently under development and from approved first-generation BRAF inhibitors due to the

Summary of Clinical Results  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initial analysis of data from these trials suggests that BGB-283 is well-tolerated with a favorable safety profile. We presented initial
clinical data from our Phase&nbsp;1 clinical trial of BGB-283 in patients with BRAF or KRAS/NRAS-mutated cancers at the 2016 American Association for Cancer Research annual conference. As of
January&nbsp;31, 2016, the data cutoff date, among 31 advanced solid tumor patients, the most frequent treatment-related adverse events, or TRAE, were fatigue&nbsp;(52%),
thrombocytopenia&nbsp;(39%), decreased appetite&nbsp;(39%), hand-foot syndrome&nbsp;(35%), dermatitis acneiform&nbsp;(32%) and hypertension&nbsp;(32%). The most frequent treatment-related
grade&nbsp;3/4 AEs included thrombocytopenia&nbsp;(13%), fatigue&nbsp;(10%) and liver enzyme elevation&nbsp;(10%). </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
have achieved proof-of-concept in a range of cancers including those with KRAS and BRAF mutations. At the time of the data cutoff, among 29 patients enrolled in the dose-escalation
phase of the trial evaluable for efficacy, one melanoma patient with BRAF V600E mutation had a CR, one endometrial cancer patient with KRAS mutation and one thyroid cancer patient with BRAF V600E
mutation had a PR, and 15 patients had an SD, including one NSCLC patient with KRAS mutation with a transient PR or durable SD. As of January&nbsp;31, 2016, 15 patients had remained on treatment for
over six months, and the patient with CR had ongoing treatment for 342&nbsp;days, and the two patients with
PR had received treatment for 455&nbsp;days and 574+ days (ongoing), respectively. When assessed by underlying mutations, of six evaluable patients with the BRAF V600E mutation, there was one CR,
one PR and four SDs. Of three evaluable patients with BRAF non-V600E mutation, there were two SDs. Of 20 evaluable patients with KRAS/NRAS mutations, there was one confirmed PR and nine SDs. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
have also initiated a dose-escalation trial in China. The goal of the study is to determine dose, exposure, safety and tolerability, and efficacy. We observed more frequent
grade&nbsp;3/4 thrombocytopenia in the China trial (seven out of 24 patients) compared to the Australia and New Zealand trial (eight out of 105 patients). </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
expect to present data from the Phase&nbsp;1 dose-expansion study of BGB-283 in patients with BRAF or KRAS/NRAS mutated solid tumors in an oral presentation on April&nbsp;2 during
a Clinical Trials Plenary Session at the 2017 American Association for Cancer Research Annual Meeting. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
March 2017, we regained the worldwide rights to BGB-283 after Merck KGaA, Darmstadt Germany informed us that it will not exercise the Continuation Option in its former exclusive

Our Preclinical Programs  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our proprietary cancer biology platform has also allowed us to develop several preclinical-stage drug candidates in potentially important
targeted areas. These currently consist of targeted therapies and immuno-oncology agents including a PD-L1 monoclonal antibody, an additional RAF dimer inhibitor, a TIM-3 cell surface protein
monoclonal antibody, and a BTK inhibitor for non-oncology indications. We anticipate advancing one or more of our preclinical assets into the clinic in the next 12&nbsp;months. We believe we have
the opportunity to combine our PD-1 monoclonal antibody with other clinical-stage and preclinical candidates in our pipeline portfolio to target multiple points in the cancer immunity cycle. We also
seek to develop companion diagnostics that will help identify patients that are most likely to benefit from the use of our drug candidates. </FONT></P>

Regulatory Framework and Structural Advantages of Being a China-Based Research and Development
Organization  </B></FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that basing our research and development effort in China offers important regulatory advantages that differentiate us from most

developed drug candidates. This pathway to approval creates the potential for our drug candidates to be first-in-class locally and to obtain approval in China prior to ex-China developed candidates.
By developing our compounds preclinically and manufacturing them in China, we have the ability to seek product approval from the CFDA as a domestic Category&nbsp;1 drug. This domestic
Category&nbsp;1 designation allows us to use a distinct route for bringing our products to market compared to the Category&nbsp;5 regulatory process available to multinational companies with drugs
approved for marketing by major foreign drug regulatory authorities, such as the FDA or EMA. We believe the Category&nbsp;1 regulatory pathway will allow us to provide patients in China more rapid
access to safe and effective cancer therapies. </FONT></DD></DL>

or IDL, after the drug has received marketing approval and a Certificate of Pharmaceutical Product, or CPP, from a major foreign drug regulatory authority, such as the FDA or EMA. Compared
with the domestic innovative registration process, the imported innovative drug registration process is more complex. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
first step in the process after receipt of a CPP is to obtain approval of a Clinical Trial Application to conduct registration studies. A pharmacokinetic study in Chinese subjects is
also required. Once this study is completed, the applicant must submit the clinical data package to the CFDA along with other required information for the issuance of an IDL. The IDL registration
process together with clinical trials have typically taken more than five years from the receipt of foreign marketing approval. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently,
the most common strategy for multinational companies is using multi-regional clinical trial, or MRCT, data to support IDL approval. Companies can apply to conduct these MRCTs
prior to receiving global regulatory approval, with China as a subset within a broader MRCT. However, these MRCTs are often not designed in a way that accounts for the unique characteristics of the
Chinese patient population and local standards of care. If the MRCT data does not meet the CFDA's registration requirements, the company may be required to conduct additional local clinical trials
that can potentially delay market access in China for imported drugs by an additional three to four years. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Chinese State Council and the CFDA have recently issued several statements and circulars aimed at improving and accelerating the new drug approval process in general. These include
the August 2015 statement issued by the Chinese State Council, </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Opinions on reforming the review and approval process for pharmaceutical products and medical

issued by the CFDA on March&nbsp;4, 2016. In the March&nbsp;4, 2016 CFDA announcement, the drugs approved outside China seeking marketing approval in China are now called Category&nbsp;5. We
believe these new regulatory initiatives will likely accelerate the approval process for new drugs,
including those marketed in other countries but not yet in China. However, how and when this approval process will be changed is still subject to further policies to be issued by the CFDA and is
currently uncertain. </FONT></P>

oncology market in China is estimated to have grown at a CAGR of 24% in the last decade through 2014. In recent years, sales of targeted therapy drugs in retail channels have
increased rapidly. Although expensive targeted therapy drugs are not included in basic national healthcare insurance and have historically had very little coverage by provincial insurance plans, the
targeted therapy drug market has continued to grow rapidly despite being an out-of-pocket market. This growth is attributable to patients' needs, newly launched drugs and patient's ability to pay for
drugs not covered by insurance. </FONT></P>

Introduction of Reimbursement  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chinese State Council requires central and provincial authorities across the PRC to promote a medical insurance program for major illnesses.
By the end by 2015, all urban and rural residents covered by basic medical insurance programs are required to be covered by the insurance program for major illnesses, according to a Chinese State
Council policy issued on July&nbsp;28, 2015. As a complement to basic insurance programs, this program is required to cover at least 50% of the medical cost incurred in connection with treating
major illnesses and is supplemental to basic insurance programs. The Chinese State Council now requires provincial authorities to increase reimbursement rates over the next three years. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According
to the PRC Central Government's guidance issued in March 2015, each province will decide which drugs to include in its provincial major illness reimbursement lists and the
percentage of reimbursement, based on local funding. For example, Zhejiang province, located in the Yangtze river delta area with a population of 55&nbsp;million, announced its provincial major
illness drug reimbursement list in early 2015. The list includes 31 high-priced drugs, 15 of which are targeted therapy agents for cancer, including Glivec, Ireesa, Erbitux, Herceptin, and Rituxan.
Although it will take three years to establish comprehensive national coverage, the affordability of the high-priced, novel cancer agents to Chinese patients could improve significantly. </FONT></P>

of only two companies today to wholly own both a clinical-stage BTK inhibitor for cancer treatment and PD-1 inhibitor and one of the few companies to have discovered, and advanced to clinical stage, a
PARP inhibitor and PD-1 inhibitor or a BRAF inhibitor and PD-1 inhibitor for use as combination therapies. In addition to monotherapy trials, we have initiated and are planning combination trials
using our wholly-owned drug candidates as well as third-party agents. For BGB-3111, in January 2016 we initiated a combination clinical trial with the anti-CD20 antibody, obinutuzumab, and the trial
is currently in the dose-expansion phase. In June&nbsp;2016, we initiated a combination clinical trial with BGB-A317 for the treatment of various B-cell malignancies. For BGB-290, in

growing markets for cancer drugs worldwide, representing approximately 20&#150;25% of the world's cancer population and an even greater proportion in lung, liver, and gastric cancers.
Because many global standard-of-care therapies are not currently approved and available in China,
there is a significant unmet need for innovative cancer drugs for patients who are naive to such treatments. In addition, focusing on cancer types of high prevalence in China will aid our global
development efforts in these indications. We have initiated clinical trials in China for each of our four clinical-stage drug candidates to develop them through the locally developed,
Category&nbsp;1 registration pathway. We plan to pursue accelerated development, single-arm registration studies and brief dose-escalation studies in China. We also strive to have our drug

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proprietary nature of, and protection for, our drug candidates and their methods of use are an important part of our strategy to develop and
commercialize novel medicines, as described in more detail below. We have obtained a U.S. patent and filed patent applications in the United States and other countries relating to certain of our drug
candidates, and are pursuing additional patent protection for them and for other of our drug candidates and technologies. We also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
term of individual patents may vary based on the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file including the United States, the term of an issued patent is
generally 20&nbsp;years from the earliest claimed filing date of a non-provisional patent application in the applicable country. In the United States, a patent's term may be lengthened in some cases
by a patent term adjustment, which extends the term of a patent to account for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office, or USPTO, in excess of a patent applicant's own delays during the prosecution process, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over a commonly owned patent having an
earlier expiration date. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period. However,
the restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term including the restoration period must not exceed 14&nbsp;years following FDA approval. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
certain foreign jurisdictions similar extensions as compensation for regulatory delays are also available. The actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a claim by claim and
country by country basis and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of any patent term extensions or adjustments, the availability of
legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore,
the patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical products and processes like those we intend to develop and commercialize are generally uncertain and involve complex
legal and factual questions. No consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in such patents has emerged to date in the United States. The scope of patent protection outside the United
States is even more uncertain. Changes in the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish our ability to protect our inventions, and enforce
our intellectual property rights and more generally, could affect the value of intellectual property. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally,
we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents or in patents owned by others. Substantial scientific and commercial research has
been conducted for many years in the areas in which we have focused our development efforts, which has resulted in other parties having a number of issued patents and pending patent applications
relating to such areas. Patent applications in the United States and elsewhere are generally published only after 18&nbsp;months from the priority date, and the publication of discoveries in the
scientific or patent literature frequently occurs substantially later than the date on which the underlying discoveries were made. Therefore, patents and patent applications relating to drugs similar
to our current drug candidates and any future drugs, discoveries or technologies we might develop may have already issued or been filed, which could prohibit us from commercializing our product
candidates. Specifically, we are aware of certain U.S. patents owned by Ono Pharmaceutical&nbsp;Co. and licensed to Bristol-Myers Squibb&nbsp;Co. that are relevant to our BGB-A317 drug candidate.
We are also aware of a U.S. patent owned by Pharmacyclics,&nbsp;Inc., which was acquired by AbbVie&nbsp;Inc., that is relevant to our BGB-3111 drug candidate, and certain U.S. patents owned or
licensed by KuDOS Pharmaceuticals,&nbsp;Ltd., which was acquired by AstraZeneca&nbsp;PLC, that are relevant to our BGB-290 drug candidate. For more information, see

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. Our ability to maintain and solidify
our proprietary position for our drug candidates and technology will depend on our success in obtaining effective claims and enforcing those claims once granted. We do not know whether any of the
patent applications that we may file or license from others will result in the issuance of any patents. The issued patents that we own or may receive in the future, may be challenged, invalidated or
circumvented, and the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our
competitors may be able to independently develop and commercialize similar drugs or duplicate our technology, business model or strategy without infringing our patents. Because of the extensive time </FONT></P>

commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing the proprietary rights of other parties. The issuance of any patent by others with claims covering or related to aspects

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once
a pharmaceutical product drug is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry,
toxicity, formulation and stability, as well as animal studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any
available clinical data or literature, to the FDA as part of the IND. The sponsor must also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the initial clinical trial, the
parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated if the initial clinical trial lends itself to an efficacy evaluation. Some preclinical testing may continue
even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30&nbsp;days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions related to a proposed clinical trial and
places the trial on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Clinical
holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during clinical trials
due to safety concerns or noncompliance, and may be imposed on all products within a certain class of products. The FDA also can impose partial clinical holds, for example, prohibiting the initiation
of clinical trials of a certain duration or for a certain dose. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All
clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with GCP regulations. These regulations include the requirement that all
research subjects provide informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Further, an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, must review and approve the plan for any
clinical trial before it commences at any institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. An IRB considers, among other things, whether the risks to
individuals participating in the clinical trial are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the information regarding the clinical trial and the consent
form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each
new clinical protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be filed with the FDA as an IND amendment, and to the IRBs for approval. Protocols detail, among other things, the

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical
tests conducted on the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA for a new drug or a BLA for a biologic, requesting approval to market the
product. The submission of an NDA or BLA is subject to the payment of a substantial user fee; although a waiver of such fee may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. For example, the agency
will waive the application fee for the first
human drug application that a small business or its affiliate submits for review. The sponsor of an approved NDA or BLA is also subject to annual product and establishment user fees. </FONT></P>

FDA reviews all NDAs and BLAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. The FDA may request additional
information rather than accept an NDA or BLA for filing. In this event, the NDA or BLA must be re-submitted with the additional information. The re-submitted application also is subject to review
before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a
product is safe and effective for its intended use, and a BLA to determine whether the biologic is safe, pure, and potent for its intended use. The FDA also evaluates whether the product's
manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure the product's identity, strength, quality and purity. Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the
product is or will be manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate
to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA may refer the NDA or BLA to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the
application should be approved and under what conditions. An advisory committee is a panel of experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, who provide advice and recommendations when
requested by the FDA. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making decisions. </FONT></P>

approval process is lengthy and difficult and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA or BLA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical
data or other data and information. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from
clinical trials are not always conclusive, and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. The </FONT></P>

including Phase&nbsp;4 clinical trials, to further assess a product's safety and effectiveness after NDA or BLA approval and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of
approved products that have been commercialized. The FDA could also approve the NDA or BLA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy plan to mitigate risks, which could include medication guides,
physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. </FONT></P>

<U>Fast Track Designation</U> </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
FDA has a Fast Track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs, including biologics that meet certain criteria.
Specifically, new drugs are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment and
demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied.
The sponsor of a new drug may request the FDA to designate the drug as a Fast Track product concurrently with, or at any time after, submission of an
IND, and the FDA must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for fast track designation within 60&nbsp;days of receipt of the sponsor's request. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition to other benefits, such as the ability to engage in more frequent interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track drug's NDA or BLA before
the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides, and the FDA approves, a schedule for the submission of each portion of the NDA or BLA and the applicant pays
applicable user fees. However, the FDA's time period goal for reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the NDA or BLA is submitted. Additionally, the Fast Track designation
may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process. </FONT></P>

<U>Accelerated Approval</U> </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under
FDA's accelerated approval regulations, the FDA may approve a drug, including a biologic, for a serious or life-threatening illness that provides meaningful
therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier
than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or
prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a
disease or condition that is thought to predict clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical
endpoints. A drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of post-approval clinical trials sometimes referred to as
Phase&nbsp;4 trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or to confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, will allow the
FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA. </FONT></P>

where there is evidence that the proposed product would be a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a serious condition. If criteria are
not met for priority review, the application is subject to the standard FDA review period of ten months after FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review designation does not change the

Post-Approval Requirements  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any products for which we receive FDA approval are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping
requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain
electronic records and signature requirements and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. Moreover, each component of a combination product retains their regulatory status (as a
drug or biologic, for example) and is subject to the requirements established by the FDA for that type of component. The FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion and other types of
information on products that are placed on the market. Products may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance
with the provisions of the approved label. Further, manufacturers must continue to comply with cGMP requirements, which are extensive and require considerable time, resources and ongoing investment to
ensure compliance. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding
new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manufacturers
and other entities involved in the manufacturing and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state
agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. The cGMP requirements apply to all stages of the
manufacturing process, including the production, processing, sterilization, packaging, labeling, storage and shipment of the product. Manufacturers must establish validated systems to ensure that
products meet specifications and regulatory requirements, and test each product batch or lot prior to its release. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of
clinical quantities of our drug candidates. Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution
or may require substantial resources to correct. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
FDA may withdraw a product approval or revoke a biologics license if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the

discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. Further, the failure to maintain
compliance with regulatory requirements may result in administrative or judicial actions, such as fines, untitled or warning letters, holds on clinical trials, product recalls or seizures, product
detention or refusal to permit the import or export of products, refusal to approve pending applications or supplements, restrictions on marketing or manufacturing, injunctions or civil or criminal

Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of the use of our drug candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible
for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a
patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the
remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14&nbsp;years from the product's approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND
and the submission date of an NDA or BLA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA or BLA and the approval of that application, except that this review period is reduced by any time during
which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to
the expiration of the patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, if available, we intend to
apply for restorations of patent term for some of our currently owned patents beyond their current expiration dates, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved
in the filing of the relevant NDA or BLA; however, there can be no assurance that any such extension will be granted to us. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Market
exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing
exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new
drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated
new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data
required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of
marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant
are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions
of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not
delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right </FONT></P>

Biosimilars and Exclusivity  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or ACA signed into law on March&nbsp;23, 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price
Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be similar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed reference biological
product. This amendment to the PHSA attempts to minimize duplicative testing. Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the
reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical trial or trials. Interchangeability requires that a product is
biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple
times, the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of
the reference biologic. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
reference biologic is granted twelve years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product. The first biologic product submitted under the abbreviated approval
pathway that is determined to be interchangeable with the reference product has exclusivity against other biologics submitting under the abbreviated approval pathway for the lesser of (i)&nbsp;one
year after the first commercial marketing, (ii)&nbsp;18&nbsp;months after approval if there is no legal challenge, (iii)&nbsp;18&nbsp;months after the resolution in the applicant's favor of a

Orphan Drugs  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs, including biologics, intended to treat a rare disease or
condition&#151;generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or that affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which
there is no reasonable expectation that costs of research and development of the product for the indication can be recovered by sales of the product in the United States. Orphan drug designation must
be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After
the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the drug or biologic and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does
not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first NDA or BLA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active ingredient to treat
a particular disease or condition with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product, for that indication. Among the other
benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA or BLA application user fee. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During
the exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease or condition, except in limited circumstances, such as if the

safe and effective. The FDASIA amended the FDCA to require that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a product that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new
dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within 60&nbsp;days of an end-of-Phase&nbsp;2 meeting or as may be agreed between the

and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to
provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial

Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. In the
United States, sales of any products for
which we may receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government
authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process
for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list which might not include all of the
FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Moreover, a payor's decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate
third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third-party
payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and
efficacy. In order to obtain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical
necessity and cost-effectiveness of any products, in addition to the costs required to obtain regulatory approvals. Our drug candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. If
third-party payors do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the product after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do,
the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its products at a profit. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
U.S. government and state legislatures have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including
price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. For example, the ACA, as amended by the Health Care and Education
Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively, the ACA, contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products, including, for example, increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by Medicaid
programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part&nbsp;D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies' share of
sales to federal health care programs. Adoption of government controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments
for pharmaceuticals. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and
reimbursement. In addition, an increasing emphasis on cost containment measures in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing.
Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory
approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
ACA broadened the reach of the fraud and abuse laws by, among other things, amending the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the applicable criminal
healthcare fraud statutes contained within 42 U.S.C. &sect;&nbsp;1320a-7b. Pursuant to the statutory amendment, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or
specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation
of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act or the civil monetary penalties statute. Many states have adopted laws similar
to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
federal False Claims Act prohibits anyone from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to federal programs (including Medicare and
Medicaid) claims for items or services that are false or fraudulent. Although we would not submit claims directly to payors, manufacturers can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to
"cause" the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. In addition, our future
activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting
federal, state, and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to scrutiny under this law. For example, pharmaceutical companies have been
prosecuted under the federal False Claims Act in connection with their off-label promotion of drugs. Penalties for a False Claims Act violation include three times the actual damages sustained by the
government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $10,781 and $21,563 for each separate false claim, the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, and, although
the federal False Claims Act is a civil
statute, conduct that results in a False Claims Act violation may also implicate various federal criminal statutes. In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring actions under the federal
False Claims Act and certain states have enacted laws modeled after the federal False Claims Act. </FONT></P>

Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March 2010, the ACA was enacted, which includes measures that have or will significantly change the way health care is financed by both
governmental and private insurers. Among the provisions of the ACA of greatest importance to the pharmaceutical industry are the following:</FONT></P>

<UL>
<DL compact>
<DT style='font-family:times;margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2> The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the
Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer's outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. The ACA
made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers' rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription
drugs from 15.1% of average manufacturer price, or AMP, to 23.1% of AMP, and adding a new rebate calculation for "line extensions" (i.e.,&nbsp;new formulations, such as extended release
formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. The ACA also expanded the universe
of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization and by expanding the population potentially eligible for
Medicaid drug benefits. In addition, the ACA provides for the public availability of retail survey prices and certain weighted average AMPs under the Medicaid program. The implementation of this
requirement by Centers for Medicare&nbsp;&amp; Medicaid Services, or CMS, may also provide for the public availability of pharmacy acquisition of cost data, which could negatively impact our sales. </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2>
<BR><BR></FONT></DD><DT style='font-family:times;margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2> In order for a pharmaceutical product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicare Part&nbsp;B and Medicaid programs or to be sold
directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is
calculated based on the AMP and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer. The ACA expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing, although, under the current
state of the law, with the exception of children's hospitals, these newly eligible entities will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan drugs when used for the orphan indication.
In addition, as 340B drug pricing is determined based on AMP and Medicaid rebate data, the revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required 340B
discount to increase. </FONT><FONT SIZE=2>
<BR><BR></FONT></DD><DT style='font-family:times;margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2> The ACA imposed a requirement on manufacturers of branded drugs to provide a 50% discount off the negotiated price of branded drugs dispensed
to Medicare Part&nbsp;D patients in the coverage gap (i.e.,&nbsp;the "donut hole"). </FONT><FONT SIZE=2>
<BR><BR></FONT></DD><DT style='font-family:times;margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2> The ACA imposed an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs, apportioned among
these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs, although this fee would not apply to sales of certain products approved exclusively for orphan indications. </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2>
<BR><BR></FONT></DD><DT style='font-family:times;margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2> The ACA required pharmaceutical and biologics manufacturers to track certain financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals,

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since
its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to numerous aspects of the ACA. In January, Congress voted to adopt a budget resolution for fiscal year 2017
that, while not a
law, is widely viewed as the first step toward the passage of legislation to repeal the ACA. Further, on January&nbsp;20, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies
with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on
states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. Congress also could consider subsequent legislation to replace elements of the ACA
that are repealed. We cannot predict how the ACA, its possible repeal, any legislation that may be proposed to replace the ACA, or the political uncertainty surrounding any repeal or replacement
legislation will affect our business. </FONT></P>

in January 2009, the CFDA conducts special examination and approval for new drugs registration application when: </FONT></P>

</UL>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Special Examination and Approval Provisions provide that the applicant may file for special examination and approval at the stage of Clinical Trial Application if the drug candidate
falls within item&nbsp;(1). The provisions provide that for drug candidates that fall within items&nbsp;(2) or (3), the application for special examination and approval must be made when filing
for production. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
believe that BGB-3111, BGB-A317, BGB 290 and BGB-283 fall within items&nbsp;(1) and (2)&nbsp;above. Therefore, we may file an application for special examination and approval at
the Clinical Trial Application stage, which may enable us to pursue a more expedited path to approval in China and bring therapies to patients more quickly. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>The
Advantages of Category&nbsp;1 New Drugs over Imported Drugs </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imported
drugs are drugs manufactured outside China. Drugs which have already been marketed abroad by multinational companies, but are not yet approved in China are required to follow
the process applicable to imported drugs in registration. Compared with the application for imported drugs, the application for Category&nbsp;1 domestic new drugs has a more straight-forward
registration pathway. According to Provisions for Drug Registration, where a special examination and approval treatment is granted, the application for clinical trial and manufacturing will be handled
with priority and with enhanced communication with the Center for Drug Evaluation of the CFDA, or the CDE, which will establish a working mechanism for communicating with the applicants. If it becomes
necessary to revise the clinical trial scheme or make other major alterations during the clinical trial, the applicant may file an application for communication. According to the </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>Administrative Measures on Communications for
Drug Development and Technical Evaluation</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> issued by CFDA in June 2016, when an application for
communication is approved, the CDE will arrange the communication with the applicant within 30 to 60 days, depending on the subject matter of such communication. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
comparison, according to Provisions for Drug Registration, the registration pathway for imported drugs is complicated and evolving. Imported drug applications may only be submitted
after a company obtains an NDA approval and receive the CPP granted by a major regulatory authority, such as the FDA or the EMA. Multinational companies may need to apply for conducting MRCTs, which
means that companies do not have the flexibility to design the clinical trials to fit the Chinese patients and standard-of-care. Imported drug candidates under Category 5 cannot qualify for the
national priority list to benefit from fast track reviews. Moreover, a requirement to further conduct local clinical trials can potentially delay market access by several years from its international
NDA approval. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
drug candidates are all new therapeutic agents and the registration applications for all four of them are filed under Category&nbsp;1. The CFDA has approved our Clinical Trial
Applications for all four of our drug candidates, i.e. BGB-3111, BGB-A317, BGB-283, and BGB-290, including all phases of their clinical trials. </FONT></P>

PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law and Its Implementation  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, or EIT Law, and its implementation rules permit certain High and New Technologies Enterprises, or HNTEs, to
enjoy preferential enterprise income tax rates subject to these HNTEs meeting certain qualification criteria. In April 2008, the State Administration of Taxation, or SAT, the Ministry of Science and
Technology, or MOST and the Ministry of Finance, or MOF jointly issued the </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Administrative Rules for the Certification of High and New Technology
Enterprises</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> specifying the criteria and procedures for the certification of HNTEs. In January 2016, revised version of the </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Administrative Rules for the
Certification of High and New Technology Enterprises</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> has been issued by the SAT, the MOST and the MOF, and replaced the 2008 version, while the material criteria of HNTEs
remains unchanged. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant
to the Temporary Regulations on Business Tax, which were promulgated by the Chinese State Council on December&nbsp;13, 1993 and effective as of January&nbsp;1, 1994, as
amended on November&nbsp;10, 2008 and effective as of January&nbsp;1, 2009, any entity or individual conducting business in a service industry is generally required to pay business tax at the rate
of 5% on the revenues generated from providing such services. However, if the services provided are related to technological development and transfer, such business tax may be exempted subject to
approval by the relevant tax authorities. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
November 2011, the MOF and the SAT promulgated the Pilot Plan for Imposition of Value-Added Tax, or VAT, to Replace Business Tax, or the Pilot Plan. Since January 2012, the SAT has
been implementing the Pilot Plan, which imposes VAT, in lieu of business tax for certain industries in Shanghai. The Pilot Plan was expanded to other regions, including Beijing, in September 2012, and
was further expanded nationwide beginning August&nbsp;1, 2013. VAT is applicable at a rate of 6% in lieu of business taxes for certain services and 17% for the sale of goods and provision of
tangible property lease services. VAT payable on goods sold or taxable services provided by a general VAT taxpayer for a taxable period is the net balance of the output VAT for the period after
crediting the input VAT for the period. </FONT></P>

and support for the design of Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trial, and settle the administrative dose regimen. Phase&nbsp;3 refers to clinical trials undertaken to confirm the therapeutic effectiveness of
a drug. Phase&nbsp;3 is used to further verify the drug's therapeutic effectiveness and safety on patients with target indication(s), to evaluate overall benefit-risk relationships of the drug, and
ultimately to provide sufficient evidence for the review of drug registration application. Phase&nbsp;4 refers to a new drug's post-marketing study to assess therapeutic effectiveness and adverse
reactions when the drug is widely used, to evaluate overall benefit-risk relationships of the drug when used among general population or specific groups, and to adjust the administration dose, etc. </FONT></P>

General </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant
to the Patent Law of the PRC and its implementation rules, patents in the PRC fall into three categories, namely invention patent, utility model and design
patent. Invention patent refers to a new technical solution proposed in respect of a product, method or its improvement; utility model refers to a new technical solution that is practicable for
application and proposed in respect of the shape, structure or a combination of both of a product; and design patent refers to the new design of a certain product in shape, pattern or a combination of
both and in color, shape and pattern combinations aesthetically suitable for industrial application. Under the Patent Law of the PRC, the term of patent protection starts from the date the patent was
filed. Patents relating to utility-models and designs are effective for ten years from the initial date the patent application was filed. The Patent Law of the PRC adopts the principle of "first to
file," which means where more than one person files&nbsp;a patent application for the same invention, a patent will be granted to the person who first filed the application. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Existing
patents can become invalid or unenforceable due to a number of factors, including known or unknown prior art, deficiencies in patent application and lack of novelty in
technology. In the PRC, a patent must have novelty, innovation and practical application. Under the Patent Law of PRC, novelty means that before a patent application is filed, no identical invention
or utility model has been publicly disclosed in any publication in the PRC or abroad or has been publicly used or made known to the public by any other means, whether in or outside of China, nor has
any other person filed with the patent authority an application that describes an identical invention or utility model and is published after the filing date. Patents in the PRC are filed with the
State Intellectual Property Office, or SIPO. Normally, the SIPO publishes an application for a pharmaceutical invention 18&nbsp;months after the application is filed, which may be shortened upon
request by the applicant. The applicant must apply to the SIPO for a substantive examination within three years from the date the application is filed. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article&nbsp;20
of the Patent Law of the PRC provides that, for an invention or utility model completed in China, any applicant, not just Chinese companies and individuals, before
filing a patent application outside of China, must first submit it to the SIPO for a confidential examination. Failure to comply with this requirement will result in the denial of any Chinese patent
for the subject invention. This added requirement of confidential examination by the SIPO has raised concerns by foreign companies who conduct research and development activities in the PRC or
outsource research and development activities to service providers in the PRC. Currently we have three invention patents published by SIPO and one invention patent under the application process. </FONT></P>

Patent Enforcement </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unauthorized
use of patents without consent from owners of patents, forgery of the patents belonging to other persons, or engagement in other infringement acts against
patent rights, will subject the infringers to tortious liabilities. Serious offences may be subject to criminal penalties. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When
a dispute arises as a result of infringement of the patent owner's patent right, PRC law requires that the parties first attempt to settle the dispute through consultation between
them. However, if the dispute cannot be settled through consultation, the patent owner, or an interested party who believes the patent is being infringed, may either file&nbsp;a civil legal suit or
file an administrative complaint with the relevant patent administration authority under the SIPO. A PRC court may issue a preliminary injunction upon the patent owner's or an interested party's
request before instituting any legal proceedings or during the proceedings. Damages for infringement are calculated as either the loss suffered by the patent holder arising from the infringement or
the benefit gained by the infringer from the infringement. If it is difficult to ascertain damages in this manner, damages may be determined by </FONT></P>

a reasonable multiple of the license fee under a contractual license. As in other jurisdictions, with one notable exception, the patent owner in the PRC has the burden of proving that the patent
is being infringed. However, if the owner of a manufacturing process patent alleges infringement of its patent, the alleged infringer has the burden of proving that it has not infringed. To our
knowledge, there are no disputes as to our infringement of any third party's patent. </FONT></P>

<U>Trade Secrets</U> </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According
to the Anti-Unfair Competition Law of the PRC, the term "trade secrets" refers to technical information and business information that is unknown to the
public, that has utility and may create business interest or profit for its legal owners or holders, and that is maintained as a secret by its legal owners or holders. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under
this law, business persons are prohibited from employing the following methods to infringe trade secrets: (1)&nbsp;obtaining the trade secrets from the legal owners or holders by
any unfair methods such as stealing, solicitation or coercion; (2)&nbsp;disclosing, using or permitting others to use the trade secrets obtained illegally under item&nbsp;(1) above; or
(3)&nbsp;disclosing, using or permitting others to use the trade secrets, in violation of any contractual agreements or any requirements of the legal owners or holders to keep such trade secrets in
confidence. If a third party knows or should have known of the above-mentioned illegal conduct but nevertheless obtains, uses or discloses trade secrets of others, the third party may be deemed to
have committed a misappropriation of the others' trade secrets. The parties whose trade secrets are being misappropriated may petition for administrative corrections, and regulatory authorities may
stop any illegal activities and fine infringing parties in the amount of RMB&nbsp;10,000&#151;200,000. Alternatively, persons whose trade secrets are being misappropriated may file lawsuits
in a PRC court for loss and damages caused by the misappropriation. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
measures to protect trade secrets include oral or written agreements or other reasonable measures to require the employees of, or persons in business contact with, legal owners or
holders to keep trade secrets confidential. Once the legal owners or holders have asked others to keep trade secrets confidential and have adopted reasonable protection measures, the requested persons
bear the responsibility for keeping the trade secrets confidential. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Foreign Exchange Administration Regulations, most recently amended in August 2008, are the principal regulations governing foreign currency exchange in China. Under
the PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, such as profit distributions and trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, may be made in foreign currencies
without prior approval from the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, by complying with certain procedural requirements. In contrast, approval from or registration with appropriate

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>required
when RMB is to be converted into a foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of foreign currency-denominated loans. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
August 2008, SAFE issued the Circular on the Relevant Operating Issues Concerning the Improvement of the Administration of the Payment and Settlement of Foreign Currency Capital of
Foreign-Invested Enterprises, or SAFE Circular 142, regulating the conversion by a foreign-invested enterprise of foreign currency-registered capital into RMB by restricting how the converted RMB may
be used. In addition, SAFE promulgated Notice on Issues concerning Further Clarifying and Regulating the Foreign Exchange Administration under Some Capital Accounts, or Circular 45, on
November&nbsp;9, 2011 to clarify the application of SAFE Circular 142. Under SAFE Circular 142 and Circular 45, RMB capital converted from foreign currency registered capital of a foreign-invested
enterprise may only be used for purposes within the business scope approved by the applicable government authority and may not be used for equity investments within the PRC. In addition, SAFE
strengthened its oversight of the flow and use of the RMB capital converted from foreign currency registered capital of foreign-invested enterprises. The use of such RMB capital may not be changed
without SAFE's approval, and such RMB capital may not, in any case, be used to repay RMB loans whose proceeds were not used. Furthermore, SAFE promulgated Notice on Issues Concerning Strengthening
Administration of Foreign Exchange Services in November 2010, which tightens the regulation over settlement of net proceeds from overseas offerings, such as our initial public offering, and requires,
among other things, the authenticity of settlement of net proceeds from offshore offerings to be closely examined and the net
proceeds to be settled in the manner described in our prospectus or otherwise approved by our board of directors. Violations of these SAFE regulations may result in severe monetary or other penalties,
including confiscation of earnings derived from such violation activities, a fine of up to 30% of the RMB funds converted from the foreign invested funds or in the case of a severe violation, a fine
ranging from 30% to 100% of the RMB funds converted from the foreign-invested funds. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
November 2012, SAFE promulgated the Circular of Further Improving and Adjusting Foreign Exchange Administration Policies on Foreign Direct Investment, which substantially amends and
simplifies the current foreign exchange procedure. Pursuant to this circular, the opening of various special purpose foreign exchange accounts, such as pre-establishment expenses accounts, foreign
exchange capital accounts and guarantee accounts, the reinvestment of RMB proceeds by foreign investors in the PRC, and remittance of foreign exchange profits and dividends by a foreign-invested
enterprise to its foreign shareholders no longer require the approval or verification of SAFE, and multiple capital accounts for the same entity may be opened in different provinces, which was not
previously possible. In addition, SAFE promulgated the Circular on Printing and Distributing the Provisions on Foreign Exchange Administration over Domestic Direct Investment by Foreign Investors and
the Supporting Documents in May 2013, which specifies that the administration by the SAFE or its local branches over direct investment by foreign investors in the PRC will be conducted by way of
registration, and banks must process foreign exchange business relating to the direct investment in the PRC based on the registration information provided by SAFE and its branches. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under
the Circular of the SAFE on Further Improving and Adjusting the Policies for Foreign Exchange Administration under Capital Accounts promulgated by the SAFE on January&nbsp;10,
2014 and effective from February&nbsp;10, 2014, administration over the outflow of the profits by domestic institutions has been further simplified. In principle, a bank is no longer required to
examine transaction documents when handling the outflow of profits of no more than the equivalent of $50,000 by a domestic institution. When handling the outflow of profits exceeding the equivalent of
$50,000, the bank, in principle, is no longer required to examine the financial audit report and capital verification report of the domestic institution, provided that it must examine, according to
the principle of transaction authenticity, the profit distribution resolution of the board of directors, or the profit distribution resolution of the partners, relating to this profit outflow and the
original copy of its tax record-filing form. After each profit outflow, the bank must affix its seal to and endorsements on the </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
March&nbsp;30, 2015, SAFE promulgated the Circular on Reforming the Management Approach regarding the Settlement of Foreign Exchange Capital of Foreign-invested Enterprises, or SAFE
Circular 19, which became effective on June&nbsp;1, 2015. According to SAFE Circular 19, the foreign exchange capital of foreign-invested enterprises may be settled on a discretionary basis, meaning
that
the foreign exchange capital in the capital account of a foreign-invested enterprise for which the rights and interests of monetary contribution has been confirmed by the local foreign exchange
bureau, or the book-entry registration of monetary contribution by the banks, can be settled at the banks based on the actual operational needs of the foreign-invested enterprise. The proportion of
such discretionary settlement is temporarily determined as 100%. The RMB converted from the foreign exchange capital will be kept in a designated account, and if a foreign-invested enterprise needs to
make further payment from such account, it still must provide supporting documents and go through the review process with the banks. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore,
SAFE Circular 19 stipulates that the use of capital by foreign-invested enterprises must adhere to the principles of authenticity and self-use within the business scope of
enterprises. The capital of a foreign-invested enterprise and capital in RMB obtained by the foreign-invested enterprise from foreign exchange settlement must not be used for the following
purposes: </FONT></P>

June&nbsp;19, 2016, SAFE promulgated the Circular on Reforming and Regulating Policies on the Control over Foreign Exchange Settlement of Capital Accounts, or Circular 16, which
took effect on the same day. Compared to Circular 19, Circular 16 provides that discretionary foreign exchange settlement applies to foreign exchange capital, foreign debt offering proceeds and
remitted foreign listing proceeds, and the corresponding Renminbi obtained from foreign exchange settlement are not restricted to extending loans to related parties or repaying the inter-company
loans, including advances by third parties. However, since Circular 16 came into effect recently, there are substantial uncertainties with respect to its interpretation and implementation in practice. </FONT></P>

Regulation of Dividend Distribution  </I></FONT></P>

PRC, as amended, the Wholly Foreign-owned Enterprise Law and its implementation regulations, and the Equity Joint Venture Law and its implementation regulations. Under these laws, rules and
regulations, foreign-invested enterprises may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profit, if any, as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Both PRC domestic
companies and wholly-foreign owned PRC enterprises are required to allocate at least 10% of their respective accumulated after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund certain capital reserve funds
until the aggregate amount of these reserve funds have reached 50% of the registered capital of the enterprises. A PRC company is not permitted to distribute any profits until any losses from prior
fiscal years have been offset. Profits retained from prior fiscal years may be distributed together with distributable profits from the current fiscal year. </FONT></P>

materials for some of our small molecule drug candidates. In addition, we lease an approximately 11,000 square meter space and are building a manufacturing facility in Suzhou, China, where we intend
to produce drug candidates for clinical or, in the future, commercial use. This facility consists of one oral-solid-dosage production line for small molecule drug products and one pilot plant for
monoclonal antibody drug substances. We also outsource to a limited number of external service providers the production of some drug substances and drug products, and we expect to continue to do so to
meet the preclinical and clinical requirements
of our drug candidates. We have framework agreements with most of our external service providers, under which they generally provide services to us on a short-term and project-by-project basis. </FONT></P>

Guangzhou GET Technology Development&nbsp;Co.,&nbsp;Ltd to establish a commercial-scale biologics manufacturing facility in Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China. We expect to acquire at least

cGMP are regulatory requirements for the production of pharmaceuticals that will be used in humans. For most of our manufacturing processes a back-up cGMP manufacturer is in place or can easily be

We are a globally focused biopharmaceutical company and have a limited operating history, which may make it
difficult to evaluate our current business and predict our future performance.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a globally focused biopharmaceutical company formed in October 2010. Our operations to date have focused on organizing and staffing our
company, business planning, raising capital, establishing our intellectual property portfolio and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials of our current drug candidates, such as BGB-3111,
BGB-A317, BGB-290 and BGB-283. We have not yet demonstrated an ability to initiate or successfully complete large-scale, pivotal clinical trials, obtain regulatory approvals, manufacture a commercial
scale drug, or arrange for a third party to do so on our behalf, or conduct sales and marketing activities necessary for successful commercialization. We have not yet obtained regulatory approval for,
or demonstrated an ability to commercialize, any of our drug candidates. We have no products approved for commercial sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. Consequently, any
predictions you make about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history. In addition, as a new business, we may encounter unforeseen
expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other known and unknown factors. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
are focused on the discovery and development of innovative, molecularly targeted and immuno-oncology drugs for the treatment of cancers. Our limited operating history, particularly in
light of the rapidly evolving cancer treatment field, may make it difficult to evaluate our current business and predict our future performance. Our short history makes any assessment of our future
success or viability subject to significant uncertainty. We will encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by early-stage companies in rapidly evolving fields as we seek to transition to
a company capable of supporting commercial activities. If we do not address these risks and difficulties successfully, our business will suffer. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investment in pharmaceutical product development is highly speculative because it entails substantial upfront capital expenditures and
significant risk that a drug candidate will fail to gain regulatory approval or become commercially viable. We have devoted most of our financial resources to research and development, including our
nonclinical development activities and clinical trials. We have not generated any revenue from product sales to date, and we continue to incur significant development and other expenses related to our
ongoing operations. As a result, we are not profitable and have incurred losses in each period since our inception in 2010. We reported a net loss of $119.2&nbsp;million, $57.1&nbsp;million and
$18.5&nbsp;million, respectively, for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. As of December&nbsp;31, 2016, we had a deficit accumulated of $237.4&nbsp;million. Substantially </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future, and we expect these losses to increase as we continue our development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our drug
candidates, and begin to commercialize approved drugs, if any. Typically, it takes many years to develop one new drug from the time it is discovered to when it is available for treating patients. We
may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business. The size of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the
rate of future growth of our expenses, our ability to generate revenues and the timing and amount of milestones and other required payments to third parties in connection with our potential future
arrangements with third parties. If any of our drug candidates fail in clinical trials or do not gain regulatory approval, or if approved, fail to achieve market acceptance, we may never become
profitable. Even if we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods. Our prior losses and expected future losses have had, and will continue
to have, an adverse effect on our shareholders' equity and working capital. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
expect our research and development expenses to continue to be significant in connection with our continued investment in our cancer biology platform and our ongoing and planned
clinical trials for our drug candidates, such as BGB-3111, BGB-A317, BGB-290 and BGB-283. Furthermore, if we obtain regulatory approval for our drug candidates, we expect to incur increased sales and
marketing expenses. In addition, we will incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. As a result, we expect to continue to incur significant and increasing operating losses
and negative cash flows for the foreseeable future. These losses have had and will continue to have a material adverse effect on our shareholders' deficit, financial position, cash flows and working
capital. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our ability to generate revenue and become profitable depends upon our ability to successfully complete the development of, and obtain the
necessary regulatory approvals for, our drug candidates, such as BGB-3111, BGB-A317, BGB-290 and BGB-283, as we do not currently have any drugs that are available for commercial sale. We expect to
continue to incur substantial and increasing losses through the projected commercialization of our drug candidates. None of our drug candidates have been approved for marketing in the United States,
the European Union, the People's Republic of China, or PRC, or any other jurisdiction and may never receive such approval. Our ability to achieve revenue and profitability is dependent on our ability

addition, because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with drug development, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses, or when, or if, we
will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. In addition, our expenses could increase beyond expectations if we are required by the FDA; the CFDA; the EMA; or other comparable regulatory
authorities to perform studies in addition to those that we currently anticipate. Even if our drug candidates are approved for commercial sale, we anticipate incurring significant costs associated
with the commercial launch of these drugs. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
ability to become and remain profitable depends on our ability to generate revenue. Even if we are able to generate revenues from the sale of our potential drugs, we may not become
profitable and may need to obtain additional funding to continue operations. If we fail to become profitable or are
unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce our operations. Even if we do achieve profitability,
we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable would decrease the value of our company and could impair our ability
to raise capital, expand our business or continue our operations. Failure to become and remain profitable may adversely affect the market price of the ADSs and our ability to raise capital and

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have financed our operations with a combination of equity and debt offerings, contracts, and private and public grants. Through
December&nbsp;31, 2016, we raised approximately $170&nbsp;million in private equity financing and $10&nbsp;million in non-convertible debt financings. To date, we have received a total of
$37&nbsp;million in upfront payments and milestone payments through our collaboration arrangements with Merck KGaA, Darmstadt Germany for BGB-283 and BGB-290. On February&nbsp;8, 2016 and
November&nbsp;23, 2016, we completed our initial public offering and follow-on public offering of the ADSs and received net proceeds of $166.2&nbsp;million and $198.6&nbsp;million, respectively,
after deducting underwriting discount and offering expenses. Our drug candidates will require the completion of regulatory review, significant marketing efforts and substantial investment before they
can provide us with any product sales revenue. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception. Our operating activities used $89.5&nbsp;million, $39.8&nbsp;million and $8.7&nbsp;million of net cash
during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We expect to continue to spend substantial amounts on drug discovery advancing the clinical development of our drug
candidates, and launching and commercializing any drug candidates for which we receive regulatory approval, including building our own commercial organizations to address certain markets. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
value of the RMB against the U.S. dollar and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by, among other things, changes in political and economic conditions and the foreign
exchange policy adopted by the PRC, Australia and other non-U.S. governments. Specifically in the PRC, on July&nbsp;21, 2005, the PRC government changed its policy of pegging the value of the RMB to
the U.S. dollar. Following the removal of the U.S. dollar peg, the RMB appreciated more than 20% against the U.S. dollar over the following three years. Between July 2008 and June 2010, this
appreciation halted and
the exchange rate between the RMB and the U.S. dollar remained within a narrow band. Since June 2010, the PRC government has allowed the RMB to appreciate slowly against the U.S. dollar again, and it
has appreciated more than 10% since June 2010. In April 2012, the PRC government announced that it would allow more RMB exchange rate fluctuation. On August&nbsp;11, 2015, China's central bank
executed a 2% devaluation in the RMB. Over the following two days, Chinese currency fell 3.5% against the dollar. However, it remains unclear what further fluctuations may occur or what impact this
will have on the currency. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It
is difficult to predict how market forces or PRC, Australian, U.S. or other government policies may impact the exchange rate between the Australian dollar, RMB, U.S. dollar and other
currencies in the future. There remains significant international pressure on the PRC government to adopt a more flexible currency policy, which could result in greater fluctuation of the RMB against
the U.S. dollar. Substantially all of our revenues are denominated in U.S. dollars and our costs are denominated in U.S. dollars, Australian dollars and RMB, and a large portion of our financial
assets and a significant portion of our debt is denominated in U.S. dollars. Any significant revaluation of the RMB may materially reduce any dividends payable on the ADSs in U.S. dollars. To the
extent that we need to convert U.S. dollars we received from our initial public offering and follow-on public offering into RMB for our operations, appreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar
would have an adverse effect on the RMB amount we would receive. Conversely, if we decide to convert our RMB into U.S. dollars for the purpose of making payments for dividends on our ordinary shares
or ADSs or for other business purposes, appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the RMB would have a negative effect on the U.S. dollar amount we would receive. </FONT></P>

The regulatory approval processes of the FDA, CFDA, EMA and other comparable regulatory authorities are

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time required to obtain approval by the FDA, CFDA, EMA and other comparable regulatory authorities is unpredictable but typically takes many
years following the commencement of preclinical studies and clinical trials and depends upon numerous factors, including the substantial discretion of the regulatory authorities. In addition, approval
policies, regulations or the type and amount of clinical data necessary to gain approval may change during the course of a drug candidate's clinical development and may vary among jurisdictions. We
have not obtained regulatory approval for any drug candidate, and it is possible that none of our existing drug candidates or any drug candidates we may discover, in-license or acquire and seek to
develop in the future will ever obtain regulatory approval. </FONT></P>

more limited indications than we request, may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials, or may approve a drug candidate with a label that is not desirable
for the successful commercialization of that drug candidate. In addition, if our drug candidate produces undesirable side effects or safety issues, the FDA may require the establishment of a Risk
Evaluation Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, or the CFDA, EMA or a comparable regulatory authority may require the establishment of a similar strategy, that may, for instance, restrict distribution of our
drugs and impose burdensome implementation requirements on us. Any of the foregoing scenarios could materially harm the commercial prospects of our drug candidates. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one of the key elements of our clinical development strategy, we seek to identify patient subsets within a disease category who may derive
selective and meaningful benefit from the drug candidates we are developing. In collaboration with partners, we plan to develop companion diagnostics to help us to more accurately identify patients
within a particular subset, both during our clinical trials and in connection with the commercialization of our drug candidates. Companion
diagnostics are subject to regulation by the FDA, CFDA, EMA and other comparable regulatory authorities and require separate regulatory approval or clearance prior to commercialization. We do not
develop companion diagnostics internally, and thus we are dependent on the sustained cooperation and effort of our third-party collaborators in developing and obtaining approval or clearance for these
companion diagnostics. We and our collaborators may encounter difficulties in developing and obtaining approval or clearance of the companion diagnostics, including issues relating to
selectivity/specificity, analytical validation, reproducibility or clinical validation. Any delay or failure by our collaborators to develop or obtain regulatory approval or clearance of the companion
diagnostics could delay or prevent approval of our drug candidates. In addition, our collaborators may encounter production difficulties that could constrain the supply of the companion diagnostics,
and both they and we may have difficulties gaining acceptance of the use of the companion diagnostics in the clinical community. A failure of such companion diagnostics to gain market acceptance would
have an adverse effect on our ability to derive revenues from sales of our drugs. In addition, the diagnostic company with whom we contract may decide to discontinue selling or manufacturing the
diagnostic we anticipate using in connection with development and commercialization of our drug candidates or our relationship with such diagnostic company may otherwise terminate. We may not be able
to enter into arrangements with another diagnostic company to obtain supplies of an alternative diagnostic test for use in connection with the development and commercialization of our drug candidates
or do so on commercially reasonable terms, which could adversely affect and/or delay the development or commercialization of our drug candidates. </FONT></P>

A Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA, even if granted for any of our drug candidates, may not lead
to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process, and does not increase the likelihood that our drug candidates will receive regulatory approval.  </I></B></FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not currently have Breakthrough Therapy Designation for any of our drug candidates but may seek it in the future. A Breakthrough Therapy
is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates
that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical
development. For drugs that have been designated as Breakthrough Therapies, interaction and communication between the FDA and the sponsor can help to identify the most efficient path for development. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Designation
as a Breakthrough Therapy is within the discretion of the FDA. Accordingly, even if we believe, after completing early clinical trials, that one of our drug candidates meets
the criteria for designation as a Breakthrough Therapy, the FDA may disagree and instead decide not to grant that designation. In any event, the receipt of a Breakthrough Therapy designation for a
drug candidate may not result in a faster development process, review or approval compared to drugs considered for approval under conventional FDA procedures and does not assure ultimate approval by
the FDA. In addition, even if one or more of our drug candidates qualify as Breakthrough Therapies, the FDA may later decide that such drug candidates no longer meet the conditions for qualification. </FONT></P>

We may seek orphan drug exclusivity for some of our drug candidates, and we may be unsuccessful.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regulatory authorities in some jurisdictions, including the United States and Europe, may designate drugs for relatively small patient
populations as orphan drugs. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a drug as an orphan drug if it is a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a
disease with a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or that affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable
expectation that costs of research and development of the product for the indication can be recovered by sales of the product in the United States. BGB-3111 received orphan drug designation from the
FDA for CLL, MCL and WM in 2016. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally,
if a drug with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first regulatory approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the drug is entitled to a
period of marketing exclusivity, which precludes the FDA or EMA, from approving another marketing application for the same drug for the same indication during the period of exclusivity. The applicable
period is seven years in the United States and 10&nbsp;years in Europe. The European exclusivity period can be reduced to six years if a drug no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation
or if the drug is sufficiently profitable so that market exclusivity is no longer justified. Orphan drug exclusivity may be lost if the
FDA or the EMA determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the
rare disease or condition. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even
if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a drug candidate, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the drug candidate from competition because different drugs can be approved
for the same condition and the same drugs can be approved for a different condition but used off-label for any orphan indication we may obtain. Even after an orphan drug is approved, the FDA can
subsequently approve a drug that is otherwise the same drug for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If our drug candidates are approved, they will be subject to ongoing regulatory requirements for manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage,

requirements in the United States and requirements of comparable regulatory authorities. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manufacturers
and manufacturers' facilities are required to comply with extensive FDA, CFDA, EMA and comparable regulatory authority, requirements, including, in the United States,
ensuring that quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMP regulations. As such, we and our contract manufacturers will be subject to continual review and inspections to assess
compliance with cGMP and adherence to commitments made in any NDA or BLA, other marketing application, and previous responses to inspection observations. Accordingly, we and others with whom we work
must continue to expend time, money and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing, production and quality control. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any
regulatory approvals that we receive for our drug candidates may be subject to limitations on the approved indicated uses for which the drug may be marketed or to the conditions of
approval, or contain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing testing, including Phase&nbsp;4 clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the drug candidate. The
FDA may also require a REMS program as a condition of approval of our drug candidates, which could entail requirements for long-term patient follow-up, a medication guide, physician communication
plans or additional elements to ensure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. In addition, if the FDA, CFDA, EMA or a comparable
regulatory authority approves our drug candidates, we will have to comply with requirements including, for example, submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports,
registration, as well as continued compliance with cGMP and GCP, for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The

manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or
clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other

FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for their approved indications and for use
in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA, CFDA, EMA and other regulatory authorities actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and
a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. The policies of the FDA, CFDA, EMA and of other regulatory authorities may change and
additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our drug candidates. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government
regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption

If we are not able to obtain, or experience delays in obtaining, required regulatory approvals, we will not

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We currently do not have any drug candidates that have gained regulatory approval for sale in the United States, European Union, China or any
other country, and we cannot guarantee that we will ever have marketable drugs. Our business is substantially dependent on our ability to complete the development of, obtain regulatory approval for
and successfully commercialize drug candidates in a timely manner. We cannot commercialize drug candidates without first obtaining regulatory approval to market each drug from the FDA, CFDA, EMA and
comparable regulatory authorities. BGB-3111, BGB-A317, BGB-290 and BGB-283 are each currently undergoing clinical trials. We cannot predict whether these trials and future trials will be successful or
whether regulators will agree with our conclusions regarding the preclinical studies and clinical trials we have conducted to date. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before
obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any drug candidate for a target indication, we must demonstrate in preclinical studies and well-controlled clinical
trials, and, with respect to approval in the United States, to the satisfaction of the FDA, that the drug candidate is safe and effective for use for that target indication and that the manufacturing
facilities, processes and controls are adequate. In the United States, we have not submitted an NDA or BLA for any of our drug candidates. An NDA or BLA must include extensive preclinical and clinical
data and supporting information to establish, in the case of an NDA, the drug candidate's safety and effectiveness or, in the case of a BLA, safety, purity and potency for each desired indication. The
NDA or BLA must also include significant information regarding the chemistry, manufacturing and controls for the drug. Obtaining approval of an NDA or BLA is a lengthy, expensive and uncertain
process, and approval may not be obtained. If we submit an NDA or BLA to the FDA, the FDA decides whether to accept or reject the submission for filing. We cannot be certain that any submissions will
be accepted for filing and review by the FDA. </FONT></P>

of drugs for commercial sale with which we must comply prior to marketing in those areas. Regulatory requirements can vary widely from country to country and could delay or prevent the
introduction of our drug candidates. Clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries, and obtaining regulatory approval in one country does
not mean that regulatory approval will be obtained in any other country. Approval processes vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and validation and additional administrative
review periods. Seeking non-U.S. regulatory approval could require additional nonclinical studies or clinical
trials, which could be costly and time consuming. The non-U.S. regulatory approval process may include all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. For all of these reasons, we may not
obtain non-U.S. regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically,
in China, the CFDA categorizes domestically-manufactured innovative drug applications as Category&nbsp;1 and imported innovative drug applications as Category&nbsp;5.
To date, most of local companies' domestically-manufactured drug applications are filed in Category&nbsp;1 if the drug has not already been approved by the FDA or EMA. Most multinational
pharmaceutical companies' drug registration applications are filed in Category&nbsp;5 applicable to imported drugs, formerly known as Category 3 prior to the reclassification implemented by the CFDA
in 2016. These two categories have distinct approval pathways, as described in "Item&nbsp;1&#151;Business&#151;Regulatory Framework and Structural Advantages of Being a China-Based
Research and Development Organization." We believe the local drug registration pathway, Category&nbsp;1, is a faster and more efficient path to approval in the Chinese market than Category&nbsp;5.
Companies are required to obtain Clinical Trial Application approval before conducting clinical trials in China. This registration pathway has a fast track review and approval mechanism if the drug
candidate is on a national priority list. The imported drug registration pathway, Category&nbsp;5, is more complex and is evolving. China Category&nbsp;5 registration applications may only be
submitted after a drug has obtained an NDA approval and received the CPP granted by a major drug regulatory authority, such as the FDA or EMA. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe the local drug registration pathway, Category&nbsp;1, is a faster and more efficient path to approval in the Chinese market than
the drug registration pathway for imported drugs under Category&nbsp;5. Companies are required to obtain Clinical Trial Application approval before conducting clinical trials in China. This
registration pathway has a fast track review and approval mechanism if the drug candidate is on a national priority list. Imported drug candidates under Category&nbsp;5 cannot qualify for the
national priority list to benefit from fast track reviews. Our drug candidates are all new therapeutic agents and we have built both research and development, clinical trial capacities, and commercial
manufacturing facilities in China. As a result, we expect all of our current drug candidates to fall within the Category&nbsp;1 application process, but cannot be sure we will be granted or be able

We face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing
competing drugs before or more successfully than we do.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development and commercialization of new drugs is highly competitive. We face competition with respect to our current drug candidates, and
will face competition with respect to any drug candidates that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future, from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and
biotechnology companies worldwide. There are a number of large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that currently market and sell drugs or are pursuing the development of drugs for the
treatment of cancer for which we are developing our drug candidates. Some of these competitive drugs and therapies are based on scientific approaches that are the same as or similar to our approach,
and others are based on entirely different approaches. Potential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct
research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically,
there are a large number of companies developing or marketing treatments for cancer, including many major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. See
"Item&nbsp;1&#151;Business&#151;Competition." </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize drugs that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are
more convenient or are less expensive than any drugs that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain approval from the FDA, CFDA, EMA or other comparable regulatory authorities for their drugs
more
rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market and or slow our regulatory approval.
Furthermore, the regulatory framework in China regarding imported drugs may undergo changes that could erode our competitive advantage with respect to the Chinese domestic regulatory pathway. For
example, on March&nbsp;17, 2017, the CFDA published a draft Decision on Regulation Adjustment on Imported Drugs Registration that if adopted would potentially accelerate the regulatory approval
process for imported drugs. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many
of the companies against which we are competing or against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and
development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved drugs than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and
biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller and other early-stage companies may also prove to be significant
competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management
personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover,
the extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, will be substituted for any one of our reference products in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for
non-biological products is not yet clear and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition, a drug product approved under an NDA, such as BGB-3111, BGB-290 or BGB-283, if they were to be approved, could face generic competition earlier than expected. The enactment
of the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of 2012 as part of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012 established a user fee program that will generate hundreds of millions of
dollars in funding for the FDA's generic drug review program. Funding from the user fee program, along with performance goals that the FDA negotiated with the generic drug industry, could
significantly decrease the timeframe for FDA review and approval of generic drug applications. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cancer therapies are sometimes characterized as first line, second line or third line, and the FDA often approves new therapies initially only
for third line use. When cancer is detected early enough, first line therapy is sometimes adequate to cure the cancer or prolong life without a cure. Whenever first line therapy, usually chemotherapy,
hormone therapy, surgery or a combination of these, proves unsuccessful, second line therapy may be administered. Second line therapies often consist of more chemotherapy, radiation, antibody drugs,
tumor targeted small molecules or a combination of these. Third line therapies can include bone marrow transplantation,
antibody and small molecule targeted therapies, more invasive forms of surgery and new technologies. In markets with approved therapies, we expect to initially seek approval of our drug candidates as
a later stage therapy for patients who have failed other approved treatments. Subsequently, for those drugs that prove to be sufficiently beneficial, if any, we would expect to seek approval as a
second line therapy and potentially as a first line therapy, but there is no guarantee that our drug candidates, even if approved, would be approved for second line or first line therapy. In addition,
we may have to conduct additional clinical trials prior to gaining approval for second line or first line therapy. </FONT></P>

Even if we are able to commercialize any drug candidates, the drugs may become subject to unfavorable pricing
regulations, third party reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives, which could harm our business.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regulations that govern regulatory approvals, pricing and reimbursement for new therapeutic products vary widely from country to country.
Some countries require approval of the sale price of a drug before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing or licensing approval is granted. In some
non-U.S. markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. As a result, we might obtain regulatory approval for a
drug in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay our commercial launch of the drug and negatively impact the revenues we
are able to generate from the sale of the drug in that country. Adverse pricing limitations may hinder our ability to recoup our investment in one or more drug candidates, even if our drug candidates
obtain regulatory approval. For example, according to a statement, </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Opinions on reforming the review and approval process for pharmaceutical products and medical
devices</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, issued by the Chinese State Council in August 2015, the enterprises applying for new drug approval will be required to undertake that the selling price of new drug on
PRC mainland market shall not be higher than the comparable market prices of the product in its country of origin or PRC's neighboring markets, as applicable. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
ability to commercialize any drugs successfully also will depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement for these drugs and related treatments will be available from government
health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations,
decide which medications they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. A primary trend in the global healthcare industry is cost containment. Government authorities and these third-party
payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that companies provide them with
predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. We cannot be sure that reimbursement will be available for any drug that we commercialize and, if
reimbursement is available, what the level of reimbursement will be. Reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any drug for which we obtain regulatory approval. Obtaining reimbursement
for our drugs may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with drugs administered under the supervision of a physician. If reimbursement is not available or is
available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any drug candidate that we successfully develop. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There
may be significant delays in obtaining reimbursement for approved product drugs, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the drug is approved by the FDA or
other comparable regulatory authorities outside the United States. Moreover, eligibility for reimbursement does not imply that any drug will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our
costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. Interim payments for new drugs, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may not be made permanent.
Payment rates may vary according to the use of the drug and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on payments allowed for lower cost drugs that are already reimbursed, and may be
incorporated into existing payments for other services. Net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drugs exists among third-party payors. As a result, obtaining coverage and reimbursement approval of a drug from
a government or other third-party payor is a time-consuming and costly process that could require us to provide to each payor supporting scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data for the use of
our drugs on a payor-by-payor basis, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained. Even if we obtain coverage for a given drug, the resulting reimbursement payment rates
might not be adequate for us to achieve or sustain profitability or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high. Additionally, third-party payors may not cover, or provide adequate
reimbursement for, long-term follow-up evaluations required following the use of our genetically modified drugs. Patients are unlikely to use our drug candidates unless coverage is provided and
reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our drug candidates. Because our drug candidates have a higher cost of goods than conventional therapies, and may require
long-term follow up evaluations, the risk that coverage and reimbursement rates may be inadequate for us to achieve profitability may be greater. </FONT></P>

Chinese State Council asked central and provincial authorities across the PRC to promote a medical insurance program for major illnesses. By the end of 2015, all urban and rural
residents covered by basic medical insurance programs should be covered by the insurance program for major illnesses, according to Chinese State Council policy number&nbsp;2015-57, issued on
July&nbsp;28, 2015. As a complement to basic insurance programs, this program is required to cover at least 50% of the medical </FONT></P>

as incurred by treating major illnesses, but falls out of the coverage of the basic insurance programs. The Chinese State Council requires provincial authorities to increase reimbursement rates
over the next three years. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According
to the PRC Central Government's guidance issued in March 2015, each province will decide which drugs to include in its provincial major illness reimbursement lists and the
percentage of reimbursement, based on local funding. For example, Zhejiang province, located in the Yangtze river delta area with a population of 55&nbsp;million, announced its provincial major
illness drug reimbursement list in early 2015. The list includes 31 expensive drugs, among which 15 are targeted therapy agents for cancer, including Glivec, Ireesa, Erbitux, Herceptin, and Rituxan.
Although it will take three years to establish a comprehensive national coverage, the affordability of the expensive, novel cancer agents to Chinese patients will improve significantly and the
targeted therapy market is expected to enter a fast growing period. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
intend to seek approval to market our drug candidates in the United States, China, Europe and in other selected jurisdictions. If we obtain approval in one or more non-U.S.
jurisdictions for our drug candidates, we will be subject to rules and regulations in those jurisdictions. In some non-U.S. countries, particularly those in the European Union, the pricing of drugs
and biologics is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after obtaining regulatory approval of a drug
candidate. In addition, market acceptance and sales of our drug candidates will depend significantly on the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors for our drug
candidates and may be affected by existing and future health care reform measures. </FONT></P>

Recently enacted and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain regulatory
approval of and commercialize our drug candidates and affect the prices we may obtain.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the United States, PRC, European Union and some other jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and
proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our drug candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to
profitably sell any drug candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the United States, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. The
legislation expanded Medicare coverage for drug purchases by the elderly and introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for physician-administered drugs. In addition,
this legislation provided authority for limiting the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class. Cost reduction initiatives and other provisions of this legislation could decrease
the coverage and price that we receive for any approved products. While the MMA only applies to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and
payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates. Therefore, any reduction in reimbursement that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More
recently, in March 2010, then President Obama signed into law the ACA, a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare
spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose
additional health policy reforms. </FONT></P>

</UL>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to
providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, starting in 2013. In January 2013, then President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare
payments to several providers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These laws may result in additional
reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
expect that the ACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure
on the price that we receive for any approved drug. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The
implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our drugs. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legislative
and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. We cannot be sure
whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the regulatory approvals of our
drug candidates, if any, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of the FDA's approval process may significantly delay or prevent regulatory approval, as well as subject us to
more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
a result of the 2016 election in the United States, the fate of the ACA and other healthcare laws is uncertain. The United States House of Representatives is considering approval of
legislation to repeal parts of the ACA, but it is uncertain whether Congress will replace the law and what any replacement law would provide. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally,
we are subject to state and non-U.S. equivalents of each of the healthcare laws described above, among others, some of which may be broader in scope and may apply
regardless of the payor. Many U.S. states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any
source, not just governmental payors, including private insurers. In addition, some states have passed laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the April 2003 Office of Inspector
General Compliance Program Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and/or the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America's Code on Interactions with Healthcare Professionals. Several
states also impose other marketing restrictions or require pharmaceutical companies to make marketing or price disclosures to the state. There are ambiguities as to what is required to comply with
these state requirements and if we fail to comply with an applicable state law requirement we could be subject to penalties. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because
of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to
challenge under one or more of such laws. In addition, recent health care reform legislation has strengthened these laws. For example, the ACA, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the
federal Anti-Kickback and criminal healthcare fraud statutes. As a result of such amendment, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate
them in order to have committed a violation. Moreover, the ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback
Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Violations
of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including penalties, fines and/or exclusion or suspension from federal and state healthcare
programs such as Medicare and Medicaid and debarment from contracting with the U.S. government. In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring actions on behalf of the U.S. government
under the federal False Claims Act as well as under the false claims laws of several states. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither
the U.S. government nor the U.S. courts have provided definitive guidance on the application of fraud and abuse laws to our business. Law enforcement authorities are increasingly
focused on enforcing these laws, and it is possible that some of our practices may be challenged under these laws. Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with
applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future
statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending
ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, disgorgement,
monetary fines, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and
curtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. In addition, the approval and commercialization of any of our drug
candidates outside the United States will also likely subject us to non-U.S. equivalents of the healthcare laws mentioned above, among other non-U.S. laws. </FONT></P>

A significant portion of our intellectual property portfolio currently comprises pending patent applications
that have not yet been issued as granted patents and if our pending patent applications fail to issue our business will be adversely affected. If we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection
for our technology and drugs, our competitors could develop and commercialize technology and drugs similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and drugs
may be adversely affected.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States, the PRC and other countries with
respect to our proprietary technology and drug candidates. As of March&nbsp;21, 2017, we own eight issued U.S. patents and eight pending U.S. patent applications as well as corresponding patents and
patent applications internationally. In addition, we own 13 pending international patent applications under the PCT, which we plan to file nationally in the United States and other jurisdictions. With
respect to any issued patents in the United States and Europe, we may be entitled to obtain a patent term extension to extend the patent expiration date provided we meet the applicable requirements
for obtaining such patent term extensions. We have sought to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the United States, the PRC and other countries related to novel
technologies and drug candidates that we consider are important to our business. This process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable
patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to
obtain patent protection. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of
much litigation. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. Our pending and future patent applications may not result in
patents being issued which protect our technology or drug candidates or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and drug candidates. Changes in either the patent
laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection. Publications of discoveries in
the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18&nbsp;months after filing,
or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our patents or pending patent applications, or that we were the first to file for
patent protection of such inventions. Assuming the other requirements for patentability are met, the first to file&nbsp;a patent application is entitled to the patent. Under the Leahy-Smith America
Invents Act enacted in 2011, the United States moved to this first-to-file system in early 2013 from the previous system under which the first to make the claimed invention was entitled to the patent.

derivation, opposition or similar other proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such proceeding could reduce the scope of, or

candidates without infringing third-party patent rights. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There
can be no assurance that our pending patent applications will result in issued patents in the United States or non-U.S. jurisdictions in which such applications are pending. Even
if patents do issue on any of these applications, there can be no assurance that a third party will not challenge their validity or that we will obtain sufficient claim scope in those patents to
prevent a third party from competing successfully with our drug candidates. Even if our patent applications issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful
protection, prevent competitors from competing with us or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Our competitors may be able to circumvent our patents by developing similar or

from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and drug candidates, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and drug candidates. Given the amount of time
required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new drug candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a

We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filing, prosecuting, maintaining and defending patents on drug candidates in all countries throughout the world could be prohibitively expensive
for us, and our intellectual property rights in some non-U.S. countries can have a different scope and strength than do those in the United States. In addition, the laws of certain non-U.S. countries
do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as U.S. federal and state laws do. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all
countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing drugs made using our inventions in and into the United States or non-U.S. jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in
jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own drugs and further, may export otherwise infringing drugs to non-U.S. jurisdictions where we have patent protection, but
where enforcement rights are not as strong as those in the United States. These drugs may compete with our drug candidates and our patent rights or other intellectual property rights may not be
effective or adequate to prevent them from competing. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
currently hold issued trademark registrations and have trademark applications pending, any of which may be the subject of a governmental or third-party objection, which could prevent
the maintenance or issuance of the same. If we are unsuccessful in obtaining trademark protection for our primary brands, we may be required to change our brand name, which could materially adversely
affect our business. Moreover, as our products mature, our reliance on our trademarks to differentiate us from our competitors will increase, and as a result, if we are unable to prevent third parties
from adopting, registering or using trademarks and trade dress that infringe, dilute or otherwise violate our trademark rights, our business could be materially adversely affected. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many
companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain jurisdictions, including China. The legal systems of some
countries do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property, particularly those relating to biopharmaceutical products, which could make it difficult in those
jurisdictions for us to stop the infringement or misappropriation of our patents or other intellectual property rights, or the marketing of competing drugs in violation of our proprietary rights. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proceedings
to enforce our patent and other intellectual property rights in non-U.S. jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other
aspects of our business. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore,
such proceedings could put our patents at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable, or interpreted narrowly, could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing,
and could provoke third parties to assert claims of infringement or misappropriation against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any,
may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the
intellectual property that we develop. </FONT></P>

We may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our intellectual property, which could be expensive,
time consuming and unsuccessful. Our patent rights relating to our drug candidates could be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged in court or before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or
comparable non-U.S. authority.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Competitors may infringe our patent rights or misappropriate or otherwise violate our intellectual property rights. To counter infringement or
unauthorized use, litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of our own
intellectual property rights or the proprietary rights of others. This can be expensive and time consuming. Any claims that we assert against perceived infringers could also provoke these parties to
assert counterclaims against us alleging that we infringe their intellectual property rights. Many of our current and potential competitors have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources
to enforce and/or defend their intellectual property rights than we can. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our
intellectual property. Litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources, which could harm our business and financial results. In addition, in an infringement
proceeding, a court may decide that patent rights or other intellectual property rights owned by us are invalid or unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at
issue on the grounds that our patent rights or other intellectual property rights do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation proceeding could put our patent, as well
as any patents that may issue in the future from our pending patent applications, at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable or interpreted narrowly. Furthermore, because of the substantial
amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of
litigation. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
we initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce our patent, or any patents that may issue in the future from our patent applications, that relates to one of our drug
candidates, the defendant could counterclaim that such patent rights are invalid or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity or
unenforceability are commonplace, and there are numerous grounds upon which a third party can assert invalidity or unenforceability of a patent. Third parties may also raise similar claims before
administrative bodies in the United States or abroad, even outside the context of litigation. Such mechanisms include </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>ex parte</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> re-examination, </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>inter partes</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>
review, post-grant review, derivation and equivalent proceedings in non-U.S. jurisdictions, such as opposition proceedings. Such
proceedings could result in revocation or amendment to our patents in such a way that they no longer cover and protect our drug candidates. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and
unenforceability is unpredictable. With respect to the validity of our patents, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art of which we, our patent counsel, and the
patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity and/or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent
protection on our drug candidates. Such a loss of patent protection could have a material adverse impact on our business. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our trade secrets or confidential information, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the
United States. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could
be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. </FONT></P>

Litigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging inventorship. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose rights such

If we are sued for infringing intellectual property rights of third parties, such litigation could be costly
and time consuming and could prevent or delay us from developing or commercializing our drug candidates.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our commercial success depends in part on our avoiding infringement of the patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties.
There is a substantial amount of litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>inter
partes</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> review, post grant review, interference and </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>ex parte</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> reexamination proceedings before the USPTO or oppositions and other
comparable proceedings in non-U.S. jurisdictions. Numerous issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we are developing drug
candidates. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our drug candidates may give rise to claims of infringement of the patent
rights of others. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third
parties may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. There may be third-party patents of which we are currently unaware with claims to
materials, formulations, methods of manufacture or methods for treatment related to the use or manufacture of our drug candidates. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may
be currently pending patent applications which may later result in issued patents that our drug candidates may infringe. In addition, third parties may obtain patents in the future and claim that use
of our technologies infringes upon these patents. If any third-party patents were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover the manufacturing process of any of our drug candidates, any
molecules formed during the manufacturing process or any final product itself, the holders of any such patents may be able to prevent us from commercializing such drug candidate unless we obtain a
license under the applicable patents, or until such patents expire or they are finally determined to be held invalid or unenforceable. Similarly, if any third-party patent were held by a court of
competent jurisdiction to cover aspects of our formulations, processes for manufacture or methods of use, including combination therapy or patient selection methods, the holders of any such patent may
be able to block our ability to develop and commercialize the applicable drug candidate unless we obtain a license, limit our uses, or until such patent expires or is finally determined to be held
invalid or unenforceable. In either case, such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third
parties who bring successful claims against us for infringement of their intellectual property rights may obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could prevent us from
developing and commercializing one or more of our drug candidates. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion
of employee resources from our business. In the event of a successful claim of infringement or misappropriation against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and
attorneys' fees in the case of willful infringement, obtain one or more licenses from third parties, pay royalties or redesign our infringing drug candidates, which may be impossible or require
substantial time and monetary expenditure. In the event of an adverse result in any such litigation, or even in the absence of litigation, we may need to obtain licenses from third parties to advance
our research or allow commercialization of our drug candidates. We cannot predict whether any required license would be available at all or whether it would be available on commercially reasonable
terms, and we may fail to obtain any of these licenses </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically,
we are aware of three U.S. patents owned by Ono Pharmaceutical&nbsp;Co., or Ono, and licensed to Bristol-Myers Squibb&nbsp;Co., or BMS, that are relevant to our
BGB-A317 drug candidate. These patents are expected to expire in 2023, 2023 and 2024, respectively. In patent infringement actions filed in Delaware Federal District court, BMS and Ono alleged that
Merck&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Co.'s KEYTRUDA product, a humanized anti-PD-1 antibody is infringing these U.S. patents. Although Merck challenged the validity of these patents, Merck recently settled this
litigation with BMS and Ono resulting in Merck taking a license from BMS and Ono. All these three patents remain presumed valid and enforceable. Merck also filed an opposition proceeding challenging a
corresponding European patent at the European Patent Office, or EPO. The EPO's Opposition Division disagreed with Merck's arguments and maintained the European patent in the form in which it was
granted. Merck appealed the decision, but recently withdrew its appeal. If the validity of the relevant claims in these U.S. patents is upheld and our BGB-A317 drug candidate is approved for sale in
the United States before the expiration of these patents, then we will need a license from BMS in order to commercialize our BGB-A317 drug candidate in the United States prior to their expiration. In
addition, depending upon circumstances, we may need a license for jurisdictions outside the United States where we wish to commercialize BGB-A317 before the expiration of a corresponding patent
covering BGB-A317. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such a license, which could materially and adversely affect our business. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition, we are aware of a U.S. patent owned by Pharmacyclics,&nbsp;Inc., which was acquired by AbbVie,&nbsp;Inc., with certain claims directed to a complex of an irreversible
BTK inhibitor having a covalent bond to a cysteine residue of a BTK. This patent is expected to expire in 2027. Although we believe that the claims of the patent relevant to our BGB-3111 drug
candidate would likely be held invalid, we cannot provide any assurances that a court or an administrative agency would agree with our assessment. If the validity of the relevant claims in question is
upheld upon a validity challenge, and BGB-3111 is approved for sale in the United States before the expiration of the U.S. patent, then we would need a license in order to commercialize BGB-3111 in
the United States. In addition, depending upon circumstances, we may need a license for jurisdictions outside the United States where we wish to commercialize BGB-3111 before the expiration of a
corresponding patent covering BGB-3111. However such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, which could materially and adversely affect our business. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
are also aware of three U.S. patents, owned or licensed by KuDOS Pharmaceuticals,&nbsp;Ltd., which was acquired by AstraZeneca&nbsp;PLC, with claims directed to using PARP
inhibitors to treat cancers with certain defects in homologous recombination including, in some cases, a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation.
These patents are expected to expire between 2027 and 2031 in the United States. Although we believe that the claims of these patents relevant to our BGB-290 drug candidate would likely be held
invalid, we cannot provide any assurances that a court or an administrative agency would agree with our assessment. While we are currently conducting and plan to conduct studies that include cancer
patients with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation, we are uncertain whether BGB-290 as commercialized will be used to treat cancer patients limited to having BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation either in a monotherapy or a
combination therapy. If BGB-290 is approved for sale in the United States for patients whose cancers have a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation, and if the validity of the relevant claims of these U.S. patents is
upheld upon a validity challenge, then we would need a license in order to commercialize BGB-290 prior to expiration of these U.S. patents. In addition, we are also aware of corresponding issued

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Periodic maintenance fees on any issued patent are due to be paid to the USPTO and other patent agencies in several stages over the lifetime of
the patent. The USPTO and various non-U.S. governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment, and other similar provisions during the patent
application process. Although an
inadvertent lapse can in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment
or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Noncompliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a
patent or patent application include failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees, and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. In any
such event, our competitors might be able to enter the market, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In most countries in which we file, including the United States, the term of an issued patent is generally 20&nbsp;years from the earliest
claimed filing date of a non-provisional patent application in the applicable country. Although various extensions may be available, the life of a patent and the protection it affords, is limited.
Even if patents covering our drug candidates are obtained, we may be open to competition from other companies as well as generic medications once the patent life has expired for a drug. If patents are
issued on our currently pending patent applications, the resulting patents will be expected to expire on dates ranging from 2031 to 2035, excluding any potential patent term extension or adjustment.
Upon the expiration of our issued patent or patents that may issue from our pending patent applications, we will not be able to assert such patent rights against potential competitors and our business

patent protection afforded could be less than we request. If we are unable to obtain a patent term extension for a given patent or the term of any such extension is less than we request, the period

Changes in patent law could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to
protect our drug candidates.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As is the case with other biopharmaceutical companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly patent rights.
Obtaining and enforcing patents in the biopharmaceutical industry involves both technological and legal complexity, and is therefore costly, time-consuming, and inherently uncertain. In addition, the
United States has recently enacted and is currently implementing wide-ranging patent reform legislation. Recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings have narrowed the scope of patent protection available in
certain circumstances and weakened the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination
of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents once obtained, if any. Depending on decisions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts and the USPTO, the laws and regulations
governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future. For example,
in a recent case, </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Assoc. for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics,&nbsp;Inc.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, the U.S. Supreme Court held that certain claims to naturally-occurring
substances are not patentable. Although we do not believe that our currently-issued patent and any patents that may issue from our pending patent applications directed to our drug candidates if issued
in their currently pending forms, as well as patent rights licensed by us, will be found invalid based on this decision, we cannot predict how future decisions by the courts, the U.S. Congress or the
USPTO may impact the value of our patent rights. There could be similar changes in the laws of foreign jurisdictions that may impact the value of our patent rights or our other intellectual property
rights. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore,
many of our employees, including our senior management, were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential

employment. Although we try to ensure that our employees do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or these employees have
used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such employee's former employer. We are not aware of any threatened or pending claims related
to these matters or concerning the agreements with our senior management, but in the future litigation may be necessary to defend against such claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in

costs and be a distraction to management. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In

our business may depend in part on our ability to acquire and maintain licenses or other rights to use these proprietary rights. We may be unable to acquire or in-license any compositions, methods of
use, or other third-party intellectual property rights from third parties that we identify. The licensing and acquisition of third-party intellectual property rights is a competitive area, and a
number of more established companies are also pursuing strategies to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights that we may consider attractive. These established companies may have a

that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal and regulatory requirements and scientific standards, and our reliance on the CROs does not relieve us of our
regulatory responsibilities. We and our CROs and our clinical investigators are required to comply with GCPs, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA, CFDA, EMA and other comparable
regulatory authorities for all of our drugs in clinical development. Regulatory authorities enforce these GCPs through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites.
If we or any of our CROs or clinical investigators fail to comply with applicable GCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA, CFDA, EMA or comparable
regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot assure you that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such
regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical trials comply with GCP regulations. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with product produced under cGMP regulations. Our

regulatory approval of our drug candidates. If our contract manufacturers do not pass their inspections by the FDA, CFDA, EMA or other comparable regulatory authorities, our commercial supply of drug
product or substance will be significantly delayed and may result in significant additional costs, including the delay or denial of any marketing application for our drug candidates. In addition, drug
and biological manufacturing facilities are continuously subject to inspection by the FDA, CFDA, EMA and other comparable regulatory authorities, before and after drug approval, and must comply with
cGMPs. Our contract manufacturers may encounter difficulties in achieving quality control and quality assurance and may experience shortages in qualified personnel. In addition, contract
manufacturers' failure to achieve and maintain high manufacturing standards in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements, or the incidence of manufacturing errors, could result in patient
injury, product liability claims, product shortages, product recalls or withdrawals, delays or failures in product testing or delivery, cost overruns or other problems that could seriously harm our
business. If a third-party manufacturer with whom we contract is unable to comply with manufacturing regulations, we may also be subject to fines, unanticipated compliance expenses, recall or seizure
of our drugs, product liability claims, total or partial suspension of production and/or enforcement actions, including injunctions, and criminal or civil prosecution. These possible sanctions could
materially adversely affect our financial results and financial condition. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore,
changes in the manufacturing process or procedure, including a change in the location where the product is manufactured or a change of a third-party manufacturer, could
require prior review by the FDA, CFDA, EMA or other comparable regulatory authorities and/or approval of the manufacturing process and procedures in accordance with the FDA, CFDA or EMA's regulations,
or comparable requirements. This review may be costly and time consuming and could delay or prevent the launch of a product. The new facility will also be subject to pre-approval inspection. In
addition, we have to demonstrate that the product made at the new facility is equivalent to the product made at the former facility by physical and chemical methods, which are costly and time
consuming. It is also possible that the FDA, CFDA, EMA or other comparable regulatory authorities may require clinical testing as a way to prove equivalency, which would result in additional costs and
delay. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are highly dependent on Xiaodong Wang, Ph.D., our Founder, Chairman of our scientific advisory board and director; John V. Oyler, our
Founder, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the board; and the other principal members of our management and scientific teams and scientific advisory board. Although we have formal employment
agreements with each of our executive officers except for our Chief Executive Officer, these agreements do not prevent our executives from terminating their employment with us at any time. We do not
maintain "key person" insurance for any of our executives or other employees. The loss of the services of any of these persons could impede the achievement of our research, development and
commercialization objectives. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
induce valuable employees to remain at our company, in addition to salary and cash incentives, we have provided share option grants that vest over time. The value to employees of
these equity grants that vest over time may be significantly affected by movements in the ADS price that are beyond our control, and may at any time be insufficient to counteract more lucrative offers
from other companies. Although we have employment agreements with our key employees, any of our employees could leave our employment at any time, with or without notice. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recruiting

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore,
replacing executive officers and key employees or consultants may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in our
industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to successfully develop, gain regulatory approval of and commercialize products. Competition to hire from this limited pool is intense, and
we may be unable to hire, train, retain or motivate these key personnel or consultants on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for similar
personnel. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
also experience competition for the hiring of scientific and clinical personnel from universities and research institutions. Our consultants and advisors may be employed by employers
other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain high
quality personnel, our ability to pursue our growth strategy will be limited. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of governmental agencies or industry regulatory bodies in the United States, and in non-U.S. jurisdictions including the PRC and
European Union, impose strict rules, regulations and industry standards governing pharmaceutical and biotechnology research and development activities, which apply to us. Our failure to comply with
such regulations could result in the termination of ongoing research, administrative penalties imposed by regulatory bodies or the disqualification of data for submission to regulatory authorities.
This could harm our reputation, prospects for future work and operating results. For example, if we were to treat research animals inhumanely or in violation of international standards set out by the
Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care, it could revoke any such accreditation and the accuracy of our animal research data could be questioned. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We and third parties, such as our CRO, are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing
laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Our operations involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals
and radioactive and biological materials. Our operations also produce hazardous waste products. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes. We also store
certain low level radioactive waste at our facilities until the materials can be properly disposed of. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of
contamination or injury resulting from our use of hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant
costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties. </FONT></P>

The recovery from the lows of 2008 and 2009 was uneven and it is facing new challenges, including the escalation of the European sovereign debt crisis since 2011 and the United Kingdom's decision to
withdraw from the European Union. It is unclear whether the European sovereign debt crisis will be contained and what effects it and the United Kingdom's decision to withdraw from the European Union
may have. There is considerable uncertainty over the long-term effects of the expansionary monetary and fiscal policies that have been adopted by the central banks and financial authorities of some of
the world's leading economies, including China's. Economic conditions in United States and China are sensitive to global economic conditions. Although we are uncertain about the extent to which the

Recent developments relating to the United Kingdom's referendum vote in favor of withdrawal from the European
Union could adversely affect us.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United Kingdom held a referendum on June&nbsp;23, 2016 in which a majority voted for the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European
Union (referred to as "Brexit"). As a result of this vote, negotiations are expected to commence to determine the terms of the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union as well as its
relationship with the European Union going forward, including the terms of trade between the United Kingdom and the European Union. The effects of Brexit have been and are expected to continue to be
far-reaching. Brexit and the perceptions as to its impact may adversely affect business activity and economic conditions in Europe and globally and could continue to contribute to instability in
global financial and foreign exchange markets. Brexit could also have the effect of disrupting the free movement of goods, services and people between the United Kingdom and the European Union;
however, the full effects of Brexit are uncertain and will depend on any agreements the United Kingdom may make to retain access to European Union markets. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition, we expect that Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the United Kingdom determines which European Union laws to
replicate or replace. If the United Kingdom were to significantly alter its regulations affecting the pharmaceutical industry, we could face significant new costs. It may also be time-consuming and
expensive for us to alter our internal operations in order to comply with new regulations. Altered regulations could also add time and expense to the process by which our product candidates receive
regulatory approval in the United Kingdom and European Union. Similarly, it is unclear at this time what Brexit's impact will have on our intellectual property rights and the process for obtaining,
maintaining and defending such rights. It is possible that certain intellectual property rights, such as trademarks, granted by the European Union will cease being enforceable in the United Kingdom
absent special arrangements to the contrary, and we are required to refile our trademarks and other intellectual property applications domestically in the United Kingdom. With regard to existing
patent rights, the effect of Brexit should </FONT></P>

manufacturing facility in Suzhou, China, where we intend to produce drug candidates for clinical or, in the future, commercial use. This facility consists of one oral-solid-dosage production line for
small molecule drug products and one pilot plant for monoclonal antibody drug substances. This new manufacturing facility is expected to be completed in 2017. This project may encounter unanticipated
delays and cost more than expected due to a number of factors, including regulatory requirements. If construction or regulatory approval of our new facility is delayed, we may not be able to

Changes in the political and economic policies of the PRC government may materially and adversely affect our

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A significant portion of our operations are in the PRC. Accordingly, our financial condition and results of operations are affected to a large
extent by economic, political and legal developments in the PRC. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
PRC economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including the extent of government involvement, level of development, growth rate, control of
foreign exchange and allocation of resources. Although the PRC government has implemented measures emphasizing the utilization of market forces for economic reform, the reduction of state ownership of
productive assets, and the establishment of improved corporate governance in business enterprises, a substantial portion of productive assets in China is still owned by the government. In addition,
the PRC government continues to play a significant role in regulating industry development by imposing industrial policies. The PRC government also exercises significant control over China's economic
growth by allocating resources, controlling payment of foreign currency-denominated obligations, setting monetary policy, regulating financial services and institutions and providing preferential
treatment to particular industries or companies. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While
the PRC economy has experienced significant growth in the past three decades, growth has been uneven, both geographically and among various sectors of the economy. The PRC
government has implemented various measures to encourage economic growth and guide the allocation of resources. Some of these measures may benefit the overall PRC economy, but may also have a negative
effect on us. Our financial condition and results of operation could be materially and adversely affected by government control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations that are
applicable to us and consequently have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition and results of operations. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
1979, the PRC government began to promulgate a comprehensive system of laws, rules and regulations governing economic matters in general. The overall effect of legislation over the
past three decades has significantly enhanced the protections afforded to various forms of foreign investment in China. However, China has not developed a fully integrated legal system, and recently
enacted laws, rules and regulations may not sufficiently cover all aspects of economic activities in China or may be subject to significant degrees of interpretation by PRC regulatory agencies. In
particular, because these laws, rules and regulations are relatively new, and because of the limited number of published decisions and the nonbinding nature of such decisions, and because the laws,
rules and regulations often give the relevant regulator significant discretion in how to enforce them, the interpretation and enforcement of these laws, rules and regulations involve uncertainties and
can be inconsistent and unpredictable. In addition, the PRC legal system is based in part on government policies and internal rules, some of which are not published on a timely basis or at all, and
which may have a retroactive effect. As a result, we may not be aware of our violation of these policies and rules until after the occurrence of the violation. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any
administrative and court proceedings in China may be protracted, resulting in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. Since PRC administrative and
court authorities have significant discretion in interpreting and implementing statutory and contractual terms, it may be more difficult to evaluate the outcome of administrative and court proceedings
and the level of legal protection we enjoy than in more developed legal systems. These uncertainties may impede our ability to enforce the contracts we have entered into and could materially and

Substantial uncertainties exist with respect to the enactment timetable, the final version, interpretation
and implementation of draft PRC Foreign Investment Law and how it may impact the viability of our current corporate governance.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Commerce published a discussion draft of the proposed Foreign Investment Law in January 2015 aiming to, upon its enactment,
replace the trio of existing laws regulating foreign investment in China, namely, the Sino-foreign Equity Joint Venture Enterprise Law, the Sino-foreign Cooperative Joint Venture Enterprise Law and
the Wholly Foreign-invested Enterprise Law, together with their implementation rules and ancillary regulations. The draft Foreign Investment Law embodies an expected PRC regulatory trend to
rationalize its foreign investment regulatory regime in line with prevailing international practice and the legislative efforts to unify the corporate legal requirements for both foreign and domestic
investments. The Ministry of Commerce has solicited comments on this draft and substantial uncertainties exist with respect to its enactment timetable, the final version, interpretation and
implementation. The draft Foreign Investment Law, if enacted as
proposed, may materially impact the viability of our current corporate governance if we, in the future, have PRC shareholders. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among
other things, the draft Foreign Investment Law expands the definition of foreign investment and introduces the principle of "actual control" in determining whether a company is
considered a foreign-invested enterprise, or an FIE. The draft Foreign Investment Law specifically provides that entities established in China but "controlled" by foreign investors will be treated as
FIEs, whereas an entity set up in a foreign jurisdiction would nonetheless be, upon market entry clearance by the Ministry of Commerce or its local counterparts, treated as a PRC domestic investor
provided that the entity is "controlled" by PRC entities and/or citizens. In this connection, "control" is broadly defined in the draft law to cover the following summarized categories:
(1)&nbsp;holding 50% of more of the shares, equity or voting rights of the subject entity; (2)&nbsp;holding less than 50% of the voting rights of the subject entity but having the power to secure
at least 50% of the seats on the board or other equivalent decision making bodies, or having the voting power to exert material influence on the board, the shareholders' meeting or other equivalent
decision making bodies; or (3)&nbsp;having the power to exert </FONT></P>

FIE, it will be subject to the foreign investment restrictions or prohibitions, if the FIE is engaged in the industry listed in the "negative list" which will be separately issued by the Chinese State
Council later. Unless the underlying business of the FIE falls within the negative list, which calls for market entry clearance by the Ministry of Commerce or its local counterparts, prior approval
from the government authorities as mandated by the existing foreign investment legal regime would no longer be required for establishment of the FIE. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
draft Foreign Investment Law, if enacted as proposed, may also materially impact our corporate governance practice and increase our compliance costs. For instance, the draft Foreign
Investment Law imposes stringent ad hoc and periodic information reporting requirements on foreign investors and the applicable FIEs. Aside from investment implementation report and investment
amendment report that are required at each investment and alteration of investment specifics, an annual report is mandatory, and large foreign investors meeting certain criteria are required to report
on a quarterly basis. Any company found to be non-compliant with these information reporting obligations may potentially be subject to fines and/or administrative or criminal liabilities, and the
persons directly responsible may be subject to criminal liabilities. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SAFE promulgated the Circular on Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Control on Domestic Residents' Offshore Investment and Financing
and Roundtrip Investment through Special Purpose Vehicles, or SAFE Circular 37, on July&nbsp;4, 2014, which replaced the former circular commonly known as "SAFE Circular 75" promulgated by SAFE on
October&nbsp;21, 2005. SAFE Circular 37 requires PRC residents to register with local branches of SAFE in connection with their direct establishment or indirect control of an offshore entity, for
the purpose of overseas investment and financing, with such PRC residents' legally owned assets or equity interests in domestic enterprises or offshore assets or interests, referred to in SAFE
Circular 37 as a "special purpose vehicle." SAFE Circular 37 further requires amendment to the registration in the event of any significant changes with respect to the special purpose vehicle, such as
increase or decrease of capital contributed by PRC individuals, share transfer or exchange, merger, division or other material event. In the event that a PRC shareholder holding interests in a special
purpose vehicle fails to fulfill the required SAFE registration, the PRC subsidiaries of that special purpose vehicle may be prohibited from making profit distributions to the offshore parent and from
carrying out subsequent cross-border foreign exchange activities, and the special purpose vehicle may be restricted in its ability to contribute additional capital into its PRC subsidiary. Moreover,
failure to comply with the various SAFE registration requirements described above could result in liability under PRC law for evasion of foreign exchange controls. </FONT></P>

We may be treated as a resident enterprise for PRC tax purposes under the EIT Law and be subject to PRC tax
on our worldwide taxable income at a rate of 25%.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the EIT Law an enterprise established outside China with "de facto management bodies" within China is considered a "resident enterprise,"
meaning that it is treated in a manner similar to a Chinese enterprise for PRC enterprise income tax, or EIT, purposes. The implementing rules of the EIT Law define "de facto management bodies" as
"management bodies that exercise substantial and overall management and control over the production and operations, personnel, accounting, and properties" of the enterprise. In addition, the Notice
Regarding the Determination of Chinese-Controlled Offshore Incorporated Enterprises as PRC Tax Resident Enterprises on the Basis of De Facto Management Bodies, or Circular 82, specifies that certain
Chinese-controlled offshore incorporated enterprises, defined as enterprises incorporated under the laws of foreign countries or territories and that have PRC enterprises or enterprise groups as their
primary controlling shareholders, will be classified as resident enterprises if all of the following are located or resident in China:&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;senior management personnel and departments
that are responsible for
daily production, operation and management; (ii)&nbsp;financial and personnel decision-making bodies; (iii)&nbsp;key properties, accounting books, company seal, and minutes of board meetings and
shareholders' meetings; and (iv)&nbsp;half or more of senior management or directors having voting rights. On July&nbsp;27, 2011, the SAT issued Administrative Measures of Enterprise Income Tax of
Chinese-Controlled Offshore Incorporated Resident Enterprises (Trial), or Bulletin 45, which became effective on September&nbsp;1, 2011 and was most recently amended on October&nbsp;1, 2016, to
provide further guidance on the implementation of Circular&nbsp;82. Bulletin 45 clarifies certain issues related to determining PRC resident enterprise status, including which competent tax
authorities are responsible for determining offshore incorporated PRC resident enterprise status, as well as post-determination administration. In 2014, the SAT, released the Announcement of the SAT
on Issues Concerning the Recognition of Chinese-Controlled Enterprises Incorporated Overseas as Resident Enterprises on the Basis of Their Actual Management Bodies and supplemented some provisions on
the administrative procedures for the recognition of resident enterprise, while the standards used to classify resident enterprises in Circular 82 remain unchanged. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although
BeiGene,&nbsp;Ltd. does not have a PRC enterprise or enterprise group as our primary controlling shareholder and is therefore not a Chinese-controlled offshore incorporated
enterprise within the meaning of Circular 82, in the absence of guidance specifically applicable to us, we have applied the guidance set forth in Circular 82 to evaluate the tax residence status of
BeiGene,&nbsp;Ltd. and its subsidiaries organized outside the PRC. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
are not aware of any offshore holding company with a corporate structure similar to ours that has been deemed a PRC "resident enterprise" by the PRC tax authorities. Accordingly, we
do not believe our company or any of our overseas subsidiaries should be treated as a PRC resident enterprise. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
the PRC tax authorities determine that our Cayman Islands holding company is a resident enterprise for PRC EIT purposes, a number of unfavorable PRC tax consequences could follow and
we may be subject to EIT at a rate of 25% on our worldwide taxable income, as well as to PRC EIT reporting obligations. In that case, it is possible that dividends paid to us by our PRC subsidiaries
will not be subject to PRC withholding tax. </FONT></P>

Dividends payable to our foreign investors may be subject to PRC withholding tax and gains on the sale of the
ADSs or ordinary shares by our foreign investors may be subject to PRC tax.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are deemed a PRC resident enterprise as described under "&#151;We may be treated as a resident enterprise for PRC tax purposes
under the EIT Law and be subject to PRC tax on our worldwide taxable income at a rate of 25%," dividends paid on our ordinary shares or ADSs, and any gain realized from the transfer of our ordinary
shares or ADSs, may be treated as income derived from sources within the PRC. As a result, dividends paid to non-PRC resident enterprise ADS holders or shareholders may be subject to PRC withholding
tax at a rate of 10% (or 20% in the case of non-PRC individual ADS holders or shareholders) and gains realized by non-PRC resident enterprises ADS holders or shareholders from the transfer of our
ordinary shares or ADSs may be subject to PRC tax at a rate of 10% (or 20% in the case of non-PRC individual ADS holders or shareholders). It is unclear whether if we or any of our subsidiaries
established outside China are considered a PRC resident enterprise, holders of the ADSs or ordinary shares would be able to claim the benefit of income tax treaties or agreements entered into between
China and other countries or areas. If dividends payable to our non-PRC investors, or gains from the transfer of the ADSs or ordinary shares by such investors are subject to PRC tax, the value of your
investment in the ADSs or ordinary shares may decline significantly. </FONT></P>

We and our shareholders face uncertainties with respect to indirect transfers of equity interests in PRC
resident enterprises or other assets attributed to a PRC establishment of a non-PRC company, or other assets attributable to a PRC establishment of a non-PRC company.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February&nbsp;3, 2015, the SAT issued the Bulletin on Issues of Enterprise Income Tax and Indirect Transfers of Assets by Non-PRC Resident
Enterprises, or Bulletin 7, which replaced or supplemented certain previous rules under the Notice on Strengthening Administration of Enterprise Income Tax for Share Transfers by Non-PRC Resident
Enterprises, or Circular 698, issued by the SAT, on December&nbsp;10, 2009. Pursuant to this Bulletin, an "indirect transfer" of "PRC taxable assets," including equity interests in a PRC resident
enterprise, by non-PRC resident enterprises may be recharacterized and treated as a direct transfer of PRC taxable assets, if such arrangement does not have a reasonable commercial purpose and was
established for the purpose of avoiding payment of PRC enterprise income tax. As a result, gains derived from such indirect transfer may be subject to PRC enterprise income tax. When determining
whether there is a "reasonable commercial purpose" of the transaction arrangement, factors to be taken into consideration include: whether the main value of the equity interest of the relevant
offshore enterprise derives from PRC taxable assets; whether the assets of the relevant offshore enterprise mainly consists of direct or indirect investment in China or if its income mainly derives
from China; whether the offshore enterprise and its subsidiaries directly or indirectly holding PRC taxable assets have real commercial nature which is evidenced by their actual function and risk
exposure; the duration of existence of the business model and organizational structure; the replicability of the transaction by direct transfer of PRC taxable assets; and the tax situation of such
indirect transfer and applicable tax treaties or similar arrangements. In respect of an indirect offshore transfer of assets of a PRC establishment, the resulting gain is to be reported on with the
enterprise income tax filing of the PRC establishment or place of business being transferred, and would consequently be subject to PRC enterprise income tax at a rate of 25%. Where the underlying
transfer relates to equity investments in a PRC resident enterprise, which is not related to a PRC establishment or place of business of a non-resident enterprise, a PRC enterprise income tax at the
rate of 10% would apply, subject to available preferential tax treatment under applicable tax treaties or similar arrangements. Late payment of applicable tax will subject the transferor to default
interest. Gains derived from the sale of shares by investors through a public stock exchange are not subject to the PRC enterprise income tax pursuant to Bulletin 7 where such shares were acquired in
a transaction through a public stock exchange. As such, the sale of the ADSs or ordinary shares on a public stock exchange will not be subject to PRC enterprise income tax pursuant to Bulletin 7.

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There
are uncertainties as to the application of Bulletin 7. Bulletin 7 may be determined by the tax authorities to be applicable to sale of the shares of our offshore subsidiaries or
investments where PRC
taxable assets are involved. The transferors and transferees may be subject to the tax filing and withholding or tax payment obligation, while our PRC subsidiaries may be requested to assist in the
filing. Furthermore, we, our non-resident enterprises and PRC subsidiaries may be required to spend valuable resources to comply with Bulletin 7 or to establish that we and our non-resident
enterprises should not be taxed under Bulletin 7, for our previous and future restructuring or disposal of shares of our offshore subsidiaries, which may have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition and results of operations. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
PRC tax authorities have the discretion under Bulletin 7 to make adjustments to the taxable capital gains based on the difference between the fair value of the taxable assets
transferred and the cost of investment. If the PRC tax authorities make adjustments to the taxable income of the transactions under Circular 698/Bulletin 7, our income tax costs associated with such
potential acquisitions or disposals will increase, which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. </FONT></P>

Restrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability to utilize our revenue effectively.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PRC government imposes controls on the convertibility of RMB into foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance of currency out
of China. A portion of our revenue may in the future be denominated in RMB. Shortages in availability of foreign currency may then restrict the ability of our PRC subsidiaries to remit sufficient
foreign currency to our offshore entities for our offshore entities to pay dividends or make other payments or otherwise to satisfy our foreign currency denominated obligations. The RMB is currently
convertible under the "current account," which includes dividends, trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, but not under the "capital account," which includes foreign direct
investment and loans, including loans we may secure from our onshore subsidiaries. Currently, our PRC subsidiaries, which are wholly-foreign owned enterprises, may purchase foreign currency for
settlement of "current account transactions," including payment of dividends to us, without the approval of SAFE by complying with certain procedural requirements. However, the relevant PRC
governmental authorities may limit or eliminate our ability to purchase foreign currencies in the future for current account transactions. Since a portion of our future revenue may be denominated in
RMB, any existing and future restrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability to utilize revenue generated in RMB to fund our business activities outside of the PRC or pay dividends in foreign
currencies to our shareholders, including holders of the ADSs. Foreign exchange transactions under the capital account remain subject to limitations and require approvals from, or registration with,
SAFE and other relevant PRC governmental authorities. This could affect our ability to obtain foreign currency through debt or equity financing for our subsidiaries. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that litigation and negative publicity surrounding companies with operations in China that are listed in the United States have
negatively impacted stock prices for such companies. Various equity-based research organizations have published reports on China-based companies after examining, among other things, their corporate
governance practices, related party transactions, sales practices and financial statements that have led to special investigations and stock suspensions on national exchanges. Any similar scrutiny of

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inspections
of other auditors conducted by the PCAOB outside China have at times identified deficiencies in those auditors' audit procedures and quality control procedures, which may be

Proceedings instituted by the SEC against five PRC-based accounting firms, including our independent
registered public accounting firm, could result in our financial statements being determined to not be in compliance with the requirements of the Exchange Act.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December 2012, the SEC brought administrative proceedings against five accounting firms in China, including our independent registered public
accounting firm, alleging that they had refused to produce audit work papers and other documents related to certain other PRC-based companies under investigation by the SEC. On January&nbsp;22,
2014, an initial administrative law decision was issued, censuring these accounting firms and suspending four of these firms from practicing before the SEC for a period of six months. The decision is
neither final nor legally effective unless and until reviewed and approved by the SEC. On February&nbsp;12, 2014, four of these PRC-based accounting firms appealed to the SEC against this decision.
In February 2015, each of the four PRC-based accounting firms agreed to a censure and to pay a fine to the SEC to settle the dispute and avoid suspension of their ability to practice before the SEC.
These firms' ability to continue to serve all their respective clients is not affected by the settlement. The settlement requires these firms to follow detailed procedures to seek to provide the SEC
with access to Chinese firms' audit documents via the China Securities Regulatory Commission. If these firms do not follow these procedures, the SEC could impose penalties such as suspensions, or it
could restart the administrative proceedings. The settlement did not require these firms to admit to any violation of law and preserves these firms' legal defenses in the event the administrative
proceeding is restarted. In the event that the SEC restarts the administrative proceedings, depending upon the final outcome, listed companies in the United States with major PRC operations may find
it difficult or impossible to retain auditors in respect of their operations in the PRC, which could result in financial statements being determined to not be in compliance with the requirements of
the Exchange Act, including possible delisting. Moreover, any negative news about the proceedings against these audit firms may cause investor uncertainty regarding PRC-based, United States-listed
companies and the market price of the ADSs may be adversely affected. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We completed our initial public offering on February&nbsp;8, 2016, and there has been a public market for the ADSs for only a short period of

fluctuation of the market prices of other companies with business operations located mainly in China that have listed their securities in the United States may affect the volatility in the price of
and trading volumes for the ADSs. Some of these companies have experienced significant volatility, including significant price declines after their initial public offerings. The trading performances
of these PRC companies' securities at the time of or after their offerings may affect the overall investor sentiment towards other PRC companies listed in the United States and consequently may impact
the trading performance of the ADSs. </FONT></P>

of these factors may result in large and sudden changes in the volume and trading price of the ADSs. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company's
securities, shareholders have often instituted securities class action litigation against that company. If we were involved in a class action suit, it could divert the attention of management, and, if
adversely determined, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. </FONT></P>

disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of the ADSs, regardless of our actual operating performance.
Further, the current decline in the financial markets and related factors beyond our control may cause the ADSs price to decline rapidly and unexpectedly. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are currently an "emerging growth company," as defined in the JOBS Act. For so long as we remain an emerging growth company, we are permitted
and intend to rely on some of the exemptions from certain reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. These exemptions include but are
not limited to not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, not being required to comply with any requirement that
may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report providing additional information about the audit and the
financial statements, reduced
disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive
compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We

Because we do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future, you must rely on price appreciation of
the ADSs for return on your investment.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We intend to retain most, if not all, of our available funds and earnings to fund the development and growth of our business. As a result, we do
not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Therefore, you should not rely on an investment in the ADSs as a source for any future dividend income. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
board of directors has significant discretion as to whether to distribute dividends. Even if our board of directors decides to declare and pay dividends, the timing, amount and form
of future dividends, if any, will depend on, among other things, our future results of operations and cash flow, our capital requirements and surplus, the amount of distributions, if any, received by
us from our subsidiaries, our financial condition, contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. Accordingly, the return on your investment in the ADSs will
likely depend entirely upon any future price appreciation of the ADSs. There is no guarantee that the ADSs will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which you purchased the ADSs. You may
not realize a return on your investment in the ADSs and you may even lose your entire investment in the ADSs. </FONT></P>

We are a Cayman Islands company. Because judicial precedent regarding the rights of shareholders is more
limited under Cayman Islands law than under U.S. law, shareholders may have fewer shareholder rights than they would have under U.S. law.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our corporate affairs are governed by our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (as may be amended from time to time), the
Companies Law (as amended) of the Cayman Islands and the common law of the Cayman Islands. The rights of shareholders to take action against the directors, actions by minority shareholders and the
fiduciary responsibilities of our directors are to a large extent governed by the common law of the Cayman Islands. This common law is derived in part from comparatively limited judicial precedent in
the Cayman Islands as well as from English common law, which has persuasive, but not binding, authority on a court in the Cayman Islands. The rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary
responsibilities of our directors under Cayman Islands law are not as clearly established as they would be under statutes or judicial precedent in some jurisdictions in the United States. In
particular, the Cayman Islands has a less developed body of securities law than the United States. In addition, some states in the United States, such as Delaware, have more fully developed and
judicially interpreted bodies of corporate law than the Cayman Islands. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition, as a Cayman Islands exempted company, our shareholders have no general rights under Cayman Islands law to inspect corporate records and accounts or to obtain copies of lists
of shareholders of these companies with the exception that the shareholders may request a copy of the current amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. Our directors have discretion
under our amended and restated articles of association to determine whether or not, and under what conditions, our corporate records may be inspected by our shareholders, but are not obliged to make
them available to our shareholders. This may make it more difficult for you to obtain the information needed to establish any facts necessary for a shareholder motion or to solicit proxies from other
shareholders in connection with a proxy contest. As a Cayman Islands company, we may not have standing to initiate a derivative action in a federal court of the United States. As a result, you may be
limited in your ability to protect your interests if you are harmed in a manner that would otherwise enable you to sue in a United States federal court. In addition, shareholders of Cayman Islands
companies may not have standing to initiate a shareholder derivative action in U.S. federal courts. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As

shares in accordance with these instructions. Under our articles of association, the minimum notice period required for convening a general meeting is seven calendar days. When a general meeting is
convened, you may not receive sufficient notice of a shareholders' meeting to permit you to withdraw your ordinary shares to allow you to cast your vote with respect to any specific matter at the

cause the depositary to extend voting rights to you in a timely manner, but you may not receive the voting materials in time to ensure that you can instruct the depositary to vote your shares.
Furthermore, the depositary and its agents will not be responsible for any failure to carry out any instructions to vote, for the manner in which any vote is cast or for the effect of any such vote.

Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents may discourage our acquisition by a third party, which

transaction. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
example, our board of directors has the authority, without further action by our shareholders, to issue preferred shares in one or more series and to fix the powers and rights of
these shares, including dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption and liquidation preferences, any or all of which may be greater than the rights associated with our
ordinary shares. preferred shares could thus be issued quickly with terms calculated to delay or prevent a change in control or make removal of management more difficult. In addition, if our board of
directors authorizes the issuance of preferred shares, the market price of the ADSs may fall and the voting and other rights of the holders of our ordinary shares may be materially and adversely
affected. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore,

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that under certain circumstances the fees, costs, and expenses that we
incur in connection with actions or proceedings brought by any person or entity, which we refer to as claiming parties, may be shifted to such person or entity. If a claiming party asserts any claim;
initiates any proceeding; or joins, offers substantial assistance to, or has a direct financial interest in any claim or proceeding against us (including any proceeding purportedly filed on behalf of
us or any shareholder), and such claiming party (or the third party that received substantial assistance from a claiming party or in whose claim or proceeding such claiming party has a direct
financial interest) is unsuccessful in obtaining a judgment on the merits in which the claiming party prevails, then such claiming party may, to the fullest extent permissible by law, be obligated
jointly and severally to reimburse us for all fees, costs, and expenses, including but not limited to all reasonable attorneys' fees and other litigation expenses, that we may incur in connection with
such claim, suit, action, or proceeding. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fee-shifting
articles are relatively new and untested in both the Cayman Islands and the United States. The case law and potential legislative action on fee-shifting articles are
evolving and there exists considerable uncertainty regarding the validity of, and potential judicial and legislative responses to, such articles. For example, it is unclear whether our ability to
invoke our fee-shifting article in connection with claims under the federal securities laws, including claims related to any of our public offerings, would be preempted by federal law. Similarly, it
is unclear how courts might apply the standard that a claiming party must obtain a judgment that substantially achieves, in substance and amount, the full remedy sought. The application of our
fee-shifting article in connection with such claims, if any, will depend in part on future developments of the law. We cannot assure you that we will or will not invoke our fee-shifting article in any
particular dispute, including any claims related to our public offerings. Consistent with our directors' fiduciary duties to act in the best interests of the company, the directors may in their sole
discretion from time to time decide whether or not to enforce this article. In addition, given the unsettled state of the law related to fee-shifting articles, such as ours, we may incur significant
additional costs associated with resolving disputes with respect to such articles, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
a shareholder that brings any such claim, suit, action or proceeding is unable to obtain the judgment sought, the attorneys' fees and other litigation expenses that might be shifted
to a claiming party are potentially significant. This fee-shifting article, therefore, may dissuade or discourage current or former shareholders (and their attorneys) from initiating lawsuits or
claims against us. In addition, it may impact the fees, contingency or otherwise, required by potential plaintiffs' attorneys to represent our shareholders or otherwise discourage plaintiffs'
attorneys from representing our shareholders at all. As a result, this article may limit the ability of shareholders to affect the management and direction of our company, particularly through
litigation or the threat of litigation. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The depositary of the ADSs has agreed to pay you the cash dividends or other distributions it or the custodian for the ADSs receives on our
ordinary shares or other deposited securities after deducting its fees and expenses. You will receive these distributions in proportion to the number of our ordinary shares that your ADSs represent.
However, the depositary is not responsible for making such payments or distributions if it is unlawful or impractical to make a distribution available to any holders of ADSs. For example, it would be
unlawful to make a distribution to a holder of ADSs if it consists of securities that require registration under the Securities Act but that are not properly registered or distributed pursuant to an
applicable exemption from registration. The depositary is not responsible for making a distribution available to any holders of ADSs if any government approval or registration required for such
distribution cannot be obtained after reasonable efforts made by the depositary. We have no obligation to take any other action to permit the distribution of the ADSs, ordinary shares, rights or
anything else to holders of the ADSs. This means that you may not receive the distributions we make on our ordinary shares or any value for them if it is illegal or impractical for us to make them
available to you. These restrictions may materially reduce the value of your ADSs. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From time to time, we may distribute rights to our shareholders, including rights to acquire securities. Under the deposit agreement, the
depositary will not distribute rights to holders of ADSs unless the distribution and sale of rights and the securities to which these rights relate are either exempt from registration under the
Securities Act with respect to all holders of ADSs or are registered under the provisions of the Securities Act. The depositary may, but is not required to, attempt to sell these undistributed rights
to third parties and may allow the rights to lapse. We may be unable to establish an exemption from registration under the Securities Act, and we are under no obligation to file&nbsp;a registration
statement with respect to these rights or underlying securities or to try to have a registration statement declared effective. Accordingly, holders of ADSs may be unable to participate in our rights
offerings and may experience dilution of their holdings as a result. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our directors, executive officers and principal shareholders beneficially owned approximately 69.8% of our outstanding ordinary shares as of
March&nbsp;17, 2017. These shareholders, if acting together, could exert substantial influence over matters such as electing directors and approving material mergers, acquisitions or other business
combination transactions. This concentration of ownership may also discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company, which could have the dual effect of depriving our shareholders of an
opportunity to receive a premium for their shares as part of a sale of our company and reducing the price of the ADSs. These actions may be taken even if they are opposed by our other shareholders,
including the holders of the ADSs. In addition, these persons could divert business opportunities away from us to themselves or others. </FONT></P>

condition. We have incurred and will continue to incur costs associated with the preparation and filing of these reports. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform
and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of the NASDAQ Stock Market and other applicable securities rules and regulations impose various requirements on public companies, including
establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to
these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, we
expect that these rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, which in turn could make it more difficult for us to
attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
continue to evaluate these rules and regulations, and cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs. These rules and regulations
are often subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by
regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant
to Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Section&nbsp;404, we will first be required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over
financial reporting for the year ending December&nbsp;31, 2016. However, while we remain an emerging growth company, we will not be required to include an attestation report on internal control over
financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm. To achieve compliance with Section&nbsp;404 within the prescribed period, we will continue to be engaged in a process
to document and evaluate our internal control over financial reporting, which is both costly and challenging. In this regard, we will need to continue to dedicate internal resources, potentially
engage outside consultants and adopt a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, continue steps to improve control processes as appropriate,
validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting. Despite our efforts,
there is a risk that we will not be able to conclude, within the prescribed timeframe or at all, that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as required by Section&nbsp;404. If
we identify one or more material weaknesses, it could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements. </FONT></P>

or PFIC, for the current taxable year and in future taxable years. If we are a PFIC for any taxable year during a U.S. shareholder's holding period of the ADSs or ordinary shares, then such U.S.
shareholder generally will be required to treat any gain realized upon a disposition of the ADSs or ordinary shares, or any "excess distribution" received on the ADSs or ordinary shares, as ordinary
income earned over the U.S. shareholder's holding period for the ADSs or ordinary shares, and to pay the applicable taxes on such ordinary income along with an interest charge at the rate applicable
to underpayments of tax on a portion of the resulting tax liability, unless the shareholder makes a timely and effective "qualified electing fund" election, or QEF election, or "mark-to-market"

of your taxable year in which the PFIC becomes a QEF pursuant to the QEF election. The gain recognized on this deemed sale would be subject to the general tax treatment of PFICs discussed above. We
intend to determine our PFIC status at the end of each taxable year and to satisfy any applicable record keeping and reporting requirements that apply to a QEF, and will endeavor to provide to you,
for each taxable year that we determine we are or may be a PFIC, the information that is necessary for you to make a QEF election with respect to us (and any of our subsidiaries which are lower-tier
PFICs). We may elect to provide such information on our website. However, there can be no assurances that we will make the necessary information available to you. You are urged to consult your own tax
advisors regarding the availability of, and procedure for making, a QEF election. A U.S. shareholder who makes an effective mark-to-market election generally must include as ordinary income any gain
recognized in a year that we are a PFIC in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of the ADSs over the shareholder's adjusted tax basis therein. Each U.S. shareholder should consult
its own tax advisors regarding the PFIC rules and the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of the ADSs or ordinary shares. </FONT></P>

investment of earnings in U.S. property, even if the CFC has made no distributions to its shareholders. A non-U.S. corporation generally will be classified as a CFC for U.S federal income tax purposes
if Ten Percent Shareholders own in the aggregate, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of either the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of such corporation entitled to vote or of the

Shareholders  </B></FONT></P>

does not include beneficial owners whose
ADSs are held by nominees in street name. Because many ordinary shares held in the form of ADSs are held by broker nominees, we are unable to estimate the total number of holders represented by these
record holders. </FONT></P>

Dividend Policy  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have never declared or paid any dividends on our ordinary shares or any other securities. We currently intend to retain all available funds
and any future earnings, if any, to fund the development and expansion of our business and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Investors should not purchase the
ADSs with the expectation of receiving cash dividends. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any
future determination to pay dividends will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and may be based on a number of factors, including our future operations and earnings,
capital requirements and surplus, general financial condition, contractual restrictions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. If we pay any dividends, we will pay the ADS
holders to the same extent as holders of our ordinary shares, subject to the terms of the deposit agreement, as amended, including the fees and expenses payable thereunder. Cash dividends on our
ordinary shares, if any, will be paid in U.S. dollar. </FONT></P>

we pay dividends in the future, in order for us to distribute dividends to our shareholders and ADS holders, we will rely to some extent on any dividends distributed by our PRC
subsidiaries. Any dividend distributions from our PRC subsidiaries to us will be subject to PRC withholding tax. In addition, regulations in the PRC currently permit payment of dividends of a PRC
company only out of accumulated distributable after-tax profits as determined in accordance with its articles of association and the accounting standards and regulations in China. See the section of
this Annual Report titled "Part&nbsp;I&#151;Item&nbsp;1A&#151;Risk Factors&#151;Risks Related to Our Doing Business in the PRC&#151;In the future, we may rely to some
extent on dividends and other distributions on equity from our principal operating subsidiaries to fund offshore cash and financing requirements." </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February&nbsp;8, 2016, we closed the sale of 7,590,000 ADSs to the public at an initial public offering price of $24.00 per ADS, including
the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional ADSs. The ordinary shares in the form of ADSs in our initial public offering were registered under the Securities Act
pursuant to a registration statements on Form&nbsp;S-1 (File No.&nbsp;333-207459), which was filed with the SEC on October&nbsp;16, 2015 and amended subsequently and declared effective on
February&nbsp;2, 2016. Following the sale of the ADSs in connection with the closing of our initial public offering, the offering terminated. The offering did not terminate before all the securities
registered in the registration statements were sold. The underwriters of the offering were Goldman, Sachs&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Co., Morgan Stanley, and Cowen and Company acting as joint book-running
managers for the offering and as representatives of the underwriters. Baird acted as co-manager for the offering. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
raised $166.2&nbsp;million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses of approximately $16.0&nbsp;million. No offering
expenses were paid directly or indirectly to any of our directors or officers (or their associates) or persons owning ten percent or more of any class of our equity securities or to any other
affiliates. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
November&nbsp;23, 2016, we closed the sale of 6,631,250 ADSs to the public at a public offering price of $32.00 per ADS, including the exercise in full by the underwriters of their
option to purchase additional ADSs. In this offering, the selling shareholders sold 468,750 ADSs representing 6,093,750 ordinary shares. The ordinary shares in the form of ADSs in this follow-on
public offering were registered under the Securities Act pursuant to a registration statements on Form&nbsp;S-1 (File No.333-214540), which was filed with the SEC on November&nbsp;10, 2016 and
amended subsequently and declared effective on November&nbsp;17, 2016. Following the sale of the ADSs in connection with the closing of our follow-on public offering, the offering terminated. The
offering did not terminate before all the securities registered in the registration statements were sold. The underwriters of the offering were Morgan Stanley; Goldman, Sachs&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Co.; and
Cowen and Company acting as joint book-running managers for the offering and as representatives of the underwriters. Baird and William Blair acted as co-managers for the offering. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
raised $198.6&nbsp;million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses of approximately $13.6&nbsp;million. We did not
receive any proceeds from the sale of the shares by the selling stockholder. No offering expenses were paid directly or indirectly to any of our directors or officers (or their associates) or persons
owning ten percent or more of any class of our equity securities or to any other affiliates. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
date, we have not yet used all of the net proceeds from our initial public offering and follow-on public offering. We invested the funds received in short-term, interest-bearing
investment-grade securities and government securities in accordance with our investment policy. As described in our final prospectuses filed with the SEC on February&nbsp;3, 2016 and
November&nbsp;18, 2016, pursuant to Rule&nbsp;424(b) </FONT></P>

Cayman Islands Taxation  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cayman Islands currently levies no taxes on individuals or corporations based upon profits, income, gains or appreciation and there is no
taxation in the nature of inheritance tax or estate duty or withholding tax applicable to us or to any holder of the ADSs and ordinary shares. There are no other taxes likely to be material to us
levied by the Government of the Cayman Islands except for stamp duties which may be applicable on instruments executed in, or after execution brought within, the jurisdiction of the Cayman Islands. No
stamp duty is payable in the Cayman Islands on the issue of shares by, or any transfers of shares of, Cayman Islands companies (except those which hold interests in land in the Cayman Islands). The
Cayman Islands is not party to any double tax treaties
that are applicable to any payments made to or by our company. There are no exchange control regulations or currency restrictions in the Cayman Islands. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payments
of dividends and capital in respect of the ADSs and ordinary shares will not be subject to taxation in the Cayman Islands and no withholding will be required on the payment of a

People's Republic of China Taxation  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the EIT Law, an enterprise established outside of China with a "de facto management body" within China is considered a "resident
enterprise," which means that it is treated in a manner similar to a Chinese enterprise for enterprise income tax purposes. Although the implementation rules of the EIT Law define "de facto management
body" as a managing body that exercises substantive and overall management and control over the production and business, personnel, accounting books and assets of an enterprise, the only official
guidance for this definition currently available is set forth in the Notice Regarding the Determination of Chinese-Controlled Offshore Incorporated Enterprise as PRC Tax Resident Enterprises on the
Basis of De Facto Management Bodies, or Circular 82, issued by the State Administration of Taxation, which provides guidance on the determination of the tax residence status of a Chinese-controlled
offshore incorporated enterprise, defined as an enterprise that is incorporated under the laws of a foreign country or territory and that has a PRC enterprise or enterprise group as its primary
controlling shareholder. Although BeiGene,&nbsp;Ltd. does not have a PRC enterprise or enterprise group as our primary controlling shareholder and is therefore not a Chinese-controlled offshore
incorporated enterprise within the meaning of Circular 82, in the absence of guidance specifically applicable to us, we have applied the guidance set forth in Circular 82 to evaluate the tax residence
status of BeiGene,&nbsp;Ltd. and its subsidiaries organized outside the PRC. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According
to Circular 82, a Chinese-controlled offshore incorporated enterprise will be regarded as a PRC tax resident by virtue of having a "de facto management body" in China and will
be subject to PRC enterprise income tax on its worldwide income only if all of the following criteria are met:</FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently,
some of the members of our management team are located in China. However, we do not believe that we meet all of the conditions outlined in the immediately preceding paragraph.
BeiGene,&nbsp;Ltd. and its offshore subsidiaries are incorporated outside the PRC. As a holding company, our key assets and records, including the resolutions and meeting minutes of our board of
directors and the resolutions and meeting minutes of our shareholders, are located and maintained outside the PRC. However, we are not aware of any offshore holding companies with a corporate
structure similar to ours that has been deemed a PRC "resident enterprise" by the PRC tax authorities. Accordingly, we believe that BeiGene,&nbsp;Ltd. and its offshore subsidiaries should not be
treated as a "resident enterprise" for PRC tax purposes if the criteria for "de facto management body" as set forth in Circular 82 were deemed applicable to us. However, as the tax residency status of
an enterprise is subject to determination by the PRC tax authorities and uncertainties remain with respect to the interpretation of the term "de facto management body" as applicable to our offshore
entities, we will continue to monitor our tax status. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
implementation rules of the EIT Law provide that, (1)&nbsp;if the enterprise that distributes dividends is domiciled in the PRC or (2)&nbsp;if gains are realized from
transferring equity interests of enterprises domiciled in the PRC, then such dividends or capital gains are treated as China-sourced income. It is not clear how "domicile" may be interpreted under the
EIT Law, and it may be interpreted as the jurisdiction where the enterprise is a tax resident. Therefore, if we are considered as a PRC tax resident enterprise for PRC tax purposes, any dividends we
pay to our overseas shareholders or ADS holders as well as gains realized by such shareholders or ADS holders from the transfer of our shares
or ADSs may be regarded as China-sourced income. As a result dividends paid to non-PRC resident enterprise ADS holders or shareholders may be subject to PRC withholding tax at a rate of up to 10% (or
20% in the case of non-PRC individual ADS holders or shareholders) and gains realized by non-PRC resident enterprise ADS holders or shareholders from the transfer of our ordinary shares or ADSs may be
subject to PRC tax at a rate of 10% (or 20% in the case of non-PRC individual ADS holders or shareholders). It is also unclear whether, if we are considered a PRC resident enterprise, holders of our
shares or ADSs would be able to claim the benefit of income tax treaties or agreements entered into between China and other countries or areas. </FONT></P>

Overview  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a globally focused, clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to becoming a leader in the discovery and development of
innovative, molecularly targeted and immuno-oncology drugs for the treatment of cancer. We believe the next generation of cancer treatment will utilize therapeutics both as monotherapies and in
combination to attack multiple underlying mechanisms of cancer cell growth and survival. We further believe that discovery of next generation cancer therapies requires new research tools. To that end,
we have developed a proprietary cancer biology platform that addresses the importance of tumor-immune system interactions and the value of primary biopsies in developing new models to support our drug
discovery effort. Our strategy is to develop a pipeline of drug candidates with the potential to be best-in-class monotherapies and also important components of multiple-agent combination regimens. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
have used our cancer biology platform to develop four clinical-stage drug candidates that we believe have the potential to be best-in-class or first-in-class. In addition, we believe
that each has the potential to be an important component of a drug combination addressing major unmet medical needs. Our clinical-stage drug candidates include three molecularly targeted agents,
BGB-3111, BGB-290 and BGB-283 and one immuno-oncology agent, BGB-A317. BGB-3111 is a potent and highly selective small molecule inhibitor of BTK. BGB-290 is a molecularly targeted, orally available,
potent and highly selective inhibitor of PARP1 and PARP2. BGB-283 is a small molecule inhibitor of both the monomer and dimer forms of the RAF kinase. For each of our molecularly targeted drug
candidates, we have achieved proof-of-concept by demonstrating objective responses in the defined patient populations. BGB-3111 received orphan drug designation from the FDA, for CLL, MCL and WM. Our
clinical-stage immuno-oncology agent, BGB-A317, is an investigational humanized monoclonal antibody against the immune checkpoint receptor, PD-1. We have IND Applications in effect for our BTK, PD-1
and PARP inhibitors with the FDA. We have also received approval of our Clinical Trial Applications for each of our four clinical-stage drug candidates from the CFDA. In addition to our clinical-stage
drug candidates, we have a robust pipeline of preclinical programs and are planning to advance one or more of these programs into the clinic in the next 12&nbsp;months. We retain full global rights
for all of our clinical and preclinical drug candidates and programs. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since
our inception on October&nbsp;28, 2010, our operations have focused on organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, establishing our intellectual
property portfolio and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials. We do not have any drug candidates approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. We have financed
operations through a combination of public and private equity and debt financings and public and private grants and contracts, including the net proceeds from our initial public offering and follow-on
public offering, the net proceeds from the issuance of a senior note and convertible promissory note to Merck Sharp&nbsp;&amp; Dohme Research&nbsp;GmbH, or MSD, an affiliate of Merck Sharp&nbsp;&amp;
Dohme Corp., the private placements of our Series&nbsp;A preferred shares and Series&nbsp;A-2 preferred shares, and our collaboration with Merck&nbsp;KGaA, Darmstadt Germany, or Merck KGaA,
Darmstadt Germany Collaboration. On February&nbsp;8, 2016 and November&nbsp;23, 2016, we completed our initial public offering and follow-on public </FONT></P>

our liquidity requirements, based upon our current operating plan and the successful completion of our initial public offering and follow-on public offerings, we believe we have sufficient cash to
meet our projected operating requirements for at least the next 12&nbsp;months. See "&#151;Liquidity and Capital Resources." </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since

December&nbsp;31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. As of December&nbsp;31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $237.4&nbsp;million. In the future, we may generate revenue from product
sales, collaboration agreements, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements, or a combination of these. Substantially all of our losses have resulted from funding our research and development
programs and general and administrative costs associated with our operations. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future. We anticipate that
our expenses will increase significantly in connection with our ongoing activities, as we:</FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
expect that any revenue we generate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year as a result of the timing and amount of license fees, milestones, reimbursement of costs
incurred and other payments and product sales, to the extent any are successfully commercialized. If we fail to complete the development of our drug candidates in a timely manner or obtain regulatory
approval of them, our ability to generate future revenue, and our results of operations and financial position, would be materially adversely affected. </FONT></P>

Revenue  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To date, our revenue has consisted of upfront license fees, reimbursed research and development expenses and milestone payments from our
collaboration agreements with Merck KGaA, Darmstadt Germany on BGB-283 and BGB-290. We have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to generate any revenue from product sales
for the foreseeable future. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
May&nbsp;24, 2013, we entered into license agreements with Merck KGaA, Darmstadt Germany on BGB-283, which we amended and restated on December&nbsp;10, 2013, and further amended
on October&nbsp;1, 2015 and December&nbsp;3, 2015. In the latest amendment, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt Germany granted us an exclusive license under certain of its intellectual property rights to
develop, manufacture and commercialize the RAF dimer inhibitor in The People's Republic of China, which we refer to as the PRC Territory, subject to certain non-compete restrictions. In March 2017,
Merck KGaA, Darmstadt Germany informed us that it will not exercise the Continuation Option in the ex-PRC Territory, and thus, the ex-PRC BRAF Agreement has terminated in its entirety, except for
certain provisions that will survive the termination. Under these agreements, we received $13&nbsp;million in non-refundable payments in 2013 following their execution, $5&nbsp;million in
milestone payments in 2014 and $4&nbsp;million in milestone </FONT></P>

in 2015. We are eligible to receive $14&nbsp;million in payments upon the successful achievement of pre-specified clinical milestones in the PRC Territory. In consideration for the licenses

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
October&nbsp;28, 2013, we entered into license agreements with Merck KGaA, Darmstadt Germany on BGB-290, pursuant to which (1)&nbsp;we granted to Merck KGaA, Darmstadt Germany an
exclusive license under certain of our intellectual property rights to develop and manufacture, and, if Merck KGaA, Darmstadt Germany exercises a certain continuation option, to commercialize and
manufacture our compound BGB-290 and any other compound covered by the same existing patent rights with primary activity to inhibit PARP 1, 2 or 3 enzymes in the Ex-PRC Territory, and (2)&nbsp;Merck
KGaA, Darmstadt Germany granted us an exclusive license under certain of its intellectual property rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize the licensed PARP inhibitors in the PRC Territory.
Under these license agreements, we received $6&nbsp;million in non-refundable payments in November 2013 following their execution and $9&nbsp;million in milestone payments in 2014. We are eligible
to receive up to $7&nbsp;million and $2.5&nbsp;million, in payments upon the successful achievement of pre-specified clinical and regulatory milestones in the PRC Territory respectively. On
October&nbsp;1, 2015, pursuant to a purchase of rights agreement, we repurchased all of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt Germany's worldwide rights under the ex-PRC license agreement, in consideration for,
among other things, a one-time payment of $10&nbsp;million and reduction of future milestone payments that we are eligible to receive under the PRC license agreement. In connection with such
repurchase, the ex-PRC license agreement terminated except for certain provisions therein. The remaining $3&nbsp;million of deferred revenue related to PARP as of October&nbsp;1, 2015 was netted
against the $10&nbsp;million repurchase consideration. In addition, if Merck KGaA, Darmstadt Germany exercises its PRC commercialization option, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt Germany is required to pay us a
$50&nbsp;million non-refundable payment upon such exercise, and we are eligible for a $12.5&nbsp;million milestone payment upon the successful achievement of a certain additional regulatory event
in the PRC Territory. In consideration for the licenses granted to us, we are required to pay Merck KGaA, Darmstadt Germany a high single-digit royalty on aggregate net sales of licensed products in
the PRC Territory. </FONT></P>

the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, substantially all of our revenue were generated solely from Merck KGaA, Darmstadt Germany. For the foreseeable future, we

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
expense research and development costs when we incur them. We record costs for some development activities, such as clinical trials, based on an evaluation of the progress to
completion of specific tasks using data such as subject enrollment, clinical site activations or information our vendors provide to us. We do not allocate employee-related costs, depreciation, rental
and other indirect costs to specific research and development programs because these costs are deployed across multiple product programs under research and development and, as such, are separately
classified as unallocated research and development expenses. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research
and development activities are central to our business model. We expect research and development costs to increase significantly for the foreseeable future as our development
programs progress, including as we continue to support the clinical trials of BGB-3111, BGB-A317, BGB-290 and BGB-283 as a treatment for various cancers and move these drug candidates into additional
clinical
trials. There are numerous factors associated with the successful commercialization of any of our drug candidates, including future trial design and various regulatory requirements, many of which
cannot be determined with accuracy at this time based on our stage of development. Additionally, future commercial and regulatory factors beyond our control will impact our clinical development
programs and plans. </FONT></P>

General and Administrative Expenses  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefit costs, including share-based compensation for general and
administrative personnel. Other general and administrative expenses include professional fees for legal, consulting, auditing and tax services as well as other direct and allocated expenses for rent
and maintenance of facilities, insurance and other supplies used in general and administrative activities. We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in future periods to
support increases in our research and development activities, including the continuation of the clinical trials of BGB-3111, BGB-A317, BGB-290 and BGB-283 as a treatment for various cancers and the
initiation of our clinical trials for our other drug candidates. These cost increases will likely be due to increased headcount, increased share-based compensation charges, expanded infrastructure and
increased costs for insurance. We also anticipate increased legal, compliance, accounting and investor and public relations expenses associated with being a public company. </FONT></P>

2011, we issued a $10&nbsp;million, 8% senior promissory note and a $10&nbsp;million 8% subordinated convertible promissory note, compounded annually, each to MSD. We also issued
an aggregate principal amount of $3.1&nbsp;million convertible promissory notes to several other investors in 2012 and 2014, all bearing interest of 8% per annum for the first three years and 15%
per annum for the remaining term. In October 2014, we completed a Series&nbsp;A preferred share financing, as a result of which, the $10&nbsp;million MSD subordinated convertible promissory note
was automatically converted into 18,518,519 Series&nbsp;A preferred shares, and the other $3.1&nbsp;million principal amount of convertible promissory notes, along with accrued interest was
automatically converted into 5,470,705 Series&nbsp;A preferred shares. We recognized a gain on debt extinguishment of $2.9&nbsp;million due to the forfeiture of interest upon the conversion, as
only the principal amount of the Merck subordinated convertible promissory note was eligible for conversion. In February 2016, in connection with the closing of our initial public offering, the
outstanding unpaid principal and interest of the MSD Senior Promissory Note was automatically exchanged into 7,942,314 of our ordinary shares. </FONT></P>

Revenue  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenue from the Merck KGaA, Darmstadt Germany Collaboration decreased by $4.2&nbsp;million to $8.8&nbsp;million for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2015 from $13.0&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014. The decrease was mainly attributable to the difference between revenues recognized in 2014 for payments
received for dosing of 5th&nbsp;patient of BGB-283 and BGB-290 in ex-PRC trials and a payment received in 2015 for dosing of the 5th&nbsp;patient of BGB-283 in PRC trials. </FONT></P>

Liquidity and Capital Resources  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since inception, we have incurred net losses and negative cash flows from our operations. Substantially all of our losses have resulted from
funding our research and development programs and general and administrative costs associated with our operations. We incurred net losses of $119.2&nbsp;million, $57.1&nbsp;million and
$18.5&nbsp;million for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. As of December&nbsp;31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $237.4&nbsp;million. Our primary use
of cash is to fund research and development costs. Our operating activities used $89.5&nbsp;million, $39.8&nbsp;million and $8.7&nbsp;million of cash flows during the years ended
December&nbsp;31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Historically, we financed our operations principally through proceeds from private placements of preferred shares, promissory notes and
convertible notes of $184.4&nbsp;million and proceeds from the Merck KGaA, Darmstadt Germany Collaboration of $37.0&nbsp;million. On February&nbsp;8, 2016 and November&nbsp;23, 2016, we
completed our initial public offering and follow-on public offering as follows: </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
February&nbsp;8, 2016, we completed our initial public offering, or IPO, on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. 6,600,000 ADSs representing 85,800,000 ordinary shares were sold at
$24.00 per ADS, or $1.85 per share. Additionally, the underwriters exercised their options to purchase an additional 990,000 ADSs representing 12,870,000 ordinary shares. Net proceeds from the IPO
including underwriter options after deducting underwriting discount and offering expenses were $166.2&nbsp;million. The deferred IPO costs of $16.0&nbsp;million were recorded as a reduction of the
proceeds received from the IPO in the shareholders' equity. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
November&nbsp;23, 2016, we completed a follow-on public offering at a price of $32.00 per ADSs, or $2.46 per share. In this offering, we sold 5,781,250 ADSs representing 75,156,250
ordinary shares. Additionally, the underwriters exercised their options to purchase an additional 850,000 ADSs representing 11,050,000 ordinary shares from us. The selling shareholders sold 468,750
ADSs representing 6,093,750 ordinary shares. Net proceeds from this offering including underwriter options after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses were $198.6&nbsp;million.
We did not receive any proceeds from the sale of the shares by the selling shareholders. The deferred follow-on public offering costs of $13.6&nbsp;million were recorded as a reduction of the
proceeds received from the offering in shareholders' equity. </FONT></P>

Net Cash Used in Operating Activities  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of cash in all periods presented resulted primarily from our net losses adjusted for non-cash charges and changes in components of
working capital. The primary use of our cash in all periods presented was to fund the development of our research and development, regulatory and other clinical trial costs, and related supporting
administration. Our prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable and accrued expense balances in all periods presented were affected by the timing of vendor invoicing and payments. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During
the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016, operating activities used $89.5&nbsp;million of cash, which resulted principally from our net loss of $119.2&nbsp;million, adjusting
for non-cash charges of $15.5&nbsp;million and interest expense of $0.1&nbsp;million, and by cash provided in our operating assets and liabilities of $14.1&nbsp;million. Our net non-cash charges
during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016 primarily consisted of $1.9&nbsp;million of depreciation expense, $10.6&nbsp;million of share-based compensation expense, a $1.4&nbsp;million loss
on sale of available-for-sale securities and a $1.5&nbsp;million loss from changes in the fair value of financial instruments related to the valuation changes of warrants and option liabilities that
were exercised in the year. </FONT></P>

for non-cash charges of $13.9&nbsp;million and interest expense of $1.1&nbsp;million, and by cash provided in our operating assets and liabilities of $2.3&nbsp;million. Our net non-cash charges
during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 primarily consisted of $1.5&nbsp;million of depreciation expense, $10.2&nbsp;million of share-based compensation expense and a $1.8&nbsp;million

for non-cash charges of $11.0&nbsp;million and interest expense of $3.3&nbsp;million, gain on debt extinguishment of $2.9&nbsp;million, and by cash used in our operating assets and liabilities
of $1.6&nbsp;million. Our net non-cash charges during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 primarily consisted of $1.6&nbsp;million of depreciation expense, $6.6&nbsp;million of share-based

Operating Capital Requirements  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not expect to generate significant revenue from product sales unless and until we obtain regulatory approval of and commercialize one of
our current or future drug candidates. We anticipate that we will continue to generate losses for the foreseeable future, and we expect the losses to increase as we continue the development of, and
seek regulatory approvals for, our drug candidates and begin to commercialize any approved products. As a newly public company, we will incur additional costs associated with operating as a public
company. In addition, subject to obtaining regulatory approval of any of our drug candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses for product sales, marketing and manufacturing.
Accordingly, we anticipate that we will need substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based
on our current operating plan, we expect that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December&nbsp;31, 2016, will enable us to fund our operating
expenses and capital expenditures requirements for at least the next 15&nbsp;months. We expect that our expenses will continue to increase substantially as we fund clinical development of BGB-3111,
BGB-A317, BGB-290 and BGB-283, fund new and ongoing research and development activities and working capital and other general corporate purposes. We have based our estimates on assumptions that may
prove to be wrong, and we may use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization
of our drug candidates, we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures necessary to complete the development and commercialization of our drug
candidates. </FONT></P>

such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations,
strategic alliances, licensing arrangements and government grants. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of
our shareholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as an ADS holder. Debt financing, if available, may
involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends and may
require the issuance of warrants, which could potentially dilute your ownership interest. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third
parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams or research programs or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to
raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant
rights to develop and market products or drug candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. </FONT></P>

Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the periods. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis, including but not limited to, estimating the useful lives of long-lived assets, identifying separate accounting units
and estimating the best estimate selling price of each deliverable in our revenue arrangements, assessing the impairment of long-lived assets, share-based compensation expenses, realizability of
deferred tax assets and the fair value of warrant and option liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events, contractual milestones and other various factors that
are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from
other sources. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. </FONT></P>

Recognition</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, or ASC&nbsp;605. Our collaborative arrangements may contain multiple elements, including grants of licenses to intellectual property rights, agreement to provide
research and development services and other deliverables. The deliverables under such arrangements are evaluated under ASC&nbsp;605-25, </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Multiple-Element
Arrangements.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> Pursuant to ASC&nbsp;605-25, each required deliverable is evaluated to determine whether it qualifies as a separate unit of accounting based on whether the
deliverable has "stand-alone value" to the customer. The collaborative arrangements do not include a right of return for any deliverable. The arrangement's consideration that is fixed or determinable,
excluding contingent payments, is then allocated to each separate unit of accounting based on the relative selling price of each deliverable. The relative selling price for each deliverable is
determined using vendor specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of selling price or third-party evidence, or TPE, of selling price if VSOE does not exist. If neither VSOE nor TPE exists, we use the best
estimate of the selling price, or BESP, for the deliverable. In general, the consideration allocated to each unit of accounting is recognized as the related goods or services are delivered, limited to
the consideration that is not contingent upon future deliverables. Non-refundable payments received before all of the relevant criteria for revenue recognition are satisfied are recorded as advances
from customers. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upfront
non-refundable payments for licensing our intellectual property are evaluated to determine if the licensee can obtain stand-alone value from the license separate from the value
of the research and development services and other deliverables in the arrangement to be provided by us. We act as the principal under our arrangements and licensing intellectual property is part of
our ongoing major or central operations. The license right is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items or meeting other specified performance conditions. Therefore, when stand-alone value
of the license is determinable, the allocated consideration is recognized as collaboration revenue upon delivery of the license rights. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
we act as the principal under our arrangements, and research and development services are also part of our ongoing major or central operations, we recognize the allocated
consideration related to reimbursements of research and development costs as collaboration revenue when delivery or performance of such services occurs. </FONT></P>

development, royalties and commercial event payments, collectively referred to as target payments, under collaborative arrangements are triggered either by the results of our
research and development efforts, achievement of regulatory goals or by specified sales results by a third-party collaborator. Under ASC&nbsp;605-28, </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Milestone Method of
Revenue Recognition</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, an accounting policy election can be made to recognize a payment that is contingent upon the achievement of a substantive milestone in its entirety in the
period in which the milestone is achieved. We elected not to adopt the milestone method of revenue recognition under ASC&nbsp;605-28. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Targets
related to our development-based activities may include initiation of various phases of clinical trials and applications and acceptance for product approvals by regulatory
agencies. Due to the uncertainty involved in meeting these development-based targets, we would account for development-based targets as collaboration revenue upon achievement of the respective
development target. Royalties based on reported sales of licensed products will be recognized as collaboration revenue based on contract terms when reported sales are reliably measurable and
collectability is reasonably assured. Targets related to commercial activities may be triggered upon events such as first commercial sale of a product or when sales first achieve a defined level.
Since these targets would be achieved after the completion of our development activities, we would account for the commercial event targets in the same manner as royalties, with collaboration revenue
recognized upon achievement of the target. To date, none of the products have been approved. Hence, no revenue has been recognized related to royalties or commercial event based targets in any of the
periods presented. </FONT></P>

Research and Development Expenses  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research and development expenses represent costs associated with the collaborative arrangements, which primarily include (1)&nbsp;payroll and
related costs (including share-based compensation) associated with research and development personnel; (2)&nbsp;costs related to clinical trials and preclinical testing of our technologies under
development; (3)&nbsp;costs to develop the product candidates, including raw materials and supplies, product testing, depreciation, and facility related expenses; (4)&nbsp;expenses for research
services provided by universities and contract laboratories, including sponsored research funding; and (5)&nbsp;other research and development expenses. Research and development expenses are charged
to expense as incurred when these expenditures relate to our research and development services and have no alternative future uses. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clinical
trial costs are a significant component of our research and development expenses. We have a history of contracting with third parties that perform various clinical trial
activities on behalf of us in the ongoing development of our product candidates. Expenses related to clinical trials are accrued based on our estimates of the actual services performed by the third
parties for the respective period. If the contracted amounts are modified (for instance, as a result of changes in the clinical trial protocol or scope of work to be performed), we will modify the
related accruals accordingly on a prospective
basis. Revisions in the scope of a contract are charged to expense in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become reasonably certain. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
process of estimating our research and development expenses involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have
been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated costs incurred for the services when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual
costs. The majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed, on a pre-determined schedule or when contractual milestones are met; however, some require advanced payments.
We make estimates of our expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. Although we do not expect our estimates to be
materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may
result in us reporting expenses that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, we have not made any material adjustments to our prior estimates of research and development expenses. </FONT></P>

awards to employees were classified as equity awards and are recognized in the financial statements based on their grant date fair values. We have elected to recognize compensation expense using the
straight-line method for all employee equity awards granted with graded vesting based on service conditions provided that the amount of compensation cost recognized at any date is at least equal to
the portion of the grant-date value of the options that are vested at that date. We use the accelerated method for all awards granted with graded vesting based on performance conditions. To the extent
the required vesting conditions are not met resulting in the forfeiture of the share-based awards, previously recognized compensation expense relating to those awards are reversed. ASC 718 requires

rates are estimated based on historical and future expectations of employee turnover rates and are adjusted to reflect future changes in circumstances and facts, if any.
Share-based compensation expense is recorded net of estimated forfeitures such that expense is recorded only for those share-based awards that are expected to vest. To the extent we revise these
estimates in the future, the share-based payments could be materially impacted in the period of revision, as well as in following periods. We, with the assistance of an independent third-party
valuation firm, determined the fair value of the share options granted to employees. The binomial option pricing model was applied in determining the estimated fair value of the options granted to
employees. </FONT></P>

transactions in which goods or services are received in exchange for equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the
consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. The measurement date of the fair value of the equity instrument issued is the date on
which the counterparty's performance is completed as there is no associated performance commitment. The expense is recognized in the same manner as if we had paid cash for the services provided by the
non-employees in accordance with ASC 505-50, </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Equity-based payments to non-employees</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A change in any of the terms or conditions of the awards is accounted for as a modification of the award. Incremental compensation cost is
measured as the excess, if any, of the fair value of the modified award over the fair value of the original award immediately before its terms are modified, measured based on the fair value of the
awards and other pertinent factors at the modification date. For vested awards, we recognize incremental compensation cost in the period the modification occurs. For unvested awards, we recognize over
the remaining requisite service period, the sum of the incremental compensation cost and the remaining unrecognized compensation cost for the original award on the modification date. If the fair value
of the modified award is lower than the fair
value of the original award immediately before modification, the minimum compensation cost we recognize is the cost of the original award. </FONT></P>

Significant Factors, Assumptions and Methodologies Used in Determining Fair Value  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fair value of each share option grant is estimated using the binomial option-pricing model. The model requires the input of highly
subjective assumptions including the estimated expected share price volatility and, the share price upon which (i.e.&nbsp;the exercise multiple) the employees are likely to exercise share options.
The trading history and observation period of our own share price movement has not been long enough to match the life of the share option. Therefore, we estimate our expected share price volatility
based on the historical volatility of a group of similar companies, which are publicly-traded. When selecting these public companies on which we have based our expected share price volatility, we
selected companies with characteristics similar to us, including the invested capital's value, business model, development stage, risk profiles, position within the industry, and with historical share
price information sufficient to meet the contractual life of our share-based awards. We will continue to apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility
of our own share price becomes available. For the exercise multiple, we were not able to develop an exercise pattern as reference, thus the exercise multiple is based on management's estimation, which
we believe is representative of the future exercise pattern of the options. The risk-free interest rates for the periods within the contractual life of the option are based on the U.S. Treasury yield
curve in effect </FONT></P>

<U>Fair value of ordinary shares</U> </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With
the completion of our initial public offering in February 2016, a public trading market for the ADSs has been established, and it is no longer necessary for our
board of directors to estimate the fair value of our ordinary shares in connection with our accounting for granted share options and restricted shares. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior
to our initial public offering, we were required to estimate the fair value of the ordinary shares underlying our share-based awards when performing the fair value calculations
with the binomial option model. Therefore, our board of directors estimated the fair value of our ordinary shares at various dates, with input from management, considering the third-party valuations
of ordinary shares at each grant date. The valuations of our ordinary shares were performed using methodologies, approaches and assumptions consistent with the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants Audit and Accounting Practice Aid Series: </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, or the AICPA
Practice Guide. In addition, our board of directors considered various
objective and subjective factors, along with input from management and the independent third-party valuation firm, to determine the fair value of our ordinary shares, including: external market
conditions affecting the biopharmaceutical industry, trends within the biopharmaceutical industry, the prices at which we sold preferred shares, the superior rights and preference of the preferred
shares or other senior securities relative to our ordinary shares at the time of each grant, the results of operations, financials position, status of our research and development efforts, our stage
of development and business strategy, and the lack of an active public market for our ordinary shares, and the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event such as an initial public offering. The
option-pricing method was used to allocate the invested capital's enterprise value to preferred shares or other senior securities and ordinary shares, taking into account the guidance prescribed by
the AICPA Practice Guide. This method treats ordinary shares and preferred shares or other senior securities as call options on the invested capital's value, with exercise prices based on their
respective payoffs upon a liquidity event. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
determining the invested capital's value, we applied the discounted cash flow analysis based on our projected cash flow using our best estimate as of the valuation date. The
determination of our invested capital's value requires complex and subjective judgments to be made regarding our projected financial and operating results, our unique business risks, and our operating
history and prospects at the time of valuation. </FONT></P>

<U>Fair value of options and restricted shares</U> </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
board of directors determined the fair value of our share options and the restricted shares as of the date of grant, taking into consideration the various objective
and subjective factors described above, including the conclusion of valuation of our ordinary shares as of dates close to the grant dates of our share options and the restricted shares discussed
below. We computed the per share weighted-average estimated fair value for share option grants based on the binomial option pricing model and the per share weighted-average estimated fair value for

warrants in connection with the convertible promissory notes and the option to purchase shares by rental deferral were exercised in January and February 2016. The
fair values of the warrants and option liabilities were determined using significant other observable inputs (Level&nbsp;2), estimated using the intrinsic value, which equals to the difference
between the share price at the IPO closing date and the exercise price, as the exercise dates were immediately prior to or very close to the IPO closing date. </FONT></P>

<U>Fair value estimation prior to the exercise dates</U> </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
presented in the prior subsection, "Fair Value Estimate," we applied the discounted cash flow analysis to estimate the invested capital's value as of various
valuation dates and the option-pricing method was used to allocate the invested capital's value to preferred shares or other senior securities and ordinary shares. The derived fair value of ordinary
share and preferred shares was then further used as inputs to the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of the derivative instruments. The Black-Scholes option pricing model
requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the risk-free interest rate, the expected volatility of the underlying stock and the expected life of the derivative instruments. These
estimates involve inherent risk and uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. To determine the expected life of the derivative instruments, we have considered factors including the
timing of expected various liquidity events and their respective probabilities as well as the contractual life of the derivative instruments. The risk-free interest rates for the periods within the
expected life of the option are based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve. We historically have been a private company and lack company-specific historical and implied volatility information. Therefore,
we estimate our expected volatility based on the historical volatility of a group of similar companies, which are publicly-traded. </FONT></P>

Income Taxes  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We use the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the
differences between the financial reporting and the tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to
reverse. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
November 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which requires deferred income tax assets and liabilities to be
classified as non-current in a classified balance sheet, and eliminates the prior guidance, which required an entity to separate deferred tax assets and liabilities into a current amount and a
non-current amount in a classified balance sheet. We changed the manner in which we classify deferred tax assets and liabilities retrospectively from the fourth quarter of 2016 due to the early
adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2015-17. The adoption of this guidance has no impact on prior year balances as current deferred tax assets and liabilities are both nil as of
December&nbsp;31, 2015. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
evaluate our uncertain tax positions using the provisions of ASC 740, </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Income Taxes</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, which requires that realization of an uncertain
income tax position be recognized in the financial statements. The benefit to be recorded in the financial statements is the amount most likely to be realized assuming a review by tax authorities
having all relevant information and applying current conventions. It is our policy to recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, if any, as a component of income tax
expense. </FONT></P>

JOBS Act  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Section&nbsp;107(b) of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, an "emerging growth company" can delay the
adoption of new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards would apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption and, as a
result, we will adopt new or revised accounting standards at the same time as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. There are other exemptions and reduced reporting
requirements provided by the JOBS Act that we are currently evaluating. For example, as an emerging growth company, we are exempt from Sections&nbsp;14A(a) and (b)&nbsp;of the Exchange Act which
would otherwise require us to (1)&nbsp;submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes, such as "say-on-pay," "say-on-frequency" and "golden parachutes;" and
(2)&nbsp;disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of our chief executive officer's compensation to
our median employee compensation. We also rely on an exemption from the rule requiring us to provide an auditor's attestation report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to
Section&nbsp;404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rule requiring us to comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the PCAOB regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the
auditor's report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements, known as the auditor discussion and analysis. We will continue to remain an "emerging growth company"
until the earliest of the following: (1)&nbsp;the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the completion of our initial public offering, (2)&nbsp;the last day of
the fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenue is equal to or more than $1&nbsp;billion, (3)&nbsp;the date on which we have issued more than $1&nbsp;billion in nonconvertible debt
during the previous three years, or (4)&nbsp;the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC.  </FONT></P>

Interest and Credit Risk  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Financial instruments that are potentially subject to credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. The carrying
amounts of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments represent the maximum amount of loss due to credit risk. We had cash and cash equivalents of $87.5&nbsp;million, $17.9&nbsp;million
and $13.9&nbsp;million and short term investments of $280.7&nbsp;million, $82.6&nbsp;million and $30.5&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. At
December&nbsp;31, 2016, our cash and cash equivalents were deposited with various major reputable financial institutions located in the PRC and international financial institutions outside of the
PRC. The deposits placed with these financial institutions are not protected by statutory or commercial insurance. In the event of bankruptcy of one of these financial institutions, we may be unlikely
to claim our deposits back in full. We believe that these financial institutions are of high credit quality, and we continually monitor the credit worthiness of these financial institutions. At
December&nbsp;31, 2016 our short-term investments consisted primarily of U.S. Treasury securities. We believe that the U.S. Treasury securities are of high credit quality and continually monitor the
credit worthiness of these institutions. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principle, provide liquidity and maximize income without significant increasing risk. Our primary exposure to market

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures. Our functional currency is the U.S.&nbsp;dollar, but a
portion of our operating transactions and assets and liabilities are in other currencies, such as RMB, Australian dollar and Euro. We do not believe that we currently have any significant direct
foreign exchange risk and have not used any derivative financial instruments to hedge exposure to such risk. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RMB
is not freely convertible into foreign currencies for capital account transactions. The value of RMB against the U.S. dollar and other currencies is affected by, among other things,
changes in China's political and economic conditions and China's foreign exchange prices. From July&nbsp;21, 2005, the RMB is permitted to fluctuate within a narrow and managed band against a basket
of certain foreign currencies. For the RMB against U.S. dollars, there was depreciation of approximately 6.3%, 4.4% and 2.4% in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. It is difficult
to predict how market forces or PRC or U.S. government policy may impact the exchange rate between the RMB and the U.S.&nbsp;dollar in the future. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
the extent that we need to convert U.S. dollars into RMB for capital expenditures and working capital and other business purpose, appreciation of RMB against the U.S. dollar would
have an adverse effect on the RMB amount we would receive from the conversion. Conversely, if we decide to convert RMB into U.S. dollars for the purpose of making payments for dividends on our
ordinary shares, strategic acquisitions or investments or other business purposes, appreciation of the U.S. dollar against RMB would have a negative effect on the U.S. dollar amount available to us. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition, a significant depreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar may significantly reduce the U.S. dollar equivalent of our earnings or losses. </FONT></P>

Currency Convertibility Risk  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A majority of our expenses and a significant portion of our assets and liabilities are denominated in RMB. On January&nbsp;1, 1994, the PRC
government abolished the dual rate system and introduced a single rate of exchange as quoted daily by the People's Bank of China, or PBOC. However, the unification of exchange rates does not imply
that the RMB may be readily convertible into U.S. dollars or other foreign currencies. All foreign exchange transactions continue to take place either through the PBOC or other banks authorized to buy
and sell foreign currencies at the exchange rates quoted by the PBOC. Approvals of foreign currency payments by the PBOC or other institutions

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures as of December&nbsp;31, 2016. The term "disclosure controls and procedures," as defined in Rule&nbsp;13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act means controls and other
procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company's management, including its principal
executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well-designed
and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and
procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December&nbsp;31, 2016, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. </FONT></P>

Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in
Rules&nbsp;13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions and that the degree
of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2016. In making this
assessment, management used the criteria set forth in the Internal Control&#151;Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO). </FONT></P>

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the audit of our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, we identified
a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting that related to having an insufficient number of financial reporting personnel with an appropriate level of knowledge, experience
and training in application of GAAP and SEC rules and regulations commensurate with our reporting requirements. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
2016, we implemented measures designed to improve our internal control over financial reporting to remediate this material weakness, including the
following:</FONT></P>

<UL>
<DL compact>
<DT style='font-family:times;margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2> hiring additional financial professionals with appropriate accounting and SEC reporting experience; </FONT><FONT SIZE=2>
<BR><BR></FONT></DD><DT style='font-family:times;margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2> increasing the number of qualified financial reporting personnel; </FONT><FONT SIZE=2>
<BR><BR></FONT></DD><DT style='font-family:times;margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2> improving the capabilities of existing financial reporting personnel through training and education in the accounting and reporting
requirements under GAAP and SEC rules and regulations; </FONT><FONT SIZE=2>
<BR><BR></FONT></DD><DT style='font-family:times;margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2> developing, communicating and implementing an accounting policy manual for our financial reporting personnel for recurring transactions and
period-end closing processes; and </FONT><FONT SIZE=2>
<BR><BR></FONT></DD><DT style='font-family:times;margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2> establishing effective monitoring and oversight controls for non-recurring and complex transactions to ensure the accuracy and completeness of
our condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. </FONT></DD></DL>
</UL>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
believe that the measures taken above enhanced our internal control over financial reporting and were sufficient to remediate the material weakness identified. Our independent
registered public accounting firm will first be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for our Annual Report on Form&nbsp;10-K for the first year we
are no longer an EGC under the JOBS Act. There is no guarantee that our remediation efforts will result in the attestation from our independent registered public accounting firm, if required, that our
internal control over financial reporting is effective as of December&nbsp;31, 2017. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except
as described above, there were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule&nbsp;13a-15(d) and
15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the three months ended December&nbsp;31, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>The
Board of Directors and Shareholders of BeiGene,&nbsp;Ltd. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of BeiGene,&nbsp;Ltd. (the "Company") as of December&nbsp;31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, comprehensive loss, cash flows, and shareholders' equity (deficit) for each of the three years in the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2016. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Company's internal control over financial
reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose
of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of BeiGene,&nbsp;Ltd. at
December&nbsp;31, 2016 and 2015, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2016, in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For subsidiaries whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar, the Company uses the average exchange rate for the year and the exchange
rate at the balance sheet date, to translate the operating results and financial position to U.S. dollar, the reporting currency, respectively. Translation differences are recorded in accumulated
other comprehensive income/(loss), a component of shareholders' equity/deficit. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at
the exchange rates prevailing on the transaction dates. Foreign currency denominated financial assets and liabilities are remeasured at the exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Exchange gains and losses are included in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss. </FONT></P>

which are recorded at fair value based on quoted prices in active markets with unrealized gain or loss recorded in other comprehensive income or loss. The long-term bank loan approximates
its fair value due to the fact that the related interest rate approximates the rate currently offered by financial institutions for similar debt instrument of comparable maturities. The warrants and
option liabilities were recorded at fair value as determined on the respective issuance dates and subsequently adjusted to the fair value at each reporting date. The senior promissory note and
convertible preferred shares were initially recorded at issue price net of issuance costs. Prior to the exercise dates, the Company determined the fair values of the warrants and option liabilities
with the assistance of an independent third party valuation firm. On the exercise dates, the Company determined the fair values of the warrants and option liabilities using the intrinsic value, which
equals to the difference between the share price at the IPO closing date and the exercise price, as the exercise dates were immediately prior to or very close to the IPO closing date. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company applies ASC topic 820 ("ASC 820"), </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> in measuring fair value. ASC 820 defines fair
value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires disclosures to be provided on fair value measurement. ASC 820 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the
inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level&nbsp;1&#151;Observable
inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level&nbsp;3&#151;Unobservable
inputs which are supported by little or no market activity. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ASC
820 describes three main approaches to measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities: (1)&nbsp;market approach; (2)&nbsp;income approach and (3)&nbsp;cost approach. The
market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated from market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. The income approach uses valuation techniques to
convert future amounts to a single present value amount. The measurement is based on the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts. The cost approach is based on the
amount that would currently be required to replace an asset. </FONT></P>

Revenue recognition  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company recognizes revenues from research and development collaborative arrangements when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the fee is fixed or determinable, and there is reasonable assurance that the related amounts are collectible in accordance with ASC 605, </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>Revenue Recognition</I></FONT><FONT
SIZE=2> ("ASC 605"). The Company's collaborative arrangements may contain multiple elements, including grants of licenses to intellectual
property rights, agreement to provide research and development services and other deliverables. The deliverables under such arrangements are evaluated under ASC&nbsp;605-25, </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>Multiple-Element Arrangements.</I></FONT><FONT
SIZE=2> Pursuant to ASC 605-25, each required deliverable is evaluated to determine whether it qualifies as a separate unit of
accounting based on whether the deliverable has "stand-alone value" to the customer. The collaborative arrangements do not include a right of return for any deliverable. The arrangement's
consideration that is fixed or determinable, excluding contingent payments, is then allocated to each separate unit of accounting based on the relative selling price of each deliverable. The relative
selling price for each deliverable is determined using vendor specific objective evidence ("VSOE") of selling price or third party evidence ("TPE") of selling price if VSOE does not exist. If neither
VSOE nor TPE exists, the Company uses the best estimate of the selling price ("BESP") for the deliverable. In general, the consideration allocated to each unit of accounting is recognized as the
related goods or services are delivered, limited to the consideration that is not contingent upon future deliverables. Non-refundable payments received before all of the relevant criteria for revenue
recognition are satisfied are recorded as advances from customers. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upfront
non-refundable payments for licensing the Company's intellectual property are evaluated to determine if the licensee can obtain stand-alone value from the license separate from
the value of the research and development services and other deliverables in the arrangement to be provided by the Company. The Company acts as the principal under its arrangements and licensing
intellectual property is part of its ongoing major or central operations. The license right is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items or meeting other specified performance conditions.
Therefore, when stand-alone value of the license is determinable, the allocated consideration is recognized as collaboration revenue upon delivery of the license rights. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
the Company acts as the principal under its arrangements, and research and development services are also part of its ongoing major or central operations, it recognizes the allocated
consideration related to reimbursements of research and development costs as collaboration revenue when delivery or performance of such services occurs. </FONT></P>

Under ASC 605-28, </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Milestone Method of Revenue Recognition,</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> an accounting policy election can be made to recognize a payment that is
contingent upon the achievement of a substantive milestone in its entirety in the period in which the milestone is achieved. The Company elected not to adopt the milestone method of revenue
recognition under ASC 605-28. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Targets
related to the Company's development-based activities may include initiation of various phases of clinical trials and applications and acceptance for product approvals by
regulatory agencies. Due to the uncertainty involved in meeting these development-based targets, the Company would account for development-based targets as collaboration revenue upon achievement of
the respective development target. Royalties based on reported sales of licensed products will be recognized as collaboration
revenue based on contract terms when reported sales are reliably measurable and collectability is reasonably assured. Targets related to commercial activities may be triggered upon events such as
first commercial sale of a product or when sales first achieve a defined level. Since these targets would be achieved after the completion of the Company's development activities, the Company would
account for the commercial event targets in the same manner as royalties, with collaboration revenue recognized upon achievement of the target. To date, none of the products have been approved. Hence,
no revenue has been recognized related to royalties or commercial event based targets in any of the periods presented. Any subsequent payments to be made to the collaborator such as profit sharing
payments based on net sales that are not related to research and development services would be recorded as expenses from the collaborative arrangement. To date, no payments have been made to the
collaborator. </FONT></P>

Research and development expenses  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research and development expenses represent costs associated with the collaborative arrangements, which primarily include (i)&nbsp;payroll and
related costs (including share-based compensation) associated with research and development personnel, (ii)&nbsp;costs related to clinical trials and preclinical testing of the Company's
technologies under development, (iii)&nbsp;costs to develop the product candidates, including raw materials and supplies, product testing, depreciation, and facility related expenses,
(iv)&nbsp;expenses for research services provided by universities and contract laboratories, including sponsored research funding, and (v)&nbsp;other research and development expenses. Research
and development expenses are charged to expense as incurred when these expenditures relate to the Company's research and development services and have no alternative future uses. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clinical
trial costs are a significant component of the Company's research and development expenses. The Company has a history of contracting with third parties that perform various
clinical trial activities on behalf of the Company in the ongoing development of the Company's product candidates. Expenses related to clinical trials are accrued based on the Company's estimates of
the actual services performed by the third parties for the respective period. If the contracted amounts are modified (for instance, as a result of changes in the clinical trial protocol or scope of
work to be performed), the Company will modify the related accruals accordingly on a prospective basis. Revisions in the scope of a contract are charged to expense in the period in which the facts
that give rise to the revision become reasonably certain. There were no material adjustments for a change in estimate to research and development expenses in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. </FONT></P>

Leases  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leases are classified at the inception date as either a capital lease or an operating lease. The Company assesses a lease to be a capital lease
if any of the following conditions exist: a)&nbsp;ownership is transferred to the lessee by the end of the lease term, b)&nbsp;there is a bargain purchase option, c)&nbsp;the lease term is at
least 75% of the property's estimated remaining economic life or d)&nbsp;the present value of the minimum lease payments at the beginning of the lease term is 90% or more of the fair value of the
leased property to the lessor at the inception date. A capital lease is accounted for as if there was an acquisition of an asset and an incurrence of an obligation at the inception of the lease. The
Company has no capital leases for the years presented. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All
other leases are accounted for as operating leases wherein rental payments are expensed on a straight-line basis over the periods of their respective lease terms. The Company leases
office space, employee accommodation and manufactory space under operating lease agreements. Certain of the lease agreements contain rent holidays. Rent holidays are considered in determining the
straight-line
rent expense to be recorded over the lease term. The lease term begins on the date of initial possession of the lease property for purposes of recognizing lease expense on straight-line basis over the
term of the lease. </FONT></P>

statements based on their grant date fair values. Specifically, the grant date fair value of share options are calculated using an option pricing model. The Company has elected to recognize
compensation expense using the straight-line method for all employee equity awards granted with graded vesting based on service conditions provided that the amount of compensation cost recognized at
any date is at least equal to the portion of the grant-date value of the options that are vested at that date. The Company uses the accelerated method for all awards granted with graded vesting based
on performance conditions. To the extent the required vesting conditions are not met resulting in the forfeiture of the share-based awards, previously recognized compensation expense relating to those
awards are reversed. ASC 718 requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in the subsequent period if actual forfeitures differ from initial estimates. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forfeiture
rates are estimated based on historical and future expectations of employee turnover rates and are adjusted to reflect future changes in circumstances and facts, if any.
Share-based compensation expense is recorded net of estimated forfeitures such that expense is recorded only for those share-based awards that are expected to vest. To the extent the Company revises
these estimates in the future, the share-based payments could be materially impacted in the period of revision, as well as in following periods. The Company, with the assistance of an independent
third party valuation firm, determined the fair value of the stock options granted to employees. The binomial option pricing model was applied in determining the estimated fair value of the options
granted to employees. </FONT></P>

All transactions in which goods or services are received in exchange for equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the

which the counterparty's performance is completed as there is no associated performance commitment. The expense is recognized in the same manner as if the Company had paid cash for the services

measured as the excess, if any, of the fair value of the modified award over the fair value of the original award immediately before its terms are modified, measured based on the fair value of the
awards and other pertinent factors at the modification date. For vested awards, the Company recognizes incremental compensation cost in the period the modification occurs. For unvested awards, the

date. If the fair value of the modified award is lower </FONT></P>

accounting. Changes in fair values of derivatives not qualified as hedges are reported in the consolidated statements of operations. The estimated fair values of derivative instruments are determined
at discrete points in time based on the relevant market information. These estimates are calculated with reference to the market rates using industry standard valuation techniques with the assistance
of an independent third party valuation firm. </FONT></P>

Income taxes  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company uses the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined
based on the differences between the financial reporting and the tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are
expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
November 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-17, </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, which requires
deferred income tax assets and liabilities to be classified as non-current in a classified balance sheet, and eliminates the prior guidance, which required an entity to separate deferred tax assets
and liabilities into a current amount and a non-current amount in a classified balance sheet. The Company changed the manner in which it classifies deferred tax assets and liabilities retrospectively
from the fourth quarter of 2016 due to the early adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2015-17. The adoption of this guidance has no impact on prior year balances as current deferred tax assets and
liabilities are both nil as of December&nbsp;31, 2015. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company evaluates its uncertain tax positions using the provisions of ASC 740, </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Income Taxes</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, which requires that realization of an
uncertain income tax position be recognized in the financial statements. The benefit to be recorded in the financial statements is the amount most likely to be realized assuming a review by tax
authorities having all relevant information and applying current conventions. It is the Company's policy to recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, if any, as a
component of income tax expense. </FONT></P>

number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period using the two-class method. Under the two-class method, net income is allocated between ordinary shares and participating securities
based on dividends declared (or accumulated) and participating rights in undistributed earnings as if all the earnings for the reporting period had been distributed. The Company's convertible
preferred shares and restricted stock are participating securities because they have contractual rights to share in the profits of the Company. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However,
both the convertible preferred shares and restricted stock do not have contractual rights and obligations to share in the losses of the Company. For the periods presented
herein, the computation of basic loss per share using the two-class method is not applicable as the Company is in a net loss position. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diluted
loss per share is calculated by dividing net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders as adjusted for the effect of dilutive ordinary equivalent shares, if any, by the weighted
average number of ordinary and dilutive ordinary equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Ordinary equivalent shares consist of the ordinary shares issuable upon the conversion of the
Company's convertible preferred shares using the if-converted method, and ordinary shares issuable upon the conversion of the share options and unvested restricted stock, using the treasury stock
method. Ordinary share equivalents are excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share if their effects would be anti-dilutive. Basic and diluted loss per ordinary share is presented in the
Company's consolidated statements of operations. </FONT></P>

PBOC or other banks authorized to buy and sell foreign currencies at the exchange rates quoted by the PBOC. Approvals of foreign currency payments by the PBOC or other institutions require submitting

the extent that the Company needs to convert U.S. dollar into RMB for capital expenditures and working capital and other business purposes, appreciation of RMB against U.S. dollar

dividends on ordinary shares, strategic acquisitions or investments or other business purposes, appreciation of U.S. dollar against RMB would have a negative effect on the U.S. dollar amount available

receivables, net investments in leases, off balance sheet credit exposures, reinsurance receivables, and any other financial assets not excluded from the scope that have the contractual right to
receive cash. For public business entities that are U.S. SEC filers, ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years.

maturities of all debt securities as of December&nbsp;31, 2016 were within one year. The Company does not intend to sell its investments in U.S. Treasury securities and it
is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the investment before recovery of its amortized cost basis, which may be maturity. Therefore, the Company does not consider the
investment in U.S. Treasury securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired at December&nbsp;31, 2016. </FONT></P>

 <P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During
2016, there is an increase in the valuation allowance by $1,627 which included the effect of expired net operating losses of $1,466. Valuation allowances have been provided on
deferred tax assets where, based on all available evidence, it was considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods.
The Company recorded a full valuation allowance against deferred tax assets related to net operating losses, and recorded a valuation allowance against the portion of the deferred tax assets related
to deductible temporary differences. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
of December&nbsp;31, 2016, the Company had net operating losses of approximately $27,948 derived from entities in the PRC, which can be carried forward to offset future net profit
for income tax purposes. The net operating loss in PRC entities will expire, if unused, beginning January&nbsp;1, 2018 through 2022. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No
unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties were recorded in any of the periods presented. The Company's management does not expect the amount of unrecognized tax
benefits would increase significantly in the next 12&nbsp;months. In general, the PRC tax authorities have up to five years to conduct examinations of the Company's tax filings. Accordingly, the PRC
subsidiaries' tax years 2012 through 2016 remain open to examination by the respective taxing authorities. </FONT></P>

promissory notes, and related warrants to purchase the Company's preference shares up to 10% of the convertible promissory notes' principal amount concurrently for an aggregate principal amount of
$2,410. The warrants were freestanding instruments and were recorded as liabilities in accordance with ASC480. The warrants were initially
recognized at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value recorded in losses. In January 2016 and February 2016, the warrants issued in connection with the promissory notes were exercised for
621,637 Preferred Shares, which were then converted into 621,637 ordinary shares. As the exercise dates were very close to the IPO closing date, the respective exercise date fair value of the warrants
of $1,148 was determined based on the intrinsic value, which equaled the difference between the share price at the IPO closing date and the exercise price of the issued warrants. For the years ended
December&nbsp;31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company recognized a loss from the increase in fair value of $363, $563 and $127, respectively. </FONT></P>

Company's rights to a PRC patent on a drug candidate. The loan principal amounts of $8,642 and $8,642 are repayable on September&nbsp;30, 2018 and 2019, respectively. Interest expense recognized for
the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2016 and 2015 amounted to $851 and $140, respectively. </FONT></P>

10. Senior promissory note  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February&nbsp;2, 2011, the Company issued a senior promissory note to Merck Sharp&nbsp;&amp; Dohme Research&nbsp;GmbH ("Merck Sharp"), an entity that is unaffiliated with Merck
KGaA, Darmstadt Germany, with a principal amount of $10,000 (the "Senior Promissory Note"). The Senior Promissory Note bore interest of 8% compounding per annum and had a term of five years. The
Company had the option to elect to repay in whole or in part the outstanding principal and accrued interest any time prior to the maturity of the Senior Promissory Note. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Senior Promissory Note was initially recorded as a long-term liability carried at its amortized cost of $10,000 and subsequently accreted to the amount payable upon maturity using
the effective interest method. Interest accrued as of December&nbsp;31, 2016 and 2015 amounted to nil and $4,598, respectively. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
January&nbsp;26, 2016, the Company entered into a note amendment and exchange agreement with Merck Sharp, pursuant to which, the maturity date of the Senior Promissory Note was

2016 from February&nbsp;2, 2016. In addition, if the IPO occurred on or prior to May&nbsp;2, 2016, subject to certain limitations, the outstanding unpaid principal and interest of
the Senior Promissory Note as of the effectiveness date of the Company's IPO (the "Exchanged Balance") would be automatically exchanged, effective immediately prior to the closing of the IPO, into up
to a number of the Company's ordinary shares equal to the quotient of (1)&nbsp;the Exchanged Balance divided by (2)&nbsp;the per ordinary share public offering price in the IPO. The amendments and
subsequent extinguishment of the Senior Promissory Note did not result in any gain or loss since the conversion rate was set at the IPO Price. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
February&nbsp;8, 2016, the outstanding unpaid principal and interest of the Senior Promissory Note of carrying value of $14,693 were exchanged into 7,942,314 ordinary shares,

ordinary shares. The conversion option of the convertible preferred shares did not qualify for bifurcation accounting because the conversion option is clearly and closely related to the host
instrument and the underlying ordinary shares were not publicly traded nor readily convertible into cash. The contingent redemption options of the convertible preferred shares did not qualify for
bifurcation accounting because the underlying ordinary shares were neither publicly traded nor readily convertible into cash. There were no other embedded derivatives that are required to be
bifurcated. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneficial
conversion features exist when the conversion price of the convertible preferred shares is lower than the fair value of the ordinary shares at the commitment date, which is
the issuance date in the Company's case. When a beneficial conversion feature exists as of the commitment date, its intrinsic value is bifurcated from the carrying value of the convertible preferred
shares as a contribution to additional paid-in capital. On the commitment date of Series&nbsp;A Preferred Shares and Series&nbsp;A-2 Preferred Shares, the most favorable conversion price used to
measure the beneficial conversion feature were $0.68 and $1.17, respectively. No beneficial conversion feature was recognized for the Series&nbsp;A Preferred Shares and Series&nbsp;A-2 Preferred
Shares as the fair value per ordinary share at the commitment date were $0.28 and $0.47, respectively, which was less than the most favorable conversion price. The Company determined the fair value of
ordinary shares with the assistance of an independent third party valuation firm. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has developed and controls certain technology and proprietary materials related to its proprietary BRAF inhibitor ("BRAF" or "BGB-283") and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase
inhibitor ("PARP" or "BGB-290"). Upon execution of the Collaborative Arrangements, the Company granted to Merck KGaA, Darmstadt Germany the exclusive right to develop and commercialize the BRAF and
PARP inhibitors worldwide except the PRC ("Ex-PRC"). The Company has since retained the exclusive right to develop and commercialize the BRAF and PARP inhibitors in the PRC, as further described
below. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
2013, the Company entered into a license agreement with Merck KGaA, Darmstadt Germany on the BRAF inhibitor, which was amended and restated in 2013 and 2015, in which it granted to
Merck KGaA, Darmstadt Germany an exclusive license to development and manufacture the BRAF inhibitor in the ex-PRC Territory, and Merck KGaA Darmstadt Germany granted the Company an exclusive license
to develop, manufacture and commercialize the BRAF inhibitor in the PRC Territory. Under the terms of the BRAF Collaborative Arrangements, the Company received an upfront non-refundable
payment and upfront Phase&nbsp;1 research and development fees in 2013. Upon the dosing of the 5th&nbsp;patient in 2014, the Company received an additional Phase&nbsp;1 research and development
fee. Subsequent to the completion of the Phase&nbsp;1 research and development phase, the Company was eligible to receive product development payments based on the successful achievement of
development and regulatory goals, commercial event payments based on the successful achievement of commercialization goals, and royalty payments based on a predetermined percentage of Merck KGaA,
Darmstadt Germany's aggregate annual net sales of all products in the Ex-PRC territories for a period not to exceed ten years from the date of the first commercial sale. In March 2017, the Company
regained the worldwide rights to the BRAF inhibitor after Merck KGaA, Darmstadt Germany informed the Company that it will not exercise the Continuation Option, and thus, the ex-PRC BRAF Agreement has
terminated in its entirety, except for certain provisions that will survive the termination. In addition, the Company is eligible for $14,000 of additional payments upon the successful achievement of
pre-specified milestones in the PRC territory. In consideration for the licenses Merck KGaA, Darmstadt Germany grants to the Company, it will pay Merck KGaA, Darmstadt Germany a high single-digit
royalty on aggregate annual net sales of BGB-283 products in PRC for a period not to exceed ten years from the date of the first commercial sale. </FONT></P>

any time during the period from October&nbsp;1, 2015 until the first regulatory approval received for the commercialization of the Company's PARP inhibitor in certain major countries. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company determined that the deliverables related to the collaboration with Merck KGaA, Darmstadt Germany, including the licenses of exclusive rights granted to Merck KGaA, Darmstadt
Germany, as well as the Company's performance obligations to provide Phase&nbsp;1 research and development services, would be accounted for as separate units of accounting. This determination was
made because each deliverable has stand-alone value to Merck KGaA, Darmstadt Germany and the arrangement does not include a right of return for any deliverable. The Company recognized the upfront
non-refundable license fee upon the delivery of the license right and the reimbursement of the Phase&nbsp;1 research and development services on a straight-line basis over the performance period
ranging from one to three years from the execution date of the respective collaboration arrangements. The Company has made an allocation of revenue recognized as collaboration revenue between the
license and the services. This allocation was based upon the relative selling price determined using the BESP of each deliverable. Management utilized a discounted cash-flow model and considered a
variety of factors in determining the best estimate of selling price of each deliverable, including, but not limited to: the rights that Merck KGaA, Darmstadt Germany was granted under the license,
the early stage of the product candidates, the relative risks of successful development of the product candidates, the size of the potential market for the product candidates, competing products and
the life-cycle of the product candidates. There have been no significant changes in either the selling price or the method or assumptions used to determine the selling price for a specific unit of
accounting during any of the periods presented. </FONT></P>

Company did not elect the milestone method of revenue recognition under ASC 605-28. Therefore, the additional Phase&nbsp;1 research and development fees related to the
5th&nbsp;patient dosing were combined with the other consideration received in the arrangement, being the license and Phase&nbsp;1 research and development reimbursements. Based on the above, the
additional fee related to the </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>5th&nbsp;patient
dosing was allocated based on the relative selling price percentages determined for the separate units of account at the inception of the Collaborative Arrangements. Upon completion
of the 5th&nbsp;patient dosing, the fee allocated to the license was recognized immediately and the fee allocated to research and development reimbursements was recognized on a straight-line basis
over the performance period under the cumulative catch-up approach. The 5th&nbsp;patient dosing was completed, and the Company received $5,000 for BRAF and $9,000 for PARP on May&nbsp;14, 2014 and
September&nbsp;17, 2014, respectively. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
repurchase consideration of $10,000 associated with the reacquisition of the rights to the PARP inhibitor was charged to research and development expenses as incurred because the
rights have no alternative future use. As Merck KGaA, Darmstadt Germany has no further rights in the Ex-PRC territories under the PARP Collaborative Agreements, the advances previously received from
Merck KGaA, Darmstadt Germany amounting to $3,018 were offset against the aforementioned repurchase consideration. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon
achievement of a 5th&nbsp;patient dosing development based target in the PRC territory under the BRAF Collaborative Arrangements on November&nbsp;12, 2015, the Company
recognized $4,000 of research and development revenue. No other development based targets have been achieved and none of the products have been approved. Hence, no revenue has been recognized related
to royalties or
commercial event based targets in any of the periods presented. In addition, no payments have been made to the collaborator for any of the periods presented. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition to the collaboration with Merck KGaA, Darmstadt Germany, the Company also provided research and development services to other customers in the PRC amounting to nil, nil and

2016 Share option and incentive plan  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On January&nbsp;14, 2016, in connection with the IPO, the board of directors and shareholders of the Company approved the 2016 Share Option
and Incentive Plan (the "2016 Plan"), which became effective on February&nbsp;2, 2016. The Company initially reserved 65,029,595 ordinary shares for the issuance of awards under the 2016 Plan plus
any shares available under the 2011 Plan and not subject to any outstanding options as of the effective date of the 2016 Plan. The 2016 Plan provides for an annual increase in the shares available for
issuance thereunder, to be added on the first day of each fiscal year, beginning with the year ending December&nbsp;31, 2017 and continuing until the expiration of the 2016 Plan, equal to the lesser
of (i)&nbsp;five percent (5%) of the outstanding shares of the Company's common stock on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year or (ii)&nbsp;such number of shares determined by the
board of director or the compensation committee. This number is subject to adjustment in the event of a share split, share dividend or other change in the Company's capitalization. In addition,
options cancelled or forfeited under the 2011 Plan will also be available for issuance under the 2016 Plan. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During
the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, the Company granted 15,663,600 and 3,766,000 options to employees, as well as 1,950,000 and 125,000 options to non-employees

<U>Modification</U>  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October&nbsp;1, 2015 ("Modification Date"), a consultant surrendered 1,000,000 options in exchange for a reduction of the vesting period
("Modified Option Agreement"). The fair value of the options immediately after the modification was higher than that immediately before the modification. The total incremental compensation cost for
the modification of $81 was recognized on Modification Date. Subsequently, on November&nbsp;1, 2015 ("Date of the Change in Employment Status"), the consultant became an employee of the Company.
Under the terms of the Modified Option Agreement, the individual retains the same vesting terms; hence, there is no modification to account for. The fair value of the options to the consultant has
been re-measured on the Date of the Change in Employment Status and compensation charges have been accounted for prospectively over the remaining vesting period. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon
the completion of the Company's IPO on February&nbsp;8, 2016, a consultant became a member of the Company's board of directors. Under the terms of the original option agreement,
the individual retains the option grants on a change in status; hence, there is no modification to account for. The fair value of the options granted by the Company to the consultant has been
re-measured as of February&nbsp;8, 2016 and compensation charges have been accounted for prospectively over the remaining vesting period. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There
were no other modifications to the Company's share option arrangements for the periods presented. </FONT></P>

<U>Fair value of options</U>  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The binomial option-pricing model was applied in determining the estimated fair value of the options granted. The model requires the input of
highly subjective assumptions including the estimated expected stock price volatility and, the exercise multiple for which employees are likely to exercise share options. For expected volatilities,
the trading history and observation period of the Company's own share price movement has not been long enough to match the life of the share option. Therefore, the Company has made reference to the
historical price volatilities of ordinary shares of several comparable companies in the same industry as the Company. For the exercise multiple, the Company was not able to develop an exercise pattern
as reference, thus the exercise multiple is based on management's estimation, which the Company believes is representative of the future exercise pattern of the options. The risk-free rate for periods
within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury Bills yield curve in effect at the time of grant. Prior to the completion of the Company's initial public offering, the
estimated fair value of the ordinary shares, at the option grant dates, was determined with assistance from an independent third party valuation firm, and the Company's management was ultimately
responsible for the determination of the estimated fair value of its ordinary shares. With the completion of the Company's initial public offering, a public trading market for the ADSs has been
established, it is no longer necessary for the Company to estimate the fair value of ordinary shares at the option grant dates. </FONT></P>

18. Restricted net assets  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company's ability to pay dividends may depend on the Company receiving distributions of funds from its PRC subsidiaries. Relevant PRC statutory laws and regulations permit payments
of dividends by the Company's PRC subsidiaries only out of its retained earnings, if any, as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. The results of operations reflected
in the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP differ from those reflected in the statutory financial statements of the Company's PRC subsidiaries. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
accordance with the company law of the PRC, a domestic enterprise is required to provide statutory reserves of at least 10% of its annual after-tax profit until such reserve has
reached 50% of its respective registered capital based on the enterprise's PRC statutory accounts. A domestic enterprise is also required to provide discretionary surplus reserve, at the discretion of
the Board of Directors, from the profits determined in accordance with the enterprise's PRC statutory accounts. The aforementioned reserves can only be used for specific purposes and are not
distributable as cash dividends. The Company's PRC subsidiaries were established as domestic invested enterprises and therefore were subject to the above mentioned restrictions on distributable
profits. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During
the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, no appropriation to statutory reserves was made because the PRC subsidiaries had substantial losses during such periods. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
a result of these PRC laws and regulations including the requirement to make annual appropriations of at least 10% of after-tax income and set aside as general reserve fund prior to
payment of dividends, the Company's PRC subsidiaries are restricted in their ability to transfer a portion of their net assets to the Company. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign
exchange and other regulation in the PRC may further restrict the Company's PRC subsidiaries from transferring funds to the Company in the form of dividends, loans and advances.
As of December&nbsp;31, 2016 and 2015, amounts restricted are the net assets of the Company's PRC subsidiaries, which amounted to $9,955 and $3,383, respectively. </FONT></P>

19. Employee defined contribution plan  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full time employees of the Company in the PRC participate in a government mandated defined contribution plan, pursuant to which certain pension benefits, medical care, employee housing
fund and other welfare benefits are provided to employees. Chinese labor regulations require that the Company's PRC subsidiaries make contributions to the government for these benefits based on
certain percentages of the employees' salaries. The Company has no legal obligation for the benefits beyond the
contributions made. The total amounts for such employee benefits, which were expensed as incurred, were $2,148, $1,443 and $1,030 for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2016, 2015 and 2014,
respectively. During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016, the Company implemented a defined contribution 401(k) savings plan (the "401(k) Plan") for U.S. employees. The 401(k) Plan covers all U.S.
employees, and allows participants to defer a portion of their annual compensation on a pretax basis. In addition, the Company implemented a matching contribution to the 401(k) Plan, matching 50% of
an employee's contribution up to a maximum of 3% of the participant's compensation. Company contributions to the 401(k) plan totaled $0.1&nbsp;million in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016. The

prepaid or converted in full or partially into a mid-single digit percentage equity interest in the JV&nbsp;Company prior to its maturity date pursuant to the terms of the JV Agreement upon the
achievement of certain regulatory milestones. The Shareholder Loan can only be used for the JV&nbsp;Company, including the construction and operation of the biologics manufacturing facility and
research and development and clinical trials to be carried out by the JV Company. If the JV Company does not use the Shareholder Loan proceeds for the specified purposes, GET may be entitled to
certain liquidated damages. In the event of an early termination of the JV Agreement, the Shareholder Loan will become due and payable at the time of termination of the JV Agreement. Under the terms
of the Capital Increase Agreement, BeiGene HK will contribute RMB200,000 as cash capital contributions over a three-year period commencing March&nbsp;31, 2017. GET will contribute its full cash
contribution, including the Shareholder Loan, not later than March&nbsp;31, 2017. </FONT></P>

JV Company will establish a biologics manufacturing facility in Guangzhou (the "Factory") through a wholly-owned subsidiary (the "Factory Sub") to manufacture biologics, with a
registered capital of RMB1,000,000. The Factory Sub expects to acquire at least 100,000 square meters of land for the Factory in the Sino-Singapore Guangzhou Knowledge City and borrow RMB1,000,000 in
the form of a commercial bank loan for the purpose of the construction and operation of the Factory and expects to receive certain interest subsidies for commercial loan interest payment(s), subject
to limitation. </FONT></P>
