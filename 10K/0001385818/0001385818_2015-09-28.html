<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are a specialty healthcare company concentrating on developing and commercializing products with an initial focus on urological conditions. We are focused
primarily on the urological disorders market and initially sexual dysfunction, urological cancers and male infertility. We are currently focused on commercializing our ProstaScint<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> product,
which we plan to launch through a focused commercial infrastructure in the U.S. while developing corporate relationships outside the U.S. to launch ProstaScint in major healthcare markets around the world. We acquired ProstaScint in May 2015 from
Jazz Pharmaceuticals. ProstaScint, which is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, is a marketed biologic imaging agent specifically indicated for the diagnostic staging of prostate cancer patients. We plan to launch the RedoxSYS<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> oxidation-reduction potential system, or the RedoxSYS System, into the global research market while developing numerous clinical applications for this potential first-in-class diagnostic device,
including an application for the detection of infertility in semen. We have developed a RedoxSYS product line extension called MiOXSYS&#153; intended for use in male infertility assessment, for which this product is undergoing clinical studies.
Further, we are entering late-stage development of our lead therapeutic candidate, Zertane, which is being studied in premature ejaculation. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our product
candidate Zertane is in clinical development for the treatment of premature ejaculation. The premature ejaculation market in the U.S. and Europe is expected to reach over $1.3 billion in annual sales by 2017, representing a projected increase of
10.3% from 2010. According to recent published analyses, premature ejaculation, or PE, is a highly prevalent male sexual dysfunction affecting 20-30% of men worldwide. Based on internal market research and published reports, we believe that PE is up
to 1.5-times more prevalent than erectile dysfunction, or ED. Currently, there are no FDA-approved prescription products in the United States to treat PE, and to our knowledge, only two other prescription products have been approved elsewhere in the
world. Treatment options for PE have traditionally included antidepressant drugs prescribed &#147;off label,&#148; topical numbing medications, and cognitive behavior therapy or counseling, all of which have had limited effectiveness in treating the
disorder. PE therefore represents an area of significant unmet medical need. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">By virtue of our recent acquisition of ProstaScint, we are now commercial
stage and generating sales for this FDA-approved prostate cancer imaging agent. As prostate cancer is a condition commonly diagnosed and treated by urologists, ProstaScint complements our urology-focused product pipeline. Prostate cancer is the most
common cancer among men in the United States, with an estimated 218,000 annual cases (as of 2010). Further, more than 2,200,000 men were alive with some history of prostate cancer in 2006, and over 30,000 U.S. men die each year from the disease. The
effect of prostate cancer on healthcare economics is substantial, which makes the need for accurate disease staging critical for treatment and management strategies. The U.S. market for the diagnosis and screening of prostate cancer is expected to
total $17.4 billion by 2017, compound annual growth rate, or CAGR of 7.5%. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are actively developing the global market for the RedoxSYS System across a
range of applications. Specifically, we have begun commercializing RedoxSYS System for research use through direct selling, distribution partners, and academic collaborators. Over the past 18 months, we have engaged in over 60 trials around the
world whereby prominent researchers are implementing oxidation-reduction potential as a marker in both chronic and acute illnesses and disorders in both clinical research as well as basic science research. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Through our extensive network of researchers, the RedoxSYS System has demonstrated the potential to have broad clinical applications. Studies are now underway
at a major U.S. university in the area of male infertility. Thus, we have developed the MiOXSYS System to uniquely detect oxidation-reduction potential in semen specimens. Male infertility is prevalent, underserved, and oxidative stress is widely
implicated in its pathophysiology. The global male infertility market is expected to grow to over $300 million by 2020 with a CAGR of nearly 5% from 2013 to 2020. Oxidative stress is broadly implicated in the pathophysiology of oxidative stress, yet
very few diagnostic tools exist to effectively measure oxidative stress levels in men. However, antioxidants are widely available and recommended to infertile men. With the introduction of the MiOXSYS System, we believe for the first time there will
be an easy and effective diagnostic tool to assess degree of oxidative stress, sperm motility and morphology, and potentially enabling the monitoring of patients&#146; responses to antioxidant therapy as a treatment regimen for infertility. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The technology underpinning the RedoxSYS and MiOXSYS systems was developed by Luoxis Diagnostics, Inc. in the two years immediately preceding the merger
between Luoxis, Vyrix Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and us (under our former name of Rosewind Corporation) in April 2015. Upon the consummation of the merger, the RedoxSYS System and MiOXSYS System became our assets. Prior to the incorporation of Luoxis,
the predecessor technologies that are now incorporated into these products were developed by the research team of Dr.&nbsp;David Bar-Or when he was at DMI BioSciences, Inc. and subsequently at Ampio Pharmaceuticals, Inc. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We were incorporated as Rosewind Corporation on August&nbsp;9, 2002 in the State of Colorado. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Vyrix Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Vyrix, was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on November&nbsp;18, 2013 and was wholly owned by Ampio
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NYSE MKT: AMPE), or Ampio, immediately prior to the completion of the Merger (defined below). Vyrix was previously a carve-out of the sexual dysfunction therapeutics business, including the late-stage men&#146;s health product
candidates, Zertane and Zertane-ED, from Ampio, which carve out was announced in December 2013. Luoxis Diagnostics, Inc., or Luoxis, was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on January&nbsp;24, 2013 and was majority owned by Ampio
immediately prior to the completion of the Merger. Luoxis was focused on initially developing and advancing the RedoxSYS System. The MiOXSYS System was developed following the completed development of the RedoxSYS System. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On March&nbsp;20, 2015, Rosewind formed Rosewind Merger Sub V, Inc. and Rosewind Merger Sub L, Inc., each a wholly-owned subsidiary formed for the purpose of
the Merger, and on April&nbsp;16, 2015, Rosewind Merger Sub V, Inc. merged with and into Vyrix and Rosewind Merger Sub L, Inc. merged with and into Luoxis, and Vyrix and Luoxis became subsidiaries of Rosewind. Immediately thereafter, Vyrix and
Luoxis merged with and into Rosewind with Rosewind as the surviving corporation (herein referred to as the Merger). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Concurrent with the closing of the
Merger, Rosewind abandoned its pre-merger business plans to develop a sailing school, and we now solely pursue the specialty healthcare market, focusing on urological related conditions, including the business of Vyrix and Luoxis. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On June&nbsp;8, 2015, we (i)&nbsp;reincorporated as a domestic Delaware corporation under Delaware General Corporate Law and changed our name from Rosewind
Corporation to Aytu BioScience, Inc., and (ii)&nbsp;effected a reverse stock split in which each common stock holder received one share of common stock for each every 12.174 shares outstanding (herein referred to as the Reverse Stock Split). All
share and per share amounts in this Annual Report have been adjusted to reflect the effect of the Reverse Stock Split. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Products </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Zertane for Premature Ejaculation </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our premature
ejaculation product candidate, Zertane, is a specifically formulated orally disintegrating tablet, or ODT, of tramadol hydrochloride patented for the on-demand treatment of PE. Zertane is being developed utilizing a regulatory pathway pursuant to
Section&nbsp;505(b)(2) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended, or the FDCA, as the active ingredient is already well characterized for the treatment of pain, and we are relying on the FDA&#146;s finding of safety of tramadol hydrochloride to
support its use in a new indication, PE, at a lower dose. If we receive marketing approval for Zertane, we believe it will be the first commercial product approved by the FDA for PE. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Effective August&nbsp;18, 2014 the Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA, began classifying tramadol as a Schedule IV substance, including its salts,
isomers, and salts of isomers. Tramadol has a low potential for abuse relative to the drugs or substances in Schedule III and has a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the U.S. for moderate to moderately severe pain. We expect the same
classification for Zertane regardless of the indication, including premature ejaculation. As a result of this classification, manufacturers are required to print &#147;C-IV&#148; on the labeling of commercial containers of tramadol. It is unclear as
to what extent the FDA and/or the DEA would expect manufacturers of tramadol-containing products to further control its distribution or monitor its use. However, we do not expect this classification to adversely affect the commercial potential for
Zertane considering that tramadol has a long history of use and a low potential for abuse. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The method of use patents covering the use of tramadol for
premature ejaculation were originally developed and held by Ampio (our parent predecessor company). However, these patents and all related intellectual property were assigned to Vyrix when it was established as an Ampio subsidiary. Following the
Merger of Vyrix, Luoxis and us, the patents were transferred and are now solely owned by us. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>ProstaScint for Prostate Cancer Imaging </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A key part of our strategy is to identify, acquire, license, or otherwise promote marketed, complementary urology assets in order to establish a commercial
footprint and generate revenues for already-approved or near-term medical products. To that end we acquired ProstaScint from Jazz Pharmaceuticals shortly after the Merger. ProstaScint received FDA approval on October&nbsp;28, 1996 and was initially
marketed by Cytogen Corporation. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">ProstaScint (capromab pendetide) is a radio-labeled monoclonal antibody, which is a biologic product that targets a
specific antigen. ProstaScint targets Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA), a protein uniquely expressed by prostate tissue. Indium (In 111) is attached to the proprietary, mouse-derived antibody. The radiolabeled antibody is infused into the
patient and is taken up </P>

by prostate cancer cells which can be detected and visualized with single-photon emission tomography (SPECT). ProstaScint has been shown to be clinically effective in determining the course of
treatment for a patient who has had a prostatectomy and/or has suspected metastasis (spread of the cancer cells beyond the prostate). Further, ProstaScint has demonstrated efficacy in newly diagnosed patients classified as high-risk or with
recurrent prostate cancer. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Multiple clinical studies have been conducted in the United States and published in peer-reviewed publications. These studies
consistently demonstrate substantial clinical efficacy of ProstaScint in staging prostate cancer patients and specifically identifying whether the cancer is confined to the prostate or has metastasized to other parts of the body. Through more
accurate clinical staging and identification of metastatic prostate cancer, clinicians are able to better direct therapeutic interventions and improve outcomes. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>RedoxSYS System for Research Use </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We completed the
development of the RedoxSYS System during the two years preceding the Merger. In 2014, we received ISO 13485 certification, demonstrating our compliance with global quality standards in medical device manufacturing. This enables the launch of the
RedoxSYS System into the research market around the world. We also received a CE marking in Europe and Health Canada clearance to begin the market development of the RedoxSYS System as a clinical diagnostic in Europe, Canada, and elsewhere around
the world where CE marking is recognized. We launched sales efforts into the research market in late 2014 and since that time have already placed the RedoxSYS System at a number of prominent research centers in the United States, Europe, Israel,
Japan, Taiwan, Singapore and Korea. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>MiOXSYS System for Male Infertility </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As part of our strategy to develop future clinical applications of the RedoxSYS System, we have conducted initial studies in male reproductive health. Male
infertility is a significant medical condition in which oxidative stress is well known to play a substantial role. As such, we believe developing a clinical application to assess oxidative stress levels with the uniquely designed and programmed
MiOXSYS System for semen analysis represents a significant commercial opportunity. Oxidative stress is well established as a leading contributing factor to male infertility. Further, a significant proportion of male infertility remains unexplained
in part because of the lack of standardized tests available to clinicians and researchers to assess oxidative stress in semen and seminal plasma. This lack of standardization has resulted in poor implementation of semen and plasma analysis around
the world. Further, currently available tests are cumbersome, time consuming to perform, and costly. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have conducted initial proof-of-concept clinical
studies in male infertility with a leading research center in the United States, which demonstrates that oxidation-reduction potential effectively measures oxidative stress levels in semen and seminal plasma &#150; and that these levels strongly
correlate with established markers of infertility. Semen analysis studies are routinely conducted to assess causes of infertility, so we expect clinicians and oxidative stress researchers to readily integrate the MiOXSYS System into routine use upon
the completion of more extensive studies and regulatory clearance for this use. Additional studies are now in the late planning stages that will evaluate the MiOXSYS System&#146;s performance in the detection of oxidative stress levels and
correlations with key semen parameters in both healthy and infertile males. The MiOXSYS System must receive 510(k) de novo clearance from the FDA before we can market it for clinical use in the United States. Of the $300 million male infertility
market projected for 2020, the North American, Middle Eastern, and Asia Pacific markets dominate due to prevalence, awareness of treatment, and availability of treatment resources. Thus, it is important that we have already established distribution
relationships and direct access to major oxidative stress researchers in many of these important markets. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">An attractive aspect of the reproductive health
market relates to reimbursement, as infertility treatments and the associated diagnostic tests are generally paid directly by patients. The current infertility treatments and associated diagnostics typically cost in excess of $10,000 per treatment
cycle, so the addition of a moderately priced oxidative stress test would consume nominal relative costs while providing specific, actionable information needed to improve the oxidative status of infertile patients. The current infertility
treatments include antioxidant supplements and lifestyle modifications that lower oxidative stress (e.g., smoking cessation, exercise, dietary changes, etc.), so the measurements reported by the MiOXSYS System could effectively guide treatment in
the infertile patients. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have an extensive range of intellectual property across our primary assets, Zertane, MiOXSYS, and RedoxSYS. We have patent
protection in the United States and several other large markets worldwide. Specifically, we have numerous patents issued and pending for the RedoxSYS/MiOXSYS systems and their use in the U.S., Europe, Israel, and major markets in Asia inclusive of
Japan, Korea, China, and the Middle East. Further, we have patent protection in the United States and several other large markets worldwide for the use of tramadol hydrochloride to treat PE. We also have intellectual property specifically covering
Zertane-ED, our product candidate to treat comorbid premature ejaculation and erectile dysfunction, or ED, that has issued patents in several large markets worldwide and is pending in the United States. However, we are not actively developing
Zertane-ED at this time. </P>

Candidate &#150; Zertane </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our lead therapeutic product candidate, Zertane, is a specifically formulated orally disintegrating tablet, or ODT, of
tramadol hydrochloride patented for the on-demand treatment of PE. Zertane is being developed utilizing a regulatory pathway pursuant to Section&nbsp;505(b)(2) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended, or the FDCA, as the active ingredient is
already well characterized for the treatment of pain, and we are relying on the FDA&#146;s finding of safety of tramadol hydrochloride to support its use in a new indication, PE, at a lower dose. If we receive marketing approval for Zertane, we
believe it will be the first commercial product approved by the FDA for PE. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There are three main types of NDAs, which are covered by Section&nbsp;505 of
the FDCA: (1)&nbsp;an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and efficacy (Section 505(b)(1)); (2)&nbsp;an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness but where at least some of
the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the application has not obtained a right of reference (Section 505(b)(2)); and (3)&nbsp;an application that contains information to show
that the proposed product is identical in active ingredient, dosage form, strength, route of administration, labeling, quality, performance characteristics, and intended use, among other things, to a previously approved product (Section 505 (j)).
Section&nbsp;505(b)(2) expressly permits the FDA to rely, for approval of an NDA, on data not developed by the applicant. In the preIND briefing meeting with Ampio and in June 2012, the FDA agreed that our NDA may be submitted under
Section&nbsp;505(b)(2). As such, we intend to rely on studies published in the scientific literature and reference FDA-approved NDAs for tramadol-containing products (NDAs 21-693, 20-281 and 21-692) to support the safety and efficacy demonstrated in
our clinical program. Relying on Section&nbsp;505(b)(2) is advantageous because we or our collaborators may not be required (i)&nbsp;to perform the full range of safety and efficacy trials that is otherwise required to secure approval of a new drug,
and (ii)&nbsp;obtain a &#147;right of reference&#148; from the applicant that obtained approval of the previously approved drug. However, a Section&nbsp;505(b)(2) application must support the proposed change of the previously approved drug by
including necessary and adequate information, as determined by the FDA, and the FDA may still require us to perform a portion or the full range of safety and efficacy trials. There can be no assurance that we would be successful under any
Section&nbsp;505(b)(2) application. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">According to recent published analyses, PE is a highly prevalent male sexual dysfunction affecting 20-30% of men
worldwide. Based on internal market research and published reports, we believe that PE is up to 1.5-times more prevalent than erectile dysfunction. Currently, there are no FDA-approved prescription products in the United States to treat PE, and to
our knowledge, only one oral prescription product has been approved elsewhere in the world. Treatment options for PE have traditionally included antidepressant drugs prescribed &#147;off label,&#148; topical numbing medications, and cognitive
behavior therapy or counseling, all of which have had limited effectiveness in treating the disorder. PE therefore represents an area of significant unmet medical need. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">By virtue of significant development work performed by a previous corporate partner, Zertane has already been evaluated outside the United States in two Phase
1 clinical trials, two Phase 2 clinical trials and two Phase 3 clinical trials. This development work has demonstrated a favorable safety and efficacy profile of Zertane in men with PE and helped inform the design and endpoints of the Phase 3
clinical trials we will need to obtain FDA approval. Furthermore, the safety and pharmacology of the drug substance in Zertane, tramadol hydrochloride, is well characterized, which we believe will eliminate the need for us to conduct additional
pre-clinical studies and safety trials. We believe we are well positioned to initiate Phase 3 clinical trials with Zertane in the United States. Upon completion of the trials, if successful, we plan to submit a New Drug Application, or NDA, and
subsequently market Zertane in the United States, if approved. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our strategy for Zertane is focused on the initiation and completion of the Phase 3
clinical program in the United States and the development of worldwide commercialization and marketing partnerships. We expect to finalize clinical development of Zertane, seek FDA marketing approval and &#150; if approved&#151;commercialize the
product candidate in the United States either directly or via </P>

partnerships. While we have not yet submitted an IND for Zertane to the FDA that would allow us to initiate the planned Phase 3 trial, we expect to submit the IND in the second half of 2015. We
will seek partnerships to commercialize Zertane in the major markets outside of the United States. We already have partnerships in place to market Zertane in South Korea (Daewoong Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.) and Brazil (FBM Farma Industria
Farmaceutica), which could provide near-term revenue for us if, working with our partners, we are able to successfully obtain regulatory approval in those countries. In addition, we recently entered into an agreement with Endo Ventures Limited,
which recently acquired Paladin Labs Inc., or Paladin, a leading Canadian specialty pharmaceutical company, to provide exclusive rights to market, sell and distribute Zertane in Canada, the Republic of South Africa, certain countries in Sub-Saharan
Africa, Colombia and Latin America. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Market Opportunity </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>PE Market </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">PE is a significant unmet medical need
in the United States and worldwide as it causes significant emotional distress for affected men and their partners. According to an article published in <I>European Urology</I> in 2010 and a survey published in the <I>Journal of the American Medical
Association (JAMA)</I> in 1999, PE is a highly prevalent male sexual dysfunction affecting 20-30% of men worldwide. However, most prevalence data on PE is based on patient surveys, which are inherently subjective, and therefore some of the men
surveyed may not have PE as it is defined by major medical societies. In a 2007 study published in <I>European Urology</I>, the incidence of PE was assessed via a web-based survey of 12,133 men ages 18-70 in the United States, Germany and Italy. In
this survey, 2,754 or 22.7% of the men reported that they suffer from PE. The vast majority (87.9%)&nbsp;of men with PE wished that they had more control over time to climax. Additionally, a majority (57.6%)&nbsp;of the men surveyed reported that
they would seek medical treatment if they knew that a pill to control ejaculation were available. We believe men would also ask their doctor about treatment options if their partner suggested it. Additional primary company market research indicated
that over 66% of patients that see a urologist for PE were self-referred, which we believe further demonstrates that PE is a condition for which patients are actively seeking treatment. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Presently, there are no approved prescription pharmaceuticals in the United States to treat PE and only two pharmaceuticals known to be approved elsewhere in
the world. Current &#147;off label&#148; or unapproved therapies used to treat PE carry with them unwanted side effects and inconsistent or limited effectiveness. Topical over-the-counter, or OTC, options are not preferred due to route of
administration and may also have an impact on partner satisfaction. Oral therapeutics, specifically selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs, carry potentially significant side effects; the most notable of which is diminished libido. PDE-5
inhibitors have been prescribed &#147;off label&#148; for PE but have not demonstrated efficacy. Outside of oral or topical therapeutics, non-medical options include behavioral therapy and relationship counseling, both of which can be time consuming
and stressful and frequently ineffective for men and their partners. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe patients and their partners are generally dissatisfied with existing
pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatments for PE. Based on primary market research commissioned by us, which included discussions with a cross section of clinicians that treat patients with PE, we believe that there are significant issues with
existing PE treatments demonstrating a real need for a safe and effective, FDA-approved product to treat PE that does not have a ramp-up period. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our lead
product candidate, Zertane for premature ejaculation, contains 89 mg tramadol hydrochloride in an orally dissolving tablet, or ODT. Tramadol hydrochloride is a well-established, centrally acting synthetic analgesic and has been used for more than 30
years as a treatment for moderate to severe pain. The drug and its active metabolite (M1, O-desmethyltramadol) act as an opiate agonist, apparently by selective activity at the &micro;-receptor. Although the mechanism by which tramadol hydrochloride
delays ejaculation has not been identified, numerous laboratory studies have shown that tramadol hydrochloride also acts as an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, 5-hydroxytryptamine type 2C receptor antagonist, 5 nicotinic acetylcholine
receptor antagonist, M1 and M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist, and a serotonin and norepinephrine modulator. It is possible that one or a combination of these effects leads to a delay in ejaculation. The relative contribution of
tramadol hydrochloride versus its M1 metabolite to delay ejaculation is unknown. However, the metabolite is six times more potent than the parent drug in producing analgesia in animal models and 200 times more potent in &micro;-receptor binding. As
a pain medication, tramadol hydrochloride has been associated with certain adverse effects including dizziness, nausea, constipation, vertigo, headache, vomiting and drowsiness. However, we intend that our labeling for Zertane, if regulatory
approval is obtained, will suggest &#147;as required&#148; dosing before sexual intercourse and not to exceed one tablet per day. Based on previous clinical studies, we believe that limiting the dosing to no more than once per day will minimize any
side effects. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Our Marketed, FDA-Approved Prostate Imaging Product &#150; ProstaScint </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On May&nbsp;20, 2015, we acquired ProstaScint from Jazz Pharmaceuticals. ProstaScint is already approved by the FDA and is generating revenues. As such, we
expect to launch a commercial infrastructure in order to support increased sales and distribution of ProstaScint in the U.S. ProstaScint, or capromab pendetide, is a radio-labeled monoclonal antibody, which is a biologic product that targets a

radioactive substance called Indium In 111 is attached to the proprietary, mouse-derived antibody. The radiolabeled antibody is infused into the patient and is taken up by prostate cancer cells
which can be detected and visualized with a special nuclear medicine scan (single-photon emission tomography, or SPECT). ProstaScint has been shown to be clinically effective in determining the course of treatment for a patient who has had a
prostatectomy and/or has suspected metastasis (spread of the cancer cells beyond the prostate). Further, ProstaScint has demonstrated efficacy in newly diagnosed patients classified as High Risk or with recurrent prostate cancer. In addition to U.S.
approval ProstaScint has also been approved by Health Canada. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">ProstaScint fills an important medical need in the detection of a common illness facing a
significant number of men in the U.S. and around the world. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among men in the United States, with an estimated 218,000 annual cases (as of 2010). Further, more than 1,800,000 men are alive with some history
of prostate cancer, and over 30,000 U.S. men die each year from the disease. The effect of prostate cancer on healthcare economics is substantial, which makes the need for accurate disease staging critical for treatment and management strategies.
The U.S. market for the diagnosis and screening of prostate cancer is expected to total $17.4 billion in 2017, a CAGR of 7.5%. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">ProstaScint has several
unique selling features that we believe will enable significant sales growth and regular use by healthcare providers diagnosing and treating prostate cancer. ProstaScint is the only imaging agent that specifically targets prostate cancer cells and
demonstrates high sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. In multiple clinical studies researchers have shown that when SPECT/CT scans were used in patients pre-treated with ProstaScint, ProstaScint imaging was highly sensitive in detecting prostate
cancer and significantly predictive of 10-year biochemical disease free survival in prostate cancer patients (86.6% vs. 65.5%; p=0.0014). Importantly, ProstaScint is already approved by the FDA with a history of sales in the U.S. Additionally, the
American Cancer Society specifically recognizes ProstaScint by name in current prostate cancer diagnosis guidelines. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Summary of Select ProstaScint

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Radiation oncology experts have published numerous papers expressing the potential for expanded use of
ProstaScint in prostate cancer imaging due to advances in imaging technologies since its FDA approval in 1996. Since the early 2000s significantly greater image resolution has been enabled due to the advent of dual head cameras (and improved imaging
in general) along with the use of co-registered images where radiologists now combine the images of SPECT and computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our leading diagnostic product candidate, the RedoxSYS System, is now fully developed for research use. RedoxSYS is a novel, portable device that measures
oxidation-reduction potential, or ORP, a global measure of oxidative stress. This system is the first and only system that measures ORP in biologic specimens to provide a complete measure of redox balance, which is broadly implicated across a wide
range of both acute and chronic conditions. To date, Canadian and European regulators have characterized RedoxSYS System as Class II medical device and regulated them accordingly. Classification of a medical device as Class II in Europe and Canada
indicates that the device is generally regarded as posing medium risk, and non-invasive medical devices that come into contact with injured skin are generally classified as Class II. As we have conducted initial validation studies with the RedoxSYS
System across a range of conditions and obtained a CE marking in Europe and Health Canada clearance to begin the market development of the RedoxSYS System as a clinical diagnostic in Europe, Canada, and elsewhere around the world where CE marking is
recognized, we are now initiating commercialization for use of the RedoxSYS System as a research tool. By employing a focused commercial infrastructure and a focused network of distributors around the world, we believe we can efficiently penetrate
the academic and industry-based research centers who study oxidative stress. With this growth in the research market, we intend to develop clinical applications for the RedoxSYS System. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our strategy for the RedoxSYS System is to continue deployment of this system at leading academic centers around the world, develop research collaborations
with key opinion leaders in oxidative stress research, identify clinical applications for the platform, and aggressively pursue infertility studies to establish efficacy of the system in this setting of care. In 2013 and 2014, we deployed the
RedoxSYS System around the world in the development of numerous future clinical applications. While many areas of study have been undertaken, we have focused research resources on high-value areas where significant medical needs remain unmet. Given
our initial orientation around trauma, the studies completed thus far have focused on large conditions related to critical care. These initial studies demonstrated the initial clinical validation for the RedoxSYS System and represent substantial
opportunities as growth applications and markets following initial entry into the research and infertility markets. As our direct commercial efforts will focus on male infertility, we expect that other areas of clinical use would be pursued through
partnerships with corporate partners established in these non-urological clinical channels. A significant potential opportunity that has presented promise through our research is the application of ORP in the study of male infertility. ORP
represents a unique approach to assessing oxidative stress in male infertility as it relates to semen analysis, and early clinical studies have been conducted. We are now beginning larger-scale clinical studies with a globally recognized U.S.
university in male infertility. As such we have developed a RedoxSYS System line extension called MiOXSYS specifically designed and programmed to detect oxidative stress in semen specimens. Oxidative stress is widely assessed in semen analysis
laboratories as part of male infertility assessment, and we believe the MiOXSYS System, if proven effective, will provide a simple, comprehensive solution to oxidative stress detection and management of antioxidant and lifestyle intervention in this
underserved market. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Future Products </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We plan to
augment our core development and commercial assets through efficient identification of complementary therapeutics, devices, and diagnostics related to urological disorders. We intend to seek assets that are near commercial stage or already
generating revenues. Further, we intend to seek to acquire products through asset purchases, licensing, co-development, or collaborative commercial arrangements (co-promotions, co-marketing, etc.). </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our management team has extensive experience across a wide range of business development activities and have in-licensed or acquired products from large,

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Business Overview </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are a specialty healthcare company concentrating on developing and commercializing products with an initial focus on urological related conditions. We are
focused primarily on the urological disorders market and specifically sexual dysfunction, urological cancers and male infertility. We are currently focused on commercializing our ProstaScint<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>
product, which we plan to launch through a focused commercial infrastructure in the U.S. while developing corporate relationships outside the U.S. to launch ProstaScint in major healthcare markets around the world. We acquired ProstaScint in May
2015 from Jazz Pharmaceuticals. ProstaScint, which is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, is a marketed biologic imaging agent specifically indicated for the diagnostic staging of prostate cancer patients. We have launched the
RedoxSYS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> oxidation-reduction potential system, or the RedoxSYS System, into the global research market and are developing numerous clinical applications for this potential first-in-class
diagnostic device. Additionally, we have developed the MiOXSYS System as a diagnostic device for the detection of infertility in semen analysis. Further, we plan to enter Phase 3 clinical development for our lead therapeutic candidate, Zertane,
which is being studied in premature ejaculation. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The premature ejaculation market in the U.S. and Europe is expected to reach over $1.3 billion in annual
sales in 2015, representing an increase of 10.3% since 2010. According to recent published analyses, premature ejaculation, or PE, is a highly prevalent male sexual dysfunction affecting 20-30% of men worldwide. Based on internal market research and
published reports, we believe that PE is up to 1.5-times more prevalent than erectile dysfunction, or ED. Currently, there are no FDA-approved prescription products in the United States to treat PE, and to our knowledge, only two other prescription
products have been approved elsewhere in the world. Treatment options for PE have traditionally included antidepressant drugs prescribed &#147;off label,&#148; topical numbing medications, and cognitive behavior therapy or counseling, all of which
have had limited effectiveness in treating the disorder. PE therefore represents an area of significant unmet medical need. In addition, approximately 32% of the more than 12,000 men with PE surveyed in a 2007 study published in <I>European
Urology</I> also suffered from ED. Accordingly, we believe that a combination product candidate to treat both PE and ED represents another significant worldwide market opportunity for us. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">By virtue of our recent acquisition of ProstaScint, we are now commercial stage and generating sales for this FDA-approved prostate cancer imaging agent. As
prostate cancer is a condition commonly diagnosed and treated by urologists, ProstaScint complements our urology-focused product pipeline. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among men in the United States, with an estimated 218,000 annual
cases (as of 2010). Further, more than 1,800,000 men are alive with some history of prostate cancer, and over 30,000 U.S. men die each year from the disease. The effect of prostate cancer on healthcare economics is substantial, which makes the need
for accurate disease staging critical for treatment and management strategies. The U.S. market for the diagnosis and screening of prostate cancer is expected to total $17.4 billion in 2017, a CAGR of 7.5%. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are actively developing the global market for the RedoxSYS System across a range of applications. Specifically, we have begun commercializing the RedoxSYS
System for research use through direct selling, distribution partners, and academic collaborators. Over the past 18 months, we have engaged in over 60 trials around the world whereby prominent researchers are implementing oxidation-reduction
potential, or ORP, as a marker in both chronic and acute illnesses and disorders in both clinical research as well as basic science research. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Through our
extensive network of researchers, the RedoxSYS System has demonstrated the potential to have broad clinical applications. Studies are now underway at a major U.S. university in the area of male infertility. As such, we developed the MiOXSYS System
as a line extension to RedoxSYS to specifically assess oxidative stress in semen as a tool to assess male infertility. Male infertility is prevalent, underserved, and oxidative stress is widely implicated in its pathophysiology. As such, we expect
to bolster our research focus in this area with the MiOXSYS System to complement our focus on urologic conditions. The global male infertility market is expected to grow to over $300 million by 2020 with a CAGR of nearly 5% from 2013 to 2020.
Oxidative stress is broadly implicated in the pathophysiology of male infertility, yet very few diagnostic tools exist to effectively measure oxidative stress levels in men. However, antioxidants are widely available and recommended to infertile
men. With the introduction of the MiOXSYS System, we believe for the first time there will be an easy and effective diagnostic tool to assess degree of oxidative stress and monitor patients&#146; responses to antioxidant therapy. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our premature ejaculation product candidate, Zertane, is a specifically formulated orally disintegrating tablet, or ODT, of tramadol hydrochloride patented for
the on-demand treatment of PE. Zertane is being developed utilizing a regulatory pathway pursuant to Section&nbsp;505(b)(2) of the FDCA, as the active ingredient is already well characterized for the treatment of pain, and we are relying on the
FDA&#146;s finding of safety of tramadol hydrochloride to support its use in a new indication, PE, at a lower dose. If we receive marketing approval for Zertane, we believe it will be the first commercial product approved by the FDA for PE. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">By virtue of significant development work performed by a previous partner of Ampio, Zertane has already been evaluated outside the United States in two Phase
1 clinical trials, two Phase 2 clinical trials and two Phase 3 clinical trials. The two Phase 1 safety trials were conducted to characterize the concentration of tramadol hydrochloride in plasma after oral administration of a single Zertane ODT (89
mg) in healthy volunteers. Two randomized, placebo-controlled, blinded Phase 2 clinical trials were conducted in a total of 102 patients. These trials evaluated doses of tramadol hydrochloride between 25 and 120 mg in male subjects with PE. Two
placebo-controlled, randomized and double-blind Phase 3 clinical trials were conducted in Europe to investigate tramadol hydrochloride 62 mg and 89 mg ODT for the treatment of PE when taken as needed between two and eight hours before a sexual
event. This development work has demonstrated a favorable safety and efficacy profile of Zertane in men with PE. Furthermore, the safety and pharmacology of the drug substance in Zertane, tramadol hydrochloride, is well characterized, which should
eliminate the need for us to conduct additional pre-clinical studies and safety trials. Based on guidance received at a recent consultation meeting with the FDA, we believe we are well positioned to initiate a Phase 3 clinical program with Zertane
in the United States. Specifically, we believe the meeting clarified specific aspects of the trial, including the primary efficacy endpoints and patient inclusion and exclusion criteria. The FDA agreed to review a draft study protocol in advance of
us submitting our Investigational New Drug application, or IND. Upon completion of the program, if successful, we plan to submit a New Drug Application, or NDA, and subsequently market Zertane in the United States, if approved. </P>

ProstaScint<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> from Jazz Pharmaceuticals. ProstaScint Kit, or capromab pendetide (ProstaScint), is a radio-labeled monoclonal antibody, which is a biologic product that targets a specific
antigen. ProstaScint targets Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA), a protein uniquely expressed by prostate tissue. A radioactive substance called Indium In 111 is attached to the proprietary, mouse-derived antibody. The radiolabeled antibody
infused into the patient and is taken up by prostate cancer cells which can be detected and visualized with a special nuclear medicine scan (single-photon emission tomography, or SPECT). ProstaScint has been shown to be clinically effective in
determining the course of treatment for a patient who has had a prostatectomy and/or has suspected metastasis (spread of the cancer cells beyond the prostate). Further, ProstaScint has demonstrated efficacy in patients classified as High Risk or
with recurrent prostate cancer. ProstaScint has been approved by the FDA and Health Canada, and significant clinical data exist demonstrating the significant predictive value in prostate cancer staging. </P>

</TABLE> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We expect to leverage these research relationships and build numerous applications in areas where researchers are studying
oxidative stress. Currently, there are no available research platforms that measure oxidation-reduction potential in biologic fluids (i.e., blood, plasma, serum, semen, seminal fluid, cerebrospinal fluid, tissue, and cells). While oxidative stress
is commonly studied in research settings around the world (both academia and industry), the current assessment methods are incomplete, time consuming, and often impractical for assessing oxidative stress completely. To position the RedoxSYS System
effectively in the research market, we have placed key personnel in the United States, Europe, and Asia to develop direct research business relationships as well as distribution networks. From these networks, we expect to realize initial product
revenues for the RedoxSYS System for research applications in 2015. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>MiOXSYS System for Male Infertility </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As part of our strategy to develop future clinical applications of the RedoxSYS System, we have conducted initial studies in reproductive health. Male
infertility is a significant medical condition in which oxidative stress is well known to play a substantial role. As such, we believe developing a specific instrument platform (called the MiOXSYS System) to assess oxidative stress levels in semen
and seminal fluid represents a significant commercial opportunity. Oxidative stress is well established as a leading contributing factor to male infertility. Further, a significant proportion of male infertility remains unexplained in part because
of the lack of standardized tests available to clinicians and researchers to assess oxidative stress in semen and plasma. This lack of standardization has resulted in poor implementation of semen and plasma analysis around the world. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have conducted proof-of-concept studies in male infertility with the MiOXSYS System with a leading research center in the United States, which demonstrate
that oxidation-reduction potential effectively measures oxidative stress levels in semen and seminal plasma. Semen analysis studies are routinely conducted to assess causes of infertility, so we expect clinicians and oxidative stress researchers to
readily integrate the MiOXSYS System into routine clinical use. Additional studies are now underway to evaluate the MiOXSYS System&#146;s performance in the detection of oxidative stress levels in semen in healthy and infertile males. Of the
approximately $300 million male infertility market, the North American market and Asia Pacific market dominate due to prevalence, awareness of treatment, and availability of treatment resources. Thus, it is important that we have already begun to
establish distribution relationships and direct access to major oxidative stress researchers and clinicians. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">An attractive aspect of the reproductive
health market relates to reimbursement as infertility treatments and the associated diagnostic tests are generally paid directly by patients. The current infertility treatments could cost in excess of $10,000 per treatment cycle, so the addition of
a moderately priced oxidative stress test would consume nominal relative costs while providing specific, actionable information needed to improve the oxidative status of infertile patients. The current infertility treatments include antioxidant
supplements and lifestyle modifications that lower oxidative stress (e.g., smoking cessation, exercise, dietary changes, etc.), so the measurements reported by the MiOXSYS System could effectively guide treatment in the infertile patients. </P>

increased sales and distribution of ProstaScint in the U.S. In addition to U.S. approval, ProstaScint has also been approved by Health Canada. ProstaScint fills an important medical need in the detection of a common illness facing a significant
number of men in the U.S. and around the world. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among men in the United States, with an estimated 218,000 annual cases (as of 2010). Further, more than 1,800,000 men are alive with some history of prostate
cancer, and over 30,000 U.S. men die each year from the disease. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">ProstaScint has several unique selling features that we believe will enable significant
sales growth and regular use by healthcare providers diagnosing and treating prostate cancer. ProstaScint is the only imaging agent that specifically targets prostate cancer cells and demonstrates high sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. In
multiple clinical studies researchers have shown that when SPECT/CT scans were used in patients pre-treated with ProstaScint, ProstaScint imaging was highly sensitive in detecting prostate cancer and significantly predictive of 10-year biochemical
disease free survival in prostate cancer patients (86.6% vs. 65.5%; p=0.0014). Additionally, the American Cancer Society specifically recognizes ProstaScint by name in current prostate cancer diagnosis guidelines. </P>

value and complement our focus. We plan to pursue product acquisitions, inclusive of therapeutics, diagnostics, and devices, which will be evaluated for their strategic fit and potential for near-term and/or accretive value to us. In May 2015, we
acquired ProstaScint as part of this strategy. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Our Product Pipeline </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Our Lead Therapeutic Product Candidate &#150; Zertane </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our lead therapeutic product candidate, Zertane, is a specifically formulated orally disintegrating tablet, or ODT, of tramadol hydrochloride patented for the
on-demand treatment of PE. Zertane is being developed utilizing a regulatory pathway pursuant to Section&nbsp;505(b)(2) of the FDCA, as the active ingredient is already well characterized for the treatment of pain, and we are relying on the
FDA&#146;s finding of safety of tramadol hydrochloride to support its use in a new indication, PE, at a lower dose. If we receive marketing approval for Zertane, we believe it will be the first commercial prescription product approved by the FDA for
PE. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">According to recent published analyses, PE is a highly prevalent male sexual dysfunction affecting 20-30% of men worldwide. Based on internal market
research and published reports, we believe that PE is up to 1.5-times more prevalent than erectile dysfunction. Currently, there are no FDA-approved prescription products in the United States to treat PE, and to our knowledge, only one oral
prescription product has been approved elsewhere in the world. Treatment options for PE have traditionally included antidepressant drugs prescribed &#147;off label,&#148; topical numbing medications, and cognitive behavior therapy or counseling, all
of which have had limited effectiveness in treating the disorder. PE therefore represents an area of significant medical need. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">By virtue of significant
development work performed by a previous partner of Ampio, Zertane has already been evaluated outside the United States in two Phase 1 clinical trials, two Phase 2 clinical trials and two Phase 3 clinical trials. This development work has
demonstrated a favorable safety and efficacy profile of Zertane in men with PE and helped inform the design and endpoints of the Phase 3 clinical trials we will need to obtain FDA approval. Furthermore, the safety and pharmacology of the drug
substance in Zertane, tramadol hydrochloride, is well characterized, which we believe will eliminate the need for us to conduct additional pre-clinical studies and safety trials. We believe we are well positioned to initiate Phase 3 clinical trials
with Zertane in the United States. Upon completion of the trials, if successful, we plan to submit an NDA to the FDA and subsequently market Zertane in the United States, if approved. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our strategy for Zertane is focused on the initiation and completion of the Phase 3 clinical program in the United States and the development of worldwide
commercialization and marketing partnerships. We expect to finalize clinical development of Zertane, seek FDA marketing approval and &#150; if approved&#151;commercialize the product candidate in the United States either directly or via
partnerships. We will seek partnerships to commercialize Zertane in rest of world, or ROW, markets. We already have partnerships in place to market Zertane in South Korea and Brazil, which could provide near-term revenue for us if, working with our
partners, we are able to successfully obtain regulatory approval in those countries. In addition, we recently entered into an agreement with Endo Ventures Limited, which recently acquired Paladin Labs Inc., or Paladin, a leading Canadian specialty
pharmaceutical company, to provide exclusive rights to market, sell and distribute Zertane in Canada, the Republic of South Africa, certain countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, Colombia and Latin America. We also intend to build awareness of PE in the
United States with the intention of paving the way for successful product introduction and initiate pre-clinical work on Zertane-ED as a potential combination treatment for PE and ED. We expect to use a similar clinical and commercial approach for
Zertane-ED and we have a clinical development collaboration in place with our South Korean partner for the combination product candidate when we elect to actively pursue its development. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>What is PE? </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Medical literature contains several
one-dimensional and multi-dimensional operational definitions of PE. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders defines PE as persistent or recurrent ejaculation with minimal sexual stimulation before, on, or shortly after penetration
and before the person wishes it, with the disturbance causing marked distress or interpersonal difficulty. Alternately, the International Society for Sexual Medicine, or the ISSM, has adopted a new and evidence-based definition for lifelong PE:
&#147;premature ejaculation is a male sexual dysfunction characterized by ejaculation which always or nearly always occurs prior to or within a minute of vaginal penetration; and inability to delay ejaculation on all or nearly all vaginal
penetrations; and negative personal consequences, such as distress, bother, frustration and/or the avoidance of sexual intimacy.&#148; </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">PE may be
classified as lifelong (primary) or acquired (secondary). Lifelong PE is characterized by onset from the first sexual experience and remains a problem throughout life. Acquired PE is characterized by either a gradual or subtle onset, with
ejaculation being considered normal before onset of PE. Time to ejaculation is short but not usually as fast as in lifelong (less than 1 minute in almost all encounters). We believe acquired PE and/or situational PE suggests a psychological cause
and behavioral therapy and/or relationship counseling may be the most appropriate initial therapy. In contrast, we believe lifelong PE suggests a biogenic cause and pharmacologic treatment is the most appropriate initial therapy. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Ejaculation latency, most commonly quantified using intravaginal ejaculation latency time, or IELT, is a dominant component of PE assessment in clinical
trials. IELT is defined as the time between vaginal intromission and intravaginal ejaculation. Although a standard cut-off for ejaculatory latency does not exist, it has been suggested that an IELT of 2 minutes or less may serve as an adequately
sensitive criterion for defining PE and some studies have used IELT values from 1 to 2&nbsp;minutes for defining PE. In a pre-IND meeting with FDA, we agreed to use an IELT of less than or equal to 1 minute as one of the enrollment criteria for our
planned Phase 3 clinical trials. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">However, IELT is not the sole criteria used to diagnose PE. We believe diagnosis of PE should also include a
subject&#146;s perceived control over ejaculation, as well as distress and interpersonal difficulty due to the condition. The need to objectively assess and diagnose PE beyond IELT has led to the development of several questionnaires within the male
sexual dysfunction medical community including the Premature Ejaculation Diagnostic Tool (PEDT), Premature Ejaculation Profile, or PEP, the Index of Premature Ejaculation (IPE), and the Male Sexual Health Questionnaire Ejaculatory Dysfunction
(MSHQ-EjD). In collaboration with the FDA, Ampio has also developed a modified version of PEP known as the Patient Outcome for Premature Ejaculation, referred to as the POPE. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Prevalence of PE </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">PE is a significant medical need
in the United States and worldwide as it causes significant emotional distress for affected men and their partners. According to an article published in <I>European Urology</I> in 2010 and a survey published in the <I>Journal of the American Medical
Association (JAMA)</I> in 1999, PE is a highly prevalent male sexual dysfunction affecting 20-30% of men worldwide. However, most prevalence data on PE is based on patient surveys, which are inherently subjective, and therefore some of the men
surveyed may not have PE as it is defined by the medical societies noted above. In a 2007 study published in <I>European Urology</I>, the incidence of PE was assessed via a web-based survey of 12,133 men ages 18-70 in the United States, Germany and
Italy. In this survey, 2,754 or 22.7%, of the men reported that they suffer from PE. The vast majority (87.9%)&nbsp;of men with PE wished that they had more control over time to climax. Additionally, a majority (57.6%)&nbsp;of the men surveyed
reported that they would seek medical treatment if they knew that a pill to control ejaculation were available. We believe men would also ask their doctor about treatment options if their partner suggested it. Additional primary company market
research by a prominent pharmaceutical market research consulting firm commissioned by Ampio indicated that over 66% of patients that see a urologist for PE were self-referred, which we believe further demonstrates that PE is a condition for which
patients are actively seeking treatment. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Existing therapies do not satisfy the significant PE market need </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Presently, there are no approved prescription pharmaceuticals in the United States to treat PE and only two pharmaceuticals known to be approved elsewhere in
the world. Current &#147;off label&#148; or unapproved therapies used to treat PE carry with them unwanted side effects and inconsistent or limited effectiveness. Topical over-the-counter, or OTC, options are not preferred due to route of
administration and may also have an impact on partner satisfaction. Oral therapeutics, specifically selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs, carry potentially significant side effects most notably of which is diminished libido. PDE-5
inhibitors have been prescribed &#147;off label&#148; for PE but have not demonstrated efficacy. Outside of oral or topical therapeutics, non-medical options include behavioral therapy and relationship counseling, both of which can be time consuming
and stressful and frequently ineffective for men and their partners. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our lead therapeutic product candidate, Zertane for premature ejaculation, contains 89 mg tramadol hydrochloride in an orally dissolving tablet, or ODT.
Tramadol hydrochloride is a well-established, centrally acting synthetic analgesic and has been used for more than 30&nbsp;years as a treatment for moderate to severe pain. The drug and its active metabolite (M1, <I>O</I>-desmethyltramadol) act as
an opiate agonist, apparently by selective activity at the &micro;-receptor. Although the mechanism by which tramadol hydrochloride delays ejaculation has not been identified, numerous laboratory studies have shown that tramadol hydrochloride also
acts as an <I>N</I>-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, 5-hydroxytryptamine type 2C receptor antagonist, 5 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist, M1 and M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist, and a serotonin and norepinephrine
modulator. It is possible that one or a combination of these effects leads to a delay in ejaculation. The relative contribution of tramadol hydrochloride versus its M1 metabolite to delay ejaculation is unknown. However, the metabolite is six times
more potent than the parent drug in producing analgesia in animal models and 200 times more potent in &micro;-receptor binding. As a pain medication, tramadol hydrochloride has been associated with certain adverse effects including dizziness,
nausea, constipation, vertigo, headache, vomiting and drowsiness. However, we intend that our labeling for Zertane, if regulatory approval is obtained, will suggest &#147;as required&#148; dosing before sexual intercourse and not to exceed one
tablet per day. Based on previous clinical studies, we believe that limiting the dosing to no more than once per day will minimize any side effects. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As
an alternative to antidepressant and anxiolytic medication, tramadol hydrochloride has been recognized as a potential therapy for treatment of PE, after an association was observed between its use and improvements in ejaculation latency time. The
combination of completed clinical trials, primarily performed in Europe, planned clinical trials in the United States, and literature are intended to establish the safety and efficacy of Zertane in the treatment of the condition and standardize the
dose and dosing regimen. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Dr.&nbsp;David Bar-Or discovered the utility of tramadol hydrochloride for the treatment of PE in June 1999, and this discovery and accompanying intellectual
property were the property of&nbsp;DMI BioSciences, Inc., or DMI BioSciences.&nbsp;DMI BioSciences conducted two Phase 2 clinical studies in male subjects with PE using a pharmacy-compounded gelatin capsule preparation.&nbsp;A proof-of-concept Phase
2 study was initiated in March 2003, and final patient assessments were on July&nbsp;7, 2003.&nbsp;A dose-ranging study Phase 2 study was initiated in September 2004 and final patient assessments were in October 2005. In 2007, DMI BioSciences
licensed the worldwide rights to tramadol hydrochloride for PE to Biovail Laboratories International, or Biovail. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Biovail had previously entered into a
product development and licensing agreement with Ethypharm S.A., or Ethypharm, in 2002, which had developed an ODT formulation of tramadol hydrochloride using its proprietary FLASHTAB technology.&nbsp;In this agreement, Biovail acquired the rights
to develop and market Ethypharm&#146;s tramadol hydrochloride ODT product for use in the management of pain. In March of 2004, Biovail submitted a Section&nbsp;505(b)(2) NDA (US NDA 21,639) to FDA for market registration of tramadol hydrochloride
ODT 50&nbsp;mg (RYBIX) for the management of moderate to moderately severe pain, and this NDA was granted approval in May 2005. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Biovail decided not to
launch the RYBIX 50&nbsp;mg ODT product in the United States, and in 2009, signed an NDA agreement with Ethypharm pursuant to which Ethypharm acquired all the rights to RYBIX 50&nbsp;mg ODT and Biovail acquired the rights to develop, manufacture and
market a FLASHTAB ODT product containing tramadol hydrochloride for the symptomatic treatment of PE.&nbsp;In this agreement, Biovail assigned to Ethypharm all of Biovail&#146;s rights, title and interest in and to the approved NDA for RYBIX, the
regulatory documentation and product rights to enable Ethypharm to develop and market RYBIX in the United States for the management of pain.&nbsp;In addition, the agreement granted Biovail the right to reference and use all data, regulatory filings
and regulatory communication, including the approved NDA for RYBIX, the product rights (including any information, data, know-how, formulas, assays, or intellectual property contained in the approved NDA) and any and all related regulatory
documentation that would be relevant for the purposes of developing, manufacturing or marketing the tramadol hydrochloride ODT product for PE. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Using the
newly acquired FLASHTAB technology and manufacturing processes obtained in the NDA agreement with Ethypharm, Biovail developed two strengths of tramadol hydrochloride ODT (62 and 89&nbsp;mg) for use in four NDA-enabling clinical trials: two Phase 1
pharmacokinetic/bioavailability and two Phase 3 placebo-controlled pivotal trials.&nbsp;These trials were initiated in the latter half of 2009.&nbsp;In&nbsp;July 2010, Biovail terminated the clinical trials in Europe as a direct result of a merger
with Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, or Valeant, which was announced in June 2010 but was finalized in September 2010. Following the merger, Valeant adopted a new research and development model and began identifying product development
programs that did not align with this new R&amp;D model. In connection with this new R&amp;D model, Valeant decided to terminate Biovail&#146;s licensing agreement for tramadol hydrochloride for PE and also to terminate the ongoing Phase 3 studies.
The Valeant model did not include compounds that had any regulatory or clinical risk (i.e., were still in development) and instead was focused solely on &#147;commercially ready&#148; products. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Biovail withdrew from its licensing agreement with DMI Biosciences and the worldwide rights to tramadol hydrochloride for PE reverted back to DMI Biosciences,
which was acquired in March 2011 by Ampio. In December of 2011, the Ethypharm-Biovail NDA Agreement was transferred to Ampio in an asset purchase from Valeant, providing Ampio access to all data, regulatory filings and rights to develop, manufacture
and market tramadol hydrochloride ODT for PE. Ampio completed clinical study reports for the European Phase&nbsp;3 studies and submitted tramadol hydrochloride 89&nbsp;mg ODT for marketing authorization in Australia. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In December 2013, Ampio spun out the assets and agreements associated with its sexual dysfunction treatment portfolio, including Zertane, to its then
wholly-owned subsidiary Vyrix. We acquired Vyrix in April 2015. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Clinical Data </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Six European clinical trials have been completed with Zertane: two Phase 1 trials in healthy volunteers and two Phase 2 and two Phase&nbsp;3 trials in men with
lifelong PE. The two Phase&nbsp;1 safety trials were conducted to characterize the concentration of tramadol hydrochloride in plasma after oral administration of a single Zertane ODT (89&nbsp;mg)&nbsp;in healthy volunteers. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Two randomized, placebo-controlled, blinded Phase 2 clinical trials were conducted in a total of 102&nbsp;patients. The first of these showed that a single
25-mg dose of conventionally formulated immediate release tramadol hydrochloride (i.e., immediate-release gelatin capsules) was safe, well-tolerated and prolonged time to ejaculation in some, but not all, patients. The second trial evaluated three
higher doses of tramadol hydrochloride: 65 mg, 85 mg and 120 mg. In this trial, a clear dose response was seen for both efficacy and safety, leading DMI Biosciences to conclude that the optimal tramadol hydrochloride dose to treat PE was likely to
be in the range 60-90 mg. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Two placebo-controlled, randomized and double-blind Phase 3 clinical trials were conducted in Europe to investigate tramadol
hydrochloride 62 mg and 89 mg ODT for the treatment of PE when taken as needed between two and eight&nbsp;hours before a sexual event. A total of 677 patients were randomized in the trials and received either the 62 or 89 mg ODT or a matching
placebo ODT. Our </P>

claim that Zertane was efficacious in the Phase 3 trials is based on at least one of the two doses resulting in statistically significant improvements in both IELT and PEP measures (i.e.,
co-primary endpoints) from baseline to the end of the trial. Using IELT in combination with a self-report questionnaire (e.g., PEP or POPE) has gained acceptance as meaningful measures of pharmacoactivity and efficacy in the scientific and
regulatory communities. The results of the Phase 3 trials suggest that tramadol hydrochloride 89&nbsp;mg ODT is consistently more effective as a treatment for PE than tramadol hydrochloride 62&nbsp;mg ODT. In accordance with the definitions from the
clinical trial protocols, only the tramadol hydrochloride 89 mg ODT dose satisfied the claim for effective treatment of PE in both Phase 3 trials. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In light of the estimated size of the U.S. market opportunity for Zertane, FDA approval is a critical value driver for us in the near term. We believe we are
well positioned to quickly move into NDA-enabling Phase 3 clinical development in order to complete and submit our Section&nbsp;505(b)(2) NDA for Zertane. Ampio met with the FDA in a pre-IND meeting on June&nbsp;20, 2012 and we subsequently met with
the FDA on October&nbsp;23, 2014. As a result of these meetings, we have been able to define the number and key aspects of necessary trials to progress Zertane to an NDA that may be accepted for filing by the FDA; furthermore, the results from the
European trials will inform the design, endpoints and inclusion criteria for the U.S. Phase 3 program as well as recommendations by FDA: </P> <P STYLE="font-size:6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

U.S. NDA approval, we plan to leverage partnerships to gain approval and eventual marketing authorization for Zertane in several key markets around the world. We already have partnerships in place with Daewoong Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd. in South
Korea and FBM Industria Farmaceutica Ltda. in Brazil, thereby providing potential royalty and milestone-based revenue if, working with our partners, we are successfully able to obtain regulatory approval in those countries. In addition, our recent
agreement with Paladin provides Paladin with exclusive rights to market, sell and distribute Zertane in Canada, the Republic of South Africa, certain countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, Colombia and Latin America. Before marketing any products in
Brazil and South Korea, approval must be received from the Brazilian Health Surveillance Agency (Anvisa) and the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS, previously the Korean Food and Drug Administration), respectively. We intend to leverage the
expertise of our local collaborators in these jurisdictions to navigate the regulatory requirements and help determine an efficient and effective pathway to bringing Zertane to market. If required regulatory approvals are obtained, partnerships in
ROW markets will potentially provide additional revenue to us and help to establish the Zertane brand and the role of tramadol hydrochloride in PE around the world. Such clinical experience will be useful as we seek to impact treatment guidelines
for PE and gather post-marketing data to better inform our U.S. NDA submission. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Commercial Strategy </B></P>

ProstaScint<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> from Jazz Pharmaceuticals. ProstaScint Kit, or capromab pendetide, is a radio-labeled monoclonal antibody, which is a biologic product that targets a specific antigen. ProstaScint
targets Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen, or PSMA, a protein uniquely expressed by prostate tissue. A radioactive substance called Indium In 111 is attached to the proprietary, mouse-derived antibody. The radiolabeled antibody infused into the
patient and is taken up by prostate cancer cells which can be detected and visualized with a special nuclear medicine scan (single-photon emission tomography, or SPECT). ProstaScint has been shown to be clinically effective in determining the course
of treatment for a patient who has had a prostatectomy and/or has suspected metastasis (spread of the cancer cells beyond the prostate). Further, ProstaScint has demonstrated efficacy in patients classified as High Risk or with recurrent prostate
cancer. ProstaScint has been approved by the FDA and Health Canada, and significant clinical data exist demonstrating the significant predictive value in prostate cancer staging. </P>

Cancer Society prostate cancer is the most common cancer among men in the United States, with an estimated 218,000 annual cases (as of 2010). Further, more than 1,800,000 men are alive with some history of prostate cancer, and over 30,000 U.S. men
die each year from the disease. The effect of prostate cancer on healthcare economics is substantial, which makes the need for accurate disease staging critical for treatment and management strategies. The U.S. market for the diagnosis and screening
of prostate cancer is expected to total $17.4 billion in 2017, a CAGR of 7.5%. Importantly, ProstaScint is the only FDA-approved radiopharmaceutical (for use in radioimmunoscintigraphy) specifically indicated for prostate cancer screening and is
specifically highlighted in the American Cancer Society practice guidelines for prostate cancer screening and staging. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Prostate cancer is classified into
four stages based on severity: Stage 1 &#150; 4. Stage 3 is considered &#147;High Risk&#148; and Stage 4 is when cancer has become metastatic. Radioimmunoscintigraphy has been established as diagnostic to stage cancer malignancy and one of the most
widespread clinical uses has been for the detection of prostate cancer. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>ProstaScint Clinical Data </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Multiple clinical studies have been conducted in the United States and published in peer-reviewed publications that consistently demonstrate substantial
clinical efficacy of ProstaScint in staging prostate cancer patients and specifically identify whether the cancer is confined to the prostate or has metastasized to other parts of the body. Through more accurate clinical staging and identification
of metastatic prostate cancer, clinicians are able to better direct therapeutic interventions and improve outcomes. A brief summary of key clinical findings for ProstaScint from select studies are summarized below. </P>

</TABLE> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Radiation oncology experts have published numerous papers expressing the potential for expanded use of ProstaScint in prostate
cancer imaging due to advances in imaging technologies since the product&#146;s initial approval. Since the early 2000s significantly greater image resolution has been enabled due to the advent of dual head cameras (and improved imaging in general)
along with the use of co-registered images where radiologists now combine the images of SPECT and computerized tomography, or CT, or magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI. Because of these factors we believe there is significant commercial opportunity
for ProstaScint. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>ProstaScint Product Information </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">ProstaScint is provided as a two-vial kit which contains all of the non-radioactive ingredients necessary to produce a single unit dose for administration by
intravenous injection. The ProstaScint vial contains 0.5&nbsp;mg of capromab pendetide in 1&nbsp;mL of sodium phosphate buffered saline solution adjusted to pH&nbsp;6; a sterile, pyrogen-free, clear, colorless solution that may contain some
translucent particles. The vial of sodium acetate buffer contains 82&nbsp;mg of sodium acetate in 2&nbsp;mL of Water for Injection adjusted to pH&nbsp;5-7 with glacial acetic acid; it is a sterile, pyrogen-free, clear, and colorless solution.
Neither solution contains a preservative. Each kit also includes one sterile 0.22&nbsp;&micro;m Millex<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> GV filter, prescribing information, and two identification labels. It may also be
helpful in conjunction with other scans (CT or MRI) for higher risk patients, by detecting lymph nodes in the abdomen that are involved with prostate cancer cells, but may still appear falsely normal on CT or MRI scans. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The procedure to administer ProstaScint is as follows: the patient is given an intravenous, or IV, infusion of the monoclonal antibody, and 30 minutes later,
a scan is performed. A second scan is done between 96 and 120 hours (4-5 days) after the infusion. The first scan (on the day of the infusion) takes approximately 1 hour, while the second scan takes approximately 2.5 hours. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">ProstaScint is indicated as a diagnostic imaging agent in newly-diagnosed patients with biopsy-proven prostate cancer, thought to be clinically-localized after
standard diagnostic evaluation (e.g.&nbsp;chest x-ray, bone scan, CT scan, or MRI), who are at high-risk for pelvic lymph node metastases. It is not indicated in patients who are not at high risk. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">ProstaScint is also indicated as a diagnostic imaging agent in post-prostatectomy patients with a rising PSA and a negative or equivocal standard metastatic
evaluation in whom there is a high clinical suspicion of occult metastatic disease. The imaging performance of Indium In&nbsp;111 ProstaScint following radiation therapy has not been studied. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The information provided by Indium In&nbsp;111 ProstaScint imaging should be considered in conjunction with other diagnostic information. Scans that are
positive for metastatic disease should be confirmed histologically in patients who are otherwise candidates for surgery or radiation therapy unless medically contraindicated. Scans that are negative for metastatic disease should not be used in lieu
of histological confirmation. ProstaScint is not indicated as a screening tool for carcinoma of the prostate nor for re-administration for the purpose of assessment of response to treatment. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Our Novel Research Instrument &#150; The RedoxSYS System </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our leading diagnostic product candidate, the RedoxSYS System, is now fully developed for research use. The RedoxSYS System was developed by Luoxis Diagnostics
in the two years immediately preceding the Merger between Luoxis, Vyrix, and us in April 2015. Upon the consummation of the Merger, the RedoxSYS System became our asset. Prior to the incorporation of Luoxis, the predecessor technologies that are now
incorporated into the RedoxSYS System were developed by the research team of Dr.&nbsp;David Bar-Or through a predecessor company, DMI BioSciences, Inc. that was acquired by Ampio. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The RedoxSYS System is a novel, portable device that measures oxidation-reduction potential, or ORP, a global measure of oxidative stress. The RedoxSYS System
is the first and only system that measures ORP in biologic specimens to provide a complete measure of redox balance, which is broadly implicated across a wide range of both acute and chronic conditions. To date, Canadian and European regulators have
characterized the RedoxSYS System as Class II medical device and regulated them accordingly. Classification of a medical device as Class II in Europe and Canada indicates that the device is generally regarded as posing medium risk, and non-invasive
medical devices that come into contact with injured skin are generally classified as Class II. As we have conducted initial validation studies with the RedoxSYS System across a range of conditions and obtained a CE marking in Europe and Health
Canada clearance to begin the market development of the RedoxSYS System as a clinical diagnostic in Europe, Canada, and elsewhere around the world where CE marking is recognized, we are now initiating commercialization for use of the RedoxSYS System
as a research tool. By employing a focused commercial infrastructure and a growing network of distributors around the world, we believe we can efficiently penetrate the academic and industry-based research centers who study oxidative stress. With
this growth in the research market, we intend to develop clinical applications for the RedoxSYS System. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our strategy for the RedoxSYS System is to
continue deployment of this system at leading academic centers around the world, develop research collaborations with key opinion leaders in oxidative stress research, identify clinical applications for the platform, and aggressively pursue
infertility studies to establish efficacy of the system in this setting of care. Our plans include introduction of the RedoxSYS System to researchers in the United States through a direct commercial effort while engaging with distributors in major
markets around the world, including Canada, Europe, and Asia (with a focus on Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Oxidative Stress and
the Male Infertility Market Opportunity </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">An early potential opportunity that has presented promise through our research is the application of ORP
in the study of male infertility. ORP represents a unique approach to assessing oxidative stress in male infertility, and early proof-of-concept studies have been conducted. We are now beginning clinical studies with a globally recognized U.S.-based
university in male infertility. Oxidative stress is widely assessed in male infertility laboratories, and we believe the RedoxSYS System, if proven effective, will provide a simple, comprehensive solution to oxidative stress detection and management
of antioxidant and lifestyle intervention in this underserved market. Given the preliminary results obtained from clinical trials conducted in semen analysis, we believe significant opportunity exists to launch a derivative product of RedoxSYS to
specifically assess oxidative stress in the context of male infertility. Accordingly, we developed the MiOXSYS System as a uniquely designed and programmed device specific to the detection of oxidation-reduction potential in semen and seminal fluid.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Oxidative stress plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of male infertility. The presence of excess levels of reactive oxygen species, or ROS, is
associated with both the structural and functional integrity of sperm. Moreover, these increased levels of ROS &#150; the increase of oxidative stress &#150; directly interfere with capacitation and fertilization. It is widely estimated that total
infertility is driven by male infertility in half of the cases, and the major factors influencing the rise in infertility among men are the change in lifestyle, increasing age, and environmental effects. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Of all sexually active adults, 12-15% are infertile and male infertility is the sole cause or contributing factor 50% of the time. The global male infertility
market is large and growing. The market is expected to grow to more than $300 million globally by 2020, with a CAGR of nearly 5% from 2013 to 2020. Despite the prevalence of male infertility, difficulties remain in effectively diagnosis root causes.
Oxidative stress assessment is considered a standard practice but due to various factors is not effectively used routinely. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Potential Role of ORP
in Male Infertility </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Oxidation-reduction potential is defined in the published literature as follows: </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">&#147;ORP in a biological system is an integrated measure of the balance between total oxidants and reductants. In plasma, many constituents contribute to the
ORP. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as the superoxide ion, hydroxyl radical, hydrogen peroxide, nitric oxide, peroxynitrite, transition metal ions, and hypochlorous acid, contribute to the oxidative potential. Plasma reductants include thiols,
vitamin C, tocopherol, &szlig;-carotene, lycopene, uric acid, bilirubin, and flavinoids. Enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, or SOD, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase, are involved in the conversion of ROS into less reactive species. ORP
monitoring of plasma represents a single measurement that integrates the overall quantitative balance among the oxidants and reductants of the system.&#148; </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Given that ORP represents a single, global measure of oxidative stress in a biological system, we believe the potential for ORP to serve as a standardized
marker in semen analysis and other aspects of infertility assessment is significant. A major limitation of oxidative stress assays relates to the fact that there is poor standardization in testing. As many factors contribute to oxidative stress
(e.g., free radical proliferation, antioxidant depletion, DNA damage, etc.), it is important to have an integrated measure that combines all known and unknown oxidants and reductants in the respective system into one measurement. We believe ORP is
an integrated measure of oxidative stress that can be easily and quickly measured with the RedoxSYS System. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:24pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="center"><B>Current assays are

male infertility market is in excess of $300 million, while the broader <I>in vitro</I> diagnostics, or IVD, market is expected to grow to more than $80 billion by 2017. With a substantial base of conditions for which the MiOXSYS System may present
utility, we expect to realize significant revenue potential from this first-in-class system. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Through our collaborative research efforts our scientific
team has identified several diagnoses in which we believe the ORP technology derives distinct values that may be useful in better identifying a patient&#146;s risk for the development of more severe illness &#150; beyond reproductive health and
infertility. Further, we believe the ORP technology has the potential to better stratify patients according to clinical characteristics detected uniquely by ORP measurements. Specific diseases where the RedoxSYS System has been initially studied
include trauma, critical illness, stroke, heart failure, diabetes, and pregnancy. Multiple other clinical areas exist where the system could be studied and potentially applied. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Diagnostics serve a key role in the health value chain by influencing the quality of patient care, health outcomes and downstream resource requirements across
a wide range of clinical conditions. From consumer-friendly at-home pregnancy and glucose monitoring tests to more complex automated laboratory-based systems, these tests are often first-line health decision tools. While diagnostics comprise less
than 5% of hospital costs and about 1.6% of all Medicare costs, their findings are commonly believed to influence as much as 60-70% of health care decision-making. The value of diagnostics accrues not only to clinicians and patients, but to health
care managers, third-party payors and quality assurance organizations that use diagnostic performance to measure and improve health care quality. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">ORP is
a tightly controlled measurement, much like the vital signs routinely measured in medical practice&#151;temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure and oxygen saturation of blood. Abnormal changes in oxidation-reduction potential are
closely associated with poor outcomes in critically ill patients, including traumatic brain injury, multi-trauma injury, stroke, sepsis, and pneumonia. Rapid results are essential for optimal treatment adjustments in critical care areas such as
emergency and intensive care departments. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">ORP results may also help determine which patients are at high risk of early readmission at hospital discharge,
especially patients with heart attack, heart failure, stroke, and pneumonia, and this represents an incremental assessment not afforded by currently available diagnostic tests. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Numerous scientific studies confirm the clinical value of measuring oxidative stress. Recently, a large assortment of blood and cell tests have been used in
research studies to measure separate biomarkers of oxidative stress, such as lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation and total antioxidants, but currently many of these separate biomarker test results are needed to start to assess total oxidative
stress. Despite the importance of assessing oxidative stress, we are not aware of any practical or efficient method for measuring these oxidative stress biomarkers in a point-of-care setting. Oxidative stress is often a marker for inflammation,
which in turn indicates the presence of disease-related processes or developing conditions across a wide array of diseases. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The worldwide IVD market was
$44 billion in 2010 and is projected to grow to $82 billion by 2017. The IVD market includes all laboratory and hospital-based sales and home-use, or over-the counter, product sales covering immunoassays, clinical chemistry, microbiology,
hematology, histology/cytology, point-of-care testing, and over-the-counter diagnostics. The professional point-of-care testing worldwide market is a significant opportunity and was in excess of $5 billion in 2009 and is expected to grow to almost
$7 billion by 2014. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Importantly, critical care (an application for which the RedoxSYS System is targeted) constituted 14% ($700 million) of sales in 2009
with expected CAGR of 5%, and cardiac markers constituted 9% ($435 million) of sales in 2009 with expected CAGR of 8%. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe the RedoxSYS System is the first and only research and clinical diagnostic platform that provides an accurate, easy, and complete real-time
assessment of redox status. Through the development and commercialization of the RedoxSYS System, we are pioneering the true measurement of redox potential, also called oxidation-reduction potential, a novel measure of oxidative stress, which has
been implicated in numerous critical injuries, illnesses, and chronic conditions with significant appreciation of the role of oxidative stress in infertility. We believe the RedoxSYS platform has a broad range of potential in both research and
clinical settings where no other methods exist to measure oxidation-reduction potential in biologic specimens. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Through research directed by
Dr.&nbsp;David Bar-Or and Raphael Bar-Or at Ampio, we believe we have developed the first and only clinical diagnostic device that measures ORP in biologic specimens (i.e., plasma, serum, semen, seminal plasma, cells, tissues, cell cultures, and
others). This device, called the RedoxSYS System, rapidly measures ORP and antioxidant capacity, a global marker of antioxidant reserve and concentration to provide a global picture of oxidative status. The system uses a small, bench top analyzer in
conjunction with small, disposable sensors that work electrochemically without any liquid reagents or difficult sample preparation. The RedoxSYS System has been CE marked and approved for use in Europe and Canada, and we are now collaborating with
major medical centers around the world for its use in research. The RedoxSYS System is an easy-to-use diagnostic device that can be used in various research settings. Further, this portable device can be decentralized to multiple research sites and
enable real-time reporting of oxidative stress values at the patient&#146;s point of care or in a clinical laboratory setting. We received ISO 13485:2003 medical device certification in 2014. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The RedoxSYS System has been developed over an 18-year period by Dr.&nbsp;David Bar-Or, Raphael Bar-Or, and their colleagues, and the research and development
work has focused on both the technical and clinical development of various applications. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>The RedoxSYS System Overview </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The RedoxSYS System is comprised of two distinct, patented components that enable a system capable of measuring the ORP and antioxidant capacity of a
biological fluid: an analyzer and sensor strips. In mechanical terms, ORP is defined as the potential between a working electrode and a reference electrode at equilibrium. The RedoxSYS System has been specifically studied in human whole blood,
serum, plasma, semen, and other biological fluids. The RedoxSYS System measures two distinct elements to determine a patient&#146;s oxidation reduction potential: </P> <P STYLE="font-size:6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

to measure oxidative stress in male infertility are successful, we expect to pursue that intended use for the MiOXSYS System via the FDA 510k de novo pathway. If cleared for the intended use, we intend to seek to commercialize MiOXSYS System as a
new tool for the assessment of oxidative stress in infertility in men. We envision pursuing a direct sales effort to high priority urology/andrology laboratories, infertility clinics and reference centers across the United States. We have identified
the primary, influential centers in the United States and believe our commercial deployment will be efficient through a focused sales and marketing effort. We intend to seek to sell the MiOXSYS System into individual centers and laboratories but
will focus our revenue model on the repeat ordering of the disposable, single use MiOXSYS sensor strips. We expect to realize a substantial gross margin and profit margin on the basis of low cost of goods sold on both components of the system. We
envision an average selling price for the disposable sensors of approximately $25-$40. We envision selling the MiOXSYS analyzers for $5,500 but will also pursue an instrument rental agreement model with minimum disposable sensor purchase
requirements. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We also intend to leverage our urology commercialization efforts with other products with a focus on urology centers, infertility clinics,

representation of our products and penetration of the reproductive health market. Our sales efforts into the research markets will be enabled initially through a full-time business development professional who will focus on collaborative research
and research sales to major oxidative stress centers in the United States. We expect identical pricing in the research market as we intend to pursue in the clinical diagnostics markets. </P>

similar strategy outside the United States for the RedoxSYS and MiOXSYS systems while complementing our efforts in infertility and research with adjunct applications in critical care conditions. To efficiently execute across our strategy, we intend
to utilize a network of established distributors in the target markets in Europe and Asia. We have already engaged with distributors in three European countries and one Asian country, while many other potential distributors are in advanced stages of
discussions with us. We anticipate slightly reduced pricing outside the United States for the disposable sensors given the anticipated lower pricing observed ex-U.S. for diagnostic and research products. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDC Act, and
other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting,
sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs, warning letters,
product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Pharmaceutical product development in the United States typically involves the performance of satisfactory nonclinical, also referred to as pre-clinical,
laboratory and animal studies under the FDA&#146;s Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulation, the development and demonstration of manufacturing processes, which conform to FDA mandated current good manufacturing requirements, or cGMP, including
a quality system regulating manufacturing, the submission and acceptance of an IND application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin in the United States, obtaining the approval of Institutional Review Boards, or IRBs,
at each site where we plan to conduct a clinical trial to protect the welfare and rights of human subjects in clinical trials, adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for
which FDA approval is sought, and the submission to the FDA for review and approval of an NDA. Satisfaction of FDA requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and
novelty of the product or disease. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Pre-clinical tests generally include laboratory evaluation of a product candidate, its chemistry, formulation,
stability and toxicity, as well as certain animal studies to assess its potential safety and efficacy. Results of these pre-clinical tests, together with chemistry, manufacturing controls and analytical data and the clinical trial protocol, which
details the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated, along with other requirements must be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND, which must become effective before
human clinical trials can begin. The entire clinical trial and its protocol must be in compliance with what are referred to as good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements. The term, GCP, is used to refer to various FDA laws and regulations, as well
as international scientific standards intended to protect the rights, health and safety of patients, define the roles of clinical trial sponsors and assure the integrity of clinical trial data. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time
period, raises concerns or questions about the intended conduct of the trials and imposes what is referred to as a clinical hold. Pre-clinical studies generally take several years to complete, and there is no guarantee that an IND based on those
studies will become effective, allowing clinical testing to begin. In addition to FDA review of an IND, each medical site that desires to participate in a proposed clinical trial must have the protocol reviewed and approved by an independent IRB or
Ethics Committee, or EC. The IRB considers, among other things, ethical factors, and the selection and safety of human subjects. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA&#146;s GCP requirements. The FDA and/or IRB may order the
temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial or that a specific clinical trial site be halted at any time, or impose other sanctions for failure to comply with requirements under the appropriate entity jurisdiction. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1 clinical
trials, a product candidate is typically introduced either into healthy human subjects or patients with the medical condition for which the new drug is intended to be used. The main purpose of the trial is to assess a product candidate&#146;s safety
and the ability of the human body to tolerate the product candidate. Phase 1 clinical trials generally include less than 50 subjects or patients. During Phase 2 trials, a product candidate is studied in an exploratory trial or trials in a limited
number of patients with the disease or medical condition for which it is intended to be used in order to: (i)&nbsp;further identify any possible adverse side effects and safety risks, (ii)&nbsp;assess the preliminary or potential efficacy of the
product candidate for specific target diseases or medical conditions, and (iii)&nbsp;assess dosage tolerance and determine the optimal dose for Phase 3 trials. Phase 3 trials are generally undertaken to demonstrate clinical efficacy and to further
test for safety in an expanded patient population with the goal of evaluating the overall risk-benefit relationship of the product candidate. Phase 3 trials are generally designed to reach a specific goal or endpoint, the achievement of which is
intended to demonstrate the candidate product&#146;s clinical efficacy and adequate information for labeling of the approved drug. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There are three main
types of NDAs, which are covered by Section&nbsp;505 of the FDC Act: (1)&nbsp;an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and efficacy (Section 505(b)(1)); (2)&nbsp;an application that contains full reports of
investigations of safety and effectiveness but where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the application has not obtained a right of reference (Section
505(b)(2)); and (3)&nbsp;an application that contains information to show that the proposed product is identical in active ingredient, dosage form, strength, route of administration, labeling, quality, performance characteristics, and intended use,
among other things, to a previously approved product (Section 505(j)). Section&nbsp;505(b)(2) expressly permits the FDA to rely, for approval of an NDA, on data not developed by the applicant. In the pre-IND briefing meeting with Ampio and in June
2012, the FDA agreed that our NDA may be submitted under Section&nbsp;505(b)(2). As such, we intend to rely on studies published in the scientific literature and reference FDA-approved NDAs for tramadol-containing products (NDAs 21-693, 20-281 and
21-692) to support the safety and efficacy demonstrated in our clinical program. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared
and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the U.S. The NDA must include the results of all pre-clinical, clinical, and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the
product&#146;s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, currently
exceeding $2.3 million and the manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved NDA are also subject to annual product and establishment user fees, currently approximately $0.1 million per product and $0.6 million per establishment. These fees are
typically increased annually. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on
the FDA&#146;s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of
NDAs. Most such applications for standard review drug products are reviewed within ten months; most applications for priority review drugs are reviewed in six months. Priority review can be applied to drugs that the FDA determines offer major
advances in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or
information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission. The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory
committee&#151;typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts&#151;for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but
it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is
manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with cGMP is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response
letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA&#146;s
satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. An approval letter authorizes commercial
marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the
potential risks. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe
use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS
can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug&#146;s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be
withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>The Hatch-Waxman Act
</I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent whose claims cover the applicant&#146;s
product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA&#146;s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the
Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and
dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown through bioequivalence testing to be therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are not required to conduct, or submit
results of, pre-clinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as &#147;generic equivalents&#148; to the listed drug, and can often be substituted by
pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed
for the approved product in the FDA&#146;s Orange Book that: 1) the required patent information has not been filed; 2) the listed patent has expired; 3) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought
after patent expiration; or 4) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product&#146;s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is
called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA
and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement
lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case
that is favorable to the ANDA applicant. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The ANDA application also will not be approved until any non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for
the referenced product has expired. Federal law provides a period of five years following approval of a drug containing no previously approved active ingredients during which ANDAs for generic versions of those drugs cannot be submitted, unless the
submission contains a Paragraph IV challenge to a listed patent&#151;in which case the submission may be made four years following the original product approval. Federal law provides for a period of three years of exclusivity during which FDA cannot
grant effective approval of an ANDA based on the approval of a listed drug that contains previously approved active ingredients but is approved in a new dosage form, route of administration or combination, or for a new use; the approval of which was
required to be supported by new clinical trials conducted by, or for, the applicant. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Post-Approval Regulation </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Even if a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval is typically limited to specific clinical indications. Further, even after regulatory
approval is obtained, subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on its use or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. Any FDA-approved products manufactured or distributed by us
are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including record-keeping requirements and reporting of adverse events or experiences. Further, drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA
and state agencies, and are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA and state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose rigorous procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our contract manufacturers. We cannot be certain that we
or our present or future contract manufacturers or suppliers will be able to comply with cGMP regulations and other FDA regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in, among other things, total or partial suspension
of production activities, failure of the FDA to grant approval for marketing, and withdrawal, suspension, or revocation of marketing approvals. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If the FDA approves one or more of our product candidates, we and the contract manufacturers we use for
manufacture of clinical supplies and commercial supplies must provide certain updated safety and efficacy information. Product changes, as well as certain changes in the manufacturing process or facilities where the manufacturing occurs or other
post-approval changes may necessitate additional FDA review and approval. The labeling, advertising, promotion, marketing and distribution of a drug or biologic product or medical devices, also must be in compliance with FDA and Federal Trade
Commission, or FTC, requirements which include, among others, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the
Internet. The FDA and FTC have very broad enforcement authority, and failure to abide by these regulations can result in penalties, including the issuance of a warning letter directing us to correct deviations from regulatory standards and
enforcement actions that can include seizures, fines, injunctions and criminal prosecution. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Approval Process for Medical Devices </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the United States, the FDCA, FDA regulations and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and
development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post-market surveillance. The FDA
regulates the design, manufacturing, servicing, sale and distribution of medical devices, including molecular diagnostic test kits and instrumentation systems. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of
administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending applications, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and
criminal prosecution. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Unless an exemption applies, each medical device we wish to distribute commercially in the United States will require marketing
authorization from the FDA prior to distribution. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a device are premarket notification, also called 510(k) clearance, and premarket approval, also called PMA approval. The type of
marketing authorization is generally linked to the classification of the device. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes (Class I, II or III) based on the degree of risk the FDA determines to be associated with a device and the
level of regulatory control deemed necessary to ensure the device&#146;s safety and effectiveness. Devices requiring fewer controls because they are deemed to pose lower risk are placed in Class I or II. Class I devices are deemed to pose the least
risk and are subject only to general controls applicable to all devices, such as requirements for device labeling, premarket notification and adherence to the FDA&#146;s current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, known as the Quality System
Regulations, or QSR. Class II devices are intermediate risk devices that are subject to general controls and may also be subject to special controls such as performance standards, product-specific guidance documents, special labeling requirements,
patient registries or post-market surveillance. Class III devices are those for which insufficient information exists to assure safety and effectiveness solely through general or special controls and include life sustaining, life-supporting or
implantable devices, devices of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, or which present a potential, unreasonable risk of illness or injury. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Most Class I devices and some Class II devices are exempted by regulation from the 510(k) clearance requirement and can be marketed without prior
authorization from the FDA. Some Class I devices that have not been so exempted and Class II devices are eligible for marketing through the 510(k) clearance pathway. By contrast, devices placed in Class III generally require PMA approval or 510(k)
de novo clearance prior to commercial marketing. The PMA approval process is more stringent, time-consuming and expensive than the 510(k) clearance process, however, the 510(k) clearance process has also become increasingly stringent and expensive.
The FDA has provided initial guidance to us that the RedoxSYS System is appropriate for the 510(k) clearance process, likely through the de novo pathway. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">510(k) Clearance. To obtain 510(k) clearance for a medical device, an applicant must submit a premarket notification to the FDA demonstrating that the device
is &#147;substantially equivalent&#148; to a device legally marketed in the United States that is not subject to PMA approval, commonly known as the &#147;predicate device.&#148; A device is substantially equivalent if, with respect to the predicate
device, it has the same intended use and has either (i)&nbsp;the same technological characteristics or (ii)&nbsp;different technological characteristics and the information submitted demonstrates that the device is as safe and effective as a legally
marketed device and does not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness. A showing of substantial equivalence sometimes, but not always, requires clinical data. Generally, the 510(k) clearance process can exceed 90 days and may extend to a
year or more. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Application fees must accompany medical device submissions. Such fees under the Medical Device User Fees Act, or MDUFA, for 2015 are
approximately $258,000 for a full fee application and approximately $5,000 for a 510(k). Fees are adjusted annually. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There are also establishment
registration and reporting fees of approximately $4,000 and $9,000, respectively. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">After a device has received 510(k) clearance for a specific intended
use, any change or modification that significantly affects its safety or effectiveness, such as a significant change in the design, materials, method of manufacture or intended use, may require a new 510(k) clearance or PMA approval and payment of
an FDA user fee. The determination as to whether or not a modification could significantly affect the device&#146;s safety or effectiveness is initially left to the manufacturer using available FDA guidance; however, the FDA may review this
determination to evaluate the regulatory status of the modified product at any time and may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is obtained. The manufacturer may also be
subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Before we can submit a medical device for 510(k) clearance, we may have to perform a series of generally short
studies over a period of months, including method comparison, reproducibility, interference and stability studies to ensure that users can perform the test successfully. Some of these studies may take place in clinical environments, but are not
usually considered clinical trials. For PMA submissions, we would generally be required to conduct a longer clinical trial over a period of years that supports the clinical utility of the device and how the device will be used. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Although clinical investigations of most devices are subject to the investigational device exemption, or IDE, requirements, clinical investigations of
diagnostic tests, including our products and products under development, are generally exempt from the IDE requirements. Thus, clinical investigations by intended users for intended uses of our products generally do not require the FDA&#146;s prior
approval but may require approval of an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, and written informed consent by the patient, provided the clinical evaluation testing is non-invasive, does not require an invasive sampling procedure that presents a
significant risk, does not intentionally introduce energy into the subject and is not used as a diagnostic procedure without confirmation by another medically established test or procedure. In addition, our products must be labeled per FDA
regulations &#147;for research use only- RUO&#148; or &#147;for investigational use only-IUO,&#148; and distribution controls must be established to assure that our products distributed for research, method comparisons or clinical evaluation studies
are used only for those purposes. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Regulation after FDA Clearance or Approval </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Any devices we manufacture or distribute pursuant to clearance or approval by the FDA are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA and certain
state agencies. We are required to adhere to applicable regulations setting forth detailed cGMP requirements, as set forth in the QSR, which include, among other things, testing, control and documentation requirements. Noncompliance with these
standards can result in, among other things, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls or seizures of products, total or partial suspension of production, refusal of the government to grant 510(k) clearance or PMA approval of devices, withdrawal
of marketing approvals and criminal prosecutions, fines and imprisonment. Our contract manufacturers&#146; facilities operate under the FDA&#146;s cGMP requirements. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Foreign Regulatory Approval </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Outside of the United
States, our ability to market our product candidates will be contingent also upon our receiving marketing authorizations from the appropriate foreign regulatory authorities, whether or not FDA approval has been obtained. The foreign regulatory
approval process in most industrialized countries generally encompasses risks similar to those we will encounter in the FDA approval process. The requirements governing conduct of clinical trials and marketing authorizations, and the time required
to obtain requisite approvals, may vary widely from country to country and differ from those required for FDA approval. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the European Union, we are
required under the European Medical Device Directive (Council Directive 93/42/EEC) to affix the CE mark to certain of our products in order to sell the products in member countries of the European Union. The CE mark is an international symbol that
represents adherence to certain essential principles of safety and effectiveness mandated in the European Medical Device Directive, which are referred to as the &#147;essential requirements&#148;. Once affixed, the CE mark enables a product to be
sold within the European Economic Area, or EEA, which is composed of the 28 member states of the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein as well as other countries that accept the CE mark. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">To demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements, we must undergo a conformity assessment procedure which varies according to the type of medical
device and its classification. Except for low risk medical devices (Class I with no measuring function and which are not sterile) where the manufacturer can issue an EC Declaration of Conformity based on a self-assessment of the conformity of its
products with the essential requirements of the Medical Devices Directive, a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of an organization accredited by a member state of the EEA to conduct conformity assessments, or a notified body.
Depending on the relevant conformity assessment procedure, the notified body would typically audit and examine the technical file and the quality system for the manufacture, design and final inspection of our devices. The notified body issues a CE
certificate of Conformity following successful completion of a conformity assessment procedure conducted in relation to the medical device and its manufacturer and their conformity with the essential requirements. This certificate entitles the
manufacturer to affix the CE mark to its medical devices after having prepared and signed a related EC Declaration of Conformity. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If we modify our
devices we may need to apply for permission to affix the CE mark to the modified product. Additionally, we may need to apply for a CE mark for any new products that we may develop in the future. Certain products regulated as medical devices
according to EC-Directives are subject to vigilance requirements for reporting of adverse events. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We will be subject to additional regulations in other
countries in which we market, sell and import our products, including Canada. We or our distributors must receive all necessary approvals or clearance prior to marketing and/or importing our products in those markets. </P>

failure to comply with regulatory requirements subjects firms to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines, imprisonment or other
penalties, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals, or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. In addition, even
if a firm complies with FDA and other requirements, new information regarding the safety or effectiveness of a product could lead the FDA to modify or withdraw product approval. Prohibitions or restrictions on sales or withdrawal of future products

patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for
patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product&#146;s approval date. The patent term
restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an
approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for
any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, if any of our NDA&#146;s are approved, we intend to apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond the current expiration
date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA. </P>

previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. Recently, the FDA stated that it may change its interpretation of 5-year NCE exclusivity
determinations to apply to each drug substance in a fixed-combination drug product, not for the drug product as a whole. If this change is implemented, for example, a fixed-combination drug product that contains a drug substance with a single, new
active moiety would be eligible for 5 year NCE exclusivity, even if the fixed-combination also contains a drug substance with a previously approved active moiety. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new
drug application, or ANDA, or a Section&nbsp;505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovator drug or for
another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or
non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than
bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity
covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of
use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the pre-clinical studies and
adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Orphan drug exclusivity, as described above, may offer a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity, except in certain circumstances. Pediatric
exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other
exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued &#147;Written Request&#148; for such a trial. </P>

of two of our product candidates (Zertane and the RedoxSYS System), once approved for sale, will be heavily dependent upon reimbursement by third-party payors. Traditionally, sales of pharmaceutical products that are not &#147;life style&#148;
indications depend, in part, on the extent to which products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly reducing
reimbursements for medical products and services. ProstaScint is dependent upon reimbursement for continued use in the U.S. market, and ProstaScint does have a reimbursement code as assigned by the American Medical Association. ProstaScint is
currently reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid, and various private health plans. However, reimbursement is not universally available throughout the United States for ProstaScint. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Lack of third-party reimbursement for our product candidate or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our product candidates could reduce physician
usage of the product candidate and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, in some
foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member
states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal
product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations
for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally tend to be
significantly lower. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>DEA Regulation </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Zertane,
because it contains tramadol, will be regulated as a &#147;controlled substance&#148; as defined in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, or CSA, and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency&#146;s, or DEA, implementing regulations, which establish
registration, security, recordkeeping, reporting, storage, distribution, importation, exportation, inventory, quota and other requirements administered by the DEA. These requirements are directly applicable to us and also applicable to our
manufacturers and to distributors, prescribers and dispensers of Zertane. The DEA regulates the handling of controlled substances through a closed chain of distribution. This control extends to the equipment and raw materials used in their
manufacture and packaging in order to prevent loss and diversion into illicit channels of commerce. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The DEA regulates controlled substances as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances. Schedule I substances by
definition have no established medicinal use, and may not be marketed or sold in the United States. A pharmaceutical product may be listed as Schedule&nbsp;II, III, IV or V. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We expect that Zertane will be listed by the DEA as Schedule IV controlled substances under the CSA. Consequently, any importation of API for Zertane, as well
as the manufacture, shipping, storage, sales and use of Zertane, will be subject to a high degree of regulation. Also, distribution and dispensing of these drugs are highly regulated. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Annual registration is required for any facility that manufactures, distributes, dispenses, imports or exports any controlled substance. The registration is
specific to the particular location, activity and controlled substance schedule. For example, separate registrations are needed for import and manufacturing, and each registration will specify which schedules of controlled substances are authorized.
Similarly, separate registrations are also required for separate facilities. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The DEA typically inspects a facility to review its security measures prior
to issuing a registration and on a periodic basis. Reports must also be made for thefts or losses of any controlled substance, and to obtain authorization to destroy any controlled substance. In addition, special permits and notification
requirements apply to imports and exports of narcotic drugs. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The DEA establishes annually an aggregate quota for how much of a controlled substance may
be produced in total in the United States based on the DEA&#146;s estimate of the quantity needed to meet legitimate scientific and medicinal needs. The DEA may adjust aggregate production quotas and individual production and procurement quotas from
time to time during the year, although the DEA has substantial discretion in whether or not to make such adjustments. Our or our manufacturers&#146; quotas of an active ingredient may not be sufficient to meet commercial demand or complete clinical
trials. Any delay, limitation or refusal by the DEA in establishing our or our manufacturers&#146; quota for controlled substances could delay or stop our clinical trials or product launches, which could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial position and results of operations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">To enforce these requirements, the DEA conducts periodic inspections of registered establishments
that handle controlled substances. Failure to maintain compliance with applicable requirements, particularly as manifested in loss or diversion, can result in administrative, civil or criminal enforcement action that could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations, or initiate administrative proceedings to revoke those registrations. In some circumstances, violations
could result in criminal proceedings. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Individual states also independently regulate controlled substances. We and our manufacturers will be subject to
state regulation on distribution of these products, including, for example, state requirements for licensures or registration. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Intellectual Property

proprietary know-how, our competitive position and business prospects could be materially harmed. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We expect to seek United States and foreign patent
protection for drug and diagnostic products we discover, as well as therapeutic and diagnostic products and processes. We expect also to seek patent protection or rely upon trade secret rights to protect certain other technologies which may be used
to discover and characterize drugs and diagnostic products and processes, and which may be used to develop novel therapeutic and diagnostic products and processes. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The patent positions of companies such as ours involve complex legal and factual questions and, therefore, their enforceability cannot be predicted with any
certainty. Our issued and licensed patents, and those that may be issued to us in the future, may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights granted under the patents or licenses may not provide us with meaningful protection or
competitive advantages. Our competitors may independently develop similar technologies or duplicate any technology developed by us, which could offset any advantages we might otherwise realize from our intellectual property. Furthermore, even if our
product candidates receive regulatory approval, the time required for development, testing, and regulatory review could mean that protection afforded us by our patents may only remain in effect for a short period after commercialization. The
expiration of patents or license rights we hold could adversely affect our ability to successfully commercialize our pharmaceutical drugs or diagnostics, thus harming our operating results and financial position. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We will be able to protect our proprietary intellectual property rights from unauthorized use by third parties primarily to the extent that such rights are
covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets. If we must litigate to protect our intellectual property from infringement, we may incur substantial costs and our officers may be forced to devote significant
time to litigation-related matters. The laws of certain foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our pending patent applications, or those we may file or license from third parties in the future, may not result in patents being issued. Until a patent is
issued, the claims covered by an application for patent may be narrowed or removed entirely, thus depriving us of adequate protection. As a result, we may face unanticipated competition, or conclude that without patent rights the risk of bringing
product candidates to market exceeds the returns we are likely to obtain. We are generally aware of the scientific research being conducted in the areas in which we focus our research and development efforts, but patent applications filed by others
are maintained in secrecy for at least 18 months and, in some cases in the United States, until the patent is issued. The publication of discoveries in scientific literature often occurs substantially later than the date on which the underlying
discoveries were made. As a result, it is possible that patent applications for products similar to our drug or diagnostic products and product candidates may have already been filed by others without our knowledge. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights, and it is
possible that our development of products and product candidates could be challenged by other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies. If we become involved in litigation concerning the enforceability, scope and validity of the proprietary rights
of others, we may incur significant litigation or licensing expenses, be prevented from further developing or commercializing a product or product candidate, be required to seek licenses that may not be available from third parties on commercially
acceptable terms, if at all, or subject us to compensatory or punitive damage awards. Any of these consequences could materially harm our business. </P>

Antidepressant drugs are sometimes prescribed &#147;off-label&#148; and have numerous shortcomings, including side effects such as nausea, headaches, drop of libido, and ED, need for chronic dosing, ramp up periods, variable responses and unwanted

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Dapoxetine (brand name Priligy, owned by Furiex Pharmaceuticals, Inc, which is owned by Actavis plc, is currently
the only approved oral prescription drug to treat PE, with approval in several European countries. Priligy is not approved in the United States. In addition, we are aware of a topical product in late-stage development for PE by Plethora Solutions
referred to as PSD502 and studies of Botox for the treatment of PE are being conducted in the United States. These products &#150; if approved in the United States &#150; would represent competition and alternative choices for physicians and
potential patients. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, generic tramadol hydrochloride is available in the United States and abroad for treatment of pain. Although the generic
drug is not available in the same dosage as Zertane for treatment of PE, it is possible that physicians could prescribe the generic version of the drug &#147;off label&#148; for the treatment of PE instead of Zertane, if Zertane is approved for
commercialization. Patients could use generic tramadol hydrochloride dosages that are either higher or lower than what will be approved for Zertane or they could attempt to split dosages to arrive at the dosages approved for Zertane. While any such
&#147;off label&#148; use of generic tramadol hydrochloride for treatment of PE may constitute infringement of the Vyrix patent portfolio, liability in that circumstance would be at the level of the physician or the patient making enforcement
difficult or impractical. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Currently, there are several FDA approved imaging techniques for cancer in general, however there is only one specifically
targeting prostate cancer&#151;ProstaScint. The other imaging methods are F18-fluorodeoxyglucose (F18-FDG), C11-Acetate, and C11-Choline. The primary advantage of these methods is that they all use PET imaging, a technique with better resolution
than SPECT. The use of PET is also a disadvantage, however, since it uses radiolabels with short half-lives necessitating the need for a local or on-site cyclotron to generate the labels. The half-life of fluorine-18 (F18) and of carbon-11 (C11) are
approximately 110 and 20 minutes, respectively. The radiolabel used by ProstaScint is Indium-11, with a half-life of about 2-3 days. This longer time period allows the radiolabel to be made remotely and shipped to the imaging facility; however it
does use SPECT as the imaging modality. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As indicated, ProstaScint is the only radio-imaging marker that is specific for prostate cancer. ProstaScint is
based on radiolabeling the antibody against prostate specific membrane antigen, or PSMA, a protein express by prostate cells. This specificity for prostate cells is what allows ProstaScint to detect the metastases of prostate cancer regardless of
location. The mechanism of labeling for F18-FDG, C11-Acetate, and C11-Choline is the intracellular accumulation of these markers in cancer cells, due to the fact that cancer cells typically have a higher cellular metabolism than non-cancerous cells.
Thus, these markers can accumulate in any type of cancer cell with a high metabolism, unfortunately prostate cancer cells tend to have a lower cellular metabolism resulting in higher false positives attributed to hyperplasia and prostatitis. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In a meta-analysis of 21 studies evaluating accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive/negative predictive values, ProstaScint using combined SPECT/CT
imaging was comparable to PET/CT imaging based on F18-FDG and C11-Choline. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There are other oxidative stress diagnostic tests available throughout the

competition to the RedoxSYS System. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our competitors may also succeed in obtaining FDA or other regulatory approvals for their product candidates more
rapidly than we are able to do, which could place us at a significant competitive disadvantage or deny us marketing exclusivity rights. Market acceptance of our product candidates will depend on a number of factors, including: (i)&nbsp;potential
advantages over existing or alternative therapies or tests, (ii)&nbsp;the actual or perceived safety of similar classes of products, (iii)&nbsp;the effectiveness of sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities, and (iv)&nbsp;the scope of any

incurred losses in each year since our inception. Our net loss for the years ended June&nbsp;30, 2015 and 2014 was $7.7 million and $5.6 million, respectively. We have not demonstrated the ability to be a profit-generating enterprise, and without
significant financing, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We expect to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future. Our ability to generate revenue is uncertain, and we may never achieve
profitability. We have a very limited operating history on which investors can evaluate our potential for future success. Potential investors should evaluate us in light of the expenses, delays, uncertainties, and complications typically encountered

expect to receive. To obtain revenues from our products and product candidates, we must succeed, either alone or with others, in a range of challenging activities, including expanding markets for our existing products and completing clinical trials
of our product candidates, obtaining positive results from the clinical trials, achieving marketing approval for these product candidates, manufacturing, marketing and selling our existing products and those products for which we, or our
collaborators, may obtain marketing approval, satisfying any post-marketing requirements and obtaining reimbursement for our products from private insurance or government payors. We, and our collaborators, if any, may never succeed in these

other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements or a combination of these approaches. In any event, we will require additional capital to obtain regulatory approval for, and to commercialize, our product candidates. Raising
funds in the current economic environment, as well our lack of operating history, may present additional challenges. Even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans, we may seek additional capital if market

issuance, may cause the market price of our shares to decline. The sale of additional equity or convertible securities would dilute all of our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed payment obligations and we
may be required to agree to certain restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could
adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. We could also be required to seek funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or otherwise at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable and we may be required to relinquish

review and regulation by numerous government authorities in the United States and in other countries where we intend to test and, if approved, market any product candidate. Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any product
candidate, we must demonstrate through pre-clinical testing and clinical trials that the product candidate is safe and effective for use in each target indication. This process can take many years and may include post-marketing studies and
surveillance, which will require the expenditure of substantial resources. Of the large number of drugs in development in the U.S., only a small percentage successfully completes the FDA regulatory approval process and is commercialized.

approval for and successfully market any product candidate. Moreover, because a substantial portion of our business is dependent upon our existing product candidates, any such setback in our pursuit of regulatory approval would have a material
adverse effect on our business and prospects. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Favorable results in the prior clinical trials of Zertane outside of the United States may not be

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in late-stage clinical trials even after achieving
promising results in earlier-stage development. The prior clinical trials of Zertane showed favorable safety and efficacy data; however, we will have different enrollment criteria in our planned Phase 3 clinical trials. In the Phase 2 clinical
trials, we were able to enroll patients utilizing a broader definition of PE. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Ejaculation latency, most commonly quantified using intravaginal
ejaculation latency time, or IELT, is a dominant component of PE assessment in clinical trials. IELT is defined as the time between vaginal intromission and intravaginal ejaculation. Although a standard cut-off for ejaculatory latency does not
exist, it has been suggested that an IELT of two minutes or less may serve as an adequately sensitive criterion for defining PE and some studies have used IELT values from one to two minutes for defining PE. In a pre-IND meeting with FDA, we agreed
to use an IELT of less than or equal to 1 minute as one of the enrollment criteria for our planned Phase 3 clinical trials. The previous European Phase 3 trials allowed for an IELT of less than two minutes however a significant proportion of
enrollees had an IELT of one minute or less. In our planned Phase 3 clinical trials, we will be utilizing the definition of lifelong PE adopted by the International Society for Sexual Medicine, or the ISSM: &#147;premature ejaculation is a male
sexual dysfunction characterized by ejaculation which always or nearly always occurs prior to or within a minute of vaginal penetration; and inability to delay ejaculation on all or nearly all vaginal penetrations; and negative personal
consequences, such as distress, bother, frustration and/or the avoidance of sexual intimacy.&#148; As a result, we may encounter difficulty enrolling a sufficient number of patients in a timely fashion and we may not observe a similarly favorable
safety and efficacy profile as our prior clinical trials. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, Ampio obtained guidance from the FDA on our planned Phase 3 trials at a pre-IND
meeting held in June 2012, including information to help us define the target patient population, select co-primary endpoints and design an acceptable patient-reported outcome measure. As a result of direction provided at the meeting, along with the
existing data from six clinical trials of Zertane conducted outside the U.S. to date, we believe we are positioned to advance Zertane into Phase 3 clinical trials in the United States. However, we can provide no assurance that the FDA will not
change its guidance about our planned Phase 3 clinical trials and require us to significantly modify the design of, or endpoints for, our planned clinical trials. Any change in the guidance we have received could delay and/or render more expensive
our planned Phase 3 trial for Zertane. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We were not involved in any of the prior clinical studies for Zertane and are relying on the data collected from
those prior clinical trials by various third parties, including a previous partner of our majority stockholder, Ampio Pharmaceuticals. Dr.&nbsp;David Bar-Or (now the Chief Scientific Officer of Ampio Pharmaceuticals) discovered the utility of
tramadol hydrochloride for the treatment of PE in June 1999, and this discovery and accompanying intellectual property were at that time the property of DMI BioSciences, Inc., or DMI BioSciences. DMI BioSciences conducted various clinical trials,
prior to licensing the worldwide rights to tramadol hydrochloride for PE to Biovail Laboratories International, or Biovail. Biovail also conducted several clinical trials and began two Phase 3 clinical trials, which trials were completed by Ampio
upon its acquisition of DMI Biosciences, to whom the rights had reverted. This lack of prior involvement may have a negative impact on our understanding of these prior clinical trials and the design of our planned Phase 3 trial. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Acquiring new products will be an important factor in our sales growth, including products that already have been developed and found market acceptance. If we
fail to identify existing or emerging consumer markets and trends and to acquire new products, we will not develop a strong revenue source to help pay for our development activities as well as possible acquisitions. This would delay our business
plan, which could have a negative adverse effect on our business and prospects. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>If we do not secure collaborations with strategic partners to test,

result, collaboration agreements may not lead to development or commercialization of our product candidates in the most efficient manner or at all. For example, our former collaborator that licensed Zertane conducted clinical trials which we believe

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Pre-clinical testing and clinical trials are long, expensive and unpredictable processes that can be subject to extensive delays. We cannot guarantee that any
clinical studies will be conducted as planned or completed on schedule, if at all. It may take several years to complete the pre-clinical testing and clinical development necessary to commercialize a drug or biologic, and delays or failure can occur
at any stage. Interim results of clinical trials do not necessarily predict final results, and success in pre-clinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful. A number of companies in the
pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials even after promising results in earlier trials and we cannot be certain that we will not face similar setbacks. The design of a clinical trial
can determine whether its results will support approval of a product and flaws in the design of a clinical trial may not become apparent until the clinical trial is well advanced. An unfavorable outcome in one or more trials would be a major
set-back for that product candidate and for us. Due to our limited financial resources, an unfavorable outcome in one or more trials may require us to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more product development programs, which could
have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects and financial condition and on the value of our common stock. </P>

Section&nbsp;505(b)(2) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended, or the FDCA. NDAs submitted under this section are eligible to receive FDA approval by relying in part on the FDA&#146;s findings of safety and efficacy for a previously approved
drug. We specifically intend to do this for Zertane. The FDA&#146;s 1999 guidance on Section&nbsp;505(b)(2) applications states that new indications for a previously approved drug, a new combination product, a modified active ingredient, or changes
in dosage form, strength, formulation, and route of administration of a previously approved product are encompassed within the Section&nbsp;505(b)(2) NDA process. Relying on Section&nbsp;505(b)(2) is advantageous because we or our collaborators may
not be required (i)&nbsp;to perform the full range of safety and efficacy trials that is otherwise required to secure approval of a new drug, and (ii)&nbsp;obtain a &#147;right of reference&#148; from the applicant that obtained approval of the
previously approved drug. However, a Section&nbsp;505(b)(2) application must support the proposed change of the previously approved drug by including necessary and adequate information, as determined by the FDA, and the FDA may still require us to
perform a portion or the full range of safety and efficacy trials. There can be no assurance that we would be successful under any Section&nbsp;505(b)(2) application. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In order to market and sell our products in the European Union and many other jurisdictions, we, and our collaborators, must obtain separate marketing
approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The approval procedure varies among countries and may involve additional testing. We may conduct clinical trials for, and seek regulatory approval to market, our product
candidates in countries other than the United States. Depending on the results of clinical trials and the process for obtaining regulatory approvals in other countries, we may decide to first seek regulatory approvals of a product candidate in
countries other than the United States, or we may simultaneously seek regulatory approvals in the United States and other countries. If we or our collaborators seek marketing approval for a product candidate outside the United States, we will be
subject to the regulatory requirements of health authorities in each country in which we seek approval. With respect to marketing authorizations in Europe, we will be required to submit a European Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, to the
European Medicines Agency, or EMA, which conducts a validation and scientific approval process in evaluating a product for safety and efficacy. The approval procedure varies among regions and countries and may involve additional testing, and the
time required to obtain approval may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Obtaining regulatory approvals from health authorities in
countries outside the United States is likely to subject us to all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval described above. In addition, marketing approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by the health authorities of any other
country, and approval by foreign health authorities does not ensure marketing approval by the FDA. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Even if we, or our collaborators, obtain

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Even if we receive regulatory approval for a product candidate, this approval may carry conditions that limit the market for the product or put the product at
a competitive disadvantage relative to alternative therapies. For instance, a regulatory approval may limit the indicated uses for which we can market a product or the patient population that may utilize the product, or may be required to carry a
warning in its labeling and on its packaging. Products with boxed warnings are subject to more restrictive advertising regulations than products without such warnings. These restrictions could make it more difficult to market any product candidate
effectively. Accordingly, assuming we, or our collaborators, receive marketing approval for one or more of our product candidates, we, and our collaborators expect to continue to expend time, money and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Any of our products and product candidates for which we, or our collaborators, obtain marketing approval in the future could be subject to
post-marketing restrictions or withdrawal from the market and we, and our collaborators, may be subject to substantial penalties if we, or they, fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we, or they, experience unanticipated problems with
our products following approval. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Any of our approved products and product candidates for which we, or our collaborators, obtain marketing
approval, as well as the manufacturing processes, post-approval studies and measures, labeling, advertising and promotional activities for such products, among other things, are or will be subject to continual requirements of and review by the FDA
and other regulatory authorities. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration and listing requirements, requirements relating to manufacturing, quality control, quality assurance
and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping. Even if marketing approval of a product candidate is granted, the approval may be subject to limitations on
the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, including the FDA requirement to implement a REMS to ensure that the benefits of a drug or biological product outweigh its risks. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The FDA may also impose requirements for costly post-marketing studies or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of a product. The
FDA and other agencies, including the Department of Justice, closely regulate and monitor the post-approval marketing and promotion of products to ensure that they are manufactured, marketed and distributed only for the approved indications and in
accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. The FDA imposes stringent restrictions on manufacturers&#146; communications regarding off-label use and if we, or our collaborators, do not market any of our product candidates for which we,
or they, receive marketing approval for only their approved indications, we, or they, may be subject to warnings or enforcement action for off-label marketing. Violation of the FDCA and other statutes, including the False Claims Act, relating to the
promotion and advertising of prescription drugs may lead to investigations or allegations of violations of federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws and state consumer protection laws. </P>

the DEA will need to determine the controlled substance schedule, taking into account the recommendation of the FDA. This may be a lengthy process that could delay our marketing of a product candidate and could potentially diminish any regulatory
exclusivity periods for which we may be eligible. Zertane will, and our other product candidates may, if approved, be regulated as &#147;controlled substances&#148; as defined in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, or CSA, and the implementing
regulations of the DEA, which establish registration, security, recordkeeping, reporting, storage, distribution, importation, exportation, inventory, quota and other requirements administered by the DEA. These requirements are applicable to us, to
our third-party manufacturers and to distributors, prescribers and dispensers of our product candidates. The DEA regulates the handling of controlled substances through a closed chain of distribution. This control extends to the equipment and raw
materials used in their manufacture and packaging, in order to prevent loss and diversion into illicit channels of commerce. A number of states and foreign countries also independently regulate these drugs as controlled substances. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The DEA regulates controlled substances as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances. Schedule I substances by definition have no established medicinal use, and

abuse among such substances. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We expect that Zertane will, and our other product candidates may, be listed by the DEA as Schedule IV controlled substances
under the CSA. Consequently, the manufacturing, shipping, storing, selling and using of the products will be subject to a high degree of regulation. Also, distribution, prescribing and dispensing of these drugs are highly regulated. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Annual registration is required for any facility that manufactures, distributes, dispenses, imports or exports any controlled substance. The registration is

and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or the Health Care Reconciliation Act, are expected to significantly impact the provision of, and payment for, health care in the United States. Various provisions of these laws have only
recently taken effect or have yet to take effect, and are designed to expand Medicaid eligibility, subsidize insurance premiums, provide incentives for businesses to provide health care benefits, prohibit denials of coverage due to pre-existing
conditions, establish health insurance exchanges, and provide additional support for medical research. Amendments to the PPACA and/or the Health Care Reconciliation Act, as well as new legislative proposals to reform healthcare and government
insurance programs, along with the trend toward managed healthcare in the United States, could influence the purchase of medicines and medical devices and reduce demand and prices for our products and product candidates, if approved. This could harm
our or our collaborators&#146; ability to market any products and generate revenues. Although we do not expect to receive significant revenues from reimbursement of our products by commercial third-party payors and government payors, cost
containment measures that health care payors and providers are instituting and the effect of further health care reform could significantly reduce potential revenues from the sale of any of our products and product candidates approved in the future,
and could cause an increase in our compliance, manufacturing, or other operating expenses. In addition, in certain foreign markets, the pricing of prescription drugs and devices is subject to government control and reimbursement may in some cases be
unavailable. We believe that pricing pressures at the federal and state level, as well as internationally, will continue and may increase, which may make it difficult for us to sell any approved product at a price acceptable to us or any of our
future collaborators. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug or medical c device must be approved before it may be
lawfully marketed. The requirements governing pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance
systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability
of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. A member state may require that physicians prescribe the generic version of a drug instead of our approved branded product. There can be no assurance that any country that has price
controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products or product candidates. Historically, pharmaceutical products launched in the European Union do not
follow price structures of the United States and generally tend to have significantly lower prices. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Our products and product candidates may cause
undesirable side effects that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval, limit the commercial profile of an approved label, or result in significant negative consequences following marketing approval, if any. </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Undesirable side effects caused by our product candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could
result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. For example, adverse events associated with tramadol use in general and observed in the PE clinical trials included:
gastrointestinal, or GI disorders (nausea) and central nervous system disorders (sleepiness, dizziness, headache) and decreased blood pressure. </P>

we expect to resume the relationship with the third-party manufacturer of ProstaScint. We expect to transition the site of manufacture within the current manufacturer&#146;s qualified sites. During this transition we may not be able to supply
sufficient quantities and on a timely basis, while maintaining product quality, acceptable manufacturing costs and complying with regulatory requirements, such as quality system regulations. In addition, we expect to engage third parties to
manufacture components of the RedoxSYS and MiOXSYS systems. For any future product, we expect to use third-party manufacturers because we do not have our own manufacturing capabilities. In determining the required quantities of any product and the
manufacturing schedule, we must make significant judgments and estimates based on inventory levels, current market trends and other related factors. Because of the inherent nature of estimates and our limited experience in marketing any products,
there could be significant differences between our estimates and the actual amounts of product we require. If we do not effectively transition sites with our manufacturing and development partners to enable to production scale of ProstaScint, or if
we do not secure collaborations with manufacturing and development partners to enable production to scale of the RedoxSYS and MiOXSYS systems, we may not be successful in selling ProstaScint or in commercializing the RedoxSYS and MiOXSYS systems in
the event we receive regulatory approval of the MiOXSYS System. If we fail in similar endeavors for future products, we may not be successful in establishing or continuing the commercialization of our products and product candidates. </P>

includes periodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees, various other governmental fees on patents and/or applications due in several stages over the lifetime of patents and/or applications, as well as the cost associated with complying with
numerous procedural provisions during the patent application process. We may or may not choose to pursue or maintain protection for particular inventions. In addition, there are situations in which failure to make certain payments or noncompliance
with certain requirements in the patent process can result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. If we choose to forgo patent protection or
allow a patent application or patent to lapse purposefully or inadvertently, our competitive position could suffer. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Legal actions to enforce our patent
rights can be expensive and may involve the diversion of significant management time. In addition, these legal actions could be unsuccessful and could also result in the invalidation of our patents or a finding that they are unenforceable. We may or
may not choose to pursue litigation or other actions against those that have infringed on our patents, or used them without authorization, due to the associated expense and time commitment of monitoring these activities. If we fail to protect or to
enforce our intellectual property rights successfully, our competitive position could suffer, which could harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. </P>

involve complex legal and factual questions. The interpretation and breadth of claims allowed in some patents covering pharmaceutical compositions may be uncertain and difficult to determine, and are often affected materially by the facts and
circumstances that pertain to the patented compositions and the related patent claims. The standards of the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, are sometimes uncertain and could change in the future. Consequently, the issuance and
scope of patents cannot be predicted with certainty. Patents, if issued, may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. U.S. patents and patent applications may also be subject to interference proceedings, and U.S. patents may be subject to
re-examination proceedings, post-grant review and/or inter partes review in the USPTO. Foreign patents may be subject to opposition or comparable proceedings in the corresponding foreign patent office, which could result in either loss of the patent
or denial of the patent application or loss or reduction in the scope of one or more of the claims of the patent or patent application. In addition, such interference, re-examination, post-grant review, inter partes review and opposition proceedings
may be costly. Accordingly, rights under any issued patents may not provide us with sufficient protection against competitive products or processes. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In
addition, changes in or different interpretations of patent laws in the United States and foreign countries may permit others to use our discoveries or to develop and commercialize our technology and products and product candidates without providing
any compensation to us, or may limit the number of patents or claims we can obtain. The laws of some countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as U.S. laws and those countries may lack adequate rules and procedures for
defending our intellectual property rights. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If we fail to obtain and maintain patent protection and trade secret protection of our products and product

challenged, and changes the way patent applications are disputed during the examination process. These changes may favor larger and more established companies that have greater resources to devote to patent application filing and prosecution. The
USPTO has developed regulations and procedures to govern the full implementation of the America Invents Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the America Invents Act, and, in particular, the first-to-file provisions,

Invents Act will ultimately have on the cost of prosecuting our patent applications, our ability to obtain patents based on our discoveries and our ability to enforce or defend any patents that
may issue from our patent applications, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>If we are unable to protect the
confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition to patent protection, because we operate
in the highly technical field of discovery and development of therapies and medical devices, we rely in part on trade secret protection in order to protect our proprietary technology and processes. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We
expect to enter into confidentiality and intellectual property assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, outside scientific and commercial collaborators, sponsored researchers, and other advisors. These agreements generally require that
the other party keep confidential and not disclose to third parties all confidential information developed by the party or made known to the party by us during the course of the party&#146;s relationship with us. These agreements also generally
provide that inventions conceived by the party in the course of rendering services to us will be our exclusive property. However, these agreements may not be honored and may not effectively assign intellectual property rights to us. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition to contractual measures, we try to protect the confidential nature of our proprietary information using physical and technological security
measures. Such measures may not, for example, in the case of misappropriation of a trade secret by an employee or third party with authorized access, provide adequate protection for our proprietary information. Our security measures may not prevent
an employee or consultant from misappropriating our trade secrets and providing them to a competitor, and recourse we take against such misconduct may not provide an adequate remedy to protect our interests fully. Enforcing a claim that a party
illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret can be difficult, expensive, and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States may be less willing to protect trade secrets. Trade secrets may be
independently developed by others in a manner that could prevent legal recourse by us. If any of our confidential or proprietary information, such as our trade secrets, were to be disclosed or misappropriated, or if any such information was
independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position could be harmed. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We may not be able to enforce our intellectual property rights
throughout the world. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United
States. Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of some countries, particularly developing countries, do not favor the
enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, especially those relating to pharmaceuticals and medical devices. This could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of some of our patents, if obtained, or the
misappropriation of our other intellectual property rights. For example, many foreign countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third parties. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of
patents against third parties, including government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, patents may provide limited or no benefit. Patent protection must ultimately be sought on a country-by-country basis, which is an expensive
and time-consuming process with uncertain outcomes. Accordingly, we may choose not to seek patent protection in certain countries, and we will not have the benefit of patent protection in such countries. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of
our business. Accordingly, our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights in such countries may be inadequate. In addition, changes in the law and legal decisions by courts in the United States and foreign countries may affect our ability
to obtain adequate protection for our technology and the enforcement of intellectual property. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Third parties may assert ownership or commercial
rights to inventions we develop. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Third parties may in the future make claims challenging the inventorship or ownership of our intellectual
property. We have or expect to have written agreements with collaborators that provide for the ownership of intellectual property arising from our collaborations. These agreements provide that we must negotiate certain commercial rights with
collaborators with respect to joint inventions or inventions made by our collaborators that arise from the results of the collaboration. In some instances, there may not be adequate written provisions to address clearly the resolution of
intellectual property rights that may arise from a collaboration. If we cannot successfully negotiate sufficient ownership and commercial rights to the inventions that result from our use of a third-party collaborator&#146;s materials where
required, or if disputes otherwise arise with respect to the intellectual property developed with the use of a collaborator&#146;s samples, we may be limited in our ability to capitalize on the market potential of these inventions. In addition, we
may face claims by third parties that our agreements with employees, contractors, or consultants obligating them to assign intellectual property to us are ineffective, or in conflict with prior or competing contractual obligations of assignment,
which could result in ownership disputes regarding intellectual property we have developed or will develop and interfere with our ability to capture the commercial value of such inventions. Litigation may be necessary to resolve an ownership
dispute, and if we are not successful, we may be precluded from using certain intellectual property, or may lose our exclusive rights in that intellectual property. Either outcome could have an adverse impact on our business. </P>

Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in defending

intellectual property rights of others. If our development and commercialization activities are found to infringe any such patents, we may have to pay significant damages or seek licenses to such patents. A patentee could prevent us from using the
patented drugs, compositions or devices. We may need to resort to litigation to enforce a patent issued to us, to protect our trade secrets, or to determine the scope and validity of third-party proprietary rights. From time to time, we may hire
scientific personnel or consultants formerly employed by other companies involved in one or more areas similar to the activities conducted by us. Either we or these individuals may be subject to allegations of trade secret misappropriation or other
similar claims as a result of prior affiliations. If we become involved in litigation, it could consume a substantial portion of our managerial and financial resources, regardless of whether we win or lose. We may not be able to afford the costs of
litigation. Any adverse ruling or perception of an adverse ruling in defending ourselves against these claims could have a material adverse impact on our cash position and stock price. Any legal action against us or our collaborators could lead to:

its stock ownership, Ampio may be able to influence our management and affairs and control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and approval of any merger, consolidation, or sale of all or
substantially all of our assets or other major corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company and might affect the market price of our common stock. This
control may delay, deter or prevent acts that would be favored by our other stockholders, as the interests of Ampio may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of our other stockholders. For example, Ampio may seek to cause us to

board of directors under our procedures regarding related party transactions. After the termination of this agreement, we would need to create our own administrative and other support systems or contract with third parties to replace Ampio&#146;s
services. These services may not be provided at the same level, and we may not be able to obtain the same benefits that we received prior to the separation. These services may not be sufficient to meet our needs, and if our agreement with Ampio is
terminated, we may not be able to replace these services at all or obtain these services at prices and on terms as favorable as we currently have with Ampio. Any failure or significant downtime in our own administrative systems or in Ampio&#146;s
administrative systems during the transitional period could result in unexpected costs, impact our results or prevent us from paying our suppliers or employees and performing other administrative services on a timely basis. </P>

Disbrow held executive positions at Ampio and/or its subsidiaries prior to the Merger. Further, at June&nbsp;30, 2015, Ampio owned approximately 81.5% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, negative developments, including negative publicity,
at Ampio could be imputed to our company and have an adverse impact on our business and prospects, including our ability to raise capital or enter into collaborations, and on the price of our common stock. </P>

parties may seek to hold us responsible for Ampio&#146;s retained liabilities. Under our agreements with Ampio, Ampio has agreed to indemnify us for claims and losses relating to these retained liabilities. However, if those liabilities are
significant and we are ultimately liable for them, we cannot assure you that we will be able to recover the full amount of our losses from Ampio. </P>

may arise that are applicable or complementary to both of our businesses and that each business would be free to pursue, such as the potential acquisition of a particular business or technology. However, we do not believe that Ampio intends to
acquire businesses that are focused on urological disorders. We have not established at this time any procedural mechanisms to address actual or perceived conflicts of interest of these individuals and expect that our board of directors, in the
exercise of its fiduciary duties, will determine how to address any actual or perceived conflicts of interest on a case-by-case basis. If any corporate opportunity arises and if our sole director or officers do not pursue it on our behalf, we may

managerial, operational and financial systems, expand our facilities and continue to recruit and train additional qualified personnel. Also, our management may need to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from its day-to-day
activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these development activities. Due to our limited resources, we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel.
This may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, give rise to operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees. The physical expansion of our operations may lead to
significant costs and may divert financial resources from other projects, such as the planned expanded commercialization of our approved products and the development of our product candidates. If our management is unable to effectively manage our
expected development and expansion, our expenses may increase more than expected, our ability to generate or increase our revenue could be reduced and we may not be able to implement our business strategy. Our future financial performance and our

effect on us. Our success also will depend upon our ability to attract and retain additional qualified management, marketing, technical, and sales executives and personnel. We do not maintain key person life insurance for any of our officers or key

commercialized, the likelihood of product liability lawsuits increases. Claims may be brought by individuals seeking relief for themselves or by individuals or groups seeking to represent a class. These lawsuits may divert our management from
pursuing our business strategy and may be costly to defend. In addition, if we are held liable in any of these lawsuits, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be forced to limit or forgo further commercialization of the affected products.

administrative liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercial production and sale of any of our products and product candidates that receive regulatory approval, which could adversely affect our business. Product liability claims could

such system failure, accident, or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a loss of clinical trial data for our product candidates which could result in delays in our
regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss of or damage to our data or applications or other data or applications relating

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of June&nbsp;30, 2015, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $17.1 million. The available net operating losses, if not utilized
to offset taxable income in future periods, will begin to expire in 2031 and will completely expire in 2034. Under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#147;Code&#148;) and the regulations promulgated thereunder, including, without
limitation, the consolidated income tax return regulations, various corporate changes could limit our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes (such as research tax credits) to offset our income. Were Ampio&#146;s
equity ownership interest in our Company to fall below 80% and we were to be deconsolidated from Ampio&#146;s consolidated federal income tax group, certain of our net operating loss carryforwards may not be available to us and we would not be able
to use them to offset our U.S. federal taxable income. In the event of such a deconsolidation, it is possible that certain other tax attributes and benefits resulting from U.S. federal income tax consolidation may no longer be available to us. Our
Company and Ampio do not have a tax sharing agreement that could mitigate the loss of net operating losses and other tax attributes resulting from a deconsolidation or our incurrence of liability for the taxes of other members of the consolidated
group by reason of the joint and several liability of group members. In addition to the deconsolidation risk, an &#147;ownership change&#148; (generally a 50% change (by value) in equity ownership over a three-year period) under Section&nbsp;382 of
the Code could limit our ability to offset, post-change, our U.S. federal taxable income. Section&nbsp;382 of the Code imposes an annual limitation on the amount of post-ownership change taxable income a corporation may offset with pre-ownership
change net operating loss carryforwards and certain recognized built-in losses. Either the deconsolidation or the ownership change scenario could result in increased future tax liability to us. </P>

an active trading market for our shares may never develop or be sustained. As a result, investors in our common stock must bear the economic risk of holding those shares for an indefinite period of time. Although our common stock is quoted on the
OTCQB, an over-the-counter quotation system, trading of our common stock is extremely limited and sporadic and at very low volumes. We do not now, and may not in the future, meet the initial listing standards of any national securities exchange, and
we presently anticipate that our common stock will continue to be quoted on the OTCQB or another over-the-counter quotation system in the foreseeable future. In those venues, our stockholders may find it difficult to obtain accurate quotations as to
the market value of their shares of our common stock, and may find few buyers to purchase their stock and few market makers to support its price. As a result of these and other factors, you may be unable to resell your shares of our common stock at
or above the price for which you purchased them, or at all. Further, an inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling additional equity in the future, and may impair our ability to enter into strategic partnerships or

Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. The realization of any of the above risks or any of a broad range of other risks, including those described

indicated its belief that there is a high probability that speculative or low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. If these FINRA requirements are applicable to us or our common stock, they may make it more difficult
for broker-dealers to recommend that at least some of their customers buy our common stock, which may limit the ability of our stockholders to buy and sell our common stock and could have an adverse effect on the market for and price of our common

Rosewind have been abandoned and replaced with the business and management team of Vyrix and Luoxis. Prior to the Merger, there were no relationships or other connections among the businesses or individuals associated with Rosewind and Vyrix and
Luoxis. As a result, we may have material liabilities that have not been discovered as a result of the Merger. We could experience losses as a result of any such undisclosed liabilities that are discovered, which could materially harm our business,
prospects and financial condition. Although the Merger Agreement contains customary representations and warranties from Rosewind concerning its assets, liabilities, financial condition and affairs, there may be limited or no recourse against
Rosewind&#146;s pre-Merger stockholders or principals in the event those representations prove to be untrue. As a result, our stockholders will bear some, or all, of the risks relating to any such unknown or undisclosed liabilities. </P>

There has been increased focus by government agencies on transactions such as the Merger in recent years, and we may be subject to increased scrutiny by the SEC and other government agencies and holders of our securities as a result of the
completion of that transaction. Additionally, our &#147;going public&#148; by means of a reverse merger transaction may make it more difficult for us to obtain coverage from securities analysts of major brokerage firms following the Merger because
there may be little incentive to those brokerage firms to recommend the purchase of our common stock. The occurrence of any such event could cause our business or stock price to suffer. </P>

by the lesser of (a)&nbsp;the lowest cash price per share paid by purchasers of shares in such financing, or (b)&nbsp;$4.63. If these notes are converted, the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion could be sold. The perception of such

dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. Further, any future sales of our common stock by us or resales of our common stock by our existing

Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless such transactions are
approved by the board of directors. This provision could have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing someone from acquiring us or merging with us, whether or not it is desired by or beneficial to our stockholders. </P>

by the Delaware law and, subject to certain conditions, advance the expenses incurred by any director or officer in defending any action, suit or proceeding prior to its final disposition. Those indemnification obligations could expose us to
substantial expenditures to cover the cost of settlement or damage awards against our directors or officers, which we may be unable to afford. Further, those provisions and resulting costs may discourage us or our stockholders from bringing a

concentrating on developing and commercializing products with an initial focus on urological indications and related conditions. We are focused primarily on the urological disorders market and specifically sexual dysfunction, urological cancers and
male infertility. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Through a multi-step reverse triangular merger, on April&nbsp;16, 2015, Vyrix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (&#147;Vyrix&#148;) and Luoxis
Diagnostics, Inc. (&#147;Luoxis&#148;) merged with and into our Company (herein referred to as the Merger) and we abandoned our pre-merger business plans to solely pursue the specialty healthcare market, including the business of Vyrix and Luoxis.
On June&nbsp;8, 2015, we reincorporated as a domestic Delaware corporation under Delaware General Corporate Law and changed our name from Rosewind Corporation to Aytu BioScience, Inc., and&nbsp;effected a reverse stock split in which each common
stock holder received one share of common stock for each every 12.174 shares outstanding (herein referred to as the Reverse Stock Split). All share and per share amounts in this Annual Report have been adjusted to reflect the effect of the Reverse
Stock Split. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In May 2015, we entered into and closed on an asset purchase agreement with Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Inc., pursuant to which we purchased
assets related to Jazz Pharmaceuticals&#146; product known as ProstaScint<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> (capromab pendetide), including certain intellectual property and contracts, and the product approvals, inventory and
work in progress (together, the &#147;ProstaScint Business&#148;), and assumed certain of Jazz Pharmaceuticals&#146; liabilities, including those related to product approvals and the sale and marketing of ProstaScint. The purchase price consists of
the upfront payment of $1.0 million. We also agreed to pay an additional $500,000 payable within five days after transfer for the ProstaScint-related product inventory and $227,000 payable on September&nbsp;30, 2015 (which represents a portion of
certain FDA fees). We also will pay 8% on its net sales made after October&nbsp;31, 2017, payable up to a maximum aggregate payment of an additional $2.5 million. </P>

Luoxis have not been segregated as a separate legal entity, related revenues, direct costs and expenses, assets and liabilities have historically been segregated on Ampio&#146;s books. In addition, we allocated corporate overhead costs based on a
review of specific labor and other overhead expenses and a reasonable estimate of activities related to Vyrix and Luoxis. Allocated labor and other overhead totaled $264,000 in 2015 and $253,000 in 2014. We also prepared a calculation of income tax
expense and deferred income tax assets and liabilities on a &#147;separate return&#148; basis (see Note 4 &#150; Income Taxes). These financial statements do not include a carve-out for cash as the operations have historically been funded by Ampio.

of BioSciences. The $7,500,000 recorded was based on an independent, third party appraisal of the fair value of the assets acquired. IPRD is considered an indefinite-lived intangible asset and its fair value will be assessed annually and written
down if impaired. Once the Zertane product obtains regulatory approval and commercial production begins, IPRD will be reclassified to an intangible that will be amortized over its estimated useful life. If we decided to abandon the Zertane product,

establishing patents, consisting of legal and filing fees paid to third parties, are expensed as incurred. The fair value of the Zertane patents, determined by an independent third party appraisal, is $500,000. The Zertane patents were acquired in
connection with the 2011 acquisition of BioSciences and the cost is being amortized over the remaining U.S. patent lives of approximately 11 years. The cost of the RedoxSYS/MiOXSYS patents was $380,000 and is being amortized over the remaining U.S.
patent lives of approximately 15 years. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Use of Estimates </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The preparation of financial statements in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (&#147;GAAP&#148;) requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting periods. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include valuation allowances, stock-based compensation, warrant valuation, purchase price allocation, valuation of contingent consideration, sales returns and
allowances, useful lives of fixed assets and assumptions in evaluating impairment of definite and indefinite lived assets. Actual results could differ from these estimates. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Income Taxes </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are included in the consolidated
tax returns of Ampio. Our taxes are computed and reported on a &#147;separate return&#148; basis for these financial statements. Deferred taxes are provided on an asset and liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible
temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The amount of income taxes and related income tax
positions taken would be subject to audits by federal and state tax authorities if we filed these taxes on a separate basis. We have adopted accounting guidance for uncertain tax positions which provides that in order to recognize an uncertain tax
benefit, the taxpayer must be more likely than not of sustaining the position, and the measurement of the benefit is calculated as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. We believe
that we have no material uncertain tax positions. Our policy is to record a liability for the difference between the benefits that are both recognized and measured pursuant to the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) Accounting
Standards Codification(&#147;ASC&#148;) 740-10, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes&#151;an interpretation of FASB Statement No.&nbsp;109 (&#147;ASC 740-10&#148;) and tax position taken or expected to be taken on the tax return. Then, to the
extent that the assessment of such tax positions changes, the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made. We report tax-related interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense. During the periods
reported, our management has concluded that no significant tax position requires recognition under ASC 740-10. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Stock-Based Compensation
</I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We account for share based payments by recognizing compensation expense based upon the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant. We
determine the estimated grant fair value using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and recognizes compensation costs ratably over the period of service using the graded method. </P>

2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (&#147;ASU&#148;) 2015-10, &#147;Technical Corrections and Improvements&#148;. The amendments represent changes to clarify the codification, correct unintended application of guidance, or make minor
improvements to the codification that are not expected to have a significant effect on current accounting practice or create a significant administrative cost. In addition, some of the amendments will make the codification easier to understand and
easier to apply by eliminating inconsistencies, providing needed clarifications, and improving the presentation of guidance in the codification. The amendments that require transition guidance are effective for all entities for fiscal years, and
interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. All other amendments will be effective upon issuance. We are evaluating the impact of ASU

liability instead of being presented as an asset. Debt disclosures will include the face amount of the debt liability and the effective interest rate. The update requires retrospective application and represents a change in accounting principle. The
update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued. We are evaluating the impact of ASU 2015-03 on its financial statements. </P>

Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items.&#148; The purpose of this amendment is to eliminate the concept of extraordinary items. As a result, an entity will no longer be required to separately classify, present and disclose extraordinary
events and transactions. The amendment is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2015 and subsequent interim periods with early application permitted. We are evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2015-01 will
have on its financial statements. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No.&nbsp;2014-15, &#147;Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern

doubt about an organization&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. The amendments in this ASU are effective for reporting periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2016, with early adoption

regarding ASC Topic 606, &#147;Revenue from Contracts with Customers&#148;. The standard provides principles for recognizing revenue for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers with the consideration to which the entity expects to be
entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2017, with early adoption permitted but not prior to the original public organization effective date of
December&nbsp;15, 2016. We are evaluating the accounting, transition and disclosure requirements of the standard and cannot currently estimate the financial statement impact of adoption. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have not generated significant revenue as our primary activities are focused on research and development, advancing our primary product candidates, and
raising capital. As of June&nbsp;30, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $7.4 million available to fund our operations and $1.2 million in accounts payable. Based upon the Ampio commitment to fund our operations with another $5.0 million
and the sale of convertible notes in July and August 2015, we believe we have adequate capital to continue operations through calendar year 2016 and into calendar year 2017. This projection is based on a number of assumptions that may prove to be
wrong, and we could exhaust our available cash and cash equivalents earlier than presently anticipated. We intend to seek additional capital within the next 12 months to expand our clinical development activities for Zertane and RedoxSYS/MiOXSYS as
well as building out a sales force for our ProstaScint product. In addition, we intend to evaluate the capital markets from time to time to determine when to raise additional capital in the form of equity, convertible debt or otherwise, depending on
market conditions relative to our need for funds at such time, and we will seek to raise additional capital during the next 12 months at such time as we conclude that such capital is available on terms that we consider to be in the best interests of
our company and our stockholders. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have prepared a budget for 2015 which reflects cash requirements for fixed, on-going expenses such as payroll, legal
and accounting, patents and overhead at an average cash burn rate of approximately $400,000 to $500,000 per month. Additional funds are planned for regulatory approvals, clinical trials, outsourced research and development and commercialization
consulting. Accordingly, it will be necessary to raise additional capital and/or enter into licensing or collaboration agreements. At this time, we expect to satisfy our future cash needs through Ampio&#146;s contributions to us and private or
public sales of our securities or debt financings. We cannot be certain that financing will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Over the last three years, volatility in the financial markets has adversely affected the market
capitalizations of many bioscience companies and generally made equity and debt financing more difficult to obtain. This volatility, coupled with other factors, may limit our access to additional financing. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As part of our plan to raise capital, during July and August 2015, we sold in a private placement convertible promissory notes with an aggregate principal
amount of $5.2 million. The notes are our unsecured obligation. Unless earlier converted, the notes will mature 18 months from their respective dates of issuance which will be on January&nbsp;22, February&nbsp;11 and February&nbsp;28, 2017, with an
option to extend up to six months at our discretion (provided that in the event we exercise such extension option, the then applicable interest rate shall increase by 2% for such extension period). We do not have the right to prepay the notes prior
to the maturity date. Interest will accrue on the notes in the following amounts: (i)&nbsp;8% simple interest per annum for the first six months and (ii)&nbsp;12% simple interest per annum thereafter if not converted during the first six months. If
there has not been a registration statement on Form&nbsp;S-1 filed with the SEC for the registration of the shares of common stock underlying the notes by the expiration of the first six-month period then (a)&nbsp;the interest rate will increase to
14% for the remainder of the period in which the notes remain outstanding and (b)&nbsp;any notes held by officers and directors of our Company will be subordinated to the remaining notes. Interest will accrue, is payable with the principal upon
maturity, conversion or acceleration of the notes and may be paid in kind or in cash, in our sole discretion. The notes are convertible at any time in a noteholder&#146;s discretion into that number of shares of our common stock equal in an amount
equal to 120% of the number of shares of common stock calculated by dividing the then outstanding principal and accrued interest by $4.63. A holder of notes will be obligated to convert on the terms of our next public offering of our stock resulting
in proceeds to us of at least $5,000,000 in gross proceeds (excluding indebtedness converted in such financing) prior to the maturity date of the notes (a &#147;Qualified Financing&#148;). The principal and accrued interest under the notes will
automatically convert into a number of shares of such equity securities of our Company sold in such financing equal to 120% of the principal and accrued interest under such note divided by the lesser of (i)&nbsp;the lowest price paid by an investor
in such financing or (ii)&nbsp;$4.63. In the event that we sell equity securities to investors at any time while the notes are outstanding in a financing transaction that is not a Qualified Financing, then the noteholders will have the option to
convert in whole the outstanding principal and accrued interest as of the closing of such financing into a number of shares of our capital stock in an amount equal to 120% of the number of such shares calculated by dividing the outstanding principal
and accrued interest by the lesser of (i)&nbsp;the lowest cash price per share paid by purchasers of shares in such financing, or (ii)&nbsp;$4.63. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If we
cannot raise adequate additional capital in the future when we require it, we will be required to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs or our commercialization efforts. We also may be required
to relinquish greater or all rights to product candidates at an earlier stage of development or on less favorable terms than we would otherwise choose. This may lead to impairment or other charges, which could materially affect our balance sheet and
operating results. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Off Balance Sheet Arrangements </B></P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In January 2013, Luoxis entered into a services agreement with Ampio whereby Ampio provides corporate overhead services and a shared facility with Luoxis in
exchange for $15,000 per month. The amount can be modified in writing upon the consent of both parties. The agreement may be terminated at any time by either party. In January 2014, Vyrix entered into a services agreement with Ampio whereby Ampio
provides corporate overhead services to Vyrix in exchange for $7,000 per month. The amount can be modified in writing upon the consent of both parties. The agreement may be terminated at any time by either party. Both agreements were assigned to us
upon the closing of the Merger. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In July 2015, Aytu entered into agreements with Ampio whereby Aytu agreed to pay Ampio $30,000 per month for shared
overhead which includes costs related to the shared facility, corporate staff, and other miscellaneous overhead expenses. These agreements will be in effect until they are terminated in writing by both parties. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In June 2013, Luoxis entered into a sponsored research agreement with TRLLC, an entity controlled by Ampio&#146;s director and Chief Scientific Officer,
Dr.&nbsp;Bar-Or. The agreement, which was amended in September 2013 and provides for Luoxis to pay $6,000 per month to TRLLC in consideration for services related to research and development of Luoxis&#146; RedoxSYS System. In March 2014, Luoxis
also agreed to pay a sum of $615,000 which is being amortized over the contractual term of 60.5 months and is divided between current and long-term on the balance sheet; this amount has been paid in full. This agreement is set to expire March 2019

Board of Directors to review, approve or ratify such transactions and identify and prevent conflicts of interest. Our Board of Directors reviews any such transaction in light of the particular affiliation and interest of any involved director,
officer or other employee or stockholder and, if applicable, any such person&#146;s affiliates or immediate family members. Management aims to present transactions to our Board of Directors for approval before they are entered into or, if that is
not possible, for ratification after the transaction has occurred. If our Board of Directors finds that a conflict of interest exists, then it will determine the appropriate action or remedial action, if any. Our Board of Directors approves or
ratifies a transaction if it determines that the transaction is consistent with our best interests and the best interest of our stockholders. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Director
Independence </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our common stock is not listed on any exchange. Consequently no exchange rules regarding director independence are applicable to us.
Audit Committee members must satisfy the independence criteria set forth in Rule 10A-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, for listed companies. In order to be considered to be independent for purposes of Rule 10A-3, a member of
an audit committee of a listed company may not, other than in his or her capacity as a member of the audit committee, the board of directors or any other board committee: (1)&nbsp;accept, directly or indirectly, any consulting, advisory or other
compensatory fee from the listed company or any of its subsidiaries; or (2)&nbsp;be an affiliated person of the listed company or any of its subsidiaries. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our sole director, Michael Macaluso, is not independent under the definition of either the NYSE or Nasdaq due to the payments we make to Ampio under the
services agreements with Luoxis and Vyrix. However, even if our common stock was listed on either NYSE or Nasdaq, we would be exempt from the director independence rules (other than those applicable to audit committees) due to exemptions for listed
companies that are &#147;controlled companies,&#148; which are companies of which more than 50% of the voting securities are held by one individual or entity. Because of Ampio beneficially owns 81.5% of our common stock, we would be a
&#147;controlled company.&#148; </P> <P STYLE="font-size:12pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our Board of Directors has responsibility for appointing, setting compensation and overseeing the work of the independent registered public accounting firm. In
recognition of this responsibility, the Board of Directors pre-approves all audit and permissible non-audit services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm although, it has no written policy on this matter. Prior to engagement
of the independent registered public accounting firm for the following year&#146;s audit, management will submit to the Board of Directors for approval a description of services expected to be rendered during that year for each of following four
categories of services: </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Audit services</I> include audit work performed in the preparation and audit of the annual financial statements, review of
quarterly financial statements, reading of annual, quarterly and current reports, as well as work that generally only the independent auditor can reasonably be expected to provide, such as the provision of consents and comfort letters in connection
with the filing of registration statements. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Audit-related services</I> are for assurance and related services that are traditionally performed by the

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Tax services</I> consist principally of assistance with tax compliance and reporting, as well as certain tax planning consultations. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Other services </I>are those associated with services not captured in the other categories. We generally do not request such services from our independent
auditor. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Prior to the engagement, the Board of Directors pre-approves these services by category of service. The fees are budgeted, and the Board of
Directors requires the independent registered public accounting firm and management to report actual fees versus the budget periodically throughout the year by category of service. During the year, circumstances may arise when it may become
necessary to engage the independent registered public accounting firm for additional services not contemplated in the original pre-approval. In those instances, the Board of Directors requires specific pre-approval before engaging the independent
registered public accounting firm. </P>

management is responsible for these financial statements. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial
reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of
the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Aytu Bioscience, Inc. as of
June&nbsp;30, 2015 and 2014, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the periods then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. </P>

Inc. (&#147;Aytu&#148; or the &#147;Company&#148;) was incorporated as Rosewind Corporation on August&nbsp;9, 2002 in the State of Colorado. Aytu was re-incorporated in the state of Delaware on June&nbsp;8, 2015. Aytu is a specialty healthcare
company concentrating on developing and commercializing products focused primarily on the urological disorders market, specifically sexual dysfunction, urological cancer and male infertility. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Basis of Presentation </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Aytu&#146;s current
business was formed through a reverse triangular merger (the &#147;Merger&#148;) in which Luoxis Diagnostics, Inc. (&#147;Luoxis&#148;) and Vyrix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (&#147;Vyrix&#148;) merged into Rosewind Corporation in a multi-step merger on
April&nbsp;16, 2015. These historical financial statements prior to April&nbsp;16, 2015 include the combined financial statements of Vyrix from its inception in November 2013, combined with the carve-out financial statements related to Vyrix assets
acquired in the Merger (the &#147;Vyrix Acquired Assets&#148;) from March&nbsp;23, 2011, the date, its parent company Ampio Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (&#147;Ampio&#148;) originally acquired the Vyrix Acquired Assets through its merger with DMI
BioSciences, Inc. (&#147;BioSciences&#148;) and the financial statements of Luoxis from its inception in January 2013, combined with the carve-out financial statements related to Luoxis. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The carve-out financial statements present the statements of financial position of Vyrix and Luoxis and the Vyrix Acquired Assets and the statements of
operations and cash flows for purposes of presenting complete comparative stand-alone financial statements in accordance with Regulation S-X, Article 3, General Instructions to Financial Statements, and Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 1-B1, Costs
Reflected in Historical Financial Statements. Historically, financial statements have not been prepared for Vyrix and Luoxis, as they were not held in a separate legal entities. Although Vyrix and Luoxis have not been segregated as a separate legal
entity, related revenues, direct costs and expenses, assets and liabilities have historically been segregated on Ampio&#146;s books. In addition, the Company allocated corporate overhead costs based on a review of specific labor and other overhead
expenses and a reasonable estimate of activities related to Vyrix and Luoxis. Allocated labor and other overhead totaled $264,000 in 2015 and $253,000 in 2014. The Company also prepared a calculation of income tax expense and deferred income tax
assets and liabilities on a &#147;separate return&#148; basis (see Note 4 &#150; Income Taxes). These financial statements do not include a carve-out for cash as the operations have historically been funded by Ampio. The historical carve-out
financial statements may not be indicative of the future results of Vyrix and Luoxis as a stand-alone entities. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The &#147;Company&#148; as referred to in
the notes to these financial statements includes Vyrix and Luoxis, collectively. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company&#146;s activities, being primarily research and development,
have not generated significant revenue to date. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of June&nbsp;30, 2015, Ampio is the majority shareholder of 81.5% of Aytu&#146;s outstanding common
stock. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On June&nbsp;8, 2015, in connection with the reincorporation as a Delaware corporation, we effected a reverse stock split in which each common
stock holder received one share of common stock for each every 12.174 shares then outstanding (the &#147;Reverse Stock Split&#148;). All share and per share amounts in this Annual Report have been adjusted to reflect the effect of the Reverse Stock
Split. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Business Combination&#151;ProstaScint </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In May
2015, Aytu entered into and closed on an asset purchase agreement with Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the &#147;Seller&#148;). Pursuant to the agreement, Aytu purchased assets related to the Seller&#146;s product known as ProstaScint<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> (capromab pendetide), including certain intellectual property and contracts, and the product approvals, inventory and work in progress (together, the &#147;ProstaScint Business&#148;), and
assumed certain of the Seller&#146;s liabilities, including those related to product approvals and the sale and marketing of ProstaScint. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The purchase
price consists of the upfront payment of $1.0 million. Aytu also agreed to pay an additional $500,000 payable within five days after transfer for the ProstaScint-related product inventory and $227,000 payable on September&nbsp;30, 2015 (which
represents a portion of certain FDA fees). Aytu also will pay 8% as contingent consideration on its net sales made after October&nbsp;31, 2017, payable up to a maximum aggregate payment of an additional $2.5 million. The contingent consideration was
valued at $664,000 using a discounted cash flow. The total fair value consideration for the purchase was $2.4 million. </P>

product returns and other allowances related to current period product revenue. In making such estimates, management analyzes historical returns, current economic trends and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products. If management
were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates, material differences in the amount of the Company&#146;s reported revenue could result.</P>

that have not been approved by the FDA, inventory used in clinical trials is expensed at the time of production and recorded as research and development expense. For products that have been approved by the FDA, inventory used in clinical trials is

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company accounts for its business acquisitions under the acquisition method of accounting as indicated in the Financial Accounting Standards Board&#146;s
(&#147;FASB&#148;) Accounting Standards Codification (&#147;ASC&#148;) 805, &#147;Business Combinations&#148;, which requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize the fair value of all assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and
any non-controlling interest in the acquire; and establishes the acquisition date as the fair value measurement point. Accordingly, the Company recognizes assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations, including contingent assets
and liabilities and non-controlling interest in the acquiree, based on the fair value estimates as of the date of acquisition. In accordance with ASC 805, the Company recognizes and measures goodwill as of the acquisition date, as the excess of the
fair value of the consideration paid over the fair value of the identified net assets acquired. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Goodwill </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The ProstaScint&nbsp;purchase price allocation was based upon an analysis of the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired from Jazz Pharmaceuticals.
The final purchase price may be adjusted up to one year from the date of the acquisition. Identifying the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired required the use of estimates by management, and were based upon
currently available data, as noted below. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company allocated the excess of purchase price over the identifiable intangible and net tangible assets to
goodwill. Such goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes and represents the value placed on entering new markets and expanding market share. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The
Company tests its goodwill for impairment annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred, by comparing the carrying value to its implied fair value. Impairment may result from, among other things,
deterioration in the performance of the acquired business, adverse market conditions, adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations and a variety of other circumstances. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it is required
to record a write-down of the carrying value and charge the impairment as an operating expense in the period the determination is made. In evaluating the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill, the Company must make assumptions regarding
estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the acquired assets. Changes in strategy or market conditions could significantly impact those judgments in the future and require an adjustment to the recorded balances.
The goodwill was recorded as part of the acquisition of ProstaScint that occurred on May&nbsp;20, 2015. There was no impairment of goodwill for the year ended June&nbsp;30, 2015. </P>

statements in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (&#147;GAAP&#148;) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures
of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include valuation allowances,
stock-based compensation, warrant valuation, purchase price allocation, valuation of contingent consideration, sales returns and allowances, useful lives of fixed assets and assumptions in evaluating impairment of definite and indefinite lived
assets. Actual results could differ from these estimates. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Income Taxes </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Aytu is included in the consolidated tax returns of Ampio. Aytu&#146;s taxes are computed and reported on a &#147;separate return&#148; basis for these
financial statements. Deferred taxes are provided on an asset and liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards and deferred tax liabilities are
recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of
management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The amount of income taxes and related income tax positions taken would be subject to audits by federal and state tax authorities if Aytu filed these taxes on
a separate basis. The Company has adopted accounting guidance for uncertain tax positions which provides that in order to recognize an uncertain tax benefit, the taxpayer must be more likely than not of sustaining the position, and the measurement
of the benefit is calculated as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. The Company believes that it has no material uncertain tax positions. The Company&#146;s policy is to record a
liability for the difference between the benefits that are both recognized and measured pursuant to FASB ASC 740-10, &#147;Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes&#151;an interpretation of FASB Statement No.&nbsp;109&#148; (&#147;ASC
740-10&#148;) and tax position taken or expected to be taken on the tax return. Then, to the extent that the assessment of such tax positions changes, the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made. The Company
reports tax-related interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense. During the periods reported, management of the Company has concluded that no significant tax position requires recognition under ASC 740-10. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Aytu accounts for share based payments by recognizing compensation expense based upon the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant. The Company
determines the estimated grant fair value using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and recognizes compensation costs ratably over the period of service using the graded method. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Aytu routinely performs an annual evaluation of the recoverability of the carrying value of its long-lived assets to determine if facts and circumstances

2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (&#147;ASU&#148;) 2015-10, &#147;Technical Corrections and Improvements&#148;. The amendments represent changes to clarify the codification, correct unintended application of guidance, or make minor
improvements to the codification that are not expected to have a significant effect on current accounting practice or create a significant administrative cost. In addition, some of the amendments will make the codification easier to understand and
easier to apply by eliminating inconsistencies, providing needed clarifications, and improving the presentation of guidance in the codification. The amendments that require transition guidance are effective for all entities for fiscal years, and
interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. All other amendments will be effective upon issuance. The Company is evaluating the impact of
ASU 2015-10 on its financial statements. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In April 2015, the FASB issued&nbsp;ASU 2015-03,&nbsp;&#147;Interest&#151;Imputation of Interest (Subtopic

debt liability instead of being presented as an asset. Debt disclosures will include the face amount of the debt liability and the effective interest rate. The update requires retrospective application and represents a change in accounting
principle. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued. The Company is evaluating the impact of ASU 2015-03 on its
financial statements. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In January 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-01, &#147;Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20): Simplifying Income Statement
Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items.&#148; The purpose of this amendment is to eliminate the concept of extraordinary items. As a result, an entity will no longer be required to separately classify, present and disclose
extraordinary events and transactions. The amendment is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2015 and subsequent interim periods with early application permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact the adoption
of ASU 2015-01 will have on its financial statements. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No.&nbsp;2014-15, &#147;Presentation of Financial

whether there is substantial doubt about an organization&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. The amendments in this ASU are effective for reporting periods beginning after December&nbsp;15,
2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2014-15 will have on its financial statements. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In May 2014,

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">During 2011, Ampio entered into a license, development and commercialization agreement with a major Korean pharmaceutical company which was assigned to Vyrix
when it was formed in 2013. The agreement grants the pharmaceutical company exclusive rights to market Zertane in South Korea for the treatment of premature ejaculation (&#147;PE&#148;) and for a combination drug to be developed, utilizing Zertane
and an erectile dysfunction drug. Upon signing of the agreement, Ampio received a $500,000 upfront payment, the net proceeds of which were $418,000 after withholding of Korean tax. The upfront payment has been deferred and is being recognized as
license revenue over a ten year period. Milestone payments of $3,200,000 may be earned and recognized contingent upon achievement of regulatory approvals and cumulative net sales targets, which may take several years. In addition, Aytu may earn a
royalty based on 25% of net sales, as defined, if the royalty exceeds the transfer price of the Zertane product. No royalties have been earned to date. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In April 2014, Vyrix entered into a Distribution and License Agreement (the &#147;Paladin Agreement&#148;) with Endo Ventures Limited, which recently acquired
Paladin Labs Inc. (&#147;Paladin&#148;), whereby Paladin has exclusive rights to market, sell and distribute Zertane in Canada, the Republic of South Africa, certain countries in Sub Saharan Africa, Colombia and Latin America. The Paladin Agreement
expires on a country by country basis upon the later of fifteen years after the first commercial sale of the product in that country or expiration of market exclusivity for Zertane in that country. Paladin paid $250,000 to Vyrix upon signing the
Paladin Agreement and is obligated to make milestone payments aggregating up to $3,025,000 based upon achieving Canadian and South African product regulatory approval and achieving specific sales goals. The upfront payment has been deferred and is
being recognized as license revenue over a seven year period. In addition, the Paladin Agreement provides that Paladin pay royalties based on sales volume. </P>

Note 2 &#150; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, the Company is included in Ampio&#146;s consolidated tax returns. For purposes of these financial statements, the Company&#146;s taxes are computed and reported on a &#147;separate

Ampio&#146;s ownership interest in Aytu falls below 80% and Aytu is deconsolidated from Ampio&#146;s consolidated income tax return, the net operating loss carryforwards originated prior to the incorporation of Vyrix and Luoxis would no longer be
available to Aytu and the related deferred income tax asset would be removed and recorded as a deemed dividend to the parent, Ampio. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Income tax benefit
resulting from applying statutory rates in jurisdictions in which Aytu is taxed (Federal and State of Colorado) differs from the income tax provision (benefit) in the Aytu&#146;s financial statements. The following table reflects the reconciliation

</TABLE> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Aytu has recorded income tax benefits in its statements of operations since inception, stemming from its operating losses, and
is expected to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future. During the year ended June&nbsp;30, 2015, the net deferred tax liability was reduced to zero based upon the operating losses, thus Aytu established a valuation allowance offsetting
any future net deferred tax asset. As such, Aytu would no longer record income tax benefits in its results of operations after the year ended June&nbsp;30, 2015 because management is currently unable to conclude that it is more likely than not that
a benefit will be realized. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some
portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during periods in which those temporary differences become deductible.
Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, carry back opportunities and tax planning strategies in making the assessment. The Company believes it is more likely than not it will realize
the benefits of these deductible differences, net of the valuation allowance provided. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company has federal net operating loss carryforwards of
approximately $17.1 million and $10.4 million as of June&nbsp;30, 2015 and June&nbsp;30, 2014, respectively that, subject to limitation, may be available in future tax years to offset taxable income. The available net operating losses, if not
utilized to offset taxable income in future periods, will begin to expire in 2031 through 2034. Net operating loss carryforwards are subject to examination in the year they are utilized regardless of whether the tax year in which they are generated
has been closed by statute. The amount subject to disallowance is limited to the NOL utilized. Accordingly, the Company may be subject to examination for prior NOLs generated as such NOLs are utilized. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of June&nbsp;30, 2015 and 2014, the Company has no liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits or related interest and penalties. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Aytu has made its best estimates of certain income tax amounts included in the financial statements. Application of the Company&#146;s accounting policies and
estimates, however, involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, could differ from these estimates. In arriving at its estimates, factors the Company considers include how accurate the
estimates or assumptions have been in the past, how much the estimates or assumptions have changed and how reasonably likely such changes may have a material impact. Aytu has been historically included in the Ampio consolidated tax return. Under the

cancelled in connection with the Merger. Option holders received a cash payment per option share equal to the difference between the consideration payable per share of common stock pursuant to the Merger and the exercise price of the option, if the
consideration paid to holders of common stock was less than the exercise price of such options, no amount was paid to the option holder in connection with the cancellation. The cash payment during the period ended June&nbsp;30, 2015 was $27,000. The
company recognized compensation of $422,000 and $189,000 related to the Luoxis and Vyrix options that had accelerated vesting as of the Merger date. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The
Luoxis options that were not paid out were terminated pursuant to the terms of the 2013 Luoxis Option Plan. The Company treated these options as pre-vesting forfeitures and $433,000 of previously recognized compensation was reversed. </P>

using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. In order to calculate the fair value of the options, certain assumptions are made regarding components of the model, including the estimated fair value of the underlying common stock, risk-free interest
rate, volatility, expected dividend yield and expected option life. Changes to the assumptions could cause significant adjustments to valuation. Aytu estimates the expected term based on the average of the vesting term and the contractual term of
the options. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield in effect at the time of the grant for treasury securities of similar maturity. The assumptions are as follows: </P>

fair value of the options was calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. In order to calculate the fair value of the options, certain assumptions are made regarding components of the model, including the estimated fair value of the

Plan, no additional options were granted during the year-ended June&nbsp;30, 2015. The assumptions are as follows: </P> <P STYLE="font-size:12pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

</TABLE> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">These warrants were valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. In order to calculate the fair value of the warrants,
certain assumptions were made regarding components of the model, including the closing price of the underlying common stock, risk-free interest rate, volatility, expected dividend yield, and expected life. Changes to the assumptions could cause
significant adjustments to valuation. The Company estimated a volatility factor utilizing a weighted average of comparable published volatilities of peer companies. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield in effect at the
time of the grant for treasury securities of similar maturity. The offering costs and the additional paid-in capital for the warrants associated with the common stock offering were valued at $313,000 using the Black-Scholes valuation methodology.
