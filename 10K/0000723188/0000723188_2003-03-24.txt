Item 1.  Business

GENERAL

Community Bank System, Inc. ("Company") was incorporated on April 15, 1983,
under the Delaware General Corporation Law. Its principal office is located at
5790 Widewaters Parkway, DeWitt, New York 13214 and its telephone number is
(315) 445-2282. The Company maintains a website at communitybankna.com. Annual
reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form
8-K, and amendments to those reports, are available on the Company's website
free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable following the filing of those
reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The Company became a bank holding company in 1984 with the acquisition of The
St. Lawrence National Bank ("St. Lawrence Bank") on February 3, 1984 and the
First National Bank of Ovid (renamed Horizon Bank, N.A or "Horizon Bank") on
March 2, 1984. Also in 1984 the Company obtained a national bank charter for its
third wholly-owned subsidiary bank, The Exchange National Bank ("Exchange
Bank"), and on July 1, 1984 Exchange Bank acquired the deposits and certain of
the assets of three branches of the Bank of New York located in Southwestern New
York. On September 30, 1987, the Company acquired The Nichols National Bank
("Nichols Bank") located in Nichols, New York. On September 30, 1988, the
Company acquired ComuniCorp, Inc., a one-bank holding company located in
Addison, New York, the parent company to Community National Bank ("Community
Bank").

On March 26, 1990, Community Bank opened the Corning Market Street branch from
the Company's acquisition of deposits and certain assets from Key Bank of
Central New York. On January 1, 1992, the Company's five banking affiliates
consolidated into a single, wholly-owned national banking subsidiary, known as
Community Bank, N.A. ("CBNA" or "Bank"). On March 31, 1993, the Bank's marketing
representative office in Ottawa, Canada was closed. On June 3, 1994, the Company
acquired three branch offices in Canandaigua, Corning and Wellsville, New York
from the Resolution Trust Corporation. At that time, the pre-existing
Canandaigua branch office loans and deposits were transferred to the new
facility. On October 28, 1994, the Company acquired the Cato, New York branch of
The Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A. On July 14, 1995, the Company acquired 15 branch
offices from The Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A. located in Norwich, Watertown (two),
Boonville, New Hartford, Utica, Skaneateles, Geneva, Pulaski, Seneca Falls,
Hammondsport, Canton, Newark (two), and Penn Yan, New York ("Chase Branches").
As required under that agreement, the Company sold three of the former Chase
Branches, located in Norwich, New Hartford, and Utica, to NBT Bank, N.A. on
December 15, 1995. On June 16, 1997 the Company acquired from Key Bank of New
York eight branches located in Alfred, Cassadaga, Clymer, Cuba, Gowanda, Ripley,
Sherman, and Wellsville in Southwestern New York State. On July 18, 1997 the
Company acquired from Fleet Bank 12 branches located in Old Forge, Boonville,
Ogdensburg, St. Regis Falls, Gateway Plaza, Watertown (2), Clayton, Lowville,
Massena (2), and Gouverneur in Northern and Central New York State. Eight of the
former Fleet offices or existing Bank offices in Watertown (2), Boonville,
Ogdensburg (2), Gouverneur, and Massena (2) have since been combined. On January
26, 2001, the Company purchased the Citizens National Bank of Malone, with its
offices in Brushton, Chateaugay, Hermon, and Malone (2) now being administered
from the Bank's Northern Market operations and management center in Canton, NY.
On May 11, 2001, the Company purchased First Liberty Bank Corp. First Liberty
had 13 branches based in the Scranton/Wilkes Barre area of Northeastern
Pennsylvania. These branches are now identified in the marketplace as "First
Liberty Bank & Trust, a division of Community Bank, N.A." On November 16, 2001,
the Company purchased 36 branches located in the Finger Lakes and Western New
York Regions from FleetBoston Financial. These branches now operate as Community
Bank, N.A. offices; five have since been closed or combined with other Bank
branches.

The Company had a wholly owned data processing subsidiary, Northeastern Computer
Services, Inc. ("Northeastern"). Northeastern was acquired by the Company from
The St. Lawrence Bank on May 31, 1984 pursuant to a corporate reorganization.
Northeastern had previously been a wholly-owned subsidiary of The St. Lawrence
Bank and was the survivor of a merger with Lawban Computer Systems, Inc.,
another wholly-owned subsidiary of The St. Lawrence Bank. In December 1991, the
Company entered into a five-year agreement with Mellon Bank, N.A. ("Mellon") to
provide data processing services. The agreement has twice been renewed with the
subsequent acquirer of Mellon's data services, Fiserv, Inc., for a term now
ending December 31, 2005. On June 30, 1992, Northeastern ceased operations. On
January 17, 1997 all the outstanding shares of common stock of Northeastern were
transferred from the Company to Community Bank, N.A. On that date, Northeastern
became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bank and changed its


                                       3

name to CBNA Treasury Management Corporation ("TMC"). TMC is now utilized by the
Bank to manage its Treasury function, including asset/liability, investment
portfolio, and liquidity management.

The Company also had a wholly-owned mortgage banking subsidiary, Community
Financial Services, Inc. (CFSI), which was established in June 1986; it
commenced operation in January 1987. In July 1988, CFSI purchased Salt City
Mortgage Corp., a Syracuse-based mortgage broker. CFSI ceased operations in 1990
and was renamed CFSI Close-Out Corp. in 1997.

On July 8, 1996, the Company acquired Benefit Plans Administrators (BPA) of
Utica, NY. The subsidiary was renamed Benefit Plans Administrative Services,
Inc., continuing as a pension administration and consulting firm serving
sponsors of defined benefit and defined contribution plans located in 27 states
and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.

On February 3, 1997, the Company formed a subsidiary business trust, Community
Capital Trust I, for the purpose of issuing preferred securities, which qualify
as Tier 1 capital. Concurrent with its formation, the trust issued $30,000,000
of 9.75% preferred securities in an exempt offering maturing in year 2027 and
guaranteed by the Company. The entire net proceeds to the trust from the
offering were invested in junior subordinated obligations of the Company.

On June 19, 1998, the Company formed a subsidiary, Community Financial Services,
Inc. (CFSI), to offer selected insurance products through its own agency. On
December 22, 1998, the Company formed a broker-dealer subsidiary, Community
Investment Services, Inc. (CISI). The subsidiary became fully operational in
March 1999, with a growing number of financial consultants available to provide
investment advice and products to customers.

On February 26, 1999, CBNA Preferred Funding Corp., a Real Estate Investment
Trust (REIT), was established as a subsidiary of the Bank to invest in real
estate mortgage assets originated by the Bank.

On April 3, 2000, the Company acquired Elias Asset Management, Inc. (EAM), of
Williamsville, NY, an asset management firm with clients located in New England,
New York, Ohio and Florida. As of December 31, 2002, EAM had $405 million in
assets under management for individuals, corporate pension and profit sharing
plans, and foundations.

On May 11, 2001, the Company formed First Liberty Service Corp. (FLSC). FLSC
provides banking-related services to the Pennsylvania branches of the Bank.

On July 16, 2001, the Company formed a subsidiary business trust, Community
Capital Trust II, for the purpose of issuing preferred securities, which qualify
as Tier 1 capital. Concurrent with its formation, the trust issued $25,000,000
of pooled floating-rate preferred securities (priced at 6 month LIBOR plus
3.75%) in an exempt offering maturing in year 2031 and guaranteed by the
Company. The entire net proceeds to the trust from the offering were invested in
junior subordinated obligations of the Company. On July 31, 2001, the Company
formed a subsidiary business trust, Community Statutory Trust III, for the
purpose of issuing preferred securities, which qualify as Tier 1 capital.
Concurrent with its formation, the trust issued $24,450,000 of pooled
floating-rate preferred securities (priced at 3 month LIBOR plus 3.58%) in an
exempt offering maturing in year 2031 and guaranteed by the Company. The entire
net proceeds to the trust from the offering were invested in junior subordinated
obligations of the Company.

The Company provides banking services through 112 customer facilities in the

St. Lawrence, Yates, Franklin, Steuben, Chemung, Schuyler, Jefferson,

The Bank is a community retail bank committed to the philosophy of serving the
financial needs of customers in local communities. The Bank's branches are
generally located in small towns and villages within its geographic market
areas. The Company believes that the local character of business, knowledge of
the customer and customer needs, and comprehensive retail and small business
products, together with responsive decision-making at the branch and regional
level, enable the Bank to compete effectively. The Bank is a member of the
Federal Reserve System and the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York ("FHLB"), and
its deposits are insured by the FDIC up to applicable limits.

CERTAIN REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS

Bank holding companies and national banks are regulated by state and federal
law. The following is a summary of certain laws and regulations that govern the
Company and the Bank. To the extent that the following information describes
statutory or regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by reference
to the actual statutes and regulations thereunder.

Bank Holding Company Supervision

The Company is registered as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding
Company Act of 1956, as amended (the "BHCA") and as such is subject to
regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal
Reserve Board"). As a bank holding company, the Company's activities and those
of its subsidiary have historically been limited to the business of banking and
activities closely related or incidental to banking. On March 12, 2000, however,
the Gramm-Leachy-Bliley Act took effect, relaxing the previous limitations and
permitting bank holding companies to engage in a broader range of financial
activities (see "Financial Services Modernization Act" section for details).

Under Federal Reserve Board policy, a bank holding company is expected to act as
a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks and to make capital
contributions to a troubled bank subsidiary. The Federal Reserve Board may
charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices
for failure to commit resources to a subsidiary bank when required. A required
capital injection may be called for at a time when the Company does not have the
resources to provide it. Any capital loans by the Company to its subsidiary bank
would be subordinate in right of payment to depositors and to certain other
indebtedness of such subsidiary banks.

The BHCA requires the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board in any case
where a bank holding company proposes to acquire direct or indirect ownership or
control of more than 5% of any class of the voting shares of, or substantially
all of the assets of, any bank (unless it owns a majority of such bank's voting
shares) or otherwise to control a bank or to merge or consolidate with any other
bank holding company. The BHCA also prohibits a bank holding company, with
certain exceptions, from acquiring more than 5% of the voting shares of any
company that is not a bank.

The Riegal-Neal Interstate Banking and Efficiency Act of 1994 provides that,
among other things, substantially all state law barriers to the acquisition of
banks by out-of-state bank holding companies are eliminated. The law also
permits interstate branching by banks. The Company believes that the effect of
the law has been to increase competition within the markets where the Company
operates, although the Company cannot quantify the effect to which competition
has increased in such markets or the timing of such increases.

OCC Supervision

The Bank is supervised and regularly examined by the Office of the Comptroller
of the Currency (OCC). The various laws and regulations administered by the OCC
affect corporate practices such as payment of dividends, incurring debt, and
acquisition of financial institutions and other companies. It also affects
business practices, such as payment of interest on deposits, the charging of
interest on loans, types of business conducted and location of offices. There
are no regulatory orders or outstanding issues resulting from regulatory
examinations of the Bank.

Limits on Dividends and Other Revenue Sources

The Company's ability to pay dividends to its shareholders is largely dependent
on the Bank's ability to pay dividends to the Company. In addition to state law
requirements and the capital requirements discussed below, the circumstances
under which the Bank may pay dividends are limited by federal statutes,
regulations and policies. For example, as a national bank, the Bank must obtain
the approval of the OCC for the payment of dividends if the total of all
dividends declared in any calendar year would exceed the total of the Bank's net
profits, as defined by applicable regulations, for that year, combined with its
retained net profits for the preceding two years. Furthermore, the Bank may not
pay a dividend in an amount greater than its undivided profits then on hand
after deducting its losses and bad debts, as defined by applicable regulations.
At December 31, 2002, the Bank had $34.4 million in undivided profits legally
available for the payment of dividends.


                                       7
<PAGE>

In addition, the Federal Reserve Board and the OCC are authorized to determine
under certain circumstances that the payment of dividends would be an unsafe or
unsound practice and to prohibit payment of such dividends. The payment of
dividends that deplete a bank's capital base could be deemed to constitute such
an unsafe or an unsound practice. The Federal Reserve Board has indicated that
banking organizations should generally pay dividends only out of current
operating earnings.

There are also statutory limits on the transfer of funds to the Company by its
banking subsidiary whether in the form of loans or other extensions of credit,
investments or asset purchases. Such transfers by the Bank to the Company
generally are limited in amount to 10% of the Bank's capital and surplus, or 20%
in the aggregate. Furthermore, such loans and extensions of credit are required
to be collateralized in specified amounts.

Capital Requirements

The Federal Reserve Board has established risk-based capital guidelines that are
applicable to bank holding companies. The guidelines established a framework
intended to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences
in risk profiles among banking organizations and take off-balance sheet
exposures into explicit account in assessing capital adequacy. The Federal
Reserve Board guidelines define the components of capital, categorize assets
into different risk classes, and include certain off-balance sheet items in the
calculation of risk-weighted assets. At least half of the total capital must be
comprised of common equity, retained earnings and a limited amount of perpetual
preferred stock, less goodwill ("Tier I capital"). Banking organizations that
are subject to the guidelines are required to maintain a ratio of Tier I capital
to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.00% and a ratio of total capital to
risk-weighted assets of at least 8.00%. The appropriate regulatory authority may
set higher capital requirements when an organization's particular circumstances
warrant. The remainder ("Tier 2 capital") may consist of a limited amount of
subordinated debt, limited-life preferred stock, certain other instruments and a
limited amount of loan and lease loss reserves. The sum of Tier I capital and
Tier 2 capital is "total risk-based capital." The Company's Tier I and total
risk-based capital ratios as of December 31, 2002 were 12.07% and 13.32%,
respectively.

In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has established a minimum leverage ratio
of Tier I capital to quarterly average assets less goodwill ("Tier I leverage
ratio") of 3.00% for bank holding companies that meet certain specified
criteria, including that they have the highest regulatory rating. All other bank
holding companies are required to maintain a Tier I leverage ratio of 3.00% plus
an additional cushion of at least 100 to 200 basis points. The Company's Tier I
leverage ratio as of December 31, 2002 was 7.05%, which exceeded its regulatory
requirement of 4.00%. The guidelines also provide that banking organizations
experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain
strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels,
without significant reliance on intangible assets. The Company is subject to the
same OCC capital requirements as those that apply to the Bank.

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991

In December 1991, Congress enacted the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
Improvement Act of 1991 ("FDICIA"), which substantially revised the bank
regulatory and funding provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and made
significant revisions to several other federal banking statutes. FDICIA provided
for, among other things, (i) a recapitalization of the Bank Insurance Fund (the
"BIF") of the FDIC by increasing the FDIC's borrowing authority and providing
for adjustments in its assessment rates; (ii) annual on-site examinations of
federally-insured depository institutions by banking regulators; (iii) publicly
available annual financial condition and management reports for financial
institutions, including audits by independent accountants; (iv) the
establishment of uniform accounting standards by federal banking agencies; (v)
the establishment of a "prompt corrective action" system of regulatory
supervision and intervention, based on capitalization levels, with more scrutiny
and restrictions placed on depository institutions with lower levels of capital;
(vi) additional grounds for the appointment of a conservator or receiver; (vii)
a requirement that the FDIC use the least-cost method of resolving cases of
troubled institutions in order to keep the costs to insurance funds at a
minimum; (viii) more comprehensive regulation and examination of foreign banks;
(ix) consumer protection provisions including a Truth-in-Savings Act; (x) a
requirement that the FDIC establish a risk-based deposit insurance assessment
system; (xi) restrictions or prohibitions on accepting brokered deposits, except
for institutions which significantly exceed minimum capital requirements; and
(xii) certain additional limits on deposit insurance coverage.


                                       8
<PAGE>

FDICIA requires federal banking agencies to take "prompt corrective action" with
respect to banks that do not meet minimum capital requirements. FDICIA
established five capital tiers: "well capitalized," "adequately capitalized,"
"undercapitalized," "significantly undercapitalized," and "critically
undercapitalized." The following table sets forth the minimum capital ratios
that a bank must satisfy in order to be considered "well capitalized" or
"adequately capitalized" under Federal Reserve Board regulations:

                                      Well Capitalized    Adequately Capitalized
                                      ----------------    ----------------------
   Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio ....      10%                    8%
   Tier I Risk-Based Capital Ratio ...       6%                    4%
   Tier I Leverage Ratio .............       5%                    4%

If a bank does not meet all of the minimum capital ratios necessary to be
considered "adequately capitalized," it will be considered "undercapitalized,"
"significantly undercapitalized," or "critically undercapitalized," depending
upon the amount of the shortfall in its capital. As of December 31, 2002, the
Bank's total risk-based capital ratio and Tier I risk - based capital ratio were
12.54% and 11.29%, respectively, and its Tier I leverage ratio as of such date
was 6.59%. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if its principal federal regulator
determines that an "adequately capitalized" institution is in an unsafe or
unsound condition or is engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice, it may
require the institution to submit a corrective action plan; restrict its asset
growth; and prohibit branching, new acquisitions, and new lines of business.
Among other things, an institution's principal federal regulator may deem the
institution to be engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice if it receives a
less than satisfactory rating for asset quality, management, earnings, or
liquidity in its most recent examination.

Possible sanctions for undercapitalized depository institutions include a
prohibition on the payment of dividends and a requirement that an institution
submit a capital restoration plan to its principal federal regulator. The
capital restoration plan of an undercapitalized bank will not be approved unless
the holding company that controls the bank guarantees the bank's performance.
The obligation of a controlling bank holding company to fund a capital
restoration plan is limited to the lesser of five percent (5%) of an
undercapitalized subsidiary's assets or the amount required to meet regulatory
capital requirements. If an undercapitalized depository institution fails to
submit or implement an acceptable capital restoration plan, it can be subjected
to more severe sanctions, including an order to sell sufficient voting stock to
become adequately capitalized. Critically undercapitalized institutions are
subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator.

In addition, FDICIA requires regulators to impose non-capital measures of bank
safety, such as loan underwriting standards and minimum earnings levels.
Regulators are also required to perform annual on-site bank examinations, place
limits on real estate lending by banks and tighten auditing requirements.

Financial Services Modernization Act

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, effective March 11, 2000, repealed
provisions of the depression-era Glass-Steagall Act, which prohibited commercial
banks, securities firms, and insurance companies from affiliating with each
other and engaging in each other's businesses.

The Act created "Financial Holding Company" (an "FHC"), a bank holding company
with dramatically expanded powers. FHCs may offer virtually any type of
financial service, including banking, securities underwriting, insurance (both
agency and underwriting) and merchant banking. The Federal Reserve serves as the
primary "umbrella" regulator of FHCs. Balanced against the attractiveness of
these expanded powers are higher standards for capital adequacy and management,
with heavy penalties for noncompliance.

Bank holding companies that wish to engage in expanded activities but do not
wish to become financial holding companies may elect to establish "financial
subsidiaries," which are subsidiaries of national banks with expanded powers.
The Act permits financial subsidiaries to engage in the same types of activities
permissible for nonbank subsidiaries of financial holding companies, with the
exception of merchant banking, insurance underwriting and real estate investment
and development. The Company has remained a bank holding company for the time
being and will continue to assess its options as circumstances change. The
Gramm-Leach Bliley Act also provided privacy protections to consumers by
limiting the transfer and use by financial institutions of consumer's nonpublic,
personal information.

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002

On July 30, 2002, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 was enacted. The various
provisions of the Act are effective upon many different dates and subject to
ongoing rule making by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). The Act
generally addresses matters relating to corporate governance, auditing and
accounting, executive compensation matters, and enhanced and timely disclosure
of corporate information. The New York Stock Exchange has also proposed
amendments to its corporate governance rules that have been presented to the SEC
for review and approval. Among the objectives of the Act and related rules are
enhancing the accountability and timely reporting of financial information by
public companies.

Item 2.  Properties

The Company has 120 properties, 83 are owned and 37 are located in long-term
leased premises. Of the 120 properties, 116 are considered customer facilities.
The remaining facilities include its administrative offices at 5790 Widewaters
Parkway, DeWitt, New York, its loan and deposit operation centers located in
Olean, and Canton, New York, respectively, and a training center located in
Ogdensburg, New York.

Real property and related banking facilities owned by the Company at December
31, 2002 had a net book value of $39.3 million and none of the properties was
subject to any encumbrances. For the year ended December 31, 2002, rental fees
of $1,896,000 were paid on facilities leased by the Company for its operations.

Item 3.  Legal Proceedings

The Company and its subsidiaries are subject in the normal course of business to
various pending and threatened legal proceedings to various pending and
threatened legal proceedings in which claims for monetary damages are asserted.
Management, after consultation with legal counsel, does not anticipate that the
aggregate liability, if any, arising out of litigation pending against the
Company or its subsidiaries will have a material effect on the Company's
consolidated financial position.

Item 4.  Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

There were no matters submitted to a vote of the shareholders during the quarter
ended December 31, 2002.

The Company has historically paid regular quarterly cash dividends on its common
stock, and declared a cash dividend of $0.29 per share for the first quarter of
2003. The Board of Directors of the Company presently intends to continue the
payment of regular quarterly cash dividends on the common stock, as well as to
make payment of regularly scheduled dividends on the trust preferred stock when
due, subject to the Company's need for those funds. However, because
substantially all of the funds available for the payment of dividends by the
Company are derived from the Bank, future dividends will depend upon the
earnings of the Bank, its financial condition, its need for funds and applicable
governmental policies and regulations. See "Certain Regulatory Considerations --
Limits On Dividends and Other Revenue Sources."

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Introduction

This Management's Discussion and Analysis ("MD&A") primarily reviews the
financial condition and results of operations of Community Bank System, Inc.,
and its subsidiaries for the past two years, although in some circumstances a
period longer than two years is covered in order to comply with Securities and
Exchange Commission disclosure requirements or to more fully explain long-term
trends. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with
the Selected Consolidated Financial Information on pages 13 and 14 and the
Company's Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes that appear on
pages 42 through 65. All references in the discussion to financial condition and
results of operations are to the consolidated position and results of the
Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole. Unless otherwise noted, all
earnings per share ("EPS") figures disclosed in the MD&A refer to diluted EPS.

All financial results reflect the 2001 acquisition of First Liberty Bank Corp.
("First Liberty") in accordance with pooling of interest accounting, unless
otherwise noted. All references to "peer banks", unless otherwise noted, pertain
to a group of 74 bank holding companies nationwide having $3 billion to $10
billion in assets and their associated composite financial results for the nine
months ending September 30, 2002 (the most recently available disclosure) as
provided by the Federal Reserve System. Lastly, unless otherwise noted, the term
"this year" refers to results in calendar year 2002.

This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations contains certain forward-looking statements with respect to the
financial condition, results of operations and business of Community Bank
System, Inc. ("CBSI" or "the Company"). These forward-looking statements involve
certain risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ
materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements are set
herein under the caption "Forward-Looking Statements" on page 41.

Accounting Policies

As a result of the complex and dynamic nature of the Company's business,
management must exercise judgement in selecting and applying the most
appropriate accounting policies for its various areas of operations. The policy
decision process not only ensures compliance with the latest generally accepted
accounting principles, but also reflects on management's discretion with regard
to choosing the most suitable methodology for reporting the Company's financial
performance. It is management's opinion that the accounting estimates covering
certain aspects of the business have more significance than others due to the
relative importance of those areas to overall performance, or the level of
subjectivity in the selection process. Management believes that these areas
include the allowance for loan losses, fair value of investment securities, fair
value methodologies used to review the carrying value of goodwill, and actuarial
assumptions associated with the pension, post-retirement and other employee
benefit plans. The accounting policies for the first three items are disclosed
in Note A (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) starting on page 46.
Pension, post-retirement and other benefits assumptions are reported in Note K
on pages 59 and 60. It is important to review all accounting policies in Note A
in order to better understand the performance of CBSI as reported in this
document.

Net Income and Profitability

Net income for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $38.5 million, up $19.4
million or 101% from the prior year. 2002 earnings per share of $2.93 were 81%
higher than the $1.62 earned in 2001. Results for both years include
nonrecurring costs associated with the Company's three 2001 acquisitions in
January, May, and November, which added $1.2 billion in assets and expanded its
branch network by 46. See Note B (pages 52-53) for a description of the
FleetBoston Financial ("FleetBoston"), Citizens National Bank of Malone
("Citizens"), and First Liberty Bank Corp. ("First Liberty" or "FLIB")
acquisitions. Acquisition and unusual expenses associated with these
transactions reduced earnings by $0.03 per share in 2002 and $0.41 in 2001. This
$0.38 difference explains 29% of the $1.31 improvement in EPS between the two
years.

The 2002 results include the benefit of adopting SFAS 147, an accounting
standard that eliminates the regular amortization of goodwill related to the
Company's branch acquisitions, and SFAS 142, which eliminates the requirement to
regularly amortize approximately $19.8 million in goodwill related to its
whole-company acquisitions. SFAS 142 and SFAS 147 were effective January 1, 2002
and increased current year earnings per share by $0.06 and $0.28, respectively.

Net income and earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2001 were
$19.1 million and $1.62, down 23% and 30%, respectively, from 2000 results. The
net income decline was primarily driven by acquisition-related expenses. In
2001, non-recurring acquisition expenses rose $7.8 million to $8.2 million, and
intangible amortization expense was up


                                       15
<PAGE>

$1.8 million due to the significant goodwill and deposit intangibles added as a
result of the acquisitions that were recorded under the purchase method of
accounting (Citizens and FleetBoston). 2001 earnings per share declined by a
higher percentage than net income because of 10% higher weighted average diluted
shares outstanding. 952,000 common shares were issued in conjunction with the
Company's January whole bank purchase of Citizens National Bank of Malone, and
1.3 million shares were issued in the fourth quarter of 2001 to partially fund
the mid-November purchase of 36 branches from FleetBoston Financial.

Performance as measured by operating earnings, which exclude acquisition and
unusual expenses and various securities transactions related to acquisitions, is
considered by some securities analysts to be a more accurate reflection of the
underlying core earnings strength of a company. CBSI's operating earnings per
share for 2002 were $2.96, up 46% from the prior year's level of $2.03.
Excluding the aforementioned benefits from adopting SFAS 142 and 147 in 2002,
operating earnings per share of $2.62 this year were 29% higher than the
operating EPS generated in 2001. The resulting $0.59 improvement largely
reflects the full-year impact of the FleetBoston branch acquisition, improved
margins, a larger securities portfolio and a lower effective income tax rate.

CBSI has also historically reported its performance using another measure of
earnings power--cash earnings. Now that SFAS 142 and SFAS 147 have been adopted,
this metric has been redefined to exclude from earnings the expense of regularly
amortizing core deposit intangibles (CDI). CDI represents the premium the
Company has paid for deposits acquired in excess of the cost incurred had the
funds been purchased in the capital markets. Amortization of CDI is a non-cash
expense, and adding it back (tax-adjusted) to reported earnings creates the cash
earnings metric. Cash earnings are believed by some securities analysts to be a
better measure of a company's ability to build capital, fund expansion, and pay
shareholder dividends. CBSI's cash operating earnings per share for 2002 were
$3.23, up 35% from the prior year.

      accordingly, are not presented in accordance with Generally Accepted
      Accounting Principles (GAAP).

The primary factors explaining 2002 performance are discussed in detail in the
remaining sections of this document and are summarized as follows:

o     As shown in Table 1 above, net interest income (full tax-equivalent basis)
      increased 35% or $35.9 million due to a $401 million increase in average
      earning assets and a 66 basis point improvement in the net interest
      margin. The relative contribution of higher volumes and better margins was
      about equal (48% versus 52%, respectively). The interest margin benefited
      from the rates on deposits and borrowings declining more rapidly than the
      yields earned on loans and investments in a falling rate environment.
      Average loans grew $179 million (11.3%) while average investments rose
      $222 million (21.3%). The growth in earning assets was funded by $416
      million (19.5%) more average deposits and $24 million (5.0%) more average
      borrowings. The growth in average loans and deposits was mostly
      attributable to the acquisition of the 36 FleetBoston branches in November
      2001 (31 branches after consolidation with existing CBSI branches).



                                       16
<PAGE>

o     2002 noninterest income (including net investment security gains and loss
      on losses on debt extinguishment) increased by $6.2 million (23.5%) from
      2001 to $32.6 million. General banking fees accounted for $3.4 million of
      the improvement, as service income and the volume of overdrafts increased
      due to the additional FleetBoston branches. Overdraft fee income also
      benefited from a mid-year increase of the fee charged for overdrafts and
      the implementation of the Overdraft FreedomTM program (described in
      noninterest income section on pages 24-26). Financial services revenues
      were $1.1 million higher due to strong growth at the Company's
      broker-dealer business, Community Investment Services, Inc. (CISI), and at
      the Company's pension administration and consulting subsidiary, Benefits
      Plans Administrative Services (BPA). $2.6 million of gains on the sale of
      debt instruments offset by a $925,000 prepayment penalty on the early
      retirement of debt resulted in $1.8 million higher income from net
      security transactions in 2002. Excluding net security transactions,
      noninterest income increased for the eighth consecutive year to $30.9
      million in 2002, a $4.4 million (16.7%) improvement over 2001.

o     Noninterest expense or overhead (including acquisition and unusual
      expenses) rose $6.8 million or 7.7% in 2002 to $95.8 million. Excluding
      acquisition and unusual expenses in both years, 2002 operating expenses
      rose $14.3 million or 17.7%. Ongoing overhead expense increased due to the
      full-year impact of the Company's mid-November 2001 acquisition of the
      FleetBoston branches. In addition, incremental costs were temporarily
      incurred as a result of consolidating the Bank's regional loan and deposit
      operations centers into two centralized locations. Efficiency steadily
      improved in 2002 as integration of the acquisitions and the benefits of
      streamlined operations were more fully realized in the second half of the
      year.

o     Loan loss provision increased $5.1 million or 72% from 2001's level. The
      full year loan loss provision covered total actual net charge-offs by 1.25
      times. Net charge-offs as a percent of average loans rose 14 basis points
      in 2002 to 0.56%. The primary reason for the overall increase in
      charge-offs is the impact of the softening economy in the markets we
      serve, including partial charge-offs on two larger commercial customers in
      the second quarter of 2002 and charge-off of the remaining balance of one
      these customers in the fourth quarter. The increase in the loan loss
      provision reflects the higher net charge-offs, a rise in specific
      commercial allowance for loan loss allocations and the annual year-end
      change in the historical periods used as a basis for general reserve
      allocations. Nonperforming loans increased during 2002 to 0.64% of loans
      outstanding at year end compared to 0.53% one year earlier, reflecting the
      weak economy. Additional information on trends and policy related to asset
      quality is provided in the asset quality section on pages 32-34.

o     The Company's combined effective federal and state tax rate decreased 2.5
      percentage points in 2002 to 26.5%, primarily as a result of an increased
      proportion of tax-exempt municipal investment holdings and higher reported
      pre-tax income due to the adoptions of SFAS 142 and SFAS 147.

As displayed in Table 2 above, return on average assets improved in 2002 in
comparison to both 2001 and 2000. This was primarily a result of substantially
higher net interest margins and improved operational efficiencies. Significantly

improved profitability resulted in a higher return on equity in 2002 versus
2001. However, the build-up of equity capital over the last two years from the
retention of net profits and common share offerings in conjunction with the
Company's 2001 acquisitions led to a lower return on equity in 2002 than 2000,
despite 55% higher net income. The strengthening of the Company's equity capital
position is also reflected in the 146 and 41 basis point increases in the
average equity to average total assets ratios in 2001 and 2002, respectively.
The dividend payout ratio spiked temporarily in 2001 due to lower earnings as a
result of acquisition-related expenses, an increased number of shares, and the
full year impact of a $0.02 per share increase in the dividend in the third
quarter of 2000. The dividend payout ratio for 2002 was below the 2000 level as
a result of net income growing at a higher compounded annual growth rate (24.4%)
than dividends (19.8%) during this period. This reflects management's emphasis
on enhancing the Company's capital position to support future internal and
external growth.

Net Interest Income

Net interest income is the amount that interest and fees on earning assets
(loans and investments) exceeds the cost of funds, primarily interest paid to
the Bank's depositors, interest on capital market borrowings, and dividends paid
on the Company's trust preferred stock. Net interest margin is the difference
between the gross yield on earning assets and the cost of interest bearing funds
as a percentage of earning assets.

As disclosed in Table 3, net interest income (with non-taxable income converted
to a full tax-equivalent basis) totaled $139.9 million in 2002; this represents
a $35.9 million or 35% increase over the prior year. The increase was due to
improved margins and net increase in interest-bearing balances, which had
positive impacts of $18.8 million and $17.2 million on net interest income,
respectively.

As shown in Tables 3 and 4, gross interest income on loans and investments grew
by $11.8 million or 5.7% in 2002 as a result of $400.9 million higher average
earning assets, which contributed $29.7 million, partially offset by $17.9
million related to lower rates. Average loans grew a total of $178.7 million in
2002, with the most significant portion occurring as a result of the November
2001 acquisition of $177 million of loans associated with the FleetBoston
branches. Interest and fees on loans decreased $905,000 or 0.7%. A 90 basis
point drop in yields due to falling capital market rates had more of an impact
(negative $15.1 million) than growth in average loans (positive $14.2 million).

Despite a falling rate environment, the steepening yield curve in the first half
of 2002 resulted in widening spreads for investments over cost of funds. This
situation created favorable opportunities to expand the Company's investment
portfolio, which was increased $132 million in the first quarter and $99 million
in the second quarter on an average balance basis. This expansion was primarily
funded through external borrowings. The investment portfolio was held relatively
flat in the third quarter, and in the fourth quarter of 2002 management decided
to allow the investment portfolio to run off, using the proceeds to pay down
borrowings due to the lack of investment opportunities offering acceptable
yields. As a result of the aforementioned portfolio activity as well as
increased investments in the fourth quarter of 2001, average balances for 2002
increased by $222 million over the year earlier period.

Investment interest income (full tax-equivalent basis) in 2002 was $12.7 million
or 17.5% higher than the prior year as a result of the larger portfolio
(positive $15.5 million impact), partially offset by a decrease in the average
investment yield from 6.96% to 6.74% (negative $2.8 million impact), which was
driven by declining yields on taxable investment securities. This decrease was
primarily due to purchases of taxable investments in a declining market rate
environment in late 2001 and early 2002 to replace run-off and increase the
overall size of the portfolio. The yields on tax-exempt securities increased by
19 basis points in 2002 despite falling interest rates as a result of the
purchase of intermediate-term municipal securities that offered attractive
yields and lengthened the average life of the portfolio. The drop in the average
yield on the total investment portfolio was mostly due to the decrease of
taxable investment yields, which more than offset the impact of the improved
yield and higher mix (28% in 2002 versus 21% in 2001) of non-taxable
investments.

The average earning asset yield fell 65 basis points to 7.18% in 2002 because of
the previously mentioned decrease in investment and loan yields and a reduced
proportion of loans to earning assets, which decreased on average from 60.3% in
2001 to 58.2% in 2002. This decline in loan mix is a consequence of the
favorable investment opportunities outlined above as well as tempered loan
growth due to continued weak economic conditions.

Total average fundings (deposits and borrowings) grew by $439.8 million in 2002,
with $415.6 million of the increase coming from deposits, mostly attributable to
acquisition of the FleetBoston branches, and $24.1 million from increased
capital market borrowings. The additional capital market borrowings primarily
came from the issuance of approximately $50 million in floating-rate trust
preferred securities in mid 2001 in anticipation of the FleetBoston branch
acquisition.

Total interest expense decreased by $24.2 million to $77.0 million in 2002.
Lower market rates resulted in $37.8 million less interest expense, with higher
average interest-bearing funds offsetting this by $13.7 million. Interest
expense as a percentage of earning assets, fell by 1.31 percentage points to
2.55%. The rate on interest bearing deposits fell 1.54 percentage points to
2.56%, due largely to steady declines in time deposit rates throughout 2002 and
periodic reduction of rates on other interest-bearing deposit products. The rate
on capital market borrowings declined 1.25 percentage points to 4.58% because of
substantially lower market rates, particularly on short-term and variable-rate
funding.

CBSI's net interest margin (full tax-equivalent basis) increased by 66 basis
points from 3.97% in 2001 to 4.63% this year. The 1.51 percentage point decrease
in the rate on average interest-bearing funds had a greater impact than the 65
basis point decline in the yield on interest-earning assets. The net interest
margin increased in every quarter of 2002, ending with a 4.83% margin for the
fourth quarter, as shown in Table 5. Downward repricing of the Company's
interest-bearing deposits and falling market rates on external borrowings
combined with a relatively stable yield on the investment portfolio led to the
improvement in the net interest margin over the course of the year. The
Company's net interest margin ranked in the favorable 68th peer bank percentile
for the nine months ending September 30, 2002.

The following table sets forth certain information concerning average
interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the yields and
rates thereon for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000. Interest
income and resultant yield information in the tables are on a fully
tax-equivalent basis using a marginal federal income tax rate of 35%. Averages
are computed on daily average balances for each month in the period divided by
the number of days in the period. Yields and amounts earned include loan fees.
Nonaccrual loans have been included in interest-earning assets for purposes of
these computations.

The following table sets forth certain information concerning average
interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the yields and
rates thereon for the three month periods ended December 31, 2002 and 2001.
Interest income and resultant yield information in the tables are on a fully
tax-equivalent basis using a marginal federal income tax rate of 35%. Averages
are computed on daily average balances for each month in the period divided by

      volume and rate changes in proportion to the relationship of the absolute
      dollar amounts of change in each.

(2)   Changes due to volume and rate are computed from the respective changes in
      average balances and rates of the totals; they are not a summation of the
      changes of the components.

As previously mentioned, the fourth quarter 2002 net interest margin was the
highest of the year, 63 basis points greater than the margin for the
corresponding prior year period. This improvement was driven by the drop in the
cost of funds having a greater impact than falling yields on loans and
investments, and larger growth in average interest-earning assets than in
average interest-bearing liabilities, as demonstrated in Table 6 above. The
latter factor was primarily a result of the significant amount of
non-interest-bearing deposits acquired in the FleetBoston branch acquisition in
mid-November 2001. Economic and market conditions and the maturity and interest
rate sensitivity profile of the Company's balance sheet continuously change.
Therefore, fourth quarter 2002 results are not necessarily indicative of future
performance.

Noninterest Income

The Company's sources of noninterest income are of three primary types: general
banking services related to loans, deposits and other core customer activities
typically provided through the branch network; financial services, comprised of
personal trust, employee benefit trust, investment, and insurance products; and
periodic transactions, most often net gains (losses) from the sale of
investments or other occasional events.

</TABLE>

As displayed in Table 7, total noninterest income in 2002 increased by 23.5% to
$32.6 million, largely as a result of reduced losses on the early retirement of
long-term borrowings, increased revenues from CISI and EBT/BPA (our pension
administration business working in concert with the Bank's employee benefit
trust service), and higher deposit service charges and overdraft fees.
Deposit-related fee income benefited significantly from the acquisition of the
FleetBoston branches. Combined revenues, excluding transactions related to
investment securities, debt and the disposal of branch properties, rose for the
eighth consecutive year to $30.9 million in 2002, a $4.4 million or 16.7%
improvement over 2001.

Noninterest income, excluding net gains (losses) from the sale of securities,
early retirement of debt and disposal of branch properties and other unusual
items, as a percent of operating income was 17.9% in 2002, a decrease of 2.5
percentage points from the prior year. This decline was primarily driven by the
aforementioned strong growth in net interest income and the adverse effect of
unfavorable equity market conditions on the financial service businesses,
particularly the Company's asset manager, Elias Asset Management, and the
personal trust unit.

The largest segment of the Company's recurring noninterest income is the wide
variety of fees earned from general banking services, which reached $17.2
million in 2002, up 24.4% from the prior year. This segment contributed 56% of
2002 noninterest income, excluding net securities gains and loss from debt
extinguishment. A large portion of the income growth was attributable to the
higher number of customer accounts due to the FleetBoston branch acquisition,


                                       24
<PAGE>

and is reflected in the significant increases in deposit service charges,
electronic banking fees and commissions, which combined grew by $2.0 million or
25.8%. 2002 overdraft fees, up $1.8 million (33.8%) over 2001's level, also
benefited from the additional accounts, but were additionally enhanced by a
mid-year fee increase and the implementation of the Company's Overdraft
FreedomTM program in December 2002. Overdraft FreedomTM is a program currently
offered to retail customers whereby the Bank may pay overdrawn amounts for
qualified customers up to a certain predetermined limit for which they are
charged the standard overdraft fee. This is a courtesy service to customers in
good standing that may allow them to avoid late and non-payment penalties from
creditors and vendors and help them in their effort to avoid the negative
consequences of returned checks. This form of service is becoming an industry
standard throughout much of the country.

Mortgage banking fees of $175,000 in 2002 were down $478,000 from the prior
year. The main reason for the decline was that $9.1 million of mortgages were
sold on the secondary market in 2002, versus $43.6 million in 2001. The
resulting lack of increase in servicing portfolio activity as well as mortgage
prepayments in 2002 resulted in $163,000 of mortgage servicing right write-downs
in 2002 compared to $139,000 of mortgage servicing right income in 2001.
Accordingly, the mortgage servicing rights asset decreased from $567,000 at
year-end 2001 to $283,000 at the end of this year. The reduced level of
secondary market activity also had an impact on the second mortgage banking fee
item, gains from the sale of mortgages, which dropped $138,000 in 2002 to
$64,000. Lower sales and mortgage prepayments were responsible for the
loan-servicing portfolio decreasing from $119.8 million at the end of 2001 to
$103.7 million at year-end 2002. Consequently, the third component of mortgage
banking income, loan-servicing fees, dropped $38,000 from 2001's level to
$274,000 in 2002.

As disclosed in Table 7, fees from the financial services segment of noninterest
income rose $1.1 million or 8.3% in 2002 to $13.7 million. Financial service
revenue now comprises 44% of total noninterest income, excluding net gains
(losses) on the sale of investment securities and debt extinguishment. Growth in
CISI revenues was driven by an expanded number of financial consultants,
penetration of new markets opened up by the three 2001 acquisitions, and strong
annuity sales in the first half of 2002. Another impressive year of revenue
growth for EBT/BPA was driven by the expanded servicing of a significant number
of new plans. Client companies of EBT/BPA are now located in 27 states and the
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. Lower revenue for personal trust and Elias Asset
Management reflected equity market price declines in 2002 that drove down the
market value of their assets under management, which is the basis for a majority
of their income. Lastly, commissions from insurance products increased by 30%
due to increased sales of creditor life and disability products and a higher
dividend from the underwriter of CBSI's creditor life insurance products.

Assets under management from the Company's several financial services businesses
dipped slightly to $1.364 billion at the end of 2002 compared to $1.385 billion
in the prior year, with market-driven declines in equity-based assets being
offset somewhat by growth of new plan assets at BPA. Overall, financial services
contributed $3.2 million (before allocation of indirect corporate expense) or
6.2% of the Company's pretax income this year, reflecting nearly a 24% return on
revenue. In 2001, financial services' contribution was $2.7 million or 10.2% of
total pretax income, with a return on revenue of almost 22%. The improvement in
earnings and margin was the result of strong revenue growth at CISI and BPA and
the reduction of expense levels at EAM and personal trust. The decline in
percentage contribution was primarily due to large increases in net interest
income and banking fees in 2002 and the existence of substantial banking-related
acquisition costs in 2001.

Lastly, income from periodic transactions in 2002 was composed of $2.6 million
in gains taken on $80 million in investment sales, and a $925,000 prepayment
penalty on the retirement of approximately $11 million of intermediate-term FHLB
borrowings in the fourth quarter of 2002. These transactions compare to $2.5
million of net investment gains and $2.7 million of losses on debt
extinguishment in 2001. The total net gain on security and debt transactions of
$1.7 million in 2002 compares to a $113,000 net loss incurred in 2001. The
security gains and debt losses taken over the last two years are illustrative of
the Company's active management of its investment portfolio and capital market
borrowings to achieve a desirable total return through combined net interest
income and transaction gains (losses) across financial market cycles.

Noninterest Expense

As shown in Table 9, noninterest expense or overhead rose $6.8 million or 7.7%
in 2002 to $95.8 million. Excluding acquisition and unusual expenses related to
Citizens National Bank of Malone (CNB), First Liberty (FLIB), and the
FleetBoston branches, noninterest expense was up $14.3 million or 17.7% in 2002,
reflective of a full year of operating expenses associated with the FleetBoston
branch acquisition versus less than two months in 2001. This year's overhead as
a percent of average assets was 2.83%, down from 3.08% in 2001. CBSI's
noninterest expense to average asset ratio was 2.85% (annualized) for the nine
months ended September 2002 compared to 2.98% for peers.

For CBSI as a whole, higher personnel expense accounted for 50% of 2002's
increase in noninterest expense, excluding acquisition and unusual expenses,
with personnel costs up 17.4%, mostly as a result of the FleetBoston branch
acquisition. The remainder of the increases in salary, benefit, and payroll tax
expense reflect competitive annual merit awards for employees and higher pension
expense (discussed in further detail below). Total full-time equivalent staff at
year-end 2002 was 1,120 versus 1,115 at year-end 2001.

Qualified and non-qualified pension expense of $2.0 million in 2002 was up
$582,000 or 42% from 2001's level. This increase was primarily due to additional
pension obligations for the employees added through the FleetBoston branch
acquisition (pension plan assets were not included in the acquisition), a
reduction from 7.0% (7.5% for pre-acquisition FLIB portion) to 6.75% of the
discount rate applied to future payments and higher executive pension-eligible
earnings. The three assumptions that have the largest impact on the calculation
of annual pension expense are the aforementioned discount rate, the rate applied
to future compensation increases and the expected rate of return on plan assets
for the next fiscal year. Table 10 contains the results of a sensitivity
analysis conducted to determine what the impact of a 1.0 percentage point
increase and decrease in these three assumptions would have on the forthcoming
annual pension expense for the two plans.

Nonpersonnel expense declined $305,000 or 0.6% in 2002 due to significantly
lower acquisition and unusual expenses in 2002. Excluding acquisition-related
expenses, nonpersonnel expense rose $7.2 million or 18.0% in 2002. As displayed
in Table 9, this was largely caused by data processing, up $2.1 million or
40.4%; occupancy expense, up $2.0 million or 33.2%; and equipment expense, up
$1.5 million or 24.1%. The increases in net occupancy and equipment expenses in
2002 were mainly due to the full-year impact of having significantly more
branches, and the corresponding expenditures necessary to adequately manage the
resulting higher volume of business. Data processing expense primarily relates
to Fiserv processing fees, data line charges, check and ATM processing expenses
and financial market transaction expenses incurred by the Company's financial
service units. The 2002 processing expense increase was driven by the higher
number of banking customer accounts and strong growth at the Company's
broker-dealer and pension administration businesses. These higher expense items
were partially offset by a $726,000 decrease in intangible amortization expense
in 2002 as a result of the adoption of SFAS 142 and SFAS 147, accounting
statements that call for the discontinuation of the amortization of certain
goodwill associated with whole company and branch acquisitions, respectively.
Please refer to Note F on page 55-56 for further information on these accounting
statements.

The efficiency ratio, a performance measurement tool widely used by banks, is
defined at two levels. The nominal ratio is total overhead expense divided by
operating income (full tax-equivalent net interest income plus noninterest
income, excluding net securities and debt gains and losses). The adjusted or
recurring efficiency ratio additionally excludes unusual expenses (a majority of
which are acquisition-related) and intangible amortization (a non-cash expense)
as well as all one-time noninterest income; these one-time income items mostly
relate the disposal of branch properties. Lower ratios correspond to higher
efficiency.

In 2002, the nominal efficiency ratio dropped by 12.1 percentage points to
56.1%, primarily as a result of much higher net interest income and
significantly lower acquisition-related expenses. The Company's nominal ratio of
57.0% was in line with the peer bank ratio of 56.7% for the nine months ended
September 2002. The 2002 recurring efficiency ratio decreased a favorable 4.0
percentage points from 2001's level to 52.5%. These results reflect the full
year impact of a combined $3.2 million in annual cost savings from actions taken
at First Liberty in mid-second quarter 2001 and the benefit of streamlining our
operations functions by eliminating duplicate loan and deposit processing units
in Canton and Olean, NY. The recurring ratio for the second half of 2002 was
50.5%, 4.2 percentage points below that of the first half, demonstrating
substantially improved efficiency arising from the full integration of the 2001
acquisitions and the consolidated operations units.

Due to the nature of the Company's financial services businesses, the efficiency
ratio of those activities is much higher than that generated by banking
operations (in most part due to the largest banking expense, interest, being
netted against gross interest income). The recurring efficiency ratio for
financial services was 76.9% for 2002, up from 75.3% in 2001, primarily as a
result of the adverse impact of unfavorable equity market conditions on Elias
Asset Management. The recurring efficiency ratio of the Company's banking
activities was 50.7% this year compared to 54.9% in 2001. The


                                       27
<PAGE>

efficiency improvements mentioned above had a proportionally greater benefit on
the banking portion of the business in 2002.

Acquisition and unusual expenses, which are excluded from recurring efficiency
ratio calculations, totaled $700,000 in 2002. These expenditures were primarily
comprised of legal and consulting fees of $455,000, $97,000 of severance expense
and general administrative expenses totaling $25,000. A vast majority of these
expenses was incurred in conjunction with the FleetBoston branch acquisition,
with the balance pertaining to the First Liberty acquisition (primarily
severance).

As displayed above in Table 9, recurring noninterest expenses for the fourth
quarter of 2002 were $2.1 million or 9.7% above the equivalent prior year
period. This change was primarily due to incurring a full quarter of expenses
associated with the branches acquired from FleetBoston versus approximately a
month and a half in 2001. Adoption of SFAS 142 and SFAS 147 in 2002 resulted in
significantly lower intangible amortization (prior year not restated as
prescribed by the accounting statements), offsetting a portion of the increases
in most of the other expense categories.

Income and Income Taxes

2002 income before taxes of $52.4 million was up $25.5 million or 95% from the
prior year's amount. Pre-tax income, adjusted to gross-up all tax-exempt
interest income to a full tax-equivalent basis, was $64.5 million, $30.2 million
or 88% above 2001's level.

The Company estimates its tax expense based on the amount it expects to owe the
respective tax authorities. Taxes are discussed in more detail in Note I of the
Consolidated Financial Statements on page 57. Accrued taxes represent the net
estimated amount due or to be received from taxing authorities. In estimating
accrued taxes, management assesses the relative merits and risks of the
appropriate tax treatment of transactions taking into account statutory,
judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of the Company's tax position.
If the final resolution of taxes payable differs from our estimates due to
regulatory determination or legislative or judicial actions, adjustments to tax
expense may be required.

The effective tax rate for 2002 declined by 2.5 percentage points to 26.5%. The
lower rate resulted in $0.10 higher earnings per share in 2002. This decline was
primarily due to the benefits realized on a larger proportion of income from tax
exempt investment securities, which mitigated the effect of the near doubling of
income before tax. In addition, the adoption of SFAS 142 and 147, the lack of
nondeductible merger expenses in 2002 compared with 2001, and a federal
low-income housing tax credit claimed in 2002, all contributed to the decline in
the effective tax rate.

Capital

Shareholders' equity ended 2002 at $325 million, up $57 million or 21.3% from
one year earlier. This improvement reflects earnings for the year and the
positive change in market value adjustment (MVA, represents the after-tax
unrealized appreciation of available-for-sale securities in the Company's
investment portfolio), offset by dividends declared to shareholders. Excluding
the MVA in both 2002 and 2001, capital rose by $28.8 million or 11.2%. Shares
outstanding grew by 76,000 during the year due to the exercise of stock options.

The Company's ratio of tier I capital to assets (or tier I leverage ratio), the
basic measure for which regulators have established a 5% minimum to be
considered "well-capitalized," increased 32 basis points in 2002 to 7.05%. This
reflects the capital-building contribution from retained earnings (net income
less dividends declared), which more than offset growth of the investment and
loan portfolios. The total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio increased 1.49
percentage points during 2002 to 13.32% as of year-end compared to the 10%
minimum requirement for "well-capitalized" banks. The tangible equity/tangible
assets ratio ended the year at 5.77% versus 4.09% at December 31, 2001;
approximately 76 basis points of this improvement reflect the increase in the
MVA. The Company's improved capital position strengthens its risk profile and
better enables it to take advantage of potential future strategic growth
opportunities.

Cash dividends declared on common stock in 2002 of $14.5 million represented an
increase of 15.4% over the prior year. This growth is partially a result of a
higher number of shares outstanding in the first three quarters of 2002 due to
the 1.3 million shares issued in the fourth quarter of 2001. The increase also
reflects the quarterly dividend per share being raised from $0.27 to $0.29 in
the third quarter of 2002.

CBSI's dividend payout ratio for the year was 37.7% compared to 65.7% in 2001
(52.3% as a percent of net income-operating), within the Company's targeted
payout range for dividends on common stock of 30-40%. Its payout ratio has
historically been high relative to peers, and for 2002, the ratio was in the
61st peer percentile. The large decrease in the payout ratio despite the higher
dividend reflects the 101% increase in net income from the prior year, which was
largely


                                       28
<PAGE>

due to higher interest earning assets, an improved net interest margin in 2002,
and considerably more acquisition-related expenses in 2001.

During the first quarter of 2002, the Company made a contribution of $5.0
million to its defined benefit pension plan. At March 31, 2002, an updated
actuarial valuation was performed which showed that plan assets exceeded the
accumulated benefit obligation (qualified pension obligations based on current
compensation levels). As a result, the additional minimum pension liability of
$5.016 million, which was recorded at December 31, 2001 as a charge to
shareholders' equity, net of tax, was reversed. During the last three quarters
of 2002 the Company contributed an additional $7.0 million to the plan to cover
the decline in plan assets partially caused by soft equity markets. At year-end
2002, an actuarial valuation was conducted. It was determined that plan assets
were greater than the accumulated benefit obligation, and therefore no minimum
pension liability adjustment was necessary. Refer to Note K on pages 59-60 of
the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information
regarding the Company's benefit plans.

Intangible Assets

Intangible assets consist of core deposit intangibles and goodwill arising from
acquisitions. Core deposit intangibles represent the premium the Company has
paid for deposits acquired in excess of the cost incurred had the funds been
purchased in the capital markets. Core deposit intangibles are amortized on
either an accelerated or straight-line basis over periods ranging from seven to
fifteen years. Goodwill represents the excess cost of an acquisition over the
fair value of the net assets acquired. Goodwill is subjected to an annual
impairment analysis to determine whether the carrying value of the acquired net
assets exceeds their fair value, which would necessitate a write-down of the
goodwill. The Company completed its goodwill impairment analysis during 2002 and
no adjustment was necessary. The impairment analysis was based upon discounted
cash flow modeling techniques that require management to make estimates
regarding the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. It also requires
them to select a discount rate that reflects the current return requirements of
the market in relation to present risk-free interest rates, required equity
market premiums and company-specific risk indicators.

As disclosed in Table 11 above, loans outstanding, net of unearned discount,
reached a record $1.807 billion as of year-end 2002, up $74 million or 4.3%
compared to twelve months earlier. CBNA's New York franchise grew $93 million or
6.9% during the year to $1.436 billion. In contrast, the Pennsylvania franchise
decreased by $19 million or 5.0% to $370 million at year-end 2002. A highly
competitive marketplace along with soft economic conditions contributed to the
decline at First

Liberty. Management is focused on enhancing lending efforts in the Pennsylvania
market and is committed to achieving solid loan growth in that region. Based on
overall asset/liability analysis, the decision was made not to sell secondary
market eligible mortgages for the first three quarters of 2002. Consequently,
only $9.1 million of the mortgages originated within our local markets were sold
in the secondary market in 2002 versus $43.6 million in 2001. Had these loans
not been sold in 2002, loan growth would have been $83 million or 4.8%.

The Company's predominant focus on the retail borrower enables its loan
portfolio to be highly diversified. As demonstrated in Table 12 below,
approximately 65% of loans outstanding are oriented to consumers borrowing on an
installment and residential mortgage loan basis. This proportion increased from
63% at year-end 2001 due to the decline in the business lending portfolio and
the strong growth of residential mortgages in 2002.

There is a high degree of diversification within the business lending sector.
The Bank's business loans are typically for amounts under $100,000, accounting
for about 82% of the number of business loans and approximately 23% of business
loan balances as of December 31, 2002. About 27% of the business portfolio is
comprised of loans between $250,000 and $1 million (about 6% of the number of
loans), while loans over $1 million comprise another 34% of the portfolio (1.6%
of the number of loans). The portfolio contains no credit card receivables.

Table 12 below recasts the Company's loan portfolio into four major lines of
business. The increase in consumer mortgages contributed $67 million of the $74
million in total loan growth in 2002, and consumer indirect loans accounted for
$39 million. Conversely, consumer direct and business lending portfolios were
down $18 million and $14 million from year-end 2001 levels, respectively. The
following section discusses the underlying reasons for changes in each of the
Company's four major lending activities or lines of business.

================================================================================

The combined total of general-purpose business lending, dealer floor plans,
mortgages on commercial property, and farm loans is characterized as the
Company's business lending activity. The portfolio decreased by $14 million or
2.2% in 2002 and reflects declines of $3 million in New York and $11 million in
Pennsylvania as lending efforts were impeded by soft economic conditions and
diminished capital spending levels in the commercial sector. Management is
committed to growing the business lending portfolio through a strategy
predicated upon hiring talented professionals, intensifying calling efforts, and
expanding business relationships in order to be positioned to fully take
advantage of growth opportunities once economic conditions improve.

The Bank's total commercial portfolio is broadly diversified by industry type
with the largest shares being in commercial real estate (19%), services (14%),
and health care (10%); followed by auto dealers (9%), agriculture (8%),
hotel/eating/drinking (7%), and manufacturing, construction, retail trade and
transportation (6% each) as of year-end 2002. Miscellaneous industries make up
the balance at 9%.

Demand for installment debt indirectly originated through automobile, marine,
and mobile home dealers increased substantially in 2002. Indirect loans ended
the year 16% or $39 million higher, primarily reflecting successful business
development efforts that increased the number of dealer relationships and the
Bank's ability to deliver attractive financing rates. Ninety-one percent of this
portfolio segment relates to automobile lending (76% of the vehicles are used
versus 24% new). Indirect loans increased $7.9 million (22%) in the Company's
First Liberty franchise and were up $31 million (15%) in the New York markets.

The segment of the Company's loan portfolio consisting of consumer mortgages is
predominantly fixed (94%) versus adjustable rate (6%) residential lending.
Record volumes in this year's historically low interest rate environment drove
strong growth of $67 million or 15.1% in 2002. Nearly $76 million of the growth
was generated in the New York franchise, offset by $9 million of run-off in
Pennsylvania. Twenty-eight percent ($21 million) of the increase in the New York
market portfolio was contributed by new business generated out of the branches
acquired from FleetBoston Financial in 2001. Growth in the core mortgage
portfolio is lower than it could have been had it not been for the sale of
selected


                                       30
<PAGE>

fixed rate originations in the secondary market. This program gives the
Bank the capability to offer competitive mortgage pricing and provides an
additional tool to manage interest rate risk.

Direct consumer loans decreased 4.5% or $18 million in 2002 to $379 million.
Loan balances fell approximately $11 million ($2.8%) in the New York markets and
$7 million (20%) at First Liberty mostly due to the weak economy adversely
affecting demand for these type of loans and a certain amount of installment
loans being paid off through mortgage refinancing. Extremely competitive
conditions in this lending segment within the Company's Pennsylvania market has
led to some loan run-off, and management is focused on bolstering lending
business development efforts at the First Liberty branches to reverse this
trend. This line of business is comprised of conventional installment loans
(including some isolated installment lending to small businesses), personal
loans, student loans (which are sold once principal repayment begins), and
borrowing under variable and fixed rate home equity lines of credit.

The following table reconciles the differences between the line of business loan
breakdown reflected above as compared to regulatory reporting definitions
reflected on the Call Report, Table 11, and Note D (pages 54-55) of the
financial statements.

</TABLE>

As displayed in Table 14 above, 12% of the loan portfolio at December 31, 2002
is scheduled to mature in one year or less, 34% of loans have maturities in the
one- to five-year range, and approximately 54% mature after five years. This
compares to 11%, 25% and 64% for the equivalent maturity categories at year-end
2001, respectively. The proportional increase in loans maturing in one to five
years reflects the growth of the indirect loan portfolio, a majority of which
relates to auto financing that predominately have terms that fall within this
range. The reduction of the percentage of loans that mature after five years was
due to a drop in time loan balances in the commercial portfolio that resulted in
a loan mix weighted more towards shorter-maturity loans.

to the mix of maturities and interest rate characteristics. At year-end 2002,
71% of loans have fixed interest rates, and the 29% that have variable rates
consist primarily of home equity and commercial loans. There is relatively even
distribution of the portfolio between loans with maturities below and above 5
years at 45% and 55% at December 31, 2002, respectively. Refer to the market
risk/interest rate risk section of the MD&A on pages 39 - 40 for specific

As shown in Table 16 above, nonperforming loans, defined as nonaccruing loans
plus accruing loans 90 days or more past due, ended 2002 at $11.6 million, up
approximately $2.5 million or 28% from one year earlier. This was primarily due
to increases in commercial loan nonaccruals. The ratio of nonperforming loans to
total loans rose 11 basis points from twelve months earlier to 0.64%. As of
September 30, 2002, when the nonperforming loan ratio stood at 0.69%, the
Company's asset quality was favorable to the peer level of 1.04%. The ratio of
nonperforming assets (which includes troubled debt restructuring and other real
estate, or OREO, in addition to nonperforming loans) to total loans plus OREO
increased to 0.69% at year-end 2002, up 8 basis points from one year earlier.

Total delinquencies, defined as loans 30 days or more past due and nonaccruing,
finished the year at 1.88% of total loans outstanding versus 1.93% at the end of
2001. As of year-end 2002, total delinquencies for commercial loans, installment
loans, and real estate mortgages were 2.22%, 2.30%, and 1.23%, respectively.
These measures were 2.15%, 2.06% and 1.25% as of September 30, 2002 compared to
peer levels of 2.56%, 1.89%, and 1.76%, respectively. As of September 30, 2002,
the total delinquency ratio of 1.80% was lower than the peer ratio of 2.06%.

A portion of the increase in net charge-offs was due to the significantly higher
average loan portfolio in 2002 as a result of the $177 million of loans added as
part of the FleetBoston branch acquisition in mid-November 2001. Consequently,
net charge-offs as a percent of average loans offers a clearer representation of
asset quality trends. Total net charge-offs for 2002 were higher by $3.2 million
or 49%, finishing the year at $9.8 million versus $6.6 million in 2001. As a
percentage of average loans, net charge-offs were up 14 basis points from last
year to 0.56%. Gross charge-offs rose 39% to $12.0 million, or 0.68% of average
loans outstanding versus 0.55% in 2001. This year's recoveries increased
$145,000 to $2.2 million, representing 26% of prior year gross charge-offs
compared to 28% in 2001. For the nine months ended September 30, 2002, the
Bank's total net charge-off ratio of 0.54% was in the 78th peer percentile based
on the peer norm of 0.40%.

Commercial loan net charge-offs increased in 2002, totaling $4.8 million or
0.74% of average commercial outstandings versus $2.0 million and 0.33% in 2001.
The primary reason for the increased commercial net charge-off ratio was
weakened economic conditions in the markets served by the Bank and charge-offs
on two particular commercial credits. Consumer installment net charge-offs rose
to $4.9 million from $4.4 million in 2001, but the net charge-off ratio was
virtually flat at a 99 basis point level. The net charge-off dollar amount and
ratio were lower for the indirect installment portfolio (loans originated
largely through automobile dealerships) in 2002, while both these items
increased on the direct installment portfolio. A portion of this increase
reflects certain differences in underwriting criteria for acquired loans than
that practiced by the Bank. Mortgage net charge-offs were de minimus in both
years. The risk profile of new installment loans booked in 2002 improved versus
2001 in relation to the credit quality of the borrowers. Seventy-five percent of
new installment lending volume in 2002 was rated as A and B paper, the two
highest rankings in the standard A - D credit categories, compared to 62% in
2001.

Management continually evaluates the credit quality of the Company's loan
portfolio and conducts a formal review of the allowance for loan loss adequacy
on a quarterly basis. The two primary components of the loan review process that
are used to determine proper allowance levels are specific and general loan loss
allocations.

Specific loan loss allocations are established for loans within the commercial
loan portfolio that are determined to be temporarily impaired. The Bank's
commercial lenders identify such loans through regular credit analysis of their
customers' financial health and the collateral supporting their loans. If it is
determined that cash flow-generating ability of the commercial customer may not
be adequate to enable to them to make full payment of principal and interest as
scheduled, and the fair market value of the assets collateralizing the loans is
not sufficient to cover potential losses, the loans are categorized as
temporarily impaired. The impairment is deemed temporary if there is expectation
that the financial performance of the customer will improve or that the value of
the collateral will appreciate. If this is not the case, the impairment is
considered permanent, and the loan will be charged off. Specific loan loss
allocations are established for all large temporarily impaired commercial loans
based on their collateral shortfall.

The second component of the allowance establishment process, general loan loss
allocations, is composed of two calculations that are computed on the four main
loan segments: commercial, consumer direct, consumer indirect and residential
real estate. The first calculation determines an allowance level based on the
latest three years of historical net charge-off data for each loan category. The
second calculation is qualitative and takes into consideration five major
factors affecting the level of loan loss risk: portfolio risk migration patterns
(internal credit quality trends); the growth of the segments of the loan
portfolio; economic and business environment trends in the Bank's markets
(includes review of bankruptcy, unemployment, population, consumer spending and
regulatory trends); industry, geographical and product concentrations in the
portfolio; and the perceived effectiveness of managerial resources and lending
practices and policies. These two allowance calculations are added together to
determine the general allocation ratio, which is applied to the four homogenous
loan pools (excluding commercial loan balances with specific loan loss
allocations). The allowance levels computed from the specific and general loan
loss allocation methods are combined to derive the necessary allowance for loan
loss to be reflected on the Consolidated Statement of Condition.

The loan loss provision is calculated by subtracting the previous period
allowance for loan loss, net of the interim period net charge-offs, from the
current required allowance level. This provision is then booked as an expense in
the income statement for that period.

The loan review department, senior credit officers, executive management and the
loan committee of the Board of Directors all examine the results of the
allowance for loan loss process in detail and determine if it is adequate each
quarter. Management is committed to continually improving the credit assessment
and risk management capabilities of the Bank and will dedicate the resources
necessary to ensure advancement in this critical area of operations.

The allowance for loan loss was increased to $26.3 million at year-end 2002
versus $23.9 million at the end of 2001. The $2.4 million increase was due to
$74 million more loans outstanding, a year-end update of the historical
component of the general allocation calculation (2002's high commercial
charge-off ratio replaced 1999's comparatively low ratio),


                                       33
<PAGE>

and higher commercial loan specific allocations ($5.1 or 0.79% of the commercial
portfolio at December 31, 2002 versus $4.3 million or 0.65% at year-end 2001).

As a percent of total loans, the allowance for loan loss ratio increased to
1.46% for year-end 2002 versus 1.38% last year. As of September 30, 2002, the
Company's reserve ratio of 1.35% was 20 basis points below the peer median,
while the coverage of nonperforming loans at 197% was above the norm of 188%
(61st percentile). Management believes year-end 2002 coverage at 226% to be
adequate in light of the probable losses in the Company's loan portfolio.

The loan loss provision as percentage of average loans increased from 0.45% in
2001 to 0.69% for all of this year. The annualized provision ratio for the nine
months ended September 30, 2002 of 0.55% was slightly above the peer norm of
0.53%. Due to higher net charge-offs in 2002 and management's assessment of the
probable losses in the loan portfolio as discussed above, loan loss provision
increased by $5.1million or 72% in 2002. Loan loss provision covered net
charge-offs by 125% this year versus 108% in 2001.

Changes in the allowance for loan losses for the last five years is as follows:

Funding Sources

Typical of most commercial banking institutions today is the need to rely on a
variety of funding sources to support the earning asset base as well as to
achieve targeted growth objectives. There are three primary sources of funding
that comprise CBSI's overall funding matrix, which considers maturity,
stability, and price: deposits of individuals, partnerships and corporations
(IPC deposits); collateralized municipal deposits (public funds); and capital
market borrowings.


                            Table 19: Source of Funds
                          Average 4th Quarter Balances

IPC deposits .............   $2,378    77.6%   $2,130    78.3%   $1,713    70.9%
Public funds .............      161     5.3%      170     6.3%      236     9.8%
Capital borrowings .......      524    17.1%      419    15.4%      467    19.3%
--------------------------------------------- ----------------  ----------------
  Total fund sources .....   $3,063   100.0%   $2,719   100.0%   $2,416   100.0%
================================================================================

The Company's funding matrix continues to benefit from a high level of IPC
deposits, which reached an all-time record with a fourth quarter average of
$2.378 billion, an increase of $248 million or 11.6% over the comparable 2001
period. This is largely due to the $470 million in deposits acquired from the 36
former FleetBoston branches in November 2001. From the acquisition date through
year-end 2002, IPC deposits in the acquired branches have increased 4.1%. IPC
deposits are frequently considered to be a bank's most attractive source of
funding because they are generally stable, do not need to be collateralized,
have a relatively low cost, and represent a strong customer base for which a
variety of loan, deposit and other financial service-related products can be
cross-sold.

The mix of CBSI's deposits changed only modestly, with the average fourth
quarter time deposit mix dropping from 49% of IPC deposits in 2001 to 45% in
2002. This decrease largely reflects certain customer preferences not to renew
at current rates, often placing the funds in non-CD accounts at the Bank for the
time being. A higher mix of money market and checking deposits in the fourth
quarter of 2002 versus the year-earlier period was not unexpected given the
interest rate environment. Historically low market rates resulted in reduced
spreads between CDs and other interest-bearing deposits and lessened the
opportunity costs associated with holding demand deposits.

Deposits of local municipalities decreased $9 million or 5.3% during the past
year, with balances for fourth quarter 2002 averaging $161 million versus $170
million for the same 2001 quarter. Under New York State Municipal Law, the
Company is required to collateralize all local government deposits with
marketable securities from its investment portfolio. Because of this
stipulation, management considers this source of funding to be equivalent to
capital market borrowings. As such, CBSI endeavors to price these deposits at or
below alternative capital market borrowing rates. Municipal deposits decreased
due to the favorability of the aforementioned borrowing rates in comparison to
competitive pricing of the public fund deposits. It should be noted that
utilization of municipal deposits has generally been flat to down over the last
few years as a percent of total funding sources.

Capital market borrowings are defined as funding sources available on a national
market basis, generally requiring some form of collateralization. Borrowing
sources for the Company include the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, Federal
Reserve Bank of New York, as well as access to the national repurchase agreement
market through established relationships with primary market security dealers.
Also considered as borrowings are the $30 million in fixed rate 9.75%
Company-Obligated Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Securities (trust preferred)
issued to support 1997's acquisitions and approximately $50 million in
floating-rate trust preferred raised to support the FleetBoston branch
acquisition. Capital market borrowings averaged $524 million or 17% of total
funding sources for fourth quarter 2002, an increase from the fourth quarter
2001 level of $419 million or 15% of total funding. These additional borrowings
were used to fund investment purchases made during the first half of 2002. As of
December 31, 2002, 54% or $248 million of capital market borrowings (excluding
the aforementioned line of credit and trust preferred securities) had remaining
terms of one year or less.

During fourth quarter 2002, approximately $11 million in term advances from the
Federal Home Loan Bank were prepaid, resulting in a prepayment penalty of
$925,000. This strategy was implemented because the cost of replacement debt,
including prepayment penalty, was economically justified versus continuing to
hold the existing instruments. A similar strategy was executed in third quarter
2001 when $95 million of debt was prepaid, resulting in a penalty of $2.7
million.

Investments

The objective of CBSI's investment portfolio is to provide low-risk, quality
assets to the statement of condition. This must be accomplished within the
following constraints: (a) implementing certain interest rate risk management
strategies which achieve a relatively stable level of net interest income; (b)
providing both the regulatory and operational liquidity necessary to conduct
day-to-day business activities; (c) considering investment risk-weights as
determined by the regulatory risk-based capital guidelines; and (d) generating a
favorable return without undue compromise of the other requirements.

From December 31, 2001 to December 31, 2002, the book value of CBSI's investment
portfolio increased $88 million or 7.8% to $1.2 billion, reflective of purchase
strategies largely in the first half of 2002, offset by planned investment
runoff and strategic investment sales.


                                       36
<PAGE>

Investment interest income in 2002 was $13.2 million or 18.4% higher than the
prior year as a result of $227 million or 22% higher average outstandings,
partially offset by a decrease in the average investment yield from 6.96% to
6.74%. This drop occurred because the decrease in taxable yields caused by the
overall decrease in market rates more than offset the increased yield and
greater mix of tax-exempt holdings, whose maturities were lengthened. Through
September 30, 2002, the tax equivalent investment yield was in the exceptional
98th percentile compared to national peer banks in the $3 to $10 billion asset
range.

To protect the Bank against exposure to falling interest rates, the bulk of the
Bank's 2002 purchases were in intermediate-term municipal bonds and agency
securities with a minimum of five years of call protection. Despite a continued
falling rate environment, the steepness of the yield curve in 2002 combined with
the call-protected yields on this year's investment purchases, allowed for
widening spreads over cost of funds on investment transactions.

During 2002, approximately $80 million of investments were sold, resulting in
net investment gains of approximately $2.6 million. The sales were based on the
Company's total return strategy (see below) or to maintain holdings within
investment policy guidelines. Those proceeds that were reinvested resulted in an
improved interest rate risk position.

The investment portfolio has essentially no credit risk due to the composition
continuing to heavily favor U.S. Agency Debentures, U.S. Agency mortgage-backed
pass-throughs, U.S. Agency CMOs and municipal bonds insured by third parties. As
of year-end 2002, these four AAA-rated (highest possible rating) security types
accounted for 98% of the total portfolio excluding Federal Home Loan Bank stock
and Federal Reserve Bank stock, or 32%, 11%, 20% and 35% respectively. These
four security types comprised 95% of total investments as of December 31, 2001
at 17%, 16%, 36% and 26%, respectively. While a little more than a third of the
investment portfolio at year-end 2002 is in municipal bonds, management believes
that the tax risk in the Company's municipal investments arising from potential
future changes in statutory, judicial and regulatory actions is minimal. The
investment portfolio's December 31, 2002 effective duration, which measures
price sensitivity, was 3.94 years.

Since 1997, the Company has utilized total return as its primary methodology for
managing investment portfolio assets. Under this analytical method, shareholder
value is maximized through both interest income and market value appreciation.
For the third quarter of 2002, the Company's five-year total return at 8.25% was
in the extremely favorable 98th peer percentile per the Investment Performance
Digest.

Because nearly all of the Company's investments are classified as available-for
sale, any broad change in market value has a significant impact on book equity.
As of year-end 2002, the pre-tax net market value gain over book value was $64.6
million versus a gain of $17.4 million as of year-end 2001.

Market Risk/Interest Rate Risk

Market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse
changes in market rates or prices. The Company's primary market risk exposure is
to interest rate risk. The ongoing monitoring and management of this risk, over
both a short-term tactical and longer-term strategic time horizon, is an
important component of the Company's asset/liability management process, which
is governed by policies established by its Board of Directors and reviewed and
approved annually. The Board of Directors delegates responsibility for carrying
out the asset/liability management policies to the Asset/Liability Management
Committee (ALCO). In this capacity, ALCO develops guidelines and strategies
impacting the Company's asset/liability management activities based upon
estimated market risk sensitivity, policy limits, and overall market interest
rate levels and trends.

As the Company does not believe it is possible to reliably predict future
interest rate movements, it has maintained an appropriate process and set of
measurement tools which enable it to identify and quantify sources of interest
rate risk in varying rate environments. The primary tool used by the Company in
managing interest rate risk is income simulation. The analysis begins by
measuring the impact of differences in maturity and repricing of all balance
sheet positions. Such work is further augmented by adjusting for prepayment and
embedded option risk found naturally in certain asset and liability classes.
Finally, balance sheet growth and funding expectations are added to the analysis
in order to reflect the strategic initiatives set forth by the Company.

Changes in net interest income are reviewed after subjecting the balance sheet
to an array of treasury yield curve possibilities. The following reflects the
Company's one-year net interest income sensitivity based on asset and liability
levels on December 31, 2002, assuming no growth in the balance sheet, and
assuming an instantaneous 200 basis point increase and 100 basis point decrease
in the prime rate, federal funds rate and the entire treasury yield curve. This
test is one that is suggested by the Company's regulators (the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency), and represents conditions that are largely
theoretical as compared to the "management model" discussed below.

                           Table 25: Regulatory Model

                             Net Interest Income
    Rate Change      Dollar Change During First 12 Months
  In Basis Points         Versus No Change In Rates           Percent Change
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
     + 200 bp                    $2.2 million                      1.7%
     - 100 bp                   -$2.0 million                     -1.6%

When compared to no change in interest rates during the first 12 months, net
interest income performs better in the rising rate environment than in the
falling rate environment due in large part to significant levels of core
deposits, which are not as volatile in terms of rate movement as are other
funding sources.

Additionally, to consider balance sheet growth and the steepness in slope of the
treasury yield curve as of year-end 2002, a second group of simulations was
performed based on what the Company believes to be conservative levels of
balance sheet growth-- low single digit growth in loans and deposits along with
natural run-off of investments, augmented by any necessary changes in
borrowings, with no growth in other major portions of the balance sheet. On that
basis, a variety of scenarios was tested, including moving Prime and Fed Funds
up 200 basis points and down 100 basis points over a 12 month period while
flattening the long end of the treasury curve to spreads over fed funds that are
more consistent with historical norms.

                           Table 26: Management Model

                             Net Interest Income
    Rate Change      Dollar Change During First 12 Months
  In Basis Points         Versus No Change In Rates           Percent Change
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
     + 200 bp                    $2.8 million                      2.2%
     - 100 bp                   -$3.0 million                     -2.4%

This test is considered by Company management to be a more realistic measure of
interest rate risk when compared to no change in rates over the first 12 months.
Nonetheless, the analysis does not represent a Company forecast and should not
be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results. These
hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions: the nature and
timing of interest rate levels (including yield curve shape), prepayments on
loans and securities, deposit decay rates, pricing decisions on loans and
deposits, reinvestment/replacement of asset and liability cash flows, and other
factors. While the assumptions are developed based upon current economic and
local market conditions, the Company cannot make any assurances as to the
predictive nature of these assumptions, including


                                       39
<PAGE>

how customer preferences or competitor influences might change. Furthermore, the
sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that ALCO might take in responding
to or anticipating changes in interest rates.

Liquidity

Due to the potential for unexpected fluctuations in deposits and loans, active
management of the Company's liquidity is critical. In order to respond to these
circumstances, adequate sources of both on and off-balance sheet funding are in
place.

CBSI's primary approach to measuring liquidity is known as the Basic
Surplus/Deficit model. It is used to calculate liquidity over two time periods:
first, the amount of cash that could be made available within 30 days
(calculated as liquid assets less short-term liabilities); and second, a
projection of subsequent cash availability over an additional 60 days. The
minimum policy level of liquidity under the Basic Surplus/Deficit approach is
7.5% of total assets for both the 30 and 90-day time horizons. As of year-end
2002, this ratio was 16.2% and 16.1%, respectively, excluding the Company's
capacity to borrow additional funds from the Federal Home Loan Bank.

To measure longer-term liquidity, a baseline projection of loan and deposit
growth for five years is made to reflect how current liquidity levels could
change over time. This five-year measure reflects ample liquidity for loan
growth over the next five years.

COMMUNITY BANK SYSTEM, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTE A:  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Nature of Operations

Community Bank System, Inc. is a one-bank holding company which wholly-owns
seven subsidiaries: Community Bank, N.A. (the Bank), Community Capital Trust I,
II, and Community Statutory Trust III subsidiary business trusts, Benefit Plans
Administrative Services, Inc. (BPA), CFSI Closeout Corp. (CFSICC), and First of
Jermyn Realty Co. (FJRC). Community Capital Trust I was formed in February 1997
for the purpose of issuing mandatorily redeemable convertible securities which
are considered Tier I capital under regulatory capital adequacy requirements
(see Note P). In July 2001, Community Capital Trust II and Community Statutory
Trust III were formed to issue Company-obligated pooled capital securities which
are considered Tier I capital under regulatory capital adequacy requirements.
BPA provides pension administration and consulting services to sponsors of
defined benefit and defined contribution plans. CFSICC and FJRC are inactive
companies. The Bank operates 112 customer facilities throughout the Northern,
the Finger Lakes, and the Southern Tier regions of New York State, as well as
Northeastern Pennsylvania, and owns the following subsidiaries: Community
Financial Services, Inc. (CFSI), Community Investment Services, Inc. (CISI),
CBNA Treasury Management Corporation (TMC), CBNA Preferred Funding Corporation
(PFC), Elias Asset Management, Inc. (EAM) and First Liberty Service Corp.
(FLSC). CFSI offers insurance and investment products. CISI provides
broker-dealer and investment advisory services. TMC operates the cash
management, investment, and treasury functions of the Bank. PFC primarily
engages in investing of residential real estate loans. EAM provides asset
management services to individuals, corporate pension and profit sharing plans,
and foundations. FLSC provides banking related services to the Pennsylvania
branches of the Bank.

Basis of Presentation

All amounts except share, per-share and rates are presented in thousands.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and
its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All inter-company accounts and transactions have
been eliminated in consolidation.

Critical Accounting Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Critical accounting estimates include the allowance for loan losses, actuarial
assumptions associated with the pension, post-retirement and other employee
benefit plans, fair value of investment securities, and fair value methodologies
used to review the carrying value of goodwill.

Risk and Uncertainties

In the normal course of its business, the Company encounters economic and
regulatory risks. There are three main components of economic risk: interest
rate risk, credit risk and market risk. The Company is subject to interest rate
risk to the degree that its interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice at
different speeds, or on different bases, from its interest-earning assets. The
Company's primary credit risk is the risk of default on the Company's loan
portfolio that results from the borrowers' inability or unwillingness to make
contractually required payments. Market risk reflects potential changes in the
value of collateral underlying loans, the fair value of investment securities,
and loans held for sale.

The Company is subject to regulations of various governmental agencies. These
regulations can and do change significantly from period to period. The Company
also undergoes periodic examinations by the regulatory agencies which may
subject it to further changes with respect to asset valuations, amounts of
required loan loss allowances, and operating restrictions resulting from the
regulators' judgements based on information available to them at the time of
their examinations.

Business Combinations

Since the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS 141, "Business
Combinations," business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001, are required
to be accounted for under the purchase method. Under the purchase method, net
assets of the business acquired are recorded at their estimated fair value as of
the date of acquisition with any excess of the cost of the acquisition over the
fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired recorded as
goodwill. Results of operations of the acquired business are included in the
income statement from the date of acquisition. Prior to SFAS 141, certain
business combinations were accounted for under the pooling-of-interests method,
which required the retroactive combining of the assets, liabilities,
shareholders' equity, and results of operations of the merged entity with the
Company's respective accounts at historical amounts. Prior period financial
statements were restated to give effect to business combinations accounted for
under this method.

Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes income on an accrual basis. TMC recognizes interest
income on its investment assets using the interest method and recognizes
management fee income for its treasury and investment management services
rendered to the Bank and PFC. CISI and CFSI both recognize fee income when
insurance and investment products are sold to the public. EAM provides asset
management services to brokerage firms and clients and recognizes income ratably
over the contract period during which service is performed. PFC recognizes
interest income on real estate mortgages using the interest method and a
management fee for services it provides to the Bank. FLSC earns a fee from the
Bank for the personnel and management services it provides to the Pennsylvania
division of the Bank. BPA performs actuarial and recordkeeping services and
earns its income over the portion of the contract period during which service is
performed. Community Capital Trust I and II and Community Statutory Trust III
earn interest income on their investment in Junior Subordinated Debentures of
the Parent Company using the interest method. All intercompany fees and interest
income and expense among related entities eliminate in consolidation.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash on
hand, amounts due from banks and federal funds sold. Generally, federal funds
are sold for one-day periods. The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet
for cash and cash equivalents approximate those assets' fair values.

Investment Securities

The Company has classified its investments in debt and equity securities as
held-to-maturity or available-for-sale. Held-to-maturity securities are those
for which the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity,
and are reported at cost, which is adjusted for amortization of premiums and
accretion of discounts. Debt securities not classified as held-to-maturity are
classified as available-for-sale and are reported at fair market value with net
unrealized gains and losses reflected as a separate component of shareholders'
equity, net of applicable income taxes. None of the Company's investment
securities has been classified as trading securities. Equity securities are
stated at cost and include stock of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and
Federal Home Loan Bank of New York. Investment securities are reviewed regularly
for other than temporary impairment. Where there is other than temporary
impairment, the carrying value of the investment security is reduced to the
estimated fair value, with the impairment loss recognized in the consolidated
statements of income as other operating income, net.

The average cost method is used in determining the realized gains and losses on
sales of investment securities, which are reported under other income as
investment security gain (loss), net. Premiums and discounts on securities are
amortized and accreted, respectively, on a systematic basis over the period to
maturity, estimated life, or earliest call date of the related security.

Fair values for investment securities are based on quoted market prices, where
available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on
quoted market prices of comparable instruments.

Loans

Loans are stated at unpaid principal balances. Fair values for variable rate
loans that reprice frequently, with no significant credit risk, are based on
carrying values. Fair values for fixed rate loans are estimated using discounted
cash flows and interest rates currently being offered for loans with similar
terms to borrowers of similar credit quality. Mortgage loans held for sale are
carried at the lower of cost or market and are included in loans as the balance
of such loans was not significant. The carrying amount of accrued interest
approximates its fair value.


                                       47
<PAGE>

Interest on commercial loans and mortgages is accrued and credited to operations
based upon the principal amount outstanding. Unearned discount on installment
loans is recognized as income over the term of the loan, principally by the
actuarial method. Non-refundable loan fees and related direct costs are included
in the loan balances and are deferred and amortized over the life of the loan as
an adjustment to loan yield using the effective interest method.

Impaired and Other Nonaccrual Loans

The Company places a loan on nonaccrual status when the loan is more than ninety
days past due (or sooner, if management concludes collection of interest is
doubtful), except when, in the opinion of management, it is well-collateralized
and in the process of collection. A loan may be placed on nonaccrual status
earlier than ninety days past due if there is deterioration in the financial
position of the borrower or if other conditions of the loan so warrant. When a
loan is placed on nonaccrual status, uncollected accrued interest is charged
against interest income. Interest income during the period the loan is on
nonaccrual status is recorded on a cash basis. Nonaccrual loans are returned to
accrual status when management determines that the borrower's performance has
improved and that both principal and interest are collectible. This generally
requires a sustained period of timely principal and interest payments.

A loan is considered impaired, based on current information and events, if it is
probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of
principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan
agreement. The measurement of impaired loans is generally based upon the present
value of expected future cash flows, except that all collateral-dependent loans
are measured for impairment based on fair value of the collateral.

Allowance for Loan Losses

When appropriate, an impaired loan is assigned a specific allowance. Specific
loan loss allocations for certain identified commercial customers are considered
and revised as necessary. Charge-off of these commercial customers are taken
against the specific allocations before being applied against the general
reserve. General allocations on the commercial, residential and consumer loan
portfolios are reviewed and recalculated quarterly based on historical loss
experience and various qualitative judgement factors. These qualitative factors
include changes in national and local economic and business conditions, changes
in experience, ability and depth of lending management, changes in the portfolio
mix and risk profile, and changes in the growth of the loan portfolios. Loan
losses are charged off against the allowance, while recoveries of amounts
previously charged off are credited to the allowance.

The allowance for loan losses reflects management's best estimate of probable
loan losses in the Company's loan portfolio. Determination of the allowance for
loan losses is inherently subjective. It requires significant estimates
including the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans
and the amount of estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans which is based
on historical loss experience and consideration of current economic trends, all
of which may be susceptible to significant change.

Intangible Assets

Intangible assets represent core deposit intangibles and goodwill arising from
acquisitions. On January 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS 142, "Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets," and SFAS 147, "Accounting for Certain Acquisitions of
Banking and Thrift Institutions." Under the provisions of SFAS 142 and SFAS 147,
goodwill is no longer ratably amortized into the income statement over an
estimated life, but rather is tested at least annually for impairment. Core
deposit intangibles continue to be amortized on either an accelerated or
straight-line basis over periods ranging from 7 to 15 years. Prior to the
adoption of SFAS 142 and SFAS 147, the Company's goodwill was amortized on a
straight-line basis over varying periods not exceeding 25 years. Note F includes
a summary of the Company's core deposit intangibles and goodwill as well as
further detail about the impact of the adoption of SFAS 142 and SFAS 147.

Premises and Equipment

Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Computer software costs that are capitalized only include external direct costs
of obtaining and installing the software. The annual provision for depreciation
is computed using the straight-line method over the assets' estimated useful
lives. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.

Other Real Estate

Properties acquired through foreclosure, or by deed in lieu of foreclosure, are
carried at the lower of the unpaid loan balance plus settlement costs, or fair
value less estimated costs of disposal. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, other
real estate, included in other assets, amounted to $704 and $1,427,
respectively.


                                       48
<PAGE>

Mortgage Servicing Rights

Originated mortgage servicing rights are recorded at their fair value at the
time of transfer and are amortized in proportion to and over the period of
estimated net servicing income or loss. The Company uses a valuation model that
calculates the present value of future cash flows to determine the fair value of
servicing rights. In using this valuation method, the Company incorporates
assumptions that market participants would use in estimating future net
servicing income, which includes estimates of the servicing cost per loan, the
discount rate, and prepayment speeds. The carrying value of the originated
mortgage servicing rights is periodically evaluated for impairment using these
same market assumptions. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, mortgage servicing
rights, included in other assets, amounted to $283 and $567, respectively.

Deposits

The fair values of demand and savings deposits are based on carrying values. The
carrying amounts for variable rate money market accounts and certificates of
deposit approximate their fair values. Fair values for fixed rate certificates
of deposit are estimated using discounted cash flows and interest rates
currently being offered on similar certificates. The carrying value of accrued
interest approximates fair value.

Borrowings

The carrying amounts of federal funds purchased and short-term borrowings
approximate their fair values. Fair values for long-term borrowings are
estimated using discounted cash flows and interest rates currently being offered
on similar borrowings.

Since the Company considers debt extinguishments in its interest rate risk
strategy, any prepayment penalties incurred on long-term borrowings are
presented in the other income section of the consolidated statements of income.

Treasury Stock

Treasury stock purchases are recorded at cost. The Company purchases treasury
stock primarily for strategic purposes. During 2001, the Company issued 648,100
shares of treasury stock in connection with the acquisition of Citizens National
Bank of Malone.

Income Taxes

Provisions for income taxes are based on taxes currently payable or refundable,
and deferred taxes which are based on temporary differences between the tax
basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial
statements. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are reported in the financial
statements at currently enacted income tax rates applicable to the period in
which the deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or
settled.

Retirement Benefits

The Company has established tax-qualified retirement plans covering
substantially all full-time employees and certain part-time employees. The
Company also provides post-retirement benefits for eligible retired employees
and dependents. Expense under these plans is charged to current operations and
consists of several components of net periodic benefit cost based on various
actuarial assumptions regarding future experience under the plans. In addition,
the Company has unfunded deferred compensation and supplemental executive
retirement plans for selected current and former employees and officers that
provide benefits that cannot be paid from a qualified retirement plan due to
Internal Revenue Code restrictions. These plans are nonqualified under the
Internal Revenue Code, and assets used to fund benefit payments are not
segregated from other assets of the Company; therefore, in general, a
participant's or beneficiary's claim to benefits under these plans is as a
general creditor.

Assets Under Management

Assets held in fiduciary or agency capacities for customers are not included in
the accompanying consolidated statements of condition, since such items are not
assets of the Company. Substantially all fees associated with providing
management services are recorded on an accrual basis of income and are included
in other income. Assets under management at December 31, 2002 and 2001 were
$1,364,000 and $1,385,000, respectively.


                                       49
<PAGE>

Earnings Per Share

Basic-earnings per share are computed based on the weighted-average common
shares outstanding for the period. Diluted-earnings per share are based on the
weighted-average shares outstanding adjusted for the dilutive effect of the
assumed exercise of stock options during the year. The dilutive effect of
options is calculated using the treasury stock method of accounting. The
treasury stock method determines the number of common shares which would be
outstanding if all the in-the-money options (average market price is greater
than the exercise price) were exercised and the proceeds were used to repurchase
common shares in the open market at the average market price for the applicable
time period.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company accounts for stock awards issued to directors, officers and key
employees using the intrinsic value method. This method requires that
compensation expense be recognized to the extent that the fair value of the
stock exceeds the exercise price of the stock award at the grant date. The
Company generally does not recognize compensation expense related to stock
awards because the stock awards generally have fixed terms and exercise prices
that are equal to or greater than the fair value of the Company's common stock
at the grant date.

SFAS 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," requires companies that use
the "intrinsic value method" to account for stock compensation plans to provide
pro forma disclosures of the net income and earnings per share effect of stock
options using the "fair value method." Under the intrinsic value method, the
excess of the fair value of the stock over the exercise price is recorded as
expense on the date at which both the number of shares the recipient is entitled
to receive and the exercise price are known.

Management estimated the fair value of options granted using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model. This model was originally developed to estimate the fair
value of exchange-traded equity options, which (unlike employee stock options)
have no vesting period or transferability restrictions. As a result, the
Black-Scholes model is not a perfect indicator of the value of an option, but it
is commonly used for this purpose.

The Black-Scholes model requires several assumptions, which management developed
based on historical trends and current market observations. These assumptions
include:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                           2002           2001          2000
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Weighted-average expected life ....            6.74       7.02             7.11
Future dividend yield .............            3.00%      3.00%            3.00%
Share price volatility ............           27.82%     28.14%           29.15%
Weighted average risk-free
  interest rate ...................    3.814%-5.157%      5.11%      4.65%-6.93%
================================================================================

If these assumptions are not accurate, the estimated fair value used to derive
the information presented in the following table also will be inaccurate.
Moreover, the model assumes that the estimated fair value of an option is
amortized over the option's vesting period and would be included in personnel
expense on the income statement. The pro forma impact of applying the fair value
method of accounting for the years shown below may not be indicative of the pro
forma impact in future years.

Fair Values of Financial Instruments

The Company determines fair values based on quoted market values where available
or on estimates using present values or other valuation techniques. Those
techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the
discount rate and estimates of future cash flows. In that regard, the derived
fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent
markets and, in many cases, could not be realized in immediate settlement of the
instrument. SFAS 107, "Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments,"
excludes certain financial instruments and all non-financial instruments from
its disclosure requirements. Accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts
presented do not represent the underlying value of the Company.

The fair values of investment securities, loans, deposits, and borrowings have
been disclosed in footnotes C, D, G, and H, respectively.

Accounting Pronouncements

In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets," which addresses financial accounting and
reporting for the impairment of long-lived assets and for long-lived assets to
be disposed of, including long-term customer relationships of a financial
institution, such as core deposit intangibles. This Statement supersedes SFAS
121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived
Assets to Be Disposed Of." SFAS 144 retains the fundamental provisions of
Statement 121 for (a) recognition and measurement of the impairment of
long-lived assets to be held and used, and (b) measurement of long-lived assets
to be disposed of by sale. Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted this
pronouncement, which had no impact on the financial condition or results of
operations for the year ended December 31, 2002.

In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS 145, "Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4,
44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections,"
which updates, clarifies, and simplifies certain existing accounting
pronouncements beginning at various dates in 2002 and 2003. This Statement
rescinds SFAS 4 and SFAS 64, which required net gains or losses from the
extinguishment of debt to be classified as an extraordinary item in the income
statement. These gains and losses will now be classified as extraordinary only
if they meet the criteria for such classification as outlined in APB Opinion 30,
which allows for extraordinary treatment if the item is material and both
unusual and infrequent in nature. The Statement also rescinds SFAS 44 related to
the accounting for intangible assets for motor carriers and amends SFAS 13 to
require certain lease modifications that have economic effects similar to
sale-leaseback transactions to be accounted for as such. The Company adopted
this pronouncement as of July 1, 2002. As a result, gains and losses from debt
extinguishments have been presented in the other income section of the
consolidated statements of income and all prior periods have been restated.

In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated
with Exit or Disposal Activities," which addresses financial accounting and
reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities. This Statement
supersedes Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 94-3, "Liability Recognition for
Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit and Activity
(including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)." The provisions of this
Statement are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after
December 31, 2002, with early application encouraged. This pronouncement does
not have a significant impact on the Company's financial condition or results of
operations for the year ended December 31, 2002.

In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation - Transition and Disclosure," which provides alternative methods of
transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting
for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, this Statement amends the
disclosure requirements of SFAS 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,"
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements
about the method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the
effect of the method used on reported results. The Company will continue to
account for stock-based compensation using the intrinsic value method but will
provide pro forma disclosures of the net income and earnings per share effect of
stock options using the "fair value method" in its annual and interim financial
statements.

See Note F for discussion of recent accounting pronouncements regarding goodwill
and intangible assets.

NOTE B:  ACQUISITIONS

FleetBoston Financial Corporation

On November 16, 2001, the Company acquired 36 branches from FleetBoston
Financial Corporation with $470 million in deposits and $177 million in loans.
The branches are located in the Southwestern and Finger Lakes Regions of New
York State. The acquisition has been accounted for under the purchase method of
accounting. As a result of the acquisition, the Company's core deposit funding
increased, and the addition of new markets with expanded lending and financial
service opportunities will enable the Company to grow in an increasingly
competitive banking environment.

Citizens National Bank of Malone

On January 26, 2001, the Company acquired the $111-million-asset Citizens
National Bank of Malone, an eighty-year-old commercial bank with five branches
throughout Franklin and St. Lawrence counties in New York State. The Company
issued 952,000 shares of its common stock to the former shareholders at a cost
of $26.50 per share. All of the 648,100 shares held in the Company's treasury
were issued in this transaction. The acquisition has been accounted for under
the purchase method of accounting.

The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets acquired
and liabilities assumed as of the dates FleetBoston Financial Corporation and
Citizens National Bank of Malone were acquired.

NOTE F:  INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS 142, "Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets," which addresses financial accounting and reporting for
acquired goodwill and other intangible assets and supercedes APB Opinion 17,
"Intangible Assets". The statement requires that the Company subject goodwill
and other intangible assets to an annual impairment analysis to assess the need
to write down the balances and recognize an impairment loss. In addition,
amortization of goodwill is no longer being recorded in accordance with this
statement. Core deposit intangibles will continue to be amortized.

In October 2002, the FASB issued SFAS 147, "Accounting for Certain Acquisitions
of Banking and Thrift Institutions," which addresses financial accounting and
reporting for certain intangibles associated with branch acquisitions. This
statement removes acquisitions of financial institutions from the scope of SFAS
72 and FASB Interpretation 9. It reclassifies as goodwill certain "unidentified
intangible assets" associated with the Company's branch acquisitions dating as
far back as 1994. Financial statements are retroactively restated to January 1,
2002 to remove amortization recorded on Other Intangible Assets. Previously,
these intangible assets were being regularly amortized. As discussed above,
under FASB 142, goodwill is not required to be amortized, but as an asset, is
periodically reviewed for impairment.

The pro forma disclosures on net income and earnings per share of SFAS 142 and
SFAS 147 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 are as
follows:

The decrease of $1,561 in the gross carrying value of goodwill pertains to the
FleetBoston acquisition, specifically an adjustment to fair value of the Bank
premises and equipment following receipt of an external appraisal and reflecting
deferred taxes. The Company completed its goodwill impairment analysis during
2002, and no adjustment was necessary.

The estimated aggregate amortization expense for each of the five succeeding
fiscal years ended December 31 is as follows:

2003 ...........   $4,970
2004 ...........    4,753

===========================================================

The estimated fair value of long-term borrowings at December 31, 2002 and 2001
was approximately $345,000 and $339,000 respectively.

In December 2002, the Company prepaid $11,000 of Federal Home Loan Bank advances
with maturity dates ranging from December 15, 2003 to December 31, 2004 and a
weighted average rate of 6.17%. In September 2001, the Company prepaid $95,000
of Federal Home Loan Bank advances with maturity dates ranging from December 17,
2002 to February 23, 2004 and a weighted average rate of 5.38%. As a result of
these prepayments, the Company incurred penalties of $925 and $2,659 in 2002 and
2001, respectively. These penalties have been reflected in the consolidated
statements of income as net investment security gains and loss on early
retirement of long-term borrowings.

On February 3, 1997, the Company formed a wholly-owned subsidiary business
trust, Community Capital Trust I (Trust), for the purpose of issuing
Company-Obligated Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Securities representing
undivided beneficial interests in the assets of the Trust. The Trust issued
$30,000 of 9.75% preferred securities that are non-voting and mandatorily
redeemable in 2027 with a ten-year call provision beginning in 2007 at a premium
of 104.54% declining to par in 2017. The Company borrowed the proceeds of the
preferred securities from the Trust by issuing Junior Subordinated Debentures
having substantially similar terms as the preferred securities. The assets of
the Trust include the principal amount of the Company's Junior Subordinated
Debentures and related accrued interest and were $32,022 at December 31, 2002.
The preferred securities mature in 2027 and are treated as Tier 1 capital. The
guarantees issued by the Company for the Trust, together with the Company's
obligations under the trust agreement, the Junior Subordinated Debentures, and
the


                                       57
<PAGE>

Indenture under which the Junior Subordinated Debentures were issued, constitute
a full and unconditional guarantee by the Company of the preferred securities
issued by the Trust. The costs related to the issuance of these securities are
capitalized and amortized over the life of the period to redemption on a
straight-line basis.

On July 16, 2001, the Company formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, Community
Capital Trust II, a Delaware business trust. The trust issued $25,000 of 30 year
floating-rate Company-obligated pooled capital securities of Community Capital
Trust II holding solely parent debentures. On July 31, 2001, the Company formed
a wholly-owned subsidiary, Community Statutory Trust III, a Connecticut business
trust. The trust issued $24,450 of 30 year floating-rate Company-obligated
pooled capital securities of Community Statutory Trust III holding solely parent
debentures. The Company borrowed the proceeds of the capital securities from its
subsidiaries by issuing deeply subordinated junior debentures having
substantially similar terms. The capital securities mature in 2031 and are
treated as Tier I capital by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Trust II
capital securities are a pooled trust preferred fund of MM Community Funding I,
Ltd, and are tied to the six- month LIBOR plus 3.75%, with a five-year call
provision beginning in 2006 at a premium of 107.6875% declining to par in 2011.
Trust III capital securities are a pooled trust preferred fund of First
Tennessee/KBW Pooled Trust Preferred Deal III and are tied to the three month
LIBOR plus 3.58%, with a five-year call provision beginning in 2006 at a premium
of 107.5% declining to par in 2011. All of these securities are guaranteed by
the Company.

The Company has determined that no valuation allowance is necessary as it is
more likely than not that deferred tax assets will be realized through carryback
of future deductions to taxable income in prior years, future reversals of
existing temporary differences, and through future taxable income.

rate and the effective tax rate for the years ended December 31 is shown in the

NOTE J:  LIMITS ON DIVIDENDS AND OTHER REVENUE SOURCES

The Company's ability to pay dividends to its shareholders is largely dependent
on the Bank's ability to pay dividends to the Company. In addition to state law
requirements and the capital requirements discussed below, the circumstances
under which the Bank may pay dividends are limited by federal statutes,
regulations, and policies. For example, as a national bank, the Bank must obtain
the approval of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) for payments
of dividends if the total of all dividends declared in any calendar year would
exceed the total of the Bank's net profits, as defined by applicable
regulations, for that year, combined with its retained net profits for the
preceding two years. Furthermore, the Bank may not pay a dividend in an amount
greater than its undivided profits then on hand after deducting its losses and
bad debts, as defined by applicable regulations. At December 31, 2002, the Bank
had approximately $34,368 in undivided profits legally available for the
payments of dividends.

In addition, the Federal Reserve Board and the OCC are authorized to determine
under certain circumstances that the payment of dividends would be an unsafe or
unsound practice and to prohibit payment of such dividends. The Federal Reserve
Board has indicated that banking organizations should generally pay dividends
only out of current operating earnings.

There are also statutory limits on the transfer of funds to the Company by its
banking subsidiary, whether in the form of loans or other extensions of credit,
investments or assets purchases. Such transfer by the Bank to the Company
generally is limited in amount to 10% of the Bank's capital and surplus, or 20%
in the aggregate. Furthermore, such loans and extensions of credit are required
to be collateralized in specific amounts.

NOTE K:  BENEFIT PLANS

The Company has a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering the
majority of its employees and retirees. The benefits are based on years of
service and the participant's average compensation, as defined in the Plan. The
Company also provides health and life insurance benefits for eligible retired
employees and dependents. The Company does not fund this plan. The Company
accrues for the estimated cost of these benefits through charges to expense
during the years that the employees earn these benefits. The following table
shows the funded status of the Company's Plans reconciled with amounts reported
in the Company's consolidated statements of condition, and the assumptions used
in determining the actuarial present value of the benefit obligations as of
December 31:

FASB 87, "Employers' Accounting for Pensions," requires recognition in the
balance sheet of an additional minimum liability for pension plans with
accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets. At December 31, 2001,
the accumulated benefit obligation exceeded the plan assets resulting in the
recognition of an additional minimum pension liability of $5,016, which was
recorded as a charge to shareholders' equity, net of tax benefit of $1,966. For
the year ended December 31, 2002, the plan assets exceeded the accumulated
benefit obligation. As a result, the additional minimum liability was reversed.

The Company has a 401(k) Employee Stock Ownership Plan that is qualified under
Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Employees can contribute from 1% to
90% of eligible compensation, with up to 6% being eligible for matching
contributions in the form of Company common stock. The Plan also permits the
Company to distribute a discretionary profit-sharing component in the form of
Company common stock to all participants except certain executive employees. The
expense recognized under this plan for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001
and 2000 was $666, $528 and $450, respectively. The Company also has a Deferred
Compensation Plan for Certain Executive Employees that is unqualified under
Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under this Plan, the participants
can contribute 15% of their eligible compensation less any amounts contributed
to the 401(k) Employee Stock Ownership Plan. Any discretionary profit-sharing
amounts that the executive receives from the Company must be contributed to the
Deferred Compensation Plan in the form of Company common stock.

The Company has nonqualified deferred compensation and supplemental retirement
plans for several current and former directors, officers, and key employees. The
liability arising from these plans is being accrued over the participant's
remaining period of service so that at the expected retirement date, the then
present value of the annual payments will have been expensed. All benefits
provided under these plans are unfunded and payments to plan participants are
made by the Company. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Company has recorded a
liability of $3,690 and $2,796, respectively. The expense recognized under these
plans for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000 was $952, $469, and
$371, respectively.

Directors may defer all or a portion of their director fees under the Deferred
Compensation Plan for Directors. Under this plan, there is a separate account
for each participating director which is credited with the amount of shares
which could have been purchased with the director's fees as well as any
dividends on such shares. On the distribution date, the director will receive
common stock equal to the accumulated share balance in his account. As of
December 31, 2002 and 2001, there were 25,510 and 31,473 shares credited to the
participants' accounts, for which a liability of $781 and $933 was accrued,
respectively. The expense recognized under the plan for the years ended December
31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 was $126, $164, and $130, respectively.

The Company has a Stock Balance Plan for non-employee directors who have
completed six months of service. The Plan is a nonqualified, noncontributory
defined benefit plan. The Plan provides benefits for service prior to January 1,
1996 based on a predetermined formula and benefits for service after January 1,
1996 based on the performance of the Company's common stock. Participants become
fully vested after six years of service. The directors can elect to receive
offset stock options that will reduce the Company's liability under the Plan.
These options vest immediately and expire one year after the date the director
retires or two years in the event of death. Benefits are payable in the form of
cash and/or Company stock on January 1st of the year after the director retires
from the Board. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, the accrued pension liability
was $379 and $283, respectively. The expense recognized under this plan for the
years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 was $69, $4 and $9, respectively.
The expense and related liability were calculated using a dividend rate of
3.00%, stock price appreciation of 6.00% for 2002 and 2001 and 10.00% for 2000,
and a discount rate of 6.10% for 2002, 6.75% for 2001, and 7.00% for 2000.

NOTE L:  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS

The Company has a long-term incentive program for directors, officers, and key
employees. Under this program, the Company authorized up to 2,537,000 shares of
Company common stock to be used for the grant of incentive stock options,
restricted stock awards, nonqualified stock options, retroactive stock
appreciation rights and offset options to its Stock Balance Plan (see Note K).
The offset options vest and become exercisable immediately and expire one year
after the date the director retires or two years in the event of death. The
remaining options have a ten-year term. They vest and become exercisable on a
grant by grant basis, ranging from immediate vesting to ratably over a five-year
period. Activity in these plans is as follows:

On February 21, 1995, the Company adopted a Stockholder Protection Rights
Agreement. Under the Plan, each stockholder received one right, representing the
right to purchase one share of common stock for $42.50 for each share of stock
owned. All of the rights expire on February 21, 2005, but the Company may redeem
the rights earlier for $.005 per right, subject to certain limitations. Rights
will become exercisable if a person or group acquires 15% or more of the
Company's outstanding shares. Until that time, the rights will trade with the
common stock; any transfer of common stock will also constitute a transfer of
the associated right. If the rights become exercisable, they will begin to trade
apart from the common stock. If one of a number of "flip-in events" occurs, each
right will entitle the holder to purchase common stock having a market value
equivalent of two times the exercise price.

NOTE N:  COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND RESTRICTIONS

The Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in
the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers.
These financial instruments consist primarily of commitments to extend credit,
which involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk in excess of the
amount recognized in the statement of condition. The contract amount of those
commitments to extend credit reflects the extent of involvement the Company has
in this particular class of financial instrument. The Company's exposure to
credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial
instrument for commitments to extend credit is represented by the contractual
amount of the instrument. The Company uses the same credit policies in making
commitments as it does for on-balance-sheet instruments.

Financial instruments whose contract amounts represent credit risk are as
follows at December 31:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(000's omitted)                                             2002           2001
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Letters of credit ................................       $ 19,728       $ 18,059
Commitments to make or purchase loans
  or to extend credit on lines of credit .........        332,422        336,218

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Total .......................................       $352,150       $354,277
================================================================================

The fair value of these financial instruments is not significant.

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as
there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments
generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may
require payment of a fee. Since some of the commitments are expected to expire
without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily
represent future cash requirements. The Company evaluates each customer's credit
worthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed
necessary by the Company upon extension of credit, is based on management's

NOTE P:  REGULATORY MATTERS

The Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by
the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can
initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by
regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the
Bank's financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the
regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must meet specific
capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Bank's assets,
liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory
accounting practices. The Bank's capital amounts and classification are also
subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk
weightings, and other factors.

Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy
require the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the table
below) of total and Tier I capital (as defined in the regulations) to
risk-weighted assets (as defined), and of Tier I capital (as defined) to average
assets (as defined). Management believes, as of December 31, 2002 and December
31, 2001, that the Bank meets all capital adequacy requirements to which it is
subject and is "well capitalized" under the regulatory framework of prompt
corrective action. To be categorized as "well capitalized," the Bank must
maintain minimum total risk-based, Tier I risk-based, and Tier I leverage ratios
as set forth in the following table:

                        Report of Independent Accountants


Board of Directors and Shareholders
Community Bank System, Inc.


In our opinion, based on our audits and the report of other auditors, the
accompanying consolidated statements of condition and the related consolidated
statements of income, changes in shareholders' equity and cash flows present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Community Bank
System, Inc. and Subsidiaries at December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2002 in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management; our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. The consolidated
financial statements give retroactive effect to the merger of First Liberty Bank
Corp., on May 11, 2001, in a transaction accounted for as pooling of interests,
as described in note B to the consolidated financial statements. We did not
audit the financial statements of First Liberty Bank Corp., which statements
reflect net interest income of $19,087,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000.
These statements were audited by other auditors whose report thereon has been
furnished to us, our opinion expressed herein, insofar as it relates to the
amounts included for First Liberty Bank Corp., is based solely on the report of
other auditors. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Note F to the consolidated financial statements, effective
January 1, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
Nos. 142 "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" and 147 "Accounting for Certain
Acquisitions of Banking and Thrift Institutions."
