Supervision and Regulation

Bank holding companies and national banks are regulated by state and federal
law. The following is a summary of certain laws and regulations that govern the
Company and the Bank. To the extent that the following information describes
statutory or regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by reference
to the actual statutes and regulations thereunder.

Federal Bank Holding Company Regulation

The Company is registered under, and is subject to, the Bank Holding Company Act
of 1956, as amended. This Act limits the type of companies that Community Bank
System, Inc. may acquire or organize and the activities in which it or they may
engage. In general, the Company and the Bank are prohibited from engaging in or
acquiring direct or indirect control of any corporation engaged in non-banking
activities unless such activities are so closely related to banking as to be a
proper incident thereto. In addition, the Company must obtain the prior approval
of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ("the FRB") to acquire
control of any bank; to acquire, with certain exceptions, more than five percent
of the outstanding voting stock of any other corporation; or, to merge or
consolidate with another bank holding company. As a result of such laws and
regulation, the Company is restricted as to the types of business activities it
may conduct and the Bank is subject to limitations on, among others, the types
of loans and the amounts of loans it may make to any one borrower. The Financial
Modernization Act of 1999 created, among other things, a new entity, the
"financial holding company". Such entities may engage in a broader range of
activities that are "financial in nature", including insurance underwriting,
securities underwriting and merchant banking. Bank holding companies which are
well capitalized and well managed under regulatory standards may convert to
financial holding companies relatively easily through a notice filing with the
FRB, which acts as the "umbrella regulator" for such entities. The Company may
seek to become a financial holding company in the future.

Federal Reserve System

The Company is required by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
to maintain cash reserves against its deposits. After exhausting other sources
of funds, the Company may seek borrowings from the Federal Reserve for such
purposes. Bank holding companies registered with the FRB are, among other
things, restricted from making direct investments in real estate. Both the
Company and the Bank are subject to extensive supervision and regulation, which
focus on, among other things, the protection of depositors' funds.

The Federal Reserve System also regulates the national supply of bank credit in
order to influence general economic conditions. These policies have a
significant influence on overall growth and distribution of loans, investments
and deposits, and affect the interest rates charged on loans or paid for
deposits.

Fluctuations in interest rates, which may result from government fiscal policies
and the monetary policies of the Federal Reserve System, have a strong impact on
the income derived from loans and securities, and interest paid on deposits.
While the Company and the Bank strive to anticipate changes and adjust their
strategies for such changes, the level of earnings can be materially affected by
economic circumstances beyond their control.

The Bank is subject to minimum capital requirements established, respectively,
by the FRB and the FDIC. For information on these capital requirements and the
Company's and the Bank's capital ratios see "Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Capital" and Note P
to the Financial Statements.

Office of Comptroller of the Currency

The Bank is supervised and regularly examined by the Office of the Comptroller
of the Currency ("the OCC"). The various laws and regulations administered by
the OCC affect corporate practices such as payment of dividends, incurring debt,
and acquisition of financial institutions and other companies. It also affects
business practices, such as payment of interest on deposits, the charging of
interest on loans, types of business conducted and location of offices. There
are no regulatory orders or outstanding issues resulting from regulatory
examinations of the Bank.

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002

The Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 ("the Sarbanes-Oxley Act") implemented a broad
range of corporate governance, accounting and reporting reforms for companies
that have securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In
particular, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act established, among other things: (i) new
requirements for audit and other key committees involving independence,
expertise levels, and specified responsibilities; (ii) additional
responsibilities regarding the oversight of financial statements by the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the reporting company; (iii)
the creation of an independent accounting oversight board for the accounting
industry; (iv) new standards for auditors and the regulation of audits,
including independence provisions which restrict non-audit services that
accountants may provide to their audit clients; (v) increased disclosure and
reporting obligations for the reporting company and its directors and executive
officers including accelerated reporting of company stock transactions; (vi) a
prohibition of personal loans to directors and officers, except certain loans
made by insured financial institutions on nonpreferential terms and in
compliance with other bank regulator requirements; and (vii) a range of new and
increased civil and criminal penalties for fraud and other violation of the
securities laws.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

Investment in Community Bank System, Inc. common stock involves risk. The market
price of the Company's common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a
number of factors including, but not limited to:

      o     Changes in securities analysts' expectations of financial
            performance

      o     Volatility of stock market prices and volumes

      o     Incorrect information or speculation

      o     Changes in industry valuations

      o     Interest rate changes

      o     Variations in operating results from general expectations

      o     Actions taken against the Company by various regulatory agencies

      o     Changes in authoritative accounting guidance by Financial Accounting
            Standards Board or other regulatory agencies

      o     Changes in general domestic economic conditions such as inflation
            rates, tax rates, unemployment rates, higher labor and healthcare
            costs, recessions, and changing government policies, laws and
            regulations

The Company's main markets are located in the states of New York and
Pennsylvania. A prolonged economic downturn in these markets could negatively
impact the Company.

The Company's income and cash flow depends to a great extent on the difference
between the interest earned on loans and investment securities, and the interest
paid on deposits and other borrowings. Interest rates are beyond the Company's
control, and they fluctuate in response to general economic conditions and the
policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies, in particular, the
Federal Reserve Board. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest
rates, will influence the origination of loans, the purchase of investments, the
generation of deposits and the rates received on loans and investment securities
and paid on deposits.

The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to extensive state and federal
regulation, supervision and legislation that govern nearly every aspect of its
operations. Changes to these laws could affect the Company's ability to deliver
or expand its services and diminish the value of its business.

The business strategy of the Company includes growth through acquisition. Any
future acquisitions will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in
acquisitions. These risks include among other things; the difficulty of
integrating the operations and personnel of acquired banks and branches, the
potential disruption of our ongoing business, the inability of our management to
maximize our financial and strategic position, and the inability to maintain
uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies and the impairment of
relationships with employees and customers as a result of changes in management.

The Company relies on communication, information, operating and financial
control systems from third-party service providers. Any failure or interruption
or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or interruptions
in our customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, servicing
and/or loan origination systems.

Readers are cautioned that it is not possible to predict or identify all of the
risks, uncertainties and other factors that may affect future results and that
the above list should not be considered to be a complete list.

Item 2. Properties

The Company's primary headquarters is located at 5790 Widewaters Parkway,
Dewitt, New York, which is leased. In addition, the Company has 135 properties,
92 are owned and 43 are located in long-term leased premises. Real property and
related banking facilities owned by the Company at December 31, 2005 had a net
book value of $48.3 million and none of the properties was subject to any
material encumbrances. For the year ended December 31, 2005, rental fees of $2.7
million were paid on facilities leased by the Company for its operations. We
believe that our facilities are suitable and adequate for the Company's current
operations.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

The Company and its subsidiaries are subject in the normal course of business to
various pending and threatened legal proceedings in which claims for monetary
damages are asserted. Management, after consultation with legal counsel, does
not anticipate that the aggregate liability, if any, arising out of litigation
pending against the Company or its subsidiaries will have a material effect on
the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

There were no matters submitted to a vote of the shareholders during the quarter
ended December 31, 2005.

substantially all of the funds available for the payment of dividends by the
Company are derived from the Bank, future dividends will depend upon the
earnings of the Bank, its financial condition, its need for funds and applicable
governmental policies and regulations.

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations

This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations ("MD&A") primarily reviews the financial condition and results of
operations of Community Bank System, Inc. ("the Company") for the past two
years, although in some circumstances a period longer than two years is covered
in order to comply with Securities and Exchange Commission disclosure
requirements or to more fully explain long-term trends. The following discussion
and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Selected Consolidated
Financial Information on page 11 and the Company's Consolidated Financial
Statements and related notes that appear on pages 44 through 66. All references
in the discussion to the financial condition and results of operations are to
the consolidated position and results of the Company and its subsidiaries taken
as a whole.

All financial results reflect the 2001 acquisition of First Liberty in

Critical Accounting Policies

As a result of the complex and dynamic nature of the Company's business,
management must exercise judgement in selecting and applying the most
appropriate accounting policies for its various areas of operations. The policy
decision process not only ensures compliance with the latest generally accepted
accounting principles, but also reflects on management's discretion with regard
to choosing the most suitable methodology for reporting the Company's financial
performance. It is management's opinion that the accounting estimates covering
certain aspects of the business have more significance than others due to the
relative importance of those areas to overall performance, or the level of
subjectivity in the selection process. These estimates affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Management believes that the critical accounting estimates include:

o     Allowance for loan losses - The allowance for loan losses reflects
      management's best estimate of probable loan losses in the Company's loan
      portfolio. Determination of the allowance for loan losses is inherently
      subjective. It requires significant estimates including the amounts and
      timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans and the amount of
      estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans which is based on
      historical loss experience and consideration of current economic trends,
      all of which may be susceptible to significant change.

o     Actuarial assumptions associated with pension, post-retirement and other
      employee benefit plans - These assumptions include discount rate, rate of
      future compensation increases and expected return on plan assets. Specific
      discussion of the assumptions used by management is discussed in Note K on
      pages 58 through 61.

o     Provision for income taxes - The Company is subject to examinations from
      various taxing authorities. Such examinations may result in challenges to
      the tax return treatment applied by the Company to specific transactions.
      Management believes that the assumptions and judgements used to record
      tax-related assets or liabilities have been appropriate. Should tax laws
      change or the taxing authorities determine that management's assumptions
      were inappropriate, an adjustment may be required which could have a
      material effect on the Company's results of operations.

o     Carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets - The carrying
      value of goodwill and other intangible assets is based upon discounted
      cash flow modeling techniques that require management to make estimates
      regarding the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. It also
      requires them to select a discount rate that reflects the current return
      requirements of the market in relation to present risk-free interest
      rates, required equity market premiums and company-specific risk
      indicators.

Executive Summary

The Company's business philosophy is to operate as a community bank with local
decision-making, principally in non-metropolitan markets, providing a broad
array of banking and financial services to retail, commercial, and municipal
customers.

The Company's core operating objectives are: (i) grow the branch network,
primarily through a disciplined acquisition strategy, and certain selective de
novo expansions, (ii) build high-quality, profitable loan portfolios using both
organic and acquisition strategies, (iii) increase the non-interest income
component of total revenues through development of banking-related fee income,
growth in existing financial services business units, and the acquisition of
additional financial services and banking businesses, and (iv) utilize
technology to deliver customer-responsive products and services and to reduce
operating costs.

Significant factors management reviews to evaluate achievement of the Company's
operating objectives and its operating results and financial condition include,
but are not limited to: net income and earnings per share, return on assets and
equity, net interest margins, non-interest income, operating expenses, asset
quality, loan and deposit growth, capital management, performance of individual
banking and financial services business units, liquidity and interest rate
sensitivity, enhancements to customer products and services, technology
enhancements, market share, peer comparisons, and the performance of acquisition
and integration activities.

In 2005, the Company reported record earnings as a result of higher non-interest
income including securities gains, improved asset quality and organic loan and
deposit growth offset by higher operating expenses, including special charges,
an increased cost of funds, lower investment income and a higher effective tax
rate. Capital levels remained strong with both the Tier 1 leverage ratio and
tangible equity ratio improving from 2004. Non-interest income, including
securities gains, increased 37% over 2004 as a result of $12 million of gains on
the sale of investments, as well as strong growth from banking sources and the
Company's employee benefits administration and consulting businesses. Operating
expense in the fourth quarter of 2005 included a one-time, $2.9 million charge
related to certain early retirement actions.

Asset quality remained strong in 2005, with a reduction in the loan charge-off
ratios and consistent delinquency and non-performing loan ratios versus 2004.
The Company produced loan growth in the consumer mortgage and consumer
installment lending portfolios, while outstanding business lending balances
declined. On a geographical basis, the Company's New York markets reported
strong growth in consumer mortgage and consumer installment loans, with slight
declines in business lending. The Pennsylvania markets reported growth in the
consumer installment portfolio with declines in the business lending and
mortgage portfolios. Total deposits increased 1.9% over 2004.

Net Income and Profitability

Net income for 2005 was $50.8 million, up $0.6 million or 1.2% from the prior
year. Earnings per share of $1.65 in 2005 were 0.6% higher than 2004's results.
The growth rate of EPS was below that of net income due to higher weighted
average diluted shares outstanding driven by the 2.6 million shares of common
stock issued in conjunction with the acquisition of First Heritage in May 2004
and the exercise of options under the employee stock plan. In 2005, the Company
made significant progress on its objective of shortening the average life of its
investment portfolio, generating a $0.29 per share after-tax gain through the
sale of securities that had optimized their total return and interest-rate
sensitivity characteristics. The 2005 results were also impacted by a $2.9
million, or $0.07 per share non-recurring charge related to the early retirement
of certain executives. Earnings in 2004 included $1.7 million of non-recurring
acquisition related expenses.

In addition to the earnings results presented above in accordance with GAAP, the
Company provides cash earnings per share, which excludes the after-tax effect of
the amortization of intangible assets and the market value adjustments on net
assets acquired in mergers. Management believes that this information helps
investors understand the effect of acquisition activity in reported results.
Cash earnings per share for 2005 were $1.84, up 1.7% from $1.81 for the year
ended December 31, 2004.

Net income and earnings per share for 2004 were $50.2 million and $1.64, up 24%
and 10.1%, respectively, from 2003 results. The growth rate of EPS was below
that of net income due to higher weighted average diluted shares outstanding.
The increase in diluted shares was primarily driven by the 2.6 million and 2.3
million shares of common stock issued in conjunction with the acquisition of
First Heritage in May 2004 and Grange in November 2003, respectively, an
increased level of option grants and exercises, and a higher average common
share price (refer to the "Earnings per Share" section of Note A on page 48 for
information regarding the impact of share price on diluted shares).

</TABLE>

            (1) Cash earnings are reconciled to GAAP net income in Table 1.

The primary factors explaining 2005 performance are discussed in detail in the
remaining sections of this document and are summarized as follows:

o     As shown in Table 2 above, net interest income decreased 4.9% or $7.4
      million due to a 28 basis point decrease in the net interest margin,
      partially offset by a $69 million increase in average earning assets.
      Average loans grew $110 million or 4.9%, primarily due to strong consumer
      installment growth as well as the addition of First Heritage in May 2004.
      Average investments decreased $41.0 million or 2.8% in 2005 primarily as a
      result of the sales made throughout 2005. The growth in earning assets was
      funded by $103 million or 3.6% higher average deposits. Cash flows from
      the investment sales were used to pay down external borrowings throughout
      2005, resulting in $63 million lower average borrowings in 2005 as
      compared to 2004.

o     The loan loss provision of $8.5 million decreased $0.2 million, or 2.5%,
      from the prior year level. Net charge-offs of $7.7 million decreased by
      $0.7 million from 2004, reducing the net charge-off ratio (net charge-offs
      / total average loans) to 0.33% for the year. Asset quality in 2005
      remained stable and favorable as evidenced by consistent standard metrics
      such as non-performing loans as a percentage of total loans,
      non-performing assets as a percentage of loans and other real estate owned
      and delinquent loans (30+ days through non-accruing) as a percentage of
      total loans. Additional information on trends and policy related to asset
      quality is provided in the asset quality section on pages 26 through 29.

o     Non-interest income for 2005 of $60.8 million increased by $16.4 million
      or 36.9% from 2004's level, the twelfth consecutive year of growth.
      Banking services were up 9.1% and accounted for $2.5 million of the
      improvement, primarily due to the acquisitions in 2004 as well as several
      revenue enhancement initiatives implemented this year. Financial services
      revenue was $1.8 million or 10.5% higher, mostly as a result of strong
      growth at the Company's benefit plan administration and consulting
      business. Gains on the sale of investment securities increased $12.1
      million as the Company took advantage of market conditions to sell certain
      securities in order to shorten the average length of the portfolio and
      maximize their expected total return.


                                       14
<PAGE>

o     Total operating expenses rose $7.5 million or 6.2% in 2005 to $127.4
      million. Excluding special charges/acquisition expenses in both years,
      2005 operating expenses rose $6.3 million or 5.3%. A majority of the
      increase was due to increased personnel expenses associated with the
      acquisitions in 2004, as well as merit increases and higher costs in
      employee health and welfare programs. In addition, higher business
      development costs associated with a more robust marketing strategy were
      incurred. Net occupancy expenses also increased because of a larger number
      of facilities due to acquisitions, current and prior year renovations and
      maintenance, and slightly higher property tax and utility rates. Operating
      expenses for 2005 include a $2.9 million non-recurring charge related to
      the early retirement of certain executives.

o     The Company's combined effective federal and state income tax rate
      increased 1.0 percentage points in 2005 to 25.9%, primarily as a result of
      a higher proportion of income being generated from fully taxable sources
      (loans and investments).

Selected Profitability and Other Measures

Return on average assets, return on average equity, dividend payout and equity
to asset ratios for the years indicated are as follows:

                            Table 3: Selected Ratios

                                                 2005       2004      2003
        ---------------------------------------------------------------------
        Return on average assets                 1.19%      1.20%      1.16%
        Return on average equity                10.89%     11.39%     11.78%
        Dividend payout ratio                    43.9%      40.9%      40.2%
        Average equity to average assets        10.93%     10.50%      9.87%

As displayed in Table 3 above, the return on average assets decreased slightly
in 2005 as compared to 2004, but was above the 2003 level. This was primarily a
result of higher expenses due to the special charge taken in the fourth quarter
of 2005 related to certain early retirements. Reported return on equity in 2005
was down slightly from 2004's level. This was mainly a result of equity capital
increasing at a faster pace than net income due to the impact of the First
Heritage acquisition and the enhancement of the Company's capital position
through the retention of net profits. Return on equity in 2004 was down slightly
from 2003's level. Likewise this was mainly a result of the buildup of equity
capital from the retention of net profits in 2004 as well as the common shares
issued in conjunction with the acquisitions of First Heritage in May 2004 and
Grange in November 2003. The strengthening of the Company's equity capital
position over the past two years is reflected in the 43 and 63 basis-point
increases in the average equity to average total assets ratios in 2005 and 2004,
respectively.

The dividend payout ratio for 2005 was above 2004's level based on reported net
income mostly due to the 12.5% and 5.6% increase in the quarterly dividend in
the third quarters of 2004 and 2005, respectively.

Net Interest Income

Net interest income is the amount that interest and fees on earning assets
(loans and investments) exceeds the cost of funds, primarily interest paid to
the Company's depositors and interest on external borrowings. Net interest
margin is the difference between the gross yield on earning assets and the cost
of interest bearing funds as a percentage of earning assets.

As disclosed in Table 4, net interest income (with non-taxable income converted
to a fully tax-equivalent basis) totaled $158.0 million in 2005, down $7.6
million or 4.6% from the prior year. A $7.3 million increase in average
interest-bearing liabilities and a 28 basis point decrease in the net interest
margin more than offset a $69 million increase in average earning-assets. As
reflected in Table 5, the volume changes mentioned above increased net interest
income by $3.0 million, while the lower net interest margin had a $10.6 million
negative impact.

The net interest margin declined 28 basis points from 4.45% in 2004 to 4.17% in
2005. This decline was primarily attributable to the eight rate hikes (25 basis
points each) by the Federal Reserve to the overnight federal funds rates since
last December having a greater impact on funding costs (up 35 basis points) than
earning-asset yields (up six basis points). The rising short-term market rates
resulted in steady increases to rates throughout the year on interest-bearing
deposits rates (up 30 basis points) and total external borrowings (up 101 basis
points). Conversely, the yield on loans remained relatively stable for the first
three quarters of 2005 and increased 25 basis points in the fourth quarter as
compared to the third quarter. The yield on investments declined during the year
from 6.18% for 2004 to 6.05% for 2005, as a result of the sale of higher
yielding securities.

The net interest margin also declined in each of the quarters of 2004, from
4.67% for the first quarter to 4.32% in the fourth quarter. This trend was
mostly attributable to the changes in market interest rates during 2004 as well
as the Federal Reserve


                                       15
<PAGE>

beginning to raise the overnight federal funds rate in June 2004. Falling market
rates early in the year allowed the Company to reduce or hold steady rates on
interest-bearing deposit accounts in the first three quarters of 2004. The
fourth quarter of 2004 saw interest rates on money market and time deposit
accounts rise slightly in response to increasing market rates. Similarly, the
yield on loans decreased throughout the first three quarters of the year. The
decline in loan yields had a greater negative impact on the margin in 2004
($12.1 million) than the benefit derived from deposit rate reductions ($7.2
million). Yields on investments declined 35 basis points during 2004 from 6.53%
to 6.18% as investment purchases were at generally lower rates. Lastly, the
average interest rate paid on borrowings decreased 83 basis points from 4.13%
for 2003 to 3.30% for 2004.

As shown in Table 4, total interest income increased by $6.2 million or 2.7% in
2005. Table 5 shows that higher average earning assets contributed a positive
$4.2 million variance and higher yields contributed $2.0 million. Average loans
grew a total of $110 million in 2005, the majority as a result of the addition
of $204 million of loans through the acquisition of First Heritage in May 2004
and $5.6 million from the November 2004 acquisition of the Dansville branch as
well as organic growth in the consumer installment and consumer mortgage
portfolios. Interest and fees on loans increased $10.6 million or 7.7%. The
increase was attributable to higher average loan balances (positive $6.8
million) as well as a 17-basis point increase in loan yields (positive $3.8
million) due to the rising rate environment. Average loans grew $379 million in
2004, the majority being the result of the First Heritage acquisition as well as
the $186 million of loans acquired in the Peoples and Grange acquisition in late
2003. Interest and fees on loans increased $11.6 million or 9.2% in 2004 as
compared to 2003. The increase was attributable to higher average loan balances
(positive $23.7 million), partially offset by a 60-basis point drop in loan
yields (negative $12.1 million) due to falling capital market rates.

A leveraging strategy was employed beginning in late 2003 through mid-2004,
which increased average investment balances by $268.3 million for 2004 versus
the year-earlier period. In 2005, the Company decided to sell certain securities
and not fully reinvest cash flows from maturing securities in the current flat
yield environment, to take advantage of market conditions to shorten the average
life of the portfolio, improve its interest-rate sensitivity profile in a
rising-rate environment, and maximize the expected total return. As a result,
average investments for 2005 decreased $41 million and the expected
life-to-maturity of the portfolio was reduced from 5.9 years at December 31,
2004 to 5.3 years at December 31, 2005. Refer to the "Investments" section of
the MD&A on pages 32 through 34 for further information.

Investment interest income in 2005 of $85.5 million was $4.4 million or 4.9%
lower than the prior year as a result of a smaller portfolio (negative $2.1
million impact) as well as a decrease in the average investment yield from 6.18%
to 6.05% (negative $2.3 million impact). The decrease in the yield was
principally driven by the sale and maturity of higher-yielding securities. The
performance of the investment portfolio in 2005 remained strong despite the
interest rate environment. The Company was able to maintain its yields to a
great extent primarily because of two important strategies: the addition of a
substantial amount of call-protected securities in 2001 and first half of 2002
when rates were higher, and foregoing security purchases in the late-2002 to
mid-2003 period as rates were falling significantly. The success of these
actions was evident in the Company's 97th percentile ranking within its peer
group for tax-equivalent investment yield for the nine months ended September
2005. Investment interest income in 2004 of $89.8 million was $12.5 million or
16% higher than the prior year as a result of a larger portfolio (positive $16.9
million impact), partially offset by a decrease in the average investment yield
from 6.53% to 6.18% (negative $4.5 million impact). The decrease in the yield
was principally driven by significant declines in market interest rates from
early 2001 through mid-2003. Consequently, the Company was unable to replace the
run-off of longer-term higher-yielding securities with equivalent-rate
investments. The Company also purchased securities in the relatively
low-interest rate environment in the second half of 2003 and 2004, which
resulted in an overall decline in yields, but offered at attractive net spread
due to the low cost of the borrowings used to fund the purchase.

The average earning asset yield grew six basis points to 6.17% in 2005 because
of the previously mentioned increase in loan yields, partially offset by the
declines in the investment yields. In 2003 the yield on the loan portfolio was
14 basis points higher than the yield on investments. In 2004 investment yields
were 11 basis points above those produced by loans. During 2005, changes in
market interest rates combined with the strategic investment portfolio actions
previously discussed resulted in the yield on the loan portfolio again being
higher than the investment portfolio by 19 basis points.

Total average funding (deposits and borrowings) grew by $39.8 million in 2005.
Deposits increased $102.9 million, attributable to the acquisitions of First
Heritage, Dansville and organic growth. Average external borrowings declined
$63.0 million in 2005 as compared to the prior year as cash flows from the
securities sales were used to reduce short-term borrowings. In 2004 total
average funding increased by $626.5 million, with $310.9 million of the increase
coming from deposits, mostly attributable to the acquisitions of First Heritage,
Grange and Peoples. External borrowings increased $315.6 in 2004 to fund organic
loan growth and investment purchases.

The cost of funding increased throughout 2005 reflective of the eight 25 basis
point increases to short-term rates by the Federal Reserve since December of
2004. Interest rates on deposit accounts were raised throughout the year, with
increases in almost all product offerings. The primary drivers of the increase
in deposit cost of funds were maturing time deposits

rolled over at higher interest rates and customers transferring funds from lower
rate interest bearing accounts to a new higher yielding money market product.
This is demonstrated by the percentage of average deposits that were in time
deposit accounts and regular savings dropping from 41.3% and 18.1% in 2004 to
40.9% and 17.1% in 2005, while money market deposits increased from 10.7% in
2004 to 11.7% in 2005. The flattening yield curve also resulted in decreasing
the interest rate differential between short and long-term debt.

Total interest expense increased by $13.8 million to $75.6 million in 2005. As
shown in Table 5, higher interest rates on deposits and external borrowings
resulted in $13.7 million of this increase, while the higher deposit and
borrowings balances accounted for just $0.1 million of the increase in interest
expense. Interest expense as a percentage of earning assets increased by 33
basis points to 1.99%. The rate on interest bearing deposits increased 30 basis
points to 1.79%, due largely to increases in money market and time deposit rates
throughout 2005. The rate on external borrowings increased 101 basis points to
4.31% because of the previously mentioned increase in short-term market rates.
Total interest expense increased by $2.5 million to $61.8 million in 2004 as
compared to 2003. A higher level of deposits and borrowings, partially offset by
lower interest rates accounted for the increase. The rate on interest bearing
deposits fell 34 basis points to 1.49% and the rate on external borrowings
declined 83 basis points to 3.30% in 2004.

The following table sets forth information related to average interest-earning
assets and interest-bearing liabilities and their associated yields and rates
for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. Interest income and yields
are on a fully tax-equivalent basis using marginal income tax rates of 38.6% in
2005, 38.7% in 2004, and 38.9% in 2003. Average balances are computed by
totaling the daily ending balances in a period and dividing by the number of
days in that period. Loan yields and amounts earned include loan fees. Average
loan balances include non-accrual loans and loans held for sale.

As discussed above, the change in net interest income (fully tax-equivalent
basis) may be analyzed by segregating the volume and rate components of the
changes in interest income and interest expense for each underlying category.

Non-interest Income

The Company's sources of non-interest income are of three primary types: general
banking services related to loans, deposits and other core customer activities
typically provided through the branch network; financial services, comprised of
employee benefit plan administration, actuarial and consulting services
(BPA-Harbridge), trust services, investment and insurance products (Community
Investment Services, Inc. or CISI) and asset management (Elias Asset Management
or EAM); and periodic transactions, most often net gains (losses) from the sale
of investments and prepayment of term debt.

</TABLE>

As displayed in Table 6, non-interest income, excluding security gains,
increased by 9.6% to $48.7 million, largely as a result of recurring bank fees
and growth in benefit plan administration, consulting and actuarial fees. Gain
on the sale of investment securities increased $12.1 million as the Company took
advantage of market conditions to sell certain securities in order to shorten
the average length of the portfolio and maximize their expected total return.
Refer to the "Investments" section of the MD&A on pages 32 through 34 for
further information. Total non-interest income for 2004 increased by 26.2% over
2003 to $44.4 million, largely as a result of higher bank fees, driven by four
bank acquisitions in 2003 and 2004, the acquisition of Harbridge, growth at BPA
and CISI, and the absence of debt repayment charges.

Non-interest income as a percent of operating income (FTE basis) was 27.8% in
2005, up 6.6 percentage points from the prior year, an all-time high for the
Company. Excluding the gain (loss) on investment securities & debt prepayment,
non-interest income as a percent of operating income (FTE basis) was 23.5% in
2005, a 2.4 percentage point increase from 21.1% for 2004. This increase was
primarily driven by the aforementioned strong growth in recurring bank fees and
benefit plan administration, consulting and actuarial fees and declining net
interest income. This ratio is considered an important measure for determining
the progress the Company is making on one of its primary long-term strategies,
expansion of non-interest income in order to diversify its revenue sources and
reduce reliance on net interest margins that may be strongly impacted by general
interest rate and other market conditions.

The largest portion of the Company's recurring non-interest income is the wide
variety of fees earned from general banking services, which reached $30.2
million in 2005, up 9.1% from the prior year. A large portion of the income
growth was attributable to overdraft fees, up $1.2 million (7.8%) over 2004's
level, due in large part to the incremental transaction volume generated from
the accounts added through the First Heritage and Dansville acquisitions, as
well as several revenue enhancement initiatives implemented this year.
Commissions and other increased $0.7 million, due to higher New York Bankers
Association dividends and transaction fees. In addition, the increase in
electronic banking is directly attributable to a concerted effort to increase
the penetration of debit cards as well as the introduction of a business debit
card program. Fees from general banking services were $27.6 million in 2004, up
$2.6 million or 10.4% from 2003 primarily driven by growth in overdraft fees and
commissions, a majority derived from the First Heritage and Grange acquisitions.

As disclosed in Table 6, non-interest income from financial services rose $1.8
million or 10.5% in 2005 to $18.5 million. Financial services revenue now
comprises 38% of total non-interest income, excluding net gains (losses) on the
sale of investment securities and retirement of debt. Revenue growth at
BPA-Harbridge (up $2.0 million or 22%) was driven by enhanced service offerings
to both new and existing clients, a portion of which relates to new actuarial
determinations required by certain state and federal healthcare programs. These
two businesses operate collaboratively to offer their clients a full array of
employee benefits, recordkeeping and consulting services, on a national basis.
BPA-Harbridge revenue of $9.2 million in 2004 was $3.1 million higher than prior
year results, driven by seven more months of revenue from Harbridge,


                                       20
<PAGE>

which was acquired at the end of July 2003, a significant number of new plans
under administration and growth in the market value of client assets.

Personal trust generated revenue growth of $154,000 (8.3%) in 2005, achieved
through new client relationships and the investment of additional assets by
established clients. In 2005, CISI and Elias were negatively impacted by the
challenging retail investment market conditions. Revenues in 2005 were down
$323,000 (17.6%) and $106,000 (2.7%) at Elias and CISI, respectively as compared
to 2004. In 2004 CISI and personal trust had positive revenue growth of $568,000
(17%) and $275,000 (18%), respectively, as improving market conditions
positively impacted both businesses. In addition, in 2004 CISI experienced an
increased volume of annuity sales in response to higher interest rates and
additional client relationships developed in the new markets opened up by the
Company's acquisitions.

Assets under management and administration at the Company's financial services
businesses rose considerably over the last two years reaching $2.5 billion at
the end of 2005, compared to $2.2 billion at year-end 2004 and $1.8 billion at
year-end 2003. Market-driven gains in equity-based assets were augmented by
attraction of new client assets. BPA in particular was very successful at
growing its asset base, as demonstrated by a $358 million or 35% increase in its
assets under administration during 2005.

Excluding non-recurring retirement charges, the total financial services group
contributed $2.9 million (excluding allocation of indirect corporate expense) or
4.1% of the Company's pre-tax income in 2005, reflecting nearly a 15% operating
margin. In 2004, financial services' contribution was $2.1 million or 3.1% of
total pre-tax income, with a margin of 12%. The higher earnings were the result
of new client business at BPA and personal trust. The increase in percentage
contribution was primarily due to growth in the financial services businesses in
2005, combined with the decline in net interest income.

There was a total net gain on security transactions of $12.2 million in 2005 as
compared to $72,000 in 2004, as the Company took advantage of market conditions
to sell certain securities in order to shorten the average length of the
portfolio and maximize their expected total return. Securities sold included
$173.2 million of U.S. Treasury and Agency securities, $46.1 million of
AAA-rated obligations of state and political subdivisions, and $24.4 million of
investment grade corporate bonds. The corresponding gains recognized on these
sales were $7.0 million, $2.2 million and $3.0 million respectively.

The net gain on security and debt transactions of $72,000 in 2004 compared to a
net loss of $2.7 million in 2003. The loss in 2003 was primarily composed of
$2.6 million of charges associated with the early retirement of $25 million of
longer-term FHLB borrowings that were replaced with lower rate, short-term
borrowings, which were expected to provide a long-term earnings benefit as well
as reduce interest rate risk. The security and debt gains and losses taken over
the last three years are illustrative of the Company's active management of its
investment portfolio and external borrowings to achieve a desirable total return
through the combination of net interest income, transaction gains/losses and
changes in market value across financial market cycles, as well as achieving an
appropriate interest-rate sensitivity profile in changing rate environments.

Operating Expenses

As shown in Table 7, operating expenses rose $7.5 million or 6.2% in 2005 to
$127.4 million. Excluding special charges/acquisition expenses, operating
expenses were up $6.3 million or 5.3% in 2005, primarily attributable to
increases in salaries and benefits costs, utility costs and business development
expenses. This year's operating expenses as a percent of average assets were
2.99%, up from 2.86% in 2004 and 2.96% in 2003. The increase in this ratio for
2005 was principally due to the reduction in the size of the investment
portfolio, the special charge related to certain early retirement actions as
well as more active business development and marketing programs. The decrease in
this ratio for 2004 was principally due to an investment leverage strategy
executed in the first two quarters of 2004 and the acquisitions in late 2003 and
the first half of 2004 (Grange and First Heritage), whereby average assets
increased significantly (21%), while operating expenses only increased 17%.

The efficiency ratio, a performance measurement tool widely used by banks, is
defined by the Company as operating expenses (excluding special
charges/acquisition expenses and intangible amortization) divided by operating
income (fully tax-equivalent net interest income plus non-interest income,
excluding net securities and debt gains and losses). Lower ratios are often
correlated to higher efficiency. In 2005 the efficiency ratio increased 4.0
percentage points to 56.8% due to higher operating expenses and a decline in net
interest income. The efficiency ratio for 2004 was 0.6 percentage points lower
than the 53.4% ratio for 2003 due primarily to increased net investment interest
income.

</TABLE>

Higher personnel expenses accounted for 52% of 2005's increase in operating
costs, primarily the result of the First Heritage and Dansville acquisitions in
2004. The remainder of the increase in personnel expense reflects higher benefit
costs and merit increases. Personnel expenses in 2004 were up $8.0 million from
2003's level mostly due to the four acquisitions made between July 2003 and May
2004. Total full-time equivalent staff at the end of 2005 was 1,299 compared to
1,301 at December 31, 2004 and 1,259 at then end of 2003.

Medical expenses were up in 2005 due to a general rise in the cost of medical
care, administration and insurance, as well as a greater number of insured
employees. Qualified and non-qualified pension expenses increased in 2005
principally due to the special charge related to certain early retirement
actions and a lower discount rate. In 2004 the qualified and non-qualified
pension expense decreased slightly due to a change in the Company's defined
benefit pension plan from a standard annuity paid benefit, to a cash balance
design, offset by a reduction of the discount rate applied to future payments
from 6.1% to 5.9% (increases current expenses in present value terms) and
additional obligations for employees added through acquisition and organic
growth. The three assumptions that have the largest impact on the calculation of
annual pension expense are the aforementioned discount rate, the rate applied to
future compensation increases and the expected rate of return on plan assets.
See Note K to the financial statements for further information concerning the
pension plan.

Total non-personnel expense increased $3.6 million or 6.1% in 2005. Excluding
special charges/acquisition expense, non-personal expenses were up $2.3 million
or 4.1% from 2004's level. As displayed in Table 7, this was largely caused by
higher occupancy and equipment expense (up $1.3 million), business development
and marketing (up $0.8 million), foreclosed property (up $0.3 million) and other
expenses (up $0.9 million), partially offset by decreases in data processing and
communication expense (down $0.7 million) and amortization of intangible assets
(down $0.3 million). The increase in occupancy and equipment in 2005 was mainly
due to incremental costs from recently acquired facilities, expenses arising
from renovations and repairs, the effect of higher rates and severe weather on
maintenance and utilities expenses, and the general increase in property taxes
in many of the locations we do business in. Business development and marketing
costs were up due to a more robust marketing strategy in 2005. The majority of
the increase in other expenses relates to higher overdraft charge-offs as a
result of higher transaction volume and certain fixed asset write-downs. Data
processing and communications costs have decreased due to certain contract
renegotiations, the assimilation of the 2004 acquisitions, and other vendor
management programs.

Total non-personnel expenses increased $9.2 million or 19% in 2004 from 2003.
Excluding acquisition-related expenses, non-personnel expenses were up $8.0
million or 16% from 2003's level. This increase was largely caused by higher
occupancy and equipment expense ($1.7 million), legal and professional fees
($1.3 million), data processing and communication expense ($.9 million),
amortization of intangible assets ($2.3 million), business development and
marketing expense ($0.5 million) and other expenses ($0.7 million). The increase
in occupancy and equipment expenses in 2004 was mainly due to incremental costs
from recently acquired facilities. The increase in legal and professional fees
over the prior year was caused, in most part, by the additional responsibilities
associated with complying with new governance and regulatory requirements. Data
processing and other expenses were up primarily due to incremental recurring
operating expense associated with the five acquisitions completed from July 2003
to December 2004. Intangible amortization in 2004


                                       22
<PAGE>

was up versus the prior year due to the amortization of additional core deposit
and customer relationship intangibles arising from the 2003 and 2004
acquisitions.

Special charges/acquisition expenses totaled $2.9 million in 2005, up from $1.7
million in 2004. The 2005 special charge relates to the early retirement of
certain long-service executives and includes severance and certain benefit plan
enhancements. Acquisition expenses totaled $1.7 million in 2004, up from
$498,000 in 2003, comprised of severance and employee benefits of $1.0 million
and legal, consulting and system conversion costs of $0.7 million.

Income Taxes

The Company estimates its tax expense based on the amount it expects to owe the
respective tax authorities, plus the impact of deferred tax items. Taxes are
discussed in more detail in Note I of the Consolidated Financial Statements on
page 57. Accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due or to be received
from taxing authorities. In estimating accrued taxes, management assesses the
relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment of transactions
taking into account statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance in the context
of the Company's tax position. If the final resolution of taxes payable differs
from its estimates due to regulatory determination or legislative or judicial
actions, adjustments to tax expense may be required.

The effective tax rate for 2005 increased by 1.0 percentage point to 25.9%. This
increase was primarily due to a larger proportion of income from fully taxable
sources versus the prior year period. The effective tax rate for 2004 increased
by 0.9 percentage points over 2003 to 24.9%, for similar reasons.

Capital

Shareholders' equity ended 2005 at $457.6 million, down $17.0 million or 3.6%
from one year earlier. This decrease reflects treasury share purchases of $25.9
million, a $25.8 million decline in the market value adjustment ("MVA",
represents the after-tax, unrealized change in value of available-for-sale
securities in the Company's investment portfolio), and common stock dividends
declared of $22.3 million. These decreases were partially offset by net income
of $50.8 million and $6.1 million from the issuance of shares through employee
stock plans. Excluding accumulated other comprehensive income in both 2005 and
2004, capital rose by $8.7 million or 2.0%. Shares outstanding declined by
685,000 during the year, comprised of 0.4 million added through employee stock
plans, offset by the purchase of 1.1 million treasury shares.

The Company's ratio of Tier 1 capital to assets (or tier 1 leverage ratio), the
basic measure for which regulators have established a 5% minimum for an
institution to be considered "well-capitalized," increased 63 basis points in
2005 to 7.57%. This was due to the capital-building contribution from retained
earnings (net income less dividends declared) and the decline in average assets,
primarily resulting from the sale of certain investments. The tangible
equity/tangible assets ratio was 5.92% at the end of 2005 versus 5.82% one year
earlier. The Company manages organic and acquired growth in a manner that
enables it to continue to build upon its strong capital base, and maintain the
Company's ability to take advantage of future strategic growth opportunities.

Cash dividends declared on common stock in 2005 of $22.3 million represented an
increase of 8.6% over the prior year. This growth was mostly a result of
dividends per share of $0.74 for 2005 increasing from $0.68 in 2004 due to
quarterly dividends per share being raised from $0.18 to $0.19 (+5.6%) in the
third quarter of 2005 and from $0.16 to $0.18 (+12.5%) in the third quarter of
2004. The increase in dollar amount of dividends declared was partially offset
by a slight decrease in the number of shares outstanding during the year,
primarily a result of treasury stock purchases in 2005. The dividend payout
ratio for this year was 43.9% compared to 40.9% in 2004, and 40.2% in 2003.

Liquidity

Liquidity risk is measured by the Company's ability to raise cash when needed at
a reasonable cost and minimize any loss. The Company must be capable of meeting
all obligations to its customers at any time and, therefore, the active
management of its liquidity position is critical. Given the uncertain nature of
our customers' demands as well as the Company's desire to take advantage of
earnings enhancement opportunities, the Company must have available adequate
sources of on and off-balance sheet funds that can be acquired in time of need.
Accordingly, in addition to the liquidity provided by balance sheet cashflows,
liquidity must be supplemented with additional sources such as credit lines from
correspondent banks, the Federal Home Loan Bank, and Federal Reserve Bank. Other
funding alternatives may also be appropriate from time to time, including
wholesale and retail repurchase agreements, large certificates of deposit, and
brokered CD relationships.

The Company's primary approach to measuring liquidity is known as the Basic
Surplus/Deficit model. It is used to calculate liquidity over two time periods:
first, the amount of cash that could be made available within 30 days
(calculated


                                       23
<PAGE>

as liquid assets less short-term liabilities as a percentage of total assets);
and second, a projection of subsequent cash availability over an additional 60
days. As of December 31, 2005, this ratio was 15.4% and 15.2% for the respective
time periods, excluding the Company's capacity to borrow additional funds from
the Federal Home Loan Bank and other sources. There is currently $317 million in
additional Federal Home Loan Bank borrowing capacity based on the Company's
year-end collateral levels. Additionally, the Company has $11 million in unused
capacity at the Federal Reserve Bank and $50 million in unused capacity from
unsecured lines of credit with other correspondent banks.

In addition to the 30 and 90-day basic surplus/deficit model, longer-term
liquidity over a minimum of five years is measured and a liquidity analysis
projecting sources and uses of funds is prepared. To measure longer-term
liquidity, a baseline projection of loan and deposit growth for five years is
made to reflect how liquidity levels could change over time. This five-year
measure reflects ample liquidity for loan growth over the next five years.

Though remote, the possibility of a funding crisis exists at all financial
institutions and therefore must be planned for. Management has addressed this
issue by formulating a Liquidity Contingency Plan, which has been reviewed and
approved by both the Board of Directors and the Company's Asset/Liability
Management Committee. The plan addresses those actions the Company would take in
response to both a short-term and long-term funding crisis.

A short-term funding crisis would most likely result from a shock to the
financial system, either internal or external, which disrupts orderly short-term
funding operations. Such a crisis should be temporary in nature and would not
involve a change in credit ratings. A long-term funding crisis would most likely
be the result of drastic credit deterioration at the Company. Management
believes that both circumstances have been fully addressed through detailed
action plans and the establishment of trigger points for monitoring such events.

Intangible Assets

Intangible assets at the end of 2005 of $224.9 million decreased $7.6 million
from the prior year-end due primarily to $7.1 million of amortization during the
year.

Intangible assets consist of goodwill, core deposit value and customer
relationships arising from acquisitions. Goodwill represents the excess cost of
an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Goodwill at
December 31, 2005 amounted to $195 million, comprised of $184 million related to
banking acquisitions and $11 million arising from the acquisition of financial
services businesses. Goodwill is subjected to periodic impairment analysis to
determine whether the carrying value of the acquired net assets exceeds their
fair value, which would necessitate a write-down of the goodwill. The Company
completed its goodwill impairment analyses during 2005 and 2004 and no
adjustments were necessary. The impairment analysis was based upon discounted
cash flow modeling techniques that require management to make estimates
regarding the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. It also requires
them to select a discount rate that reflects the current return requirements of
the market in relation to present risk-free interest rates, required equity
market premiums and company-specific risk indicators. Management believes that
there is a low probability of future impairment with regard to the goodwill
associated with whole-bank and branch acquisitions. The performance of Elias
Asset Management (EAM) weakened subsequent to its acquisition in 2000 as a
result of adverse market conditions, however, its performance stabilized in 2004
as market conditions improved. As a result of margin compression and no asset
growth, operating revenues continued to decline in 2005. Certain organizational
and structural changes were made late in 2005 that will decrease operating
expenses going forward. The Company expects these changes will result in
improved operating performance for EAM in the future. However, additional
declines in EAM's operating results may cause impairment to its recorded
goodwill of $7.3 million.

Core deposit intangibles represent the premium the Company has paid for deposits
acquired in excess of the cost that would have been incurred had the funds been
purchased in the capital markets. Core deposit intangibles are amortized on
either an accelerated or straight-line basis over periods ranging from seven to
twenty years. The recognition of a customer relationship intangible arose due to
the acquisition of Harbridge. This asset was determined based on a methodology
that calculates the present value of the projected future revenue derived from

</TABLE>

As disclosed in Table 8 above, gross loans outstanding reached a record level of
$2.41 billion as of year-end 2005, up $53.3 million or 2.3% compared to twelve
months earlier. The loan growth was produced in the consumer mortgage and
installment lines of business, with declines experienced in business lending.
Loan growth was attributable to the New York market, with the Pennsylvania
market experiencing a net decline in loans outstanding.

The compounded annual growth rate ("CAGR") for the Company's total loan
portfolio between 2001 and 2005 was 8.6% comprised of approximately 4% organic
growth, with the remainder coming from whole bank and branch acquisitions. The
greatest overall expansion occurred in the consumer mortgage segment, which grew
at a 16% CAGR (including the impact of acquisitions) over that time frame. The
consumer mortgage growth was primarily driven by record mortgage refinancing
volumes over the last five years, as well as the acquisition of
consumer-oriented banks and branches in that time period. As a consequence, the
consumer mortgages segment accounted for 34% of the total loan portfolio at
year-end 2005 versus 26% at the end of 2001. Indirect consumer installment
loans, largely borrowings originated in automobile, marine and recreational
vehicle dealerships experienced a compounded annual growth rate of 13.5% over
the last 5 years. Business lending grew at a compounded annual growth rate of 6%
from 2001 to 2005.

The weighting of retail lending in the Company's loan portfolio enables it to be
highly diversified. Approximately 66% of loans outstanding at the end of 2005
were made to consumers borrowing on an installment and residential mortgage loan
basis. The commercial portfolio is also broadly diversified by industry type as
demonstrated by the following distributions at year-end 2005: real estate
development (19%), healthcare (10%), general services (10%), motor vehicle and
parts dealers (8%), construction (6%), agriculture (7%), restaurant & lodging
(7%), retail trade (8%), manufacturing (6%) and wholesale trade (5%). A variety
of other industries with less than a 3% share of the total portfolio comprise
the remaining 14%. Since May 2004, the mix of loans has become more weighted
towards business lending due to the high proportion of commercial loans in First
Heritage's portfolio.

The consumer mortgage segment of the Company's loan portfolio is comprised of
fixed (96%) and adjustable rate (4%) residential lending. Consumer mortgages
increased $14.4 million or 1.8% in 2005. During the last several years, record
levels of refinancing activity were driven by mortgage rates that were at or
near 40-year lows. Consumer mortgage growth slowed in 2005 compared to the past
two years, as the pace of refinancing slowed after an extended period of
elevated demand in the low-rate environment. The 2005 growth was derived
principally from activity in the New York markets.

The combined total of general-purpose business lending, dealer floor plans,
mortgages on commercial property, and farm loans is characterized as the
Company's business lending activity. The business lending portfolio decreased
$11.6 million or 1.4% in 2005. The declines were concentrated in the
Pennsylvania market, while the New York market experienced modest growth.
Lending efforts in First Liberty's traditional markets continue to be challenged
by a modest economic recovery, diminished capital spending levels in the
commercial sector, an extremely competitive pricing environment and the
Company's dedication to maintaining strong credit quality standards. Management
has worked aggressively to address the loan generation challenges in
Pennsylvania by adding enhanced management, lending and credit administration
resources, and strong business relationships over the last two years via the
acquisition of First Heritage in 2004 and Grange in 2003. The enhanced scale and
coverage of the Pennsylvania business combined with a commitment to business
development efforts, positions the Company to fully take advantage of growth
opportunities in this key market as economic conditions continue to improve and
increased capital spending leads to expanded borrowing activity in the
commercial sector.

Consumer installment loans, both those originated directly (such as personal
loans and home equity loans and lines of credit), and indirectly (originated
predominantly in automobile, marine and recreational vehicle dealerships), rose
$50.6 million or 7.0% from one year ago. Continued moderate interest rates by
historical standards, aggressive dealer and manufacturer incentives on new
vehicles, and enhanced business development efforts have helped drive strong
growth in this segment over the last two years. Consumer installment loans
increased in both the New York and Pennsylvania markets during the last twelve
months.

</TABLE>

The Company places a loan on nonaccrual status when the loan becomes ninety days
past due or sooner, if management concludes collection of interest is doubtful,
except when, in the opinion of management, it is well-collateralized and in the
process of collection. As shown in Table 10 above, non-performing loans, defined
as non-accruing loans plus accruing loans 90 days or more past due, ended 2005
at $13.3 million, up approximately $0.4 million or 2.7% from one year earlier.
The ratio of non-performing loans to total loans remained consistent with the
prior year at 0.55%. The ratio of non-performing assets (which includes troubled
debt restructuring and other real estate, or OREO, in addition to non-performing
loans) to total loans plus OREO decreased to 0.59% at year-end 2005, down three
basis points from one-year earlier. The improvement was driven by improvements
in the economy, enhanced collection and recovery efforts, and the charge-off and
disposition of certain problematic loans over the last two years. Had nonaccrual
loans for the year ended December 31, 2005 been current in accordance with their
original terms, additional interest income of approximately $1.0 million would
have been recorded. At year-end 2005, the Company was managing 15 OREO
properties with a value of $1.0 million as compared to 30 OREO properties at a
value of $1.6 million a year earlier.


                                       26
<PAGE>

Total delinquencies, defined as loans 30 days or more past due or in nonaccrual
status, finished the current year at 1.46% of total loans outstanding versus
1.45% at the end of 2004. As of year-end 2005, total delinquency ratios for
commercial loans, consumer loans, and real estate mortgages were 1.78%, 2.14%,
and 0.82%, respectively. These measures were 1.57%, 2.08% and 1.00%,
respectively, as of December 31, 2004. Delinquency levels, particularly in the
30 to 89 days category, tend to be somewhat volatile due to their measurement at
a point in time, and therefore management believes that it is useful to look at
this ratio over a longer period. The total average quarter-end delinquency ratio
for 2005 was 1.40% versus 1.52% in 2004.

As displayed in Table 11 above, total net charge-offs in 2005 were $7.7 million,
down $0.7 million from the prior year, principally due to significantly improved
results in the business lending portfolio. Net charge-offs in 2004 were $1.8
million below 2003's level, and were again impacted by improved results in the
business lending portfolio. A prolonged period of economic weakness from late
2000 through early 2003 impacted the net charge-off levels in both 2002 and
2003, with the greatest impact being realized in the business loan segment.

Due to the significant increase in average loan balances in 2004 and 2003 as a
result of the factors mentioned above, management believes that net charge-offs
as a percent of average loans ("net charge-off ratio") offers a more meaningful
representation of asset quality trends. The net charge-off ratio for 2005 was
down 4 basis points from last year to 0.33%. This year's ratio benefited from
improved gross charge-off and recovery performance. Gross charge-offs as a
percentage of average loans dropped five basis points to 0.47% in 2005. Enhanced
recovery efforts were evidenced by recoveries of $3.5 million, representing 30%
of average gross charge-offs for the latest two years, compared to 27% in 2004.

Business loan net charge-offs decreased in 2005, totaling $1.9 million or 0.23%
of average business loans outstanding versus $2.8 million and 0.35% in 2004. The
primary reason for the decreased net charge-off ratio for business loans was
generally improved economic conditions in the markets served by the Company, as
well as the charge-off of a number of business loans in 2004 that had been
identified as weak and had been specifically reserved for in previous periods.
Consumer installment loan net charge-offs increased slightly to $5.4 million
this year from $5.2 million in 2004, but the net charge-off ratio remained
consistent at 0.73% due to larger average balances. Consumer mortgage net
charge-offs declined $0.1 million to $0.4 million. The net charge-off ratio
declined one basis point to 0.05%.

All the primary asset quality metrics deteriorated in 2002 and these conditions
continued into 2003, in comparison to the 2001 period. This was principally due
to the weakened economic conditions in the Company's markets, and was manifested
most strongly in the business loan portfolio. Based on almost all measurements,
the asset quality profile of the Company began to improve in 2003 in conjunction
with gradually improving economic conditions and strengthened credit
administration and loan review resources. Significant changes and enhancements
were made to lending and credit administration functions in 2003 and have
continued through 2005. These improvements contributed significantly to the
positive credit management performance in 2005.

Management continually evaluates the credit quality of the Company's loan
portfolio and conducts a formal review of the allowance for loan loss adequacy
on a quarterly basis. The two primary components of the loan review process that
are used to determine proper allowance levels are specific and general loan loss
allocations.

Measurement of specific loan loss allocations is typically based on expected
future cash flows, collateral values and other factors that may impact the
borrower's ability to pay. Impaired loans greater than $0.5 million are
evaluated for specific loan loss allocations, as defined in SFAS No. 114,
"Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan," as amended. Consumer
mortgages and consumer direct and indirect loans are considered smaller balance
homogeneous loans and are evaluated collectively. The Company considers a loan
to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable
that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts according to the
contractual terms of the loan agreement or the loan is delinquent 90 days or
more.

The second component of the allowance establishment process, general loan loss
allocations, is composed of two calculations that are computed on the four main
loan segments: commercial, consumer direct, consumer indirect and residential
real estate. The first calculation determines an allowance level based on the
latest three years of historical net charge-off data for each loan category
(commercial loans exclude balances with specific loan loss allocations). The
second calculation is qualitative and takes into consideration five major
factors affecting the level of loan loss risk: portfolio risk migration patterns
(internal credit quality trends); the growth of the segments of the loan
portfolio; economic and business environment trends in the Company's markets
(includes review of bankruptcy, unemployment, population, consumer spending and
regulatory trends); industry, geographical and product concentrations in the
portfolio; and the perceived effectiveness of managerial resources and lending
practices and policies. These two allowance calculations are added together to
determine the general loan loss allocation. The allowance levels computed from
the specific and general loan loss allocation methods are combined to derive the
necessary allowance for loan loss to be reflected on the Consolidated Statement
of Condition.

The loan loss provision is calculated by subtracting the previous period
allowance for loan loss, net of the interim period net charge-offs, from the
current required allowance level. This provision is then recorded as an expense
in the income statement for that period.

Members of senior management and the loan committee of the Board of Directors
review the adequacy of the allowance for loan loss quarterly. Management is
committed to continually improving the credit assessment and risk management
capabilities of the Company and has dedicated the resources necessary to ensure
advancement in this critical area of operations.

The allowance for loan loss was increased to $32.6 million at year-end 2005 from
$31.8 million at the end of 2004. The $0.8 million increase was primarily due to
$53 million more in loans outstanding, while the Company's asset quality profile
remained favorable. The ratio of the allowance for loan loss to total loans was
consistent at 1.35% for year-end 2005 and 2004. Management believes the year-end
2005 allowance for loan losses to be adequate in light of the probable losses
inherent in the Company's loan portfolio.

The loan loss provision decreased by $0.2 million or 2.5% in 2005 as a result of
management's assessment of the probable losses in the loan portfolio, and the
reduced level of charge-offs in 2005, as discussed above. The loan loss
provision as a percentage of average loans decreased from 0.39% in 2004 to 0.36%
this year in most part due to the stable and favorable asset quality trends. The
loan loss provision covered net charge-offs by 110% this year versus 104% in
2004, reflective of the reduced level of charge-offs this year.

The net charge-off ratio in 2005 was more consistent with the ratios of the 1999
to 2001 period. As previously noted, there was a strong correlation between the
increased level of net charge-offs in 2002 and 2003 and the performance of the
overall economy. The Company's net charge-off ratio was also above 50 basis
points during the 1990 to 1992 period, when the ratio fluctuated between 51 and
59 basis points. Not surprisingly, similar to the period from mid-2001 through
late 2003, that time frame included a recession and the first stage of an
economic recovery. The net charge-off ratio dropped significantly in the years
immediately following that period. In 2004 and 2005, the Company realized the
benefits of one of management's primary goals, which was to steadily bring the
net charge-off ratio back to a range that was consistent with historical
performance.

As demonstrated in Table 12 above and discussed previously, the risk inherit in
the consumer mortgage portfolio is much lower than that of the other segments of
the loan portfolio. The risk differential is illustrated by the average net
charge-off ratio of 0.05% over the last three years for consumer mortgages
compared to the 0.58% average for the rest of the portfolio over the same time
frame. This is manifested in the comparatively small $3.0 million allowance
attributable to consumer mortgages, representing only 0.4% of the their ending
balance versus 1.8% for the remaining portion of the loan portfolio. The
unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses was 5.1% of the total
recorded allowance at December 31, 2005 as compared to 6.4% at December 31,
2004.

Funding Sources

The Company utilizes a variety of funding sources to support the earning asset
base as well as to achieve targeted growth objectives. Overall funding is
comprised of three primary sources that possess a variety of maturity,
stability, and price characteristics: deposits of individuals, partnerships and
corporations (IPC deposits); collateralized municipal deposits (public funds);
and external borrowings.

The average daily amount of deposits and the average rate paid on each of the
following deposit categories are summarized below for the years indicated:

</TABLE>

As displayed in Table 13 above, total average deposits for 2005 equaled $2.98
billion, up $103 million or 3.6% from the prior year. This increase was
principally the result of deposits obtained through the First Heritage and
Dansville acquisitions in the second and fourth quarter of 2004, respectively.
Average deposits in 2004 were up $311 million or 12.1% from 2003. This increase
was principally the result of deposits obtained through the First Heritage
acquisition in 2004 and the Grange and Peoples acquisitions in late 2003.

The Company's funding composition continues to benefit from a high level of IPC
deposits, which reached an all-time high in 2005 with an average balance of
$2.780 billion, an increase of $88 million or 3.3% over the comparable 2004
period. This was largely due to the $210 million and $31 million in IPC deposits
added in conjunction with the acquisition of First Heritage in May 2004 and
Dansville in December 2004, respectively. IPC deposits are frequently considered
to be a bank's most attractive source of funding because they are generally
stable, do not need to be collateralized, have a relatively low cost, and
provide a strong customer base for which a variety of loan, deposit and other
financial service-related products can be sold.


                                       29
<PAGE>

Full-year average deposits of local municipalities rose $14.8 million or 8.1%
during 2005, with the First Heritage and Dansville acquisitions accounting for
$2.0 million of the increase. The Company is required to collateralize all local
government deposits with marketable securities from its investment portfolio.
Because of this stipulation, management considers this source of funding to be
similar to external borrowings. As such, the Company generally prices these
deposits consistent with alternative external borrowing rates.

The mix of average deposits in 2005 changed slightly in comparison to 2004. The
weightings of noninterest bearing demand deposit and money market balances
increased from their 2004 levels, while interest checking, savings and time
deposit weightings decreased. This change in deposit mix may have reflected
customers' expectations for rising rates and consequently their unwillingness to
be locked into rates and products for extended periods of time. New product
introductions, proactive marketing and increased yields on money markets
accounts throughout the year resulted in the average balance for money market
accounts increasing from 10.7% of the total deposits to 11.7% of total deposits.
Recently, as interest rates have risen, time deposits have attracted more funds.
This shift in mix, combined with increasing interest rates on money market and
time deposit accounts increased the cost of interest bearing deposits from 1.49%
in 2004 to 1.79% in 2005.

The remaining maturities of time deposits in amounts of $100,000 or more
outstanding as of December 31 are as follows:

External borrowings are defined as funding sources available on a national
market basis, generally requiring some form of collateralization. Borrowing
sources for the Company include the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York and
Federal Reserve Bank of New York, as well as access to the repurchase market
through established relationships with primary market security dealers. The
Company also had approximately $80 million in fixed and floating-rate
subordinated debt outstanding at the end of 2005 that is held by unconsolidated
subsidiary trusts. External borrowings averaged $761 million or 20% of total
funding sources for all of 2005 as compared to $824 million or 22% of total
funding sources for 2004. As shown in Table 15 below, at year-end 2005, $191
million or 29% of external borrowings had remaining terms of one year or less,
down considerably from $649 million and 71% at the end of 2004. This change in
external funding mix is the result of not fully reinvesting the cash flows from
the sales and maturities of investments in the current flat yield curve
environment, and instead using the funds to pay off short-term borrowings.

As displayed in Table 4 on page 18, the overall mix of funding has shifted in
2005. The percentage of funding derived from deposits increased to 80% in 2005
from 78% in 2004 and down from 83% in 2003. FHLB borrowings decreased during the
year as cash flows from the sale and maturity of investments were used to reduce
short-term borrowings. Additionally, the Company took advantage of the low point
in the yield curve in 2005 and converted $190 million of FHLB short term
borrowings to long term instruments with two or three year convertible features.

Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk

The Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in
the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers.
These financial instruments consist primarily of commitments to extend credit
and standby letters of credit. Commitments to extend credit are agreements to
lend to customers, generally having fixed expiration dates or other termination
clauses that may require payment of a fee. These commitments consist principally
of unused commercial and consumer credit lines. Standby letters of credit
generally are contingent upon the failure of the customer to perform according
to the terms of an underlying contract with a third party. The credit risks
associated with commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit are
essentially the same as that involved with extending loans to customers and are
subject to normal credit policies. Collateral may be obtained based on
management's assessment of the customer's creditworthiness. The fair value of
these commitments is immaterial for disclosure in accordance with FASB
Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for
Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others".

The contract amount of these off-balance sheet financial instruments as of
December 31 is as follows:

Investments

The objective of the Company's investment portfolio is to hold low-risk,
high-quality earning assets that provide favorable returns and provide another
effective tool to actively manage its asset/liability position to maximize
future net interest income opportunities. This must be accomplished within the
following constraints: (a) implementing certain interest rate risk management
strategies which achieve a relatively stable level of net interest income; (b)
providing both the regulatory and operational liquidity necessary to conduct
day-to-day business activities; (c) considering investment risk-weights as
determined by the regulatory risk-based capital guidelines; and (d) generating a
favorable return without undue compromise of the other requirements.

The Company executed a number of sales strategies during 2005, with a focus on
maximizing the total return performance of the portfolio. During 2005 sales of
U.S. Treasury and Agency securities, AAA rated obligations of state and
political subdivisions, and investment grade corporate bonds were $173.2
million, $46.1 million and $24.4 million, respectively. The corresponding
pre-tax gains on investment securities recognized on these sales were $7.0
million, $2.2 million and $3.0 million, respectively. All proceeds from these
sales were used to repay short-term borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank
of New York.

As displayed in Table 18 below, the book value of the Company's investment
portfolio decreased $239 million or 16% during the year to $1.289 billion.
Investment sales and limited new investment opportunities in the current flat
yield curve environment were the primary reasons for this decline in balance. As
of December 31, 2005, the expected life-to-maturity of the portfolio was 5.3
years versus 5.9 years as of December 31, 2004. Average investment balances
(book value basis) for 2005 decreased $41 million or 2.8% versus the prior year.

Investment interest income in 2005 was $4.1 million or 5.5% lower than the prior
year as a result of the lower average balances in the portfolio as well as a
13-basis point decrease in the average investment yield from 6.18% to 6.05%.
This decline in the yield was primarily due to the maturity and sales of
securities from the portfolio that had been purchased in higher interest rate
environments of previous periods. It is expected that the portfolio yield will
continue to decline given the relatively low longer-term rates prevalent in the
current market.

The investment portfolio has limited credit risk due to the composition
continuing to heavily favor U.S. Agency debentures, U.S. Agency mortgage-backed
pass-throughs, U.S. Agency CMOs and municipal bonds insured by third parties. As
of year-end 2005, these four AAA-rated (highest possible rating) security types
accounted for 96% of the portfolio's total book value, excluding Federal Home
Loan Bank stock and Federal Reserve Bank stock. These four security types
comprised 97% of total investments as of December 31, 2004.

Eighty-nine percent of the investment portfolio was classified as
available-for-sale at year-end 2005 versus ninety one percent at the end of
2004. The net pre-tax market value gain over book value for the
available-for-sale portfolio as of December 31, 2005 was $13.7 million, down
$42.1 million from one year earlier. This decline reflects the sales and
maturities of securities, as well as increasing market interest rates during the
intervening period.

(1)   Weighted average yields on the tax-exempt obligations have been computed
      on a fully tax equivalent basis assuming a marginal federal tax rate of
      35.0%. These yields are an arithmetic computation of accrued income
      divided by average balance; they may differ from the yield to maturity,
      which considers the time value of money.

(2)   Mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations are
      listed based on the contractual maturity. Actual maturities will differ
      from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call
      or prepay certain obligations with or without penalties.

Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices

The Company's financial statements have been prepared in terms of historical
dollars, without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money
over time due to inflation. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of
the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As
a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial
institution's performance than the effect of general levels of inflation.
Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same
magnitude as the prices of goods and services. Notwithstanding this, inflation
can directly affect the value of loan collateral, in particular real estate.

Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Market Risk

Market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse
changes in market rates, prices or credit risk. Credit risk associated with the
Company's loan portfolio has been previously discussed in the asset quality
section of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations. Although more than a third of the securities portfolio at
year-end 2005 was invested in municipal bonds, management believes that the tax
risk of the Company's municipal investments associated with potential future
changes in statutory, judicial and regulatory actions is minimal. The Company
also believes that it has an insignificant amount of credit risk in its
investment portfolio because essentially all of the fixed-income securities in
the portfolio are AAA-rated (highest possible rating). The Company does not have
any material foreign currency exchange rate risk exposure. Therefore, almost all
the market risk in the investment portfolio is related to interest rates.

The ongoing monitoring and management of both interest rate risk and liquidity,
in the short and long term time horizons is an important component of the
Company's asset/liability management process, which is governed by limits
established in the policies reviewed and approved annually by the Board of
Directors. The Board of Directors delegates responsibility for carrying out the
policies to the Asset/Liability Committee (ALCO), which meets each month. The
committee is made up of the Company's senior management as well as regional and
line-of-business managers who oversee specific earning asset classes and various
funding sources.

Asset/Liability Management

The primary objective of the Company's asset/liability management process is to
maximize earnings and return on capital within acceptable levels of risk. As the
Company does not believe it is possible to reliably predict future interest rate
movements, it has maintained an appropriate process and set of measurement tools
that enable it to identify and quantify sources of interest rate risk in varying
rate environments. The primary tools used by the Company in managing interest
rate risk are the income simulation model and economic value of equity modeling.

Interest Rate Risk

Interest rate risk (IRR) can result from the timing differences in the
maturity/repricing of an institution's assets, liabilities, and off-balance
sheet contracts; the effect of embedded options, such as loan prepayments,
interest rate caps/floors, and deposit withdrawals; and differences in the
behavior of lending and funding rates, sometimes referred to as basis risk; an
example of basis risk would occur if floating rate assets and liabilities, with
otherwise identical repricing characteristics, were based on market indexes that
were imperfectly correlated.

Given the potential types and differing related characteristics of IRR, it is
important that the Company maintain an appropriate process and set of
measurement tools that enable it to identify and quantify its primary sources of
IRR. The Company also recognizes that effective management of IRR includes an
understanding of when potential adverse changes in interest rates will flow
through the income statement. Accordingly, the Company will manage its position
so that it monitors its exposure to net interest income over both a one year
planning horizon and a longer-term strategic horizon.

It is the Company's objective to manage its exposure to interest rate risk,
bearing in mind that it will always be in the business of taking on rate risk
and that rate risk immunization is not possible. Also, it is recognized that as
exposure to interest rate risk is reduced, so too may net interest margin be
reduced.

Income Simulation

Income simulation is tested on a wide variety of balance sheet and treasury
yield curve scenarios. The simulation projects changes in net interest income
caused by the effect of changes in interest rates. The model requires management
to make assumptions about how the balance sheet is likely to evolve through time
in different interest rate environments. Loan and deposit growth rate
assumptions are derived from management's outlook, as are the assumptions used
for new loan yields and deposit rates. Loan prepayment speeds are based on a
combination of current industry averages and internal historical prepayments.
Balance sheet and yield curve assumptions are analyzed and reviewed by the ALCO
Committee regularly.

The following table reflects the Company's one-year net interest income
sensitivity, using December 31, 2005 asset and liability levels as a starting
point.

The prime rate and federal funds rates are assumed to move up 200 basis points
and down 100 basis points over a 12-month period while the treasury curve shifts
to spreads over federal funds that are more consistent with historical norms.
Deposit rates are assumed to move in a manner that reflects the historical
relationship between deposit rate movement and changes in the federal funds
rate, generally reflecting 10%-65% of the movement of the federal funds rate.

Cash flows are based on contractual maturity, optionality and amortization
schedules along with applicable prepayments derived from internal historical
data and external sources.

In the 2005 model, the modeled NII in a falling rate environment is less
favorable than if rates were to rise due to a faster reaction of assets
repricing than liabilities. The rising rate environment reflects an increase in
net interest income (NII) from a flat rate environment largely due fewer
short-term capital market borrowings repricing. Over a longer time period the
growth in NII improves even more significantly in a rising rate environment as
lower yielding earning assets mature and are replaced at higher rates.

The analysis does not represent a Company forecast and should not be relied upon
as being indicative of expected operating results. These hypothetical estimates
are based upon numerous assumptions: the nature and timing of interest rate
levels (including yield curve shape), prepayments on loans and securities,
deposit decay rates, pricing decisions on loans and deposits,
reinvestment/replacement of asset and liability cash flows, and other factors.
While the assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market
conditions, the Company cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature
of these assumptions, including how customer preferences or competitor
influences might change. Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis does not reflect
actions that ALCO might take in responding to or anticipating changes in
interest rates.

Management uses a "value of equity" model to supplement the modeling technique
described above. Those supplemental analyses are based on discounted cash flows
associated with on and off-balance sheet financial instruments. Such analyses
are modeled to reflect changes in interest rates and shifts in the maturity
curve of interest rates and provide management with a long-term interest rate
risk metric.

COMMUNITY BANK SYSTEM, INC.

NOTE A: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Nature of Operations

Community Bank System, Inc. is a single bank holding company which wholly-owns
four consolidated subsidiaries: Community Bank, N.A. (the Bank), Benefit Plans
Administrative Services, Inc. (BPAS), CFSI Closeout Corp. (CFSICC), and First of
Jermyn Realty Co. (FJRC). BPAS owns two subsidiaries, Benefit Plans
Administrative Services LLC and Harbridge Consulting Group LLC. BPAS provides
administration, consulting and actuarial services to sponsors of employee
benefit plans. CFSICC and FJRC are inactive companies.

The Bank operates 124 customer facilities throughout 22 counties of Upstate New
York and five counties of Northeastern Pennsylvania. The Bank owns the following
subsidiaries: Community Investment Services, Inc. (CISI), CBNA Treasury
Management Corporation (TMC), CBNA Preferred Funding Corporation (PFC), Elias
Asset Management, Inc. (EAM) and First Liberty Service Corp. (FLSC). CISI
provides broker-dealer and investment advisory services. TMC operates the cash
management, investment, and treasury functions of the Bank. PFC primarily is an
investor in residential real estate loans. EAM provides asset management
services to individuals, corporate pension and profit sharing plans, and
foundations. FLSC provides banking-related services to the Pennsylvania branches
of the Bank.

The Company wholly-owns three unconsolidated subsidiary business trusts formed
for the purpose of issuing mandatorily redeemable preferred securities which are
considered Tier I capital under regulatory capital adequacy guidelines (see Note
H).

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and
its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All inter-company accounts and transactions have
been eliminated in consolidation. Certain prior period amounts have been
reclassified to conform with the current period presentation.

Critical Accounting Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Critical accounting estimates include the allowance for loan losses, actuarial
assumptions associated with the pension, post-retirement and other employee
benefit plans, the provision for income taxes, and the carrying value of
goodwill and other intangible assets.

Risk and Uncertainties

In the normal course of its business, the Company encounters economic and
regulatory risks. There are three main components of economic risk: interest
rate risk, credit risk and market risk. The Company is subject to interest rate
risk to the degree that its interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice at
different speeds, or on different basis, from its interest-earning assets. The
Company's primary credit risk is the risk of default on the Company's loan
portfolio that results from the borrowers' inability or unwillingness to make
contractually required payments. Market risk reflects potential changes in the
value of collateral underlying loans, the fair value of investment securities,
and loans held for sale.

The Company is subject to regulations of various governmental agencies. These
regulations can and do change significantly from period to period. The Company
also undergoes periodic examinations by the regulatory agencies which may
subject it to further changes with respect to asset valuations, amounts of
required loan loss allowances, and operating restrictions resulting from the
regulators' judgements based on information available to them at the time of
their examinations.

Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes income on an accrual basis. CISI recognizes fee income
when investment and insurance products are sold to customers. EAM provides asset
management services to brokerage firms and clients and recognizes income ratably
over the contract period during which service is performed. Revenue from BPA's
administration and recordkeeping services is recognized ratably over the service
contract period. Revenue from consulting and actuarial


                                       44
<PAGE>

services is recognized when services are rendered. All inter-company revenue and
expense among related entities are eliminated in consolidation.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash on
hand, amounts due from banks and highly liquid investments with original
maturities of less than ninety days. The carrying amounts reported in the
balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents approximate those assets' fair
values.

Investment Securities

The Company has classified its investments in debt and equity securities as
held-to-maturity or available-for-sale. Held-to-maturity securities are those
for which the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity,
and are reported at cost, which is adjusted for amortization of premiums and
accretion of discounts. Securities not classified as held-to-maturity are
classified as available-for-sale and are reported at fair market value with net
unrealized gains and losses reflected as a separate component of shareholders'
equity, net of applicable income taxes. None of the Company's investment
securities has been classified as trading securities. Equity securities are
stated at cost and include restricted stock of the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York and Federal Home Loan Bank of New York. Investment securities are reviewed
regularly for other than temporary impairment. Where there is other than
temporary impairment, the carrying value of the investment security is reduced
to the estimated fair value, with the impairment loss recognized in the
consolidated statements of income as other expense.

The average cost method is used in determining the realized gains and losses on
sales of investment securities. Premiums and discounts on securities are
amortized and accreted, respectively, on a systematic basis over the period to
maturity, estimated life, or earliest call date of the related security.

Fair values for investment securities are based on quoted market prices, where
available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on
quoted market prices of comparable instruments.

Loans

Loans are stated at unpaid principal balances, net of unearned income. Mortgage
loans held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value and are
included in loans as the balance of such loans was not significant. Fair values
for variable rate loans that reprice frequently are based on carrying values.
Fair values for fixed rate loans are estimated using discounted cash flows and
interest rates currently being offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers
of similar credit quality. The carrying amount of accrued interest approximates
its fair value.

Interest on loans is accrued and credited to operations based upon the principal
amount outstanding. Unearned discount on installment loans is recognized as
income over the term of the loan, principally by the interest method.
Non-refundable loan fees and related direct costs are included in the loan
balances and are deferred and amortized over the life of the loan as an
adjustment to loan yield using the effective interest method. Premiums and
discounts on purchased loans are amortized on an accelerated method over the
life of the loans.

Impaired and Other Nonaccrual Loans

The Company places a loan on nonaccrual status when the loan becomes ninety days
past due (or sooner, if management concludes collection is doubtful), except
when, in the opinion of management, it is well-collateralized and in the process
of collection. A loan may be placed on nonaccrual status earlier than ninety
days past due if there is deterioration in the financial position of the
borrower or if other conditions of the loan so warrant. When a loan is placed on
nonaccrual status, uncollected accrued interest is reversed against interest
income and the deferral and amortization of non-refundable loan fees and related
direct costs is discontinued. Interest income during the period the loan is on
nonaccrual status is recorded on a cash basis after recovery of principal is
reasonably assured. Nonaccrual loans are returned to accrual status when
management determines that the borrower's performance has improved and that both
principal and interest are collectible. This generally requires a sustained
period of timely principal and interest payments.

Commercial loans greater than $500,000 are evaluated individually for impairment
in accordance with FASB No. 114, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a
Loan." A loan is considered impaired, based on current information and events,
if it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled
payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of
the loan agreement. The measurement of impaired loans is generally based upon
the present value of expected future cash flows or the fair value of the
collateral, if the loan is collateral-dependent.


                                       45
<PAGE>

The Company's charge-off policy by loan type is as follows:

o     Commercial loans are generally charged-off to the extent outstanding
      principal exceeds the fair value of estimated proceeds from collection
      efforts, including liquidation of collateral. The charge-off is recognized
      when the loss becomes reasonably quantifiable.

o     Consumer installment loans are generally charged-off to the extent
      outstanding principal balance exceeds the fair value of collateral, and
      are recognized by the end of the month in which the loan becomes 120 days
      past due.

o     Loans secured by 1-4 family residential real estate are generally
      charged-off to the extent outstanding principal exceeds the fair value of
      the property, and are recognized when the loan becomes 180 days past due.

Allowance for Loan Losses

Management continually evaluates the credit quality of the Company's loan
portfolio, and performs a formal review of the adequacy of the allowance for
loan losses on a quarterly basis. The allowance reflects management's best
estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Determination of the
allowance is subjective in nature and requires significant estimates. The
Company's allowance methodology consists of two broad components, general and
specific loan loss allocations.

The general loan loss allocation is composed of two calculations that are
computed on four main loan segments: commercial, consumer direct, consumer
indirect and residential real estate. The first calculation determines an
allowance level based on the latest three years of historical net charge-off
data for each loan category (commercial loans exclude balances with specific
loan loss allocations). The second calculation is qualitative and takes into
consideration five major factors affecting the level of loan loss risk:
portfolio risk migration patterns (internal credit quality trends); the growth
of the segments of the loan portfolio; economic and business environment trends
in the Company's markets (includes review of bankruptcy, unemployment,
population, consumer spending and regulatory trends); industry, geographical and
product concentrations in the portfolio; and the perceived effectiveness of
managerial resources and lending practices and policies. These two calculations
are added together to determine the general loan loss allocation. The specific
loan loss allocation relates to individual commercial loans that are both
greater than $0.5 million and in a non-accruing status with respect to interest.
Specific losses are based on discounted estimated cash flows, including any cash
flows resulting from the conversion of collateral.

Loan losses are charged off against the allowance, while recoveries of amounts
previously charged off are credited to the allowance. A provision for loan loss
is charged to operations based on management's periodic evaluation of factors
previously mentioned.

Intangible Assets

Intangible assets include core deposit intangibles, customer relationship
intangibles and goodwill arising from acquisitions. Core deposit intangibles and
customer relationship intangibles are amortized on either an accelerated or
straight-line basis over periods ranging from 7 to 20 years. Goodwill is
evaluated at least annually for impairment. The carrying value of goodwill and
other intangible assets is based upon discounted cash flow modeling techniques
that require management to make estimates regarding the amount and timing of
expected future cash flows. It also requires use of a discount rate that
reflects the current return requirements of the market in relation to present
risk-free interest rates, required equity market premiums, and company-specific
risk indicators.

Premises and Equipment

Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Computer software costs that are capitalized only include external direct costs
of obtaining and installing the software. Depreciation is calculated using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Useful lives
range from five to 10 years for equipment; three to five years for software and
hardware; and 10 to 40 years for building and building improvements. Land
improvements are depreciated over 15 years and leasehold improvements are
amortized over the term of the respective lease plus any optional renewal
periods, that are reasonable assured. Maintenance and repairs are charged to
expense as incurred.

Long-lived depreciable assets are evaluated periodically for impairment when
events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be
recoverable. Impairment exists when the expected undiscounted future cash flows
of a long-lived asset are less than its carrying value. In that event, the
Company recognizes a loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the
estimated fair value of the asset based on a quoted market price, if applicable,
or a discounted cash flow analysis. Impairment losses are recorded in other
expenses on the income statement.


                                       46
<PAGE>

Other Real Estate

Properties acquired through foreclosure, or by deed in lieu of foreclosure, are
carried at the lower of the unpaid loan balance or fair value less estimated
costs of disposal. Subsequent changes in value are reported as adjustments to
the carrying amount, not to exceed the initial carrying value of the asset at
the time of transfer. Changes in value subsequent to transfer are recorded in
operating expenses on the income statement. Gains or losses not previously
recognized resulting from the sale of other real estate are recognized as an
expense on the date of sale. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, other real estate,
included in other assets, amounted to $1,048,000 and $1,645,000, respectively.

Mortgage Servicing Rights

Originated mortgage servicing rights are recorded at their allocated fair value
at the time of sale of the underlying loan, and are amortized in proportion to
and over the period of estimated net servicing income or loss. The Company uses
a valuation model that calculates the present value of future cash flows to
determine the fair value of servicing rights. In using this valuation method,
the Company incorporates assumptions that market participants would use in
estimating future net servicing income, which includes estimates of the
servicing cost per loan, the discount rate, and prepayment speeds. The carrying
value of the originated mortgage servicing rights is evaluated quarterly for
impairment using these same market assumptions.

Deposits

The fair value of deposit obligations are based on current market rates for
alternative funding sources, principally the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York.
The carrying value of accrued interest approximates fair value.

Borrowings

The carrying amounts of federal funds purchased and short-term borrowings
approximate their fair values. Fair values for long-term borrowings are
estimated using discounted cash flows and interest rates currently being offered
on similar borrowings.

Since the Company considers debt extinguishments to be a component of its
interest rate risk management, any related gains or losses are not deemed
extraordinary and are presented in the non-interest income section of the
consolidated statements of income.

Treasury Stock

On December 15, 2004, the Board of Directors approved a twelve-month
authorization to repurchase up to 500,000 of its outstanding shares in open
market or privately negotiated transactions. All shares were repurchased as of
February 23, 2005 at a cost of $11.9 million, or an average of $23.83 per share.
On April 20, 2005 the Board of Directors authorized a twenty-month program to
repurchase up to 1,500,000 shares of its outstanding shares. As of December 31,
2005, the Company has repurchased 593,711 shares at an aggregate cost of $14.0
million, or $23.51 per share. The repurchases were for general corporate
purposes, including those related to stock plan activities.

Income Taxes

Provisions for income taxes are based on taxes currently payable or refundable
as well as deferred taxes which are based on temporary differences between the
tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial
statements. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are reported in the financial
statements at currently enacted income tax rates applicable to the period in
which the deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or
settled.

Retirement Benefits

The Company provides defined benefit pension benefits and post-retirement health
and life insurance benefits to eligible employees. The Company also provides
deferred compensation and supplemental executive retirement plans for selected
current and former employees and officers. Expense under these plans is charged
to current operations and consists of several components of net periodic benefit
cost based on various actuarial assumptions regarding future experience under
the plans, including discount rate, rate of future compensation increases and
expected return on plan assets.

Assets Under Management or Administration

Assets held in fiduciary or agency capacities for customers are not included in
the accompanying consolidated statements of condition as they are not assets of
the Company. Substantially all fees associated with providing asset management
services are recorded on an accrual basis of accounting and are included in
non-interest income. Assets under management or administration at December 31,
2005 and 2004 were $2,506,000,000 and $2,177,000,000, respectively.

Advertising

Advertising costs amounting to approximately $2,106,000, $1,553,000 and
$1,123,000 for the years ending December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively,
are non-direct response in nature and expensed as incurred.

Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share are computed based on the weighted-average common
shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share are based on the
weighted-average shares outstanding adjusted for the dilutive effect of the
assumed exercise of stock options during the year. The dilutive effect of
options is calculated using the treasury stock method of accounting. The
treasury stock method determines the number of common shares that would be
outstanding if all the dilutive options (average market price is greater than
the exercise price) were exercised and the proceeds were used to repurchase
common shares in the open market at the average market price for the applicable
time period.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company accounts for stock-based awards issued to directors, officers and
key employees using the intrinsic value method. This method requires that
compensation expense be recognized to the extent that the fair value of the
underlying stock exceeds the exercise price of the stock award at the grant
date. The Company generally does not recognize compensation expense related to
stock awards because the stock awards generally have fixed terms and exercise
prices that are equal to or greater than the fair value of the Company's common
stock at the grant date.

SFAS 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," requires companies that use
the "intrinsic value method" to account for stock compensation plans to provide
pro forma disclosures of the net income and earnings per share effect of stock
options using the "fair value method." Under this method, the fair value of the
option on the date of grant is recognized ratably as compensation expense over
the vesting period of the option.

Management estimated the fair value of options granted using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model. This model was originally developed to estimate the fair
value of exchange-traded equity options, which (unlike employee stock options)
have no vesting period or transferability restrictions. As a result, the
Black-Scholes model is not necessarily a precise indicator of the value of an
option, but it is commonly used for this purpose. The Black-Scholes model
requires several assumptions, which management developed based on historical
trends and current market observations. These assumptions include:

                                                   2005      2004       2003
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Weighted-average expected life (in years)          7.70       7.43       8.74
Future dividend yield                              3.00%      3.00%      3.00%
Share price volatility                            26.71%     27.02%     27.57%
Weighted average risk-free interest rate           4.26%      4.03%      3.82%
================================================================================

If these assumptions are not accurate, the estimated fair value used to derive
the information presented in the following table also will be inaccurate.
Moreover, the model assumes that the estimated fair value of an option is
amortized over the option's vesting period and would be included in salaries and
employee benefits on the income statement.

During the fourth quarter 2005, certain executive officers elected early
retirement as of December 31, 2005 and the Company announced the planned
retirement of its chief executive officer in July 2006. In connection with these
actions, the Company accelerated the vesting of 254,163 options and granted an
additional 80,633 fully vested options. Additionally, the Company granted 70,593
options to certain directors in the Directors Stock Balance Plan (see Note K).
The effect of these option modifications and issuances resulted in the foregoing
of future after-tax stock-based compensation expense of approximately $1.2
million.

Fair Values of Financial Instruments

The Company determines fair values based on quoted market values where available
or on estimates using present values or other valuation techniques. Those
techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the
discount rate and estimates of future cash flows. In that regard, the derived
fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent
markets and, in many cases, could not be realized in immediate settlement of the
instrument. SFAS 107, "Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments,"
excludes certain financial instruments and all non-financial instruments from
its disclosure requirements. Accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts
presented do not represent the underlying value of the Company. The fair values
of investment securities, loans, deposits, and borrowings have been disclosed in
footnotes C, D, G, and H, respectively.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 123
(revised), "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation." SFAS 123R requires all
entities to recognize compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair value
on the grant date of share-based payments such as stock options granted to
employees. The Statement requires several accounting changes in the areas of
award modifications and forfeitures. It contains additional guidance in several
areas including measuring fair value, classifying an award as equity or as a
liability, and attributing compensation cost to reporting periods. For calendar
year companies, the Statement is effective January 1, 2006. Management expects
the effect of expensing stock options will be between $0.04 - 0.05 per share.

In December 2003, the Accounting Standards Executive Committee issued Statement
of Position (SOP) 03-3, Accounting for Certain Loans or Debt Securities Acquired
in a Transfer. The SOP is effective for loans acquired in fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2004. The SOP addresses accounting for differences between
contractual cash flows and cash flows expected to be collected from an
investor's initial investment in loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer
if those differences are attributable, at least in part, to credit quality. The
initial adoption of this standard did not have an impact on the financial
condition or the results of operations of the Company.

In November 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB
Staff Position (FSP) 115-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and
its Application to Certain Investments. This FSP provides additional guidance o
when an investment in a debt or equity security should be considered impaired
and when that impairment should be considered other-than-temporary and
recognized a s loss in earnings. The FSP also requires certain disclosures about
unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other-than-temporary
impairments. The FSP is effective for reporting periods beginning after December
15, 2005. Management does not anticipate any material impact to its financial
condition or results of operations as a result of the adoption of this guidance.

Management does not believe any individual unrealized loss as of December 31,
2005 or 2004 represents an other than temporary impairment. The unrealized
losses reported for the agency and mortgage-backed securities relate primarily
to securities issued by FHLB, FNMA and FHLMC and are currently rated AAA by
Moody's Investor Services and Standards & Poor. The unrealized losses in the
portfolios are primarily attributable to changes in interest rates. The Company
has both the intent and ability to hold these securities for the time necessary
to recover the amortized cost.

================================================================================

The estimated fair value of long-term borrowings at December 31, 2005 and 2004
was approximately $505.1 million and $319.0 million, respectively.

In December 2003, the Company prepaid $25.0 million of Federal Home Loan Bank
("FHLB") advances with maturity dates ranging from January 30, 2008 to February
4, 2008 and a weighted-average rate of 5.31%. As a result of this prepayment,
the Company incurred penalties of $2.6 million in 2003. These penalties have
been reflected in the consolidated statements of income as gain (loss) on
investment securities and debt extinguishments.

The Company sponsors three business trusts, Community Capital Trust I, Community
Capital Trust II, and Community Statutory Trust III, of which 100% of the common
stock is owned by the Company. The trusts were formed for the purpose of issuing
company-obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities to third-party
investors and investing the proceeds from the sale of such preferred securities
solely in junior subordinated debt securities of the Company. The debentures
held by each trust are the sole assets of that trust. Distributions on the
preferred securities issued by each trust are payable semi-annually at a rate
per annum equal to the interest rate being earned by the trust on the debentures
held by that trust. The preferred securities are subject to mandatory
redemption, in whole or in part, upon repayment of the debentures. The Company
has entered into agreements which, taken collectively, fully and unconditionally
guarantee the preferred securities subject to the terms of each of the
guarantees. The terms of the preferred securities of each trust are as follows:

====================================================================================================================================
</TABLE>

In the fourth quarter 2003, as a result of applying the provisions of FIN 46,
the Company de-consolidated these subsidiary trusts from its financial
statements. The de-consolidation of the net assets and results of operations of
the trusts had an immaterial impact on the Company's financial statements. The
Company continues to be obligated to repay the debentures held by the trusts and
guarantees repayment of the preferred securities issued by the trusts. The
preferred securities held by the trusts qualify as Tier I capital for the
Company under Federal Reserve Board guidelines.

The Company has determined that no valuation allowance is necessary as it is
more likely than not that deferred tax assets will be realized through carryback
of future deductions to taxable income in prior years, future reversals of
existing temporary differences, and through future taxable income.

A reconciliation of the differences between the federal statutory income tax
rate and the effective tax rate for the years ended December 31 is shown in the
following table:

NOTE J: LIMITS ON DIVIDENDS AND OTHER REVENUE SOURCES

The Company's ability to pay dividends to its shareholders is largely dependent
on the Bank's ability to pay dividends to the Company. In addition to state law
requirements and the capital requirements discussed below, the circumstances
under which the Bank may pay dividends are limited by federal statutes,
regulations, and policies. For example, as a national bank, the Bank must obtain
the approval of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) for payments
of dividends if the total of all dividends declared in any calendar year would
exceed the total of the Bank's net profits, as defined by applicable
regulations, for that year, combined with its retained net profits for the
preceding two years. Furthermore, the Bank may not pay a dividend in an amount
greater than its undivided profits then on hand after deducting its losses and
bad debts, as defined by applicable regulations. At December 31, 2005, the Bank
had approximately $14,155,000 in undivided profits legally available for the
payments of dividends.

In addition, the Federal Reserve Board and the OCC are authorized to determine
under certain circumstances that the payment of dividends would be an unsafe or
unsound practice and to prohibit payment of such dividends. The Federal Reserve
Board has indicated that banking organizations should generally pay dividends
only out of current operating earnings.

There are also statutory limits on the transfer of funds to the Company by its
banking subsidiary, whether in the form of loans or other extensions of credit,
investments or assets purchases. Such transfer by the Bank to the Company
generally is limited in amount to 10% of the Bank's capital and surplus, or 20%
in the aggregate. Furthermore, such loans and extensions of credit are required
to be collateralized in specific amounts.

NOTE K: BENEFIT PLANS

As of December 31, 2005, the Company amended its defined benefit pension plan
and certain executive supplemental pension plans to provide special termination
benefits to certain key employees. In 2004, the Company amended its defined
benefit pension plan to allow for a cash balance option. Participants in the
plan as of December 31, 2003 were given an option to continue to have their
benefits calculated under the traditional plan formula or have their benefits
determined as


                                       58
<PAGE>

an account balance under a cash balance formula. All new participants to the
plan automatically participate in the cash balance option. In addition, in 2005
and 2004 the plan was amended to provide for the payment of certain benefits
formerly accrued and payable under the Deferred Compensation Plan for Certain
Executive Employees. Effective January 1, 2005, the Company also amended its
post-retirement medical plan to provide benefit coverage through a self-insured
plan. Previously, coverage was provided through community-rated HMO plans.

The Company has unfunded supplemental pension plans for certain key executives.
The projected benefit obligation and accrued benefit cost included in the
preceding table related to these plans was $3,032,000 and $3,020,000 for 2005
and $3,128,000 and $2,798,000 for 2004, respectively. The accumulated benefit
obligation for the defined benefit pension was $41,838,000 and $40,659,000 as of
December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

The weighted-average assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations as of
December 31 are as follows:

Other expense represents a $515,000 adjustment recorded in the fourth quarter of
2005 to reflect special termination benefits associated with certain early
retirement actions and a $1.2 million adjustment recorded in the fourth quarter
of 2003 to reflect the proper actuarial impact of indexing salary levels
associated with certain benefits frozen in 1988.

Prior service costs in which all or almost all of the plan's participants are
fully eligible for benefits under the plan are amortized on a straight-line
basis over the expected future working years of all active plan participants.
Prior service costs associated with transferring individual non-qualified plans
are amortized on a straight-line basis over a three-year period. Unrecognized
gains or losses are amortized using the "corridor approach", which is the
minimum amortization required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
87. Under the corridor approach, the net gain or loss in excess of 10 percent of
the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of
the assets is amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected future
working years of all active plan participants.

==========================================================

The payments reflect future service and are based on various assumptions
including retirement age and form of payment (lump-sum versus annuity). Actual
results may differ from these estimates.

The assumed discount rate is used to reflect the time value of future benefit
obligations. The discount rate was determined based upon the yield on
high-quality fixed income investments expected to be available during the period
to maturity of the pension benefits. This rate is sensitive to changes in
interest rates. A decrease in the discount rate would increase our obligation
and future expense while an increase would have the opposite effect. The
expected long-term rate of return was estimated by taking into consideration
asset allocation, reviewing historical returns on type of assets held and
current economic factors. The asset allocation for the defined benefit pension
plan as of December 31, by asset category, is as follows:

                          2005         2004
---------------------------------------------
Equity securities           73%         69%
Debt securities             25%         19%
Cash                         2%         12%
---------------------------------------------
   Total                   100%        100%
=============================================

Plan assets include $2,052,000 (5%) and $2,571,000 (6%) of Community Bank
System, Inc. stock at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

The investment objective for the defined benefit pension plan is to achieve an
average annual total return over a five-year period equal to the assumed rate of
return used in the actuarial calculations. At a minimum performance level, the
portfolio should earn the return obtainable on high quality intermediate-term
bonds. The Company's perspective regarding portfolio assets combines both
preservation of capital and moderate risk-taking. Asset allocation favors
equities, with a target allocation of approximately 75% equity securities, 20%
fixed income securities and 5% cash. No more than 10% of the portfolio can be in
stock of the Company. Due to the volatility in the market, the target allocation
is not always desirable and asset allocations will fluctuate between acceptable
ranges. Prohibited transactions include purchase of securities on margin,
uncovered call options, short sale transactions, and use of real estate,
unlisted limited partnerships, derivative products or venture capital loans as
fixed income investment vehicles.

The Company makes contributions to its funded qualified pension plan as required
by government regulation or as deemed appropriate by management after
considering the fair value of plan assets, expected return on such assets, and
the value of the accumulated benefit obligation. Based upon current information,
the Company does not expect to make contributions to the funded qualified
pension plan in 2006. The Company funds the payment of benefit obligations for
the supplemental pension and post-retirement plans because such plans do not
hold assets for investment.

The assumed health care cost trend rate used in the post-retirement health plan
at December 31, 2005 was 10.5% for the pre-65 participants and 8.5% for the
post-65 participants for medical costs and 12.0% for prescription drugs. The
rate to which the cost trend rate is assumed to decline (the ultimate trend
rate) and the year that the rate reaches the ultimate trend rate is 5.0% and
2013, respectively.

Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts
reported for the health care plan. A one-percentage-point increase in the trend
rate would increase the service and interest cost components by $56,000 and
increase the benefit obligation by $411,000. A one-percentage-point decrease in
the trend rate would decrease the service and interest cost components by
$49,000 and decrease the benefit obligation by $366,000.

401(k) Employee Stock Ownership Plan

The Company has a 401(k) Employee Stock Ownership Plan in which employees can
contribute from 1% to 90% of eligible compensation, with up to 6% being eligible
for matching contributions in the form of Company common stock. The Plan also
permits the Company to distribute a discretionary profit-sharing component in
the form of Company common stock to all participants except certain executive
employees. The expense recognized under this plan for the years ended December
31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $1,763,000, $1,583,000 and $1,309,000, respectively.

Deferred Compensation Plan for Certain Executive Employees

The Company has a Deferred Compensation Plan for Certain Executive Employees in
which participants may contribute up to 15% of their eligible compensation less
any amounts contributed to the 401(k) Employee Stock Ownership Plan. Any
discretionary profit-sharing amounts that the executive receives from the
Company must be contributed to the Deferred Compensation Plan in the form of
Company common stock. The expense recognized under this plan for the years ended
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $201,000, $159,000 and $119,000,
respectively.

Other Deferred Compensation Arrangements

In addition to the supplemental pension plans for certain executives, the
Company has nonqualified deferred compensation for several former directors,
officers and key employees. All benefits provided under these plans are unfunded
and payments to plan participants are made by the Company. At December 31, 2005
and 2004, the Company has recorded a liability of $6,320,000 and $5,373,000,
respectively. The expense recognized under these plans for the years ended
December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003 was $1,102,000, $1,727,000 and $947,000,
respectively.

Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors

Directors may defer all or a portion of their director fees under the Deferred
Compensation Plan for Directors. Under this plan, there is a separate account
for each participating director which is credited with the amount of shares
which could have been purchased with the director's fees as well as any
dividends on such shares. On the distribution date, the director will receive
common stock equal to the accumulated share balance in his account. As of
December 31, 2005 and 2004, there were 73,369 and 65,090 shares credited to the
participants' accounts, for which a liability of $1,311,000 and $1,097,000 was
accrued, respectively. The expense recognized under the plan for the years ended
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, was $238,000, $206,000, and $113,000,
respectively.

Director Stock Balance Plan

The Company has a Stock Balance Plan for non-employee directors who have
completed six months of service. The Plan is a nonqualified, noncontributory
defined benefit plan. The Plan provides benefits for service prior to January 1,
1996 based on a predetermined formula and benefits for service after January 1,
1996 based on the performance of the Company's common stock. Participants become
fully vested after six years of service. The directors can elect to receive
offset stock options that may reduce the Company's liability under the Plan.
These options vest immediately and expire one year after the date the director
retires or two years in the event of death. Benefits are payable in the form of
cash and/or Company stock (as elected by the director) on January 1st of the
year after the director retires from the Board. As of December 31, 2005 and
2004, the accrued pension liability was $297,000 and $287,000, respectively. The
expense recognized under this plan for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004
and 2003, was $10,000, $36,000 and $38,000, respectively. The expense and
related liability were calculated using a dividend rate of 3.00%, stock price
appreciation of 6.00%, and a discount rate of 5.6% for 2005, 5.6% for 2004, and
5.9% for 2003.

NOTE L:  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS

The Company has a long-term incentive program for directors, officers and key
employees. Under this program the Company authorized 4,024,000 shares of Company
common stock for the grant of incentive stock options, restricted stock awards,
nonqualified stock options, retroactive stock appreciation rights, and offset
options to its Stock Balance Plan (see Note K). The offset options vest and
become exercisable immediately and expire one year after the date the director
retires or two years in the event of death. The remaining options have a
ten-year term. They vest and become exercisable on a grant-by-grant basis,
ranging from immediate vesting to ratably over a five-year period. Option
activity in this plan is as follows:

NOTE N: COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND RESTRICTIONS

The Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in
the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers.
These financial instruments consist primarily of commitments to extend credit
and standby letters of credit. Commitments to extend credit are agreements to
lend to customers, generally having fixed expiration dates or other termination
clauses that may require payment of a fee. These commitments consist principally
of unused commercial and consumer credit lines. Standby letters of credit
generally are contingent upon the failure of the customer to perform according
to the terms of an underlying contract with a third party. The credit risks
associated with commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit are
essentially the same as that involved with extending loans to customers and are
subject to normal credit policies. Collateral may be obtained based on
management's assessment of the customer's creditworthiness. The fair value of
the standby letters of credit is immaterial for disclosure in accordance with
FASB Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements
for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others". The
contract amount of commitment and contingencies is as follows:

(000's omitted)                                 2005            2004
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Commitments to extend credit                  $434,640        $429,751
Standby letters of credit                       25,638          22,948
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
     Total                                    $460,278        $452,699
=======================================================================

The fair value of these financial instruments approximates their contract value.

The Company has unused lines of credit of $50,000,000 at December 31, 2005. The
Company has unused borrowing capacity of approximately $317,376,000 through
collateralized transactions with the Federal Home Loan Bank and $11,325,000
through collateralized transactions with the Federal Reserve Bank.

The Company is required to maintain a reserve balance, as established by the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The required average total reserve for the
14-day maintenance period of December 22, 2005 through January 4, 2006 was
$16,969,000 of which $2,000,000 was required to be on deposit with the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York. The remaining $14,969,000 was represented by cash on
hand.

NOTE O: LEASES

The Company leases buildings and office space under agreements that expire in
various years. Rental expense included in operating expenses amounted to
$2,661,000, $2,486,000 and $1,940,000 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The
future minimum rental commitments as of December 31, 2005 for all non-cancelable
operating leases are as follows:

2006                    $ 2,203
2007                      2,067
2008                      1,442
2009                      1,126
2010                      1,012
Thereafter                3,268
--------------------------------
  Total                 $11,118
================================

NOTE P: REGULATORY MATTERS

The Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements
administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital
requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional
discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct
material effect on the Company's financial statements. Under capital adequacy
guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the
Company and the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve
quantitative measures of the Company's and the Bank's assets, liabilities, and
certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting
practices. The Company's and the Bank's capital amounts and classification are
also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk
weightings, and other factors.

Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy
require the Company and Bank to maintain minimum total core capital to risk
weighted assets of 8%, and Tier I capital to risk weighted assets and Tier I
capital to average assets of 4%. Management believes, as of December 31, 2005,
that the Company and Bank meet all capital adequacy requirements to which they
are subject.


                                       64
<PAGE>

As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the most recent notification from the Office
of the Comptroller of the Currency categorized the Company and Bank as "well
capitalized" under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be
categorized as "well capitalized," the Company and Bank must maintain minimum
total core capital to risk weighted assets of 10%, Tier I capital to risk
weighted assets of 6% and Tier I capital to average assets of 5%. There are no
conditions or events since that notification that management believes have
changed the institution's category. In addition, there were no significant
capital requirements imposed or agreed to during the regulatory approval process
of any of our acquisitions.

The capital ratios and amounts of the Company and the Bank as of December 31 are

Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule
13a - 15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management,
including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control -
Integrated Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over
financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2005.

Our management's assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2005 has been audited by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as
stated in their report which is included herein.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Community Bank System, Inc.:

We have completed integrated audits of Community Bank System, Inc.'s 2005 and
2004 consolidated financial statements and of its internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, and an audit of its 2003
consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our opinions, based on our
audits, are presented below.

Consolidated financial statements

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying
index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Community Bank System, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2005 and 2004,
and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended December 31, 2005 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We
conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of
financial statements includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Internal control over financial reporting

Also, in our opinion, management's assessment, included in Management's Report
on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 8, that the
Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2005 based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those
criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework
issued by the COSO. The Company's management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
responsibility is to express opinions on management's assessment and on the
effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting based
on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over financial
reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting includes
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
evaluating management's assessment, testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other
procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Financial Disclosure

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including
our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an
evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined
under Rule 13a - 15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based upon
this evaluation, our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the
end of the period covered by this annual report. Management's annual report on
internal control over financial reporting is included under the heading "Report
on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting" at Item 8 of this Annual Report on
Form 10-K. The attestation report of the registered public accounting firm is
included under the heading "Report of the Independent Registered Public
Accounting Firm" at Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The Company continually assesses the adequacy of its internal control over
financial reporting and enhances its controls in response to internal control
assessments, and internal and external audit and regulatory recommendations. No
change in internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended
December 31, 2005 or through the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the
Company's internal control over financial reporting.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate due to changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with
the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
