This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains certain forward-looking statements with
respect to the financial  condition,  results of operations  and business of the
Company.   These   forward-looking   statements   involve   certain   risks  and

the caption "Forward-Looking Statements."

Item 1.  Business

GENERAL

Community Bank System,  Inc.  ("Company")  was  incorporated  on April 15, 1983,
under the Delaware  General  Corporation Law. Its principal office is located at
5790  Widewaters  Parkway,  DeWitt,  New York 13214 and its telephone  number is
(315)  445-2282.  The  Company  became a bank  holding  company in 1984 with the
acquisition of The St. Lawrence National Bank ("St.  Lawrence Bank") on February
3,  1984 and the First  National  Bank of Ovid  (renamed  Horizon  Bank,  N.A or
"Horizon Bank") on March 2, 1984.  Also in 1984 the Company  obtained a national
bank charter for its third  wholly-owned  subsidiary bank, The Exchange National
Bank ("Exchange  Bank"), and on July 1, 1984 Exchange Bank acquired the deposits
and certain of the assets of three  branches of the Bank of New York  located in
Southwestern  New York. On September 30, 1987, the Company  acquired The Nichols
National Bank ("Nichols  Bank")  located in Nichols,  New York. On September 30,
1988, the Company acquired ComuniCorp,  Inc., a one-bank holding company located
in Addison,  New York, the parent company to Community National Bank ("Community
Bank").

On March 26, 1990,  Community  Bank opened the Corning Market Street branch from
the  Company's  acquisition  of  deposits  and  certain  assets from Key Bank of
Central New York.  On January 1, 1992,  the  Company's  five banking  affiliates
consolidated into a single,  wholly owned national banking subsidiary,  known as
Community  Bank,  N.A.  ("Bank").  On  March  31,  1993,  the  Bank's  marketing
representative office in Ottawa, Canada was closed. On June 3, 1994, the Company
acquired three branch offices in Canandaigua,  Corning and Wellsville,  New York
from the Resolution Trust Corporation. At that time, the preexisting Canandaigua
branch office loans and deposits  were  transferred  into the new  facility.  On
October 28, 1994,  the Company  acquired the Cato,  New York branch of The Chase
Manhattan  Bank,  N.A. On July 14, 1995, the Company  acquired 15 branch offices
from The Chase  Manhattan  Bank,  N.A.  located  in  Norwich,  Watertown  (two),
Boonville,  New Hartford,  Utica,  Skaneateles,  Geneva,  Pulaski, Seneca Falls,
Hammondsport,  Canton,  Newark (two), and Penn Yan, New York ("Chase Branches").
On December  15,  1995,  the Company  sold three of the former  Chase  Branches,
located in Norwich, New Hartford,  and Utica, to NBT Bank, N.A. On June 16, 1997
the Company acquired eight branches from Key Bank of New York located in Alfred,
Cassadaga,   Clymer,   Cuba,  Gowanda,   Ripley,   Sherman,  and  Wellsville  in
Southwestern  New York State. On July 18, 1997 the Company  acquired 12 branches
from Fleet Bank located in Old Forge,  Boonville,  Ogdensburg,  St. Regis Falls,
Gateway Plaza, Watertown (2), Clayton,  Lowville, Massena (2), and Gouverneur in
Northern  and  Central  New York  State.  Seven of the former  Fleet  offices or
existing Bank offices in Watertown (2), Boonville,  Ogdensburg,  Gouverneur, and
Massena (2) have since been combined. On January 26, 2001, the Company purchased
the Citizens National Bank of Malone, with its offices in Brushton,  Chateaugay,
Hermon,  and Malone (2) now being  administered  from the Bank's Northern Market
operations  and  management  center in Canton,  NY. On May 11, 2001, the Company
purchased  First Liberty Bank Corp.  First Liberty had 13 branches  based in the
Scranton/Wilkes Barre area of Northeastern Pennsylvania.  These branches are now
identified  in the  marketplace  as "First  Liberty Bank & Trust,  a division of
Community  Bank,  N.A." On November 16, 2001, the Company  purchased 36 branches
located  in the Finger  Lakes and  Western  New York  Regions  from  FleetBoston
Financial. These branches now operate as Community Bank, N.A. offices; five have
since been closed or combined with other bank branches.

The Company had a wholly owned data processing subsidiary, Northeastern Computer
Services, Inc.  ("Northeastern").  Northeastern was acquired by the Company from
The St.  Lawrence Bank on May 31, 1984  pursuant to a corporate  reorganization.
Northeastern  had previously been a wholly owned  subsidiary of The St. Lawrence
Bank and was the  survivor  of a merger  with  Lawban  Computer  Systems,  Inc.,
another wholly-owned subsidiary of The St. Lawrence Bank.  Northeastern's office
was located at 6464 Ridings  Road,  Syracuse,  New York. In December  1991,  the
Company entered into a five-year  agreement with Mellon Bank, N.A. ("Mellon") to
provide data processing services.  The agreement has twice been renewed with the
subsequent  acquirer of Mellon's data  services,  Fiserv,  Inc.,  for a term now
ending December 31, 2005. On June 30, 1992,  Northeastern ceased operations.  On
January 17, 1997 all the outstanding shares of common stock of Northeastern were
transferred from the Company to Community Bank, N.A. On that date,  Northeastern
became a wholly  owned  subsidiary  of the  Bank  and  changed  its name to CBNA
Treasury  Management  Corporation  ("TMC").  TMC is now  utilized by the Bank to
manage its Treasury function,  including asset/liability,  investment portfolio,
and liquidity management.

The Company  also had a  wholly-owned  mortgage  banking  subsidiary,  Community
Financial  Services,  Inc.  (CFSI),  which  was  established  in June  1986;  it
commenced  operation in January 1987.  In July 1988,  CFSI  purchased  Salt City
Mortgage Corp., a Syracuse-based mortgage broker. CFSI ceased operations in 1990
and was renamed CFSI Close-Out Corp. in 1997.

On July 8, 1996,  the Company  acquired  Benefit Plans  Administrators  (BPA) of
Utica,  NY. The subsidiary was renamed  Benefit Plans  Administrative  Services,
Inc.,  continuing  as a  pension  administration  and  consulting  firm  serving
sponsors of defined benefit and defined contribution plans.

On February 3, 1997, the Company formed a subsidiary  business trust,  Community
Capital Trust I, for the purpose of issuing preferred securities,  which qualify
as Tier 1 capital.  Concurrent with its formation,  the trust issued $30,000,000
of 9.75% preferred  securities in an exempt  offering  maturing in year 2027 and
guaranteed  by the  Company.  The  entire  net  proceeds  to the trust  from the
offering were invested in junior subordinated obligations of the Company.

On June 19, 1998, the Company formed a subsidiary, Community Financial Services,
Inc. (CFSI), to offer selected insurance products through its own agency.

On December 22, 1998, the Company formed a broker-dealer  subsidiary,  Community
Investment  Services,  Inc. (CISI).  The subsidiary  became fully operational in
March 1999, with a growing number of Financial  Consultants available to provide
investment advice and products to customers.

On February 26, 1999,  CBNA Preferred  Funding  Corp., a Real Estate  Investment
Trust  (REIT),  was  established  as a subsidiary  of the Bank to invest in real
estate mortgage assets originated by the Bank.

On April 3,  2000,  the  Company  acquired  Elias  Asset  Management,  Inc.,  of
Williamsville,  NY, a nationally  recognized firm presently with $550 million in
assets under  management for individuals,  corporate  pension and profit sharing
plans, and foundations.

On July 16, 2001,  the Company  formed a subsidiary  business  trust,  Community
Capital Trust II, for the purpose of issuing preferred securities, which qualify
as Tier 1 capital.  Concurrent with its formation,  the trust issued $25,000,000
of pooled  floating  rate  preferred  securities  (priced at 6 month  LIBOR plus
3.75%)  in an  exempt  offering  maturing  in year  2031 and  guaranteed  by the
Company. The entire net proceeds to the trust from the offering were invested in
junior subordinated obligations of the Company.

On July 31, 2001,  the Company  formed a subsidiary  business  trust,  Community
Statutory  Trust III,  for the purpose of issuing  preferred  securities,  which
qualify as Tier 1  capital.  Concurrent  with its  formation,  the trust  issued
$24,450,000  of pooled  floating rate  preferred  securities  (priced at 3 month
LIBOR plus 3.58%) in an exempt offering  maturing in year 2031 and guaranteed by
the  Company.  The  entire net  proceeds  to the trust  from the  offering  were
invested in junior subordinated obligations of the Company.

financial  needs of  customers  in local  communities.  The Bank's  branches are
generally  located in small  towns and  villages  within its  geographic  market
areas. The Company  believes that the local character of business,  knowledge of

CERTAIN REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS

Bank holding  companies  and national  banks are  regulated by state and federal
law. The following is a summary of certain laws and regulations  that govern the
Company and the Bank.  To the extent that the  following  information  describes
statutory or regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by reference
to the actual statutes and regulations thereunder.

Bank Holding Company Supervision

The Company is  registered  as a bank  holding  company  under the Bank  Holding
Company  Act of  1956,  as  amended  (the  "BHCA")  and as  such is  subject  to
regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal
Reserve Board"). As a bank holding company,  the Company's  activities and those
of its subsidiary have  historically been limited to the business of banking and
activities closely related or incidental to banking. On March 12, 2000, however,
the  Gramm-Leachy-Bliley  Act took effect, relaxing the previous limitations and
permitting  bank  holding  companies  to engage in a broader  range of financial
activities (see "Financial  Services  Modernization Act" in the final section of
this discussion for details).

Under Federal Reserve Board policy, a bank holding company is expected to act as
a source of  financial  strength  to its  subsidiary  banks and to make  capital
contributions  to a troubled  bank  subsidiary.  The Federal  Reserve  Board may
charge the bank holding  company with  engaging in unsafe and unsound  practices
for failure to commit  resources to a subsidiary bank when required.  A required
capital injection may be called for at a time when the Company does not have the
resources to provide it. Any capital loans by the Company to its subsidiary bank
would be  subordinate  in right of payment to  depositors  and to certain  other
indebtedness of such subsidiary banks.

The BHCA  requires the prior  approval of the Federal  Reserve Board in any case
where a bank holding company proposes to acquire direct or indirect ownership or
control of more than 5% of any class of the voting  shares of, or  substantially
all of the assets of, any bank (unless it owns a majority of such bank's  voting
shares) or otherwise to control a bank or to merge or consolidate with any other
bank  holding  company.  The BHCA also  prohibits a bank holding  company,  with
certain  exceptions,  from  acquiring  more than 5% of the voting  shares of any
company that is not a bank.

The  Riegal-Neal  Interstate  Banking  and  Efficiency  Act of 1994  (enacted on
September 29, 1994) provides that, among other things,  substantially  all state
law barriers to the acquisition of banks by out-of-state  bank holding companies
are eliminated  effective  September 29, 1995.  The law also permits  interstate
branching  by banks  effective  as of June 1, 1997,  subject  to the  ability of
states to opt-out  completely or to set an earlier  effective  date. The Company
believes that the effect of the law has been to increase  competition within the
markets where the Company  operates,  although the Company  cannot  quantify the
effect to which  competition has increased in such markets or the timing of such
increases.

OCC Supervision

The Bank is supervised and regularly  examined by the Office of the  Comptroller
of the Currency (OCC). The various laws and regulations  administered by the OCC
affect  corporate  practices such as payment of dividends,  incurring  debt, and
acquisition  of  financial  institutions  and other  companies.  It also affects
business  practices,  such as payment of interest on  deposits,  the charging of
interest on loans,  types of business  conducted and location of offices.  There
are no  regulatory  orders  or  outstanding  issues  resulting  from  regulatory
examinations of the Bank.

Limits on Dividends and Other Revenue Sources

The Company's  ability to pay dividends to its shareholders is largely dependent
on the Bank's ability to pay dividends to the Company.  In addition to state law
requirements and the capital  requirements  discussed  below, the  circumstances
under  which  the  Bank may pay  dividends  are  limited  by  federal  statutes,
regulations and policies.  For example, as a national bank, the Bank must obtain
the  approval  of the OCC for the  payment  of  dividends  if the  total  of all
dividends declared in any calendar year would exceed the total of the Bank's net
profits, as defined by applicable regulations,  for that year, combined with its
retained net profits for the preceding two years. Furthermore,  the Bank may not
pay a dividend in an amount  greater  than its  undivided  profits  then on hand
after deducting its losses and bad debts, as defined by applicable  regulations.
At December 31, 2001,  the Bank had $26.6 million in undivided  profits  legally
available for the payment of dividends.

                                       7
<PAGE>

In addition,  the Federal  Reserve Board and the OCC are authorized to determine
under certain  circumstances that the payment of dividends would be an unsafe or
unsound  practice  and to  prohibit  payment of such  dividends.  The payment of
dividends that deplete a bank's capital base could be deemed to constitute  such
an unsafe or an unsound  practice.  The Federal Reserve Board has indicated that
banking  organizations  should  generally  pay  dividends  only  out of  current
operating earnings.

There are also  statutory  limits on the transfer of funds to the Company by its
banking  subsidiary  whether in the form of loans or other extensions of credit,
investments  or asset  purchases.  Such  transfers  by the  Bank to the  Company
generally are limited in amount to 10% of the Bank's capital and surplus, or 20%
in the aggregate.  Furthermore, such loans and extensions of credit are required
to be collateralized in specified amounts.

Capital Requirements

The Federal Reserve Board has established risk-based capital guidelines that are
applicable to bank holding  companies.  The  guidelines  established a framework
intended to make regulatory  capital  requirements more sensitive to differences
in  risk  profiles  among  banking  organizations  and  take  off-balance  sheet
exposures  into  explicit  account in assessing  capital  adequacy.  The Federal
Reserve Board  guidelines  define the components of capital,  categorize  assets
into different risk classes,  and include certain off-balance sheet items in the
calculation of risk-weighted  assets. At least half of the total capital must be
comprised of common equity,  retained earnings and a limited amount of perpetual
preferred stock, less goodwill ("Tier I capital").  Banking  organizations  that
are subject to the guidelines are required to maintain a ratio of Tier I capital
to  risk-weighted  assets  of at least  4.00%  and a ratio of total  capital  to
risk-weighted assets of at least 8.00%. The appropriate regulatory authority may
set higher capital requirements when an organization's  particular circumstances
warrant.  The remainder  ("Tier 2 capital")  may consist of a limited  amount of
subordinated debt, limited-life preferred stock, certain other instruments and a
limited  amount of loan and lease loss  reserves.  The sum of Tier I capital and
Tier 2 capital is "total  risk-based  capital." The  Company's  Tier I and total
risk-based  capital  ratios as of  December  31,  2001 were  11.41% and  12.76%,
respectively.

In addition,  the Federal Reserve Board has established a minimum leverage ratio
of Tier I capital to quarterly  average  assets less goodwill  ("Tier I leverage
ratio")  of  3.00%  for bank  holding  companies  that  meet  certain  specified
criteria, including that they have the highest regulatory rating. All other bank
holding companies are required to maintain a Tier I leverage ratio of 3.00% plus
an additional  cushion of at least 100 to 200 basis points. The Company's Tier I
leverage ratio as of December 31, 2001 was 6.73%,  which exceeded its regulatory
requirement  of 4.00%.  The guidelines  also provide that banking  organizations
experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain
strong capital positions  substantially  above the minimum  supervisory  levels,
without significant reliance on intangible assets. The Company is subject to the
same OCC capital requirements as those that apply to the Bank.

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991

In December 1991,  Congress  enacted the Federal Deposit  Insurance  Corporation
Improvement  Act of  1991  ("FDICIA"),  which  substantially  revised  the  bank
regulatory and funding  provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and made
significant revisions to several other federal banking statutes. FDICIA provides
for, among other things, (i) a recapitalization  of the Bank Insurance Fund (the
"BIF") of the FDIC by increasing  the FDIC's  borrowing  authority and providing
for  adjustments in its assessment  rates;  (ii) annual on-site  examinations of
federally-insured  depository institutions by banking regulators; (iii) publicly
available  annual  financial  condition  and  management  reports for  financial
institutions,   including   audits   by   independent   accountants;   (iv)  the
establishment of uniform accounting  standards by federal banking agencies;  (v)
the  establishment  of  a  "prompt   corrective  action"  system  of  regulatory
supervision and intervention, based on capitalization levels, with more scrutiny
and restrictions placed on depository institutions with lower levels of capital;
(vi) additional grounds for the appointment of a conservator or receiver;  (vii)
a  requirement  that the FDIC use the  least-cost  method of resolving  cases of
troubled  institutions  in  order  to keep the  costs  to  insurance  funds at a
minimum; (viii) more comprehensive  regulation and examination of foreign banks;
(ix) consumer  protection  provisions  including a  Truth-in-Savings  Act; (x) a
requirement that the FDIC establish a risk-based  deposit  insurance  assessment
system; (xi) restrictions or prohibitions on accepting brokered deposits, except
for institutions which significantly  exceed minimum capital  requirements;  and
(xii) certain additional limits on deposit insurance coverage.

                                       8
<PAGE>
FDICIA requires federal banking agencies to take "prompt corrective action" with
respect  to  banks  that  do  not  meet  minimum  capital  requirements.  FDICIA
establishes five capital tiers: "well  capitalized,"  "adequately  capitalized,"
"undercapitalized,"    "significantly    undercapitalized,"    and   "critically
undercapitalized."  The following  table sets forth the minimum  capital  ratios
that a bank  must  satisfy  in  order to be  considered  "well  capitalized"  or
"adequately capitalized" under Federal Reserve Board regulations:

                                   Well Capitalized       Adequately Capitalized
                                   ----------------       ----------------------
Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio           10%                      8%
Tier I Risk-Based Capital Ratio           6%                      4%
Tier I Leverage Ratio                     5%                      4%

If a bank  does not meet  all of the  minimum  capital  ratios  necessary  to be
considered "adequately  capitalized," it will be considered  "undercapitalized,"
"significantly  undercapitalized," or "critically  undercapitalized,"  depending
upon the amount of the  shortfall in its capital.  As of December 31, 2001,  the
Bank's total risk-based capital ratio and Tier I risk - based capital ratio were
12.57% and 11.22%,  respectively,  and its Tier I leverage ratio as of such date
was 6.69%.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  if its principal  federal regulator
determines  that an  "adequately  capitalized"  institution  is in an  unsafe or
unsound  condition  or is  engaging  in an unsafe or  unsound  practice,  it may
require the institution to submit a corrective  action plan;  restrict its asset
growth;  and prohibit  branching,  new acquisitions,  and new lines of business.
Among other things,  an institution's  principal  federal regulator may deem the
institution  to be  engaging  in an unsafe or unsound  practice if it receives a
less than  satisfactory  rating  for asset  quality,  management,  earnings,  or
liquidity in its most recent examination.

Possible  sanctions  for  undercapitalized  depository  institutions  include  a
prohibition  on the payment of dividends and a requirement  that an  institution
submit a  capital  restoration  plan to its  principal  federal  regulator.  The
capital restoration plan of an undercapitalized bank will not be approved unless
the holding  company that controls the bank  guarantees the bank's  performance.
The  obligation  of a  controlling  bank  holding  company  to  fund  a  capital
restoration  plan  is  limited  to  the  lesser  of  five  percent  (5%)  of  an
undercapitalized  subsidiary's  assets or the amount required to meet regulatory
capital  requirements.  If an undercapitalized  depository  institution fails to
submit or implement an acceptable capital  restoration plan, it can be subjected
to more severe sanctions,  including an order to sell sufficient voting stock to
become  adequately  capitalized.  Critically  undercapitalized  institutions are
subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator.

In addition,  FDICIA requires  regulators to impose new non-capital  measures of
bank safety,  such as loan  underwriting  standards and minimum earnings levels.
Regulators are also required to perform annual on-site bank examinations,  place
limits on real estate lending by banks and tighten auditing requirements.

Financial Services Modernization Act
The   Gramm-Leach-Bliley  Act  of  1999,  effective  March  11,  2000,  repealed
provisions of the depression-era Glass-Steagall Act, which prohibited commercial
banks,  securities  firms,  and insurance  companies from  affiliating with each
other and engaging in each other's businesses.

The Act creates a new type of  financial  services  company  called a "Financial
Holding Company" (an "FHC"), a bank holding company with  dramatically  expanded
powers.  FHCs may  offer  virtually  any type of  financial  service,  including
banking,  securities underwriting,  insurance (both agency and underwriting) and
merchant banking. The Federal Reserve serves as the primary "umbrella" regulator
of FHCs. Balanced against the attractiveness of these expanded powers are higher
standards  for  capital  adequacy  and  management,  with  heavy  penalties  for
noncompliance.

Bank holding  companies  that wish to engage in expanded  activities  but do not
wish to become  financial  holding  companies may elect to establish  "financial
subsidiaries,"  which are  subsidiaries of national banks with expanded  powers.
The Act permits financial subsidiaries to engage in the same types of activities
permissible for nonbank  subsidiaries of financial holding  companies,  with the
exception of merchant banking, insurance underwriting and real estate investment
and  development.  CBSI  expects to remain a bank  holding  company for the time
being and assess its options as circumstances change.

The Gramm-Leach Bliley Act also provides new privacy protections to consumers by
limiting the transfer and use by financial institutions of consumer's nonpublic,
personal  information.  The foregoing discussion is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the  statutory  provisions  of the  Gramm-Leach-Bliley  Act and the
implementing  regulations  which  have  been  or  will  be  adopted  by  various
government agencies.

The Company has historically paid regular quarterly cash dividends on its common
stock,  and declared a cash dividend of $0.27 per share for the first quarter of
2002.  The Board of Directors of the Company  presently  intends to continue the
payment of regular  quarterly cash dividends on the common stock,  as well as to
make payment of regularly  scheduled  dividends on the trust  preferred stock as
and when due,  subject to the Company's need for those funds.  However,  because
substantially  all of the funds  available  for the payment of  dividends by the
Company  are  derived  from the Bank,  future  dividends  will  depend  upon the
earnings of the Bank, its financial condition, its need for funds and applicable
governmental policies and regulations. See "Certain Regulatory Considerations --
Limits On Dividends and Other Revenue Sources."

$2,659  incurred  on  the  early  retirement  of  long-term  borrowings  against
investment  security  gain  (loss),  net. The 3rd quarter  information  has been
restated to reflect these penalties as an extraordinary loss, net of tax benefit
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  The effect of this
restatement  was to increase  amounts  previously  reported  for other income by
$2,659, decrease income before extraordinary item by $834 and increase basic and
diluted  earnings  per share  before  extraordinary  item by $.13.  There was no
impact on net  income as  previously  reported,  nor any effect on cash flows or
financial condition.

Item 7. Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

This Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations  contains  certain  forward-looking  statements  with  respect to the
financial  condition,  results of  operations  and  business of  Community  Bank
System, Inc. ("CBSI" or "the company"). These forward-looking statements involve
certain risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ
materially from those  contemplated by such  forward-looking  statements are set
herein under the caption "Forward-Looking Statements."

The  following  discussion  is  intended  to  facilitate  an  understanding  and
assessment of significant  changes in trends related to the financial  condition
of the company and the results of its operations.  The following  discussion and
analysis should be read in conjunction with the Selected Consolidated  Financial
Information  and the company's  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  and related
notes  thereto  appearing  elsewhere in this Form 10-K.  All  references  in the
discussion  to  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations  are  to  the
consolidated position and results of the company and its subsidiaries taken as a
whole. All financial  results reflect the 2001 acquisition of First Liberty Bank
Corp.  ("First  Liberty") in  accordance  with  pooling of interest  accounting,
unless otherwise noted. Lastly, all references to "peer banks", unless otherwise
noted,  pertain to a group of 172 companies  nationwide  having $1 billion to $3
billion in assets based on data through  September  30, 2001 (the most  recently
available disclosure) as provided by the Federal Reserve System.

Net Income and Profitability
Net income and earnings per share (diluted) for the year ended December 31, 2001
were $19.1  million  and $1.62,  off 23% and 30%,  respectively,  from the prior
year.  These results include $8.3 million in nonrecurring  items associated with
the company's three 2001 acquisitions in January, May, and November, which added
$1.2 billion in assets and increased its branch network by 70% to 119 locations.
Included in these  nonrecurring items are acquisition and other unusual costs as
well as net  security  gains and loss on early  retirement  of  long-term  debt.
2001's  operating  earnings,  which exclude all nonrecurring  items,  were $24.1
million (down 4.3%),  while  operating  earnings per share  (diluted) were $2.03
(off 13.2% on 10.1% more average shares outstanding).

Cash operating  earnings  reached an all-time high in 2001 of $28.4 million,  up
1.3% from 2000's  level.  In  addition to  deducting  nonrecurring  items,  cash
operating  earnings  exclude  the  amortization  of  intangible  assets,   which
represent premiums paid on acquisitions.

Cash  operating  earnings  per share  (diluted)  for all of 2001 were  $2.40,  a
decrease of 8.0% from 2000.  These results reflect an additional  952,000 common
shares issued in connection with the company's January  whole-bank  purchase and
1.309 million issued in the fourth quarter to support the mid-November  purchase
of 36 branches in Western New York from FleetBoston Financial (NYSE: FBF).

Cash  operating  return  on  assets  (ROA)  for 2001 was  0.98%  versus  nominal
operating ROA at 0.83%.  Cash operating  return on equity (ROE) for the year was
11.86% versus nominal operating ROE at 10.05%.  The difference  between cash and
nominal results  reflects the  contribution of the company's  acquisitions on an
economic  basis,  which excludes the non-cash  impact of amortizing the premiums
paid for the acquisitions.  Many analysts and investors  consider cash results a
better measure of core  profitability  and value created for  shareholders  than
nominal results.

The primary  factors  explaining  2001 are  explained in detail in the remaining
sections of this document and are summarized as follows:

o    Net interest  income (full  tax-equivalent  basis)  increased  7.4% or $7.1
     million due to a $237 million  increase in average earning assets.  Average
     loans grew $96 million (6.5%) while average  investments  rose $141 million
     (15.7%).  The growth in earning  assets was funded by $209 million  (10.9%)
     more in average deposits and $34 million (7.6%) more in average borrowings.
     Net  interest  margin  decreased  by 9 basis  points  to 3.97% on  average,
     largely  reflective  of the  impact of  rapidly  falling  financial  market
     interest  rates during much of the year,  which caused lower margins during
     the first half of 2001.

o    Total  noninterest  income  increased by $3.3 million  (14.3%) from 2000 to
     $26.4  million.  Financial  services  accounted  for  $1.8  million  of the
     improvement  in  noninterest  income,  with  approximately  $860,000  being
     attributable  to  increased   revenues  from  BPA  (the  company's  pension
     administration and consulting business) and nearly $660,000 attributable to
     the full year impact of the  purchase of Elias  Asset  Management  (EAM) on
     April 3, 2000.  Revenues  excluding net  investment  gains (losses) and the
     impact of branch properties no longer in use were

                                       15
<PAGE>

     up nicely for the seventh  consecutive year to approximately  $26.5 million
     in 2001, a $3.3 million (14.0%) improvement.

o    Noninterest  expense or  overhead  rose  $18.1  million or 25.5% in 2001 to
     $89.0  million.  Acquisition  and other  one-time  expenses and  intangible
     amortization  accounted for 54% of the increase,  or $7.8 and $1.9 million,
     respectively.  While day-to-day  overhead expense rose due to the company's
     three 2001  acquisitions,  more than $3.2 million in expense reductions was
     realized on an annualized  basis beginning in the third quarter of the year
     as  a  result  of  aggressive  cost  cutting  and  efficiency   improvement
     strategies.

o    Loan loss  provision  expense fell $625,000 or 8.1% from 2000's level.  The
     full year loan loss provision  covered total actual net charge-offs by 1.08
     times.  Net charge-offs as a percent of average loans remained flat in 2001
     at .42%.  The lower  level of  provision  was in part due to the 2000 level
     being  elevated by two isolated and unusual  commercial  loan  charge-offs.
     Nonperforming  loans increased during 2001 to .53% of loans  outstanding at
     year end compared to .49% one year earlier, reflective of the weak economy.

o    The company's  combined  effective federal and state tax rate decreased one
     percentage point this year to 29.0% as a result of an increased  proportion
     of tax-exempt  municipal  investment  holdings and continued  effective tax
     planning strategies.

Net Interest Income

Net  interest  income is the amount  that  interest  and fees on earning  assets
(loans and investments)  exceeds the cost of funds,  primarily  interest paid to
the company's depositors,  interest on capital market borrowings,  and dividends
paid  on the  company's  trust  preferred  stock.  Net  interest  margin  is the
difference  between the gross  yield on earning  assets and the cost of interest
bearing funds as a percentage of earning assets.

Net interest income (with non-taxable income converted to a full  tax-equivalent
basis) totaled $104.0  million in 2001;  this  represents a $7.1 million or 7.4%
increase  over the prior year.  The  increase  was due to higher  earning  asset
volumes,  which had a positive  impact on net interest  income of $9.4  million,
while interest rate changes had an offsetting impact of $2.3 million.

Gross interest income on loans and  investments  grew by $9.2 million or 4.7% in
2001 as a result of greater  average  earning  assets of $236.8  million,  which
contributed  $18.8 million,  partially  offset by $9.6 million  related to lower
rates.  Average  loans  grew a total of  $95.9  million  in 2001,  with the most
significant  portions  occurring as a result of the January  acquisition  of $59
million  in  loans  from  Citizens  National  Bank of  Malone  and the  November
acquisition of $177 million  associated with the FleetBoston  branches.  Overall
interest  and fees on loans  climbed  $1.3  million  or 1.0% as a result of this
growth,  partially  offset by a 46 basis  point (BP)  decrease in loan yields to
8.39%, which was caused by falling capital market rates.

Despite a falling rate environment,  the 2001 steepening yield curve allowed for
widening spreads over cost of funds on investment  transactions.  This situation
created favorable  opportunities to expand the company's  investment  portfolio,
which  increased $147 million on average  (excluding  Federal Funds sold) during
the  year.  Two  primary  components  of  this  expansion  were a  $140  million
securities  strategy made possible by First Liberty's ample capital position and
additional   purchases  of  $120  million  from  the  excess  cash  provided  by
FleetBoston  branch  acquisition.  Investment  interest  income in 2001 was $7.9
million  or  12.4%  higher  than  the  prior  year  as a  result  of the  higher
outstandings,  partially  offset by a decrease in the average  investment  yield
from  7.18% to  6.96%.  The  large  volume  of  growth  in 2001  being put on at
declining market rates was the primary cause of the change in average investment
yield.

The average earning asset yield fell 39 basis points to 7.83% in 2001 because of
the  aforementioned  decrease in investment and loan yields and a reduced mix of
loans to earning assets,  which decreased on average from 62.3% in 2000 to 60.3%
in 2001.  This  decline in loan mix is a  consequence  of  favorable  investment
opportunities  outlined above as well as a slight reduction in loans outstanding
excluding the Citizens and FleetBoston branch acquisitions.

Total average fundings (deposits and borrowings) grew by $243.0 million in 2001,
largely attributable to a $209 million increase in deposits related primarily to
acquisitions and $12.7 million more in capital market borrowings. In addition to
capital  market  borrowing  largely from the Federal Home loan Bank of New York,
the  bank  has   approximately   $78  million  in  trust  preferred   borrowings
outstanding,  $50 million of which are floating rate offerings completed in July
to help finance the FleetBoston branch purchase.

Total  interest  expense  increased  by $2.1  million  in 2001.  Higher  average
interest-bearing  funds contributed $9.4 million in additional interest expense,
with lower market rates  offsetting this by $7.3 million.  Interest expense as a
percentage of earning assets,  fell by 30 basis points (BPs) to 3.86%.  The rate
on interest bearing deposits fell 23 BPs to 4.10% due largely to steady declines
in  deposit  rates  throughout  2001.  The  borrowing  rate  on  capital  market
borrowings  declined  83 BPs because of lower  market  rates and a higher mix of
short-term funding taken on in advance of the FleetBoston branch acquisition.

CBSI's net  interest  margin  decreased  by 9 basis points from 4.06% in 2000 to
3.97% this year as the 23 BP  decrease in the rate on average  interest  bearing
deposits  from 2000 to 2001,  in  addition  to the 83 BP decrease in the average
borrowed  funds  rate,  were not enough to offset the 39 BP drop in the  earning
asset yield. By the third quarter of the year, however,  margins turned up after
steadily  falling  since  third  quarter  2000,  as  downward  repricing  of the
company's certificates of deposits continued while the decrease in earning asset
yield moderated.  The company's net interest margin ranked in the favorable 53rd
peer bank percentile through September 30, 2001.

The  following  table  sets  forth  certain   information   concerning   average
interest-earning  assets  and  interest-bearing  liabilities  and the yields and
rates  thereon for the twelve month periods  ended  December 31, 2001,  2000 and
1999.  Interest  income and resultant  yield  information in the tables are on a
fully  tax-equivalent  basis  using a marginal  federal  income tax rate of 35%.
Averages  are  computed on daily  average  balances for each month in the period
divided by the number of days in the period.  Yields and amounts  earned include
loan fees. Nonaccrual loans have been included in interest earnings for purposes
of these computations.

(1) The change in  interest  due to both rate and volume has been  allocated  to
volume and rate changes in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar
amounts of change in each.

(2) Changes due to volume and rate are computed from the  respective  changes in

The  following  table  sets  forth  certain   information   concerning   average
interest-earning  assets  and  interest-bearing  liabilities  and the yields and
rates  thereon for the three month  periods  ended  December  31, 2001 and 2000.
Interest  income and resultant  yield  information  in the tables are on a fully
tax-equivalent  basis using a marginal federal income tax rate of 35%.  Averages
are computed on daily average  balances for each month in the period  divided by
the number of days in the period.  Yields and amounts  earned include loan fees.
Nonaccrual  loans have been included in interest  earnings for purposes of these
computations.

Noninterest Income

The company's sources of noninterest income are of three primary types:  general
banking services related to loans,  deposits and other core customer  activities
typically provided through the branch network; financial services,  comprised of
personal trust, employee benefit trust, investment,  and insurance products; and
periodic  transactions,   most  often  net  gains  (losses)  from  the  sale  of
investments or other occasional events.

Total  noninterest  income in 2001 increased by 25.8% to $29.1 million,  largely
due to gains on the sale of investments,  increased  revenues from the company's
Benefits Plans Administrative Services subsidiary (BPA), and increased overdraft
fees. Combined revenues, excluding transactions related to investment securities
and disposal of branch properties,  were up strongly for the seventh consecutive
year to approximately $26.5 million in 2001, a $3.3 million or 14.0% improvement
over 2000.  Noninterest  income,  excluding  transactions  related to investment
securities and disposal of branch  properties,  as a percent of operating income
was 20.3% in 2001, an increase of one percentage point from the prior year.

The largest segment of the company's  recurring  noninterest  income is the wide
variety of fees  earned from  general  banking  services,  which  reached  $13.8
million in 2001, up 11.8% from the prior year.  This segment  contributed 52% of
noninterest  income,  excluding net  investment  securities  gains  (losses) and
disposal of branch  properties.  Highlighting  this increase was a large rise in
service charges on deposit  accounts and overdraft fees, which increased by $1.8
million,  a 24%  growth  rate over  $7.6  million  in 2000.  This  reflects  the
company's  2001  acquisitions,  including a fee  schedule

                                       21

increase in the First Liberty market.  Offsetting this increase was a decline of
$387,000 in revenue  from  electronic  banking  products  due to a change in the
company's VISATM affiliation.

Mortgage  banking  fees were up strongly at $653,000 in 2001,  an increase  from
$340,000 in the prior year.  The primary  reason for the  increase was the sharp
rise in loans sold on the secondary market to $43.6 million from $9.5 million in
2000, as driven by a decline in capital  market rates.  This change is reflected
in an increase in mortgage  servicing  rights from  $526,201 in 2000 to $567,013
this year.  Loan  servicing fees (a component of mortgage  banking  income) were
$312,000 in 2001, up 30.5% from the previous  year on a serviced loan  portfolio
of approximately $120 million, consisting of 2,007 loans.

Fees from the financial services segment of noninterest income rose $1.8 million
or 16.9% in 2001 to $12.7 million.  As a whole,  financial services now comprise
48% of total  noninterest  income,  excluding net  investment  securities  gains
(losses).  Strength in revenue  from  record  keeping  and  consulting  services
provided by EBT/BPA (our pension administration business working in concert with
the bank's employee benefit trust service), offset a reduction in personal trust
revenues,  that was caused by lower estate fees (which  periodically  fluctuate)
and  transfer  of mutual fund sales  commissions  now being  earned  through the
company's  broker-dealer,  Community Investment Services, Inc. (CISI). Growth in
CISI revenues was consistent  with an expanded  force of financial  consultants,
which  numbered 20 at year end,  including  four in the recently  acquired  (and
formerly  underserved)  First  Liberty  franchise.   The  rise  in  revenues  at
investment  manager Elias Asset Management  reflects the full year impact of the
firm,  which was  acquired in second  quarter  2000.  Lastly,  commissions  from
insurance  products  increased  slightly  due  to  greater  sales  by  financial
consultants  and a higher  dividend from the underwriter of CBSI's creditor life
insurance products.

Assets under management from the company's several financial services businesses
dipped  slightly to $1.39 billion in 2001 compared to $1.42 billion in the prior
year,  largely  reflective of reduced equity market levels.  Overall,  financial
services  contributed  $2.8 million or 9.3% of the  company's  pretax net income
this year (before allocation of indirect corporate expense), reflecting nearly a
22% return on revenue.  In 2000, the net income contribution was $2.9 million or
8.3%,  with a return on revenue of almost 27%.  The  decrease  in  earnings  and
return on revenue was caused by front-end  recruiting  payments to new financial
consultants and reduced fees on products tied to equity assets under management.

Lastly,  income from periodic transactions in 2001 largely includes $2.5 million
in gains taken on $118.7 million in investment sales, with the net proceeds used
to pre-pay $95.0 million in high-cost FHLB borrowings at a $2.7 million premium.
This amount  compares to losses of $159,000 last year. The investment  gains and
losses taken over the last two years are  illustrative  of the company's  active
management of its investment portfolio to achieve a desirable total return and a
targeted level of combined  interest income and securities gains (losses) across
financial market cycles.

Noninterest Expense

Noninterest  expense or overhead rose $18.1 million or 25.5% in 2001.  Excluding
acquisition  expenses related to Citizens  National Bank of Malone (CNB),  First
Liberty  (FLIB),  and  FleetBoston  branches,  noninterest  expense was up $10.0
million or 14.1% in 2001.  This year's overhead of $89.0 million as a percent of
average  assets was  3.08%,  up from 2.77% in 2000.  Excluding  amortization  of
intangible assets,  which is a significant  non-cash expense for the company and
virtually  non-existent for its peer group, CBSI's noninterest expense ratio was
2.85% in 2001 compared to 2.98% for peers.

For  CBSI as a whole,  higher  personnel  expense  accounted  for 32% of  2001's
increase in  overhead,  with  personnel  costs up 15.7% as a result of the three
acquisitions. The remainder of the increases in salary, benefit, and payroll tax
expense  reflect  modest  annual merit  awards for  employees.  Total  full-time
equivalent  staff at year-end 2001 was 1,115 versus 927 at year-end  2000, up as
the result of the 2001  acquisitions  and their related  impact on selected back
office and administrative staffing.

Nonpersonnel   expense   rose  $12.3   million  or  36.0%  in  2001.   Excluding
acquisition-related expenses, nonpersonnel expense rose $5.7 million or 16.6% in
2001. This was largely caused by increases in intangible  amortization,  up $1.8
million  or 36.5%;  occupancy  expense,  up $1.0  million  or  20.4%;  equipment
expense,  up $851,000 or 16.3%; and data  processing,  up $729,000 or 13.7%. The
increase in  intangible  amortization  was due to the Citizens  and  FleetBoston
acquisitions  and a  full  year  of  the  Elias  Asset  Management  acquisition.
Occupancy  expenses increased largely due to the impact of the Citizens branches
acquired in January and the Fleet branches  acquired in November of 2001. Higher
equipment   expenses  were  related  to  higher   service   contract  costs  and
depreciation expense due to the additional number of branches in 2001. Increases
in data processing  relates to higher Fiserv  processing fees, data line charges
and check processing expenses.

The  efficiency  ratio is  defined at two  levels.  The  nominal  ratio is total
overhead expense divided by operating income (full  tax-equivalent  net interest
income plus noninterest income,  excluding net securities gains and losses). The
adjusted or recurring  efficiency ratio  additionally  excludes one-time expense
and  intangible  amortization  (a  non-cash  expense)  as well  as all  one-time
noninterest  income;  over the last five years, these one-time income items have
related to the  disposal  of branch  properties.  The lower the ratio,  the more
efficient a bank is considered to be.

In 2001,  the recurring  efficiency  ratio  increased 2.3  percentage  points to
56.9%.  Management  believes it is more meaningful to use the recurring ratio to
compare to national  norms,  because as mentioned  above,  most of the company's
peers do not have intangible  expense to the significance that CBSI has. On that
basis, CBSI's ratio is more favorable than the peer bank ratio of 62.8% based on
data available as of September 30, 2001.  These results only  partially  reflect
the full year impact of the $3.2 million in annual cost savings  implemented  in
mid second  quarter 2001 in the First Liberty  market,  including the associated
benefit of streamlining our operations  functions by eliminating  duplicate loan
and deposit  processing units in Canton and Olean,  NY. However,  because of the
surge in volumes being processed as a result of the former FleetBoston branches,
fourth quarter 2001 part-time and overtime costs were some $105,000  higher than
in the same  period  a year  earlier,  representing  a .3% lag in  lowering  the
efficiency  ratio.  As experience in handling  this  additional  work is gained,
improvement in the efficiency ratio is expected.

By the nature of the company's  financial  services  businesses,  the efficiency
ratio of those activities was 75.3% in 2001 compared to 71.4% in the prior year.
The  efficiency  ratio of the company's  banking  activities was 54.9% this year
compared to 52.9% in 2000. As discussed  above, the efficiency ratio is expected
to improve for both businesses in 2002.

Acquisition  and  unusual  expenses,  which  are  excluded  from  the  recurring
efficiency  ratio  calculation,  totaled $8.2 million in 2001. The largest items
comprising the 2001  expenditures  include $1.5 million in severance expense for
First Liberty; $3.2 million in professional and consulting fees; $1.3 million in
postage,  printing, and check replacement costs; $1.3 million in data processing
conversion  costs and obsolete  software  write-offs;  and $.9 million in a wide
variety of other nonrecurring expenses.

While the company's  expense ratios have generally  been  favorable,  management
maintains   a   heightened   focus  on   controlling   costs   and   eliminating
inefficiencies. Areas for improvement have been identified through detailed peer
comparisons,  a  bank-wide  program of  employee  involvement,  targeted  use of
outside  consultants,  and review of  productivity-enhancing  technology.  These
combined efforts are intended to offset pressure from future price increases and
higher  transaction  volumes and enable the company to more fully  benefit  from
economies of scale as it continues to grow.

Income and Income Taxes

Income before taxes and extraordinary item in 2001 was $29.6 million, down 15.2%
over the prior  year's  amount.  When  income  is  recast  as if all  tax-exempt
revenues  were fully  taxable on a federal  basis,  2001's  results fell by $4.4
million or 10.6% to $36.9 million before tax.

The main  reasons for the decline in pretax  earnings  were the $8.2  million in
acquisition  and  unusual  expenses,  partially  offset by $2.5  million  in net
investment  security gains associated with the company's three 2001 acquisitions
in January,  May, and November.  Favorable  increases in net interest income, up
$7.1 million or 7.4% (full tax-equivalent basis) related to strong earning asset
growth (up 9.9% or $236.8 million on average), and a $3.3 million or 14.0% climb
in noninterest income, excluding net securities gains (losses), helped partially
offset a portion of the acquisition related expenses.

The  company's  combined  effective  federal  and state tax rate  decreased  one
percentage  point this year to 29.0%.  The decrease  resulted from effective tax
planning,  principally  because of increased  purchases of tax-exempt  municipal
investments and other earning asset strategies during the year.

Capital

Shareholders'  equity ended 2001 at $268 million,  up 33% from one year earlier.
This improvement  reflects  earnings for the year, the positive change in market
value  adjustment  (MVA)  of  the  bank's  available-for-sale   investments,  an
additional  952,000 in common  shares issued in  conjunction  with the company's
January whole bank purchase of Citizens National Bank of Malone, and 1.3 million
shares issued in the fourth quarter of 2001 to support the mid-November purchase
of  36  branches  from  FleetBoston  Financial,  offset  by  dividends  paid  to
shareholders.  Excluding  the MVA in both 2000 and 2001,  capital  rose by $61.8
million or 31.6%.  Shares outstanding grew by 2.3 million during the year due to
the aforementioned issuance of stock and the exercise of stock options.

                                       25

The company's ratio of tier I capital to assets (or tier I leverage ratio),  the
basic  measure  for  which  regulators  have  established  a 5%  minimum  to  be
considered  "well-capitalized,"  increased  slightly from one year ago to 6.73%.
This reflects the combined  impact of the additional  shares of common stock and
approximately  $50  million in floating  rate trust  preferred  stock  raised to
support the  FleetBoston  branch  acquisition,  which more than  offset  greater
intangibles  resulting  from  acquisitions.  The total capital to  risk-weighted
assets ratio increased 106 BPs during 2001 to 12.76% as of year-end  compared to
the  10%  minimum  requirement  for   "well-capitalized"   banks.  The  tangible
equity/tangible  assets  ratio ended the year at 4.09%  versus 5.65% at December
31, 2000.  The company is  confident  that  capital  levels are being  prudently
balanced between regulatory and investor perspectives.

Cash dividends declared on common stock in 2001 of $12.6 million  represented an
increase  of 24.3%  over the  prior  year.  This  growth  largely  reflects  the
aforementioned  increase in the number of shares.  The  quarterly  dividend  per
share at $.27 remained  unchanged  from the level  established  in third quarter
2000.

CBSI's  dividend  payout ratio for the year was 65.7% compared to 40.6% in 2000,
temporarily  higher than the  company's  targeted  payout range for dividends on
common stock of 30-40%.  Its payout ratio has historically  been strong relative
to peers,  and for 2001,  the ratio was in the 95th peer  percentile.  The large
increase in the payout ratio reflects  maintenance  of the dividend  despite the
23.2%  decrease  in net income  from the prior  year,  which was  largely due to
one-time acquisition expense.

Loans outstanding,  net of unearned discount, reached a record $1.733 billion as
of  year-end  2001,  up over $217  million or 14.3%  compared  to twelve  months
earlier.  About  $173  million  or 80% of 2001's  growth  came from 36  branches
acquired in mid-November from FleetBoston Financial, while $53 million came from
the company's whole bank purchase of Citizens National Bank of Malone in January
(both loan figures reflecting slight run-off since acquisition date.)

Excluding  the 2001  acquisitions,  total loans  declined by $9 million or .6 %.
CBNA's New York  franchise  grew $29  million or 2.6%  during the year to $1.128
million.  In contrast,  the Pennsylvania  franchise  decreased by $19 million or
4.8% to $379 million at year end. None of these figures include $43.6 million in
mortgages  originated  within our local markets and sold in the secondary market
to FNMA. Had these loans not been sold, loan growth excluding acquisitions would
have been $35 million or 2.3%.

<PAGE>
The  company's  predominant  focus  on the  retail  borrower  enables  its  loan
portfolio to be highly  diversified.  Approximately 63% of loans outstanding are
oriented to consumers borrowing on an installment and residential  mortgage loan
basis.  Over the last  several  years,  the  growth  rate of  CBSI's  commercial
business loans has exceeded that of loans to  individuals,  and even within this
sector there is a high degree of diversification.  The bank's business loans are
typically for amounts under  $100,000,  accounting  for 85% of our customers but
only  25% of our  commercial  loans  outstanding.  About  30% of our  commercial
portfolio is comprised of loans between $250,000 and $1 million (about 5% of our
customers),  while loans over $1 million  comprise  another 30% of the portfolio
(1.1% of our customers). The portfolio contains no credit card receivables.

The "Nature of Lending"  table below recasts the company's  loan  portfolio into
four major lines of business.  The increase in consumer direct loans contributed
60% of the $217  million  in total  loan  growth  in 2001 and  business  lending
accounted  for 31%. A smaller 12% share of this year's total loan  increase came
from consumer  mortgages while consumer  indirect loans declined  slightly.  The
following more fully discusses the underlying reasons for changes in each of the
company's four major lending activities or lines of business.

             =====================================================

The combined  total of  general-purpose  business  lending,  dealer floor plans,
mortgages  on  commercial  property,  and  farm  loans is  characterized  as the
company's  business lending activity.  At $644 million,  this segment represents
37% of loans outstanding at year-end.  Outstandings  climbed over $67 million or
12% in 2001 and  largely  resulted  from $44  million  in  loans  acquired  from
FleetBoston   Financial,   $17  million  in  loans  (reduced  by  run-off  since
acquisition  date)  acquired  from  Citizens  National  Bank of Malone,  and $28
million in growth from the New York market areas. Despite the softening economy,
the bank was able to slightly grow business lending excluding acquired loans due
to  persistent  business  development  efforts and the  strength of its existing
customer  base.  Turnover  in staff in the First  Liberty  market and run-off of
several  large  transactions  due  to  refinancing  with  institutional  lenders
resulted in a $23 million decrease in Pennsylvania-based loans.

CBNA's total commercial  portfolio is broadly  diversified by industry type with
the largest shares being in commercial real estate (16%),  services  (13%),  and
health  care  (11%);  followed  by  auto  dealers  and  agriculture  (8%  each),
hotel/eating/drinking,   manufacturing,   and  retail   trade  (7%  each);   and
construction and transportation (6% each).  Miscellaneous industries make up the
balance at 11%.

Demand for installment debt indirectly  originated through  automobile,  marine,
and mobile home dealers fell modestly in 2001. Outstandings ended the year 3% or
$8 million  lower,  primarily  resulting  from reduced  demand in certain of our
market places and less new car financing due to significant  discounting offered
by the major  manufacturers.  This  portfolio  segment,  of which 91% relates to
automobile  lending (75% of the  vehicles are used versus 25% new),  constitutes
14% of total loans  outstanding.  Indirect loans in the company's  First Liberty
franchise  increased  $6.6  million (up 23%),  in  contrast  to a $15.8  million
decrease (down 6.9%) in the New York markets excluding acquisitions.  About $1.5
million in indirect loans was obtained via acquisition in 2001.

The segment of the company's loan portfolio  committed to consumer  mortgages is
predominantly  fixed (95%) versus adjustable rate (5%) residential  lending.  It
accounts for $444 million or 26% of total loans  outstanding.  Growth during the
year of $27  million  or 6.4%  in  2001  resulted  from  $28  million  in  loans
(including subsequent growth) acquired from Citizens National Bank of Malone and
nearly $13  million  generated  in the New York  franchise,  less $14 million in
run-off  in  Pennsylvania.  Growth  in the core  mortgage  portfolio  (prior  to
acquisitions)  is lower  than it could  have  been had it not been for a program
that began in mid-1994 to sell selected fixed rate originations in the secondary
market.  The purpose of this  program,  with sales of $43.6  million in 2001 and
$9.5  million in 2000,  is to develop a  meaningful  source of mortgage  banking
income (which reached $653,000 in 2001) as well as to provide an additional tool
to manage interest rate risk.

The direct consumer  lending  activity  increased 49% or $131 million in 2001 to
$397 million.  Acquired loans in this segment  included $7 million from Citizens
National Bank of Malone and $133 million from Fleet Boston  (nearly all of which
were home equity  financing).  The weak economy  enabled a  relatively  small $6
million  increase in the core New York markets,  while the First Liberty  market
was more adversely  affected (down $15 million),  which  management  considers a
consequence  of the  Pennsylvania  bank going  through  its change of  ownership
during  2001.  This line of business is comprised  of  conventional  installment
loans  (including  some  isolated  installment  lending  to  small  businesses),
personal loans,  student loans (which are sold once principle repayment begins),
and  borrowing  under  variable and fixed rate home equity lines of credit.  The
consumer direct segment as a percent of total loans was 23%,  compared to 18% in
2001.

The following table reconciles the differences between the line of business loan
breakdown  reflected  above as  compared  to  regulatory  reporting  definitions
reflected on the Call Report and the table at the beginning of this section.

The impact of interest not recognized on nonaccrual  loans,  and interest income
that would have been  recorded  if the  restructured  loans had been  current in
accordance with their original terms, was immaterial. The company's policy is to
place a loan on nonaccrual  status and recognize  income on a cash basis when it
is more than ninety days past due,  except when in the opinion of  management it
is well secured and in the process of collection.

Provision and Reserve for Loan Losses

Nonperforming loans, defined as nonaccruing loans plus accruing loans 90 days or
more past due,  ended 2001 at $9.1  million.  This level is  approximately  $1.7
million or 23% higher  than one year  earlier,  primarily  due to  increases  in
commercial and residential mortgage loan nonaccruals. The ratio of nonperforming
loans to total loans rose a modest 4 basis points from twelve months  earlier to
 .53%. As of September 30, 2001, when the nonperforming loan ratio stood at .54%,
the company's asset quality was better than the peer level of .79%. The ratio of
nonperforming assets (which additionally include troubled debt restructuring and
other real estate) to total loans plus OREO increased to .61%, up 3 basis points
from one year earlier.

Total delinquencies,  defined as loans 30 days or more past due and nonaccruing,
finished the year at 1.93% as a percent of total loans  outstanding  compared to
1.84% in 2000. As of year-end 2001, total  delinquencies  for commercial  loans,
installment  loans,  and real estate  mortgages  were 1.98%,  2.60%,  and 1.32%,
respectively.  These  measures  compare to  delinquencies  of peer bank  holding
companies as of September 30, 2001 of 2.30%, 1.97%, and 1.43%, respectively.  As
of September 30, 2001, the  delinquency  ratio was slightly higher than the norm
at 1.96% versus peers at 1.81%.

Commercial loan net charge-offs  improved in 2001, totaling $2.0 million or .33%
of  average  commercial  outstandings  versus  $3.1  million  and  .58% in 2000.
Consumer  installment net charge-offs  rose to $4.4 million and 1.03% of average
installment   loans   outstanding,   up  $1.4  million  and  32  basis   points,
respectively,  from 2000's  level.  The increase by dollar amount was greater in
the indirect installment  portfolio (loans originated largely through automobile
dealer show rooms) than the direct installment portfolio, though the increase in
the charge-off ratio for each component was approximately the same. Mortgage net
charge-offs  were de minimus in both years.  In total,  net charge-offs for 2001
were higher by $369,000 or 6.0%,  finishing the year at $6.6 million versus $6.2
million  in 2000.  As a  percentage  of  average  loans,  net  charge-offs  were
unchanged from last year at .42%. Gross  charge-offs rose 15.8% to $8.7 million,
or .55% of average loans outstanding versus .51% in 2000. This year's recoveries
increased  sharply  to  $2.1  million,  representing  28% of  prior  year  gross
charge-offs  compared to 21% in 2000. As of September 30, 2001, the bank's total
net charge-off  ratio of .38% was in the 74th peer percentile  based on the peer
norm of .26%.

Management  continually  evaluates loan loss reserve  adequacy from a variety of
perspectives,  including overall economic conditions,  concentration of the loan
portfolio by industry and loan type, and individual customer condition. The loan
loss  reserve was  increased  to $23.9  million  versus  $20.0  million in 2000,
including $3.4 million related to the $177 million in loans  associated with the
acquired  FleetBoston  branches and the $59 million in loans associated with the
Citizens acquisition.  Of this latter increment to the reserve, $787,000 related
to  Citizens  was offset by an increase  to  goodwill  while the $2.565  million
related to FleetBoston was offset by an increase to other intangibles.

As a percent of total  loans,  the loss  reserve  ratio  increased  to 1.38% for
year-end  2001 versus  1.32% last year.  As of September  30, 2001,  the reserve
ratio at 1.35% was at the peer  median and  coverage of  nonperforming  loans at
247% was above the norm in the 62nd percentile. Management believes the year-end
coverage at 263% to be adequate in light of the probable losses in the company's
loan portfolio.

As a percentage of average  loans,  through  September 30, 2001,  the annualized
loan loss  provision at .40% was slightly  above the peer norm of .37%. The loss
provision ratio decreased from .52% in 2000 to .45% for all of this year. Due to
lower net charge-offs in 2001 and management's assessment of the probable losses
in the loan portfolio, loan loss provision expense decreased by $625,000 or 8.1%
in 2001.  Loan loss provision  expense covered net charge-offs by 108% this year
versus 124% in 2000.

Funding Sources

Typical of most commercial  banking  institutions today is the need to rely on a
variety of  funding  sources to  support  the  earning  asset base as well as to
achieve targeted growth  objectives.  There are three primary sources of funding
that  comprise  CBSI's  overall  funding  matrix,   which  considers   maturity,
stability,  and price:  deposits of individuals,  partnerships  and corporations
(IPC  deposits);   collateralized   municipal   deposits;   and  capital  market
borrowings.

             =========================================================

The  company's  funding  matrix  continues  to benefit  from a high level of IPC
deposits,  which  reached an  all-time  record for a fourth  quarter  average of
$2.130  billion,  an increase of $417 million or 24.3% over the comparable  2000
period.  This is  largely  due to the $88  million  in  deposits  acquired  from
Citizens  National  Bank of  Malone  in  January  2001 and the $470  million  in
deposits acquired from the 36 former FleetBoston  branches in November 2001. IPC
deposits are  frequently  considered  to be a bank's most  attractive  source of
funding  because they are generally  stable,  do not need to be  collateralized,
have a relatively low cost,  and because they represent a working  customer base
with the  potential  to be  cross-sold  a  variety  of loan,  deposit  and other
financial service-related products.

==============================================================================================================================
</TABLE>

Despite the 2001 acquisitions, the mix of CBSI's deposits changed only modestly.
The time  deposit mix  dropped  from 53% at the end of 2000 to 46% at the end of
2001, in part due to a lower  relative mix in both the Citizens and  FleetBoston
acquisitions  and due to a certain  amount of movement  out of time  deposits by
core customers who no longer wanted a maturity-based  product.  The money market
mix increased  from 7% to 11% due to the higher mix of money market  accounts in
the  FleetBoston  branches  and due to time  deposit  runoff  flowing  into this
category.  No other  deposit  category  mix changed by more than two  percentage
points.

Deposits of local  municipalities  decreased  $66 million or 28% during the past
year,  with balances for fourth  quarter 2001 averaging $170 million versus $236
million  for the same 2000  quarter.  Under New York State  Municipal  Law,  the
company  is  required  to  collateralize  all  local  government  deposits  with
marketable   securities   from  its  investment   portfolio.   Because  of  this
stipulation,  management  considers  this source of funding to be  equivalent to
capital market borrowings. As such, CBSI endeavors to price these deposits at or
below  alternative  capital  market  borrowing  rates.  Consequently,  levels of
municipal  deposits fluctuate  depending on how competitive  pricing compares to
the  aforementioned  borrowing  rates.  It should be noted that  utilization  of
municipal deposits has generally been flat to down over the last five years as a
percent of total funding sources.

Capital market borrowings are defined as funding sources available on a national
market basis,  generally  requiring  some form of  collateralization.  Borrowing
sources for the company include the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York,  Federal
Reserve Bank of New York, as well as access to the national repurchase agreement
market through  established  relationships with primary market security dealers.
Also  considered  as  borrowings  are  the  $30  million  in  fixed  rate  9.75%
Company-Obligated  Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Securities (trust preferred)
issued to support  1997's  acquisitions,  approximately  $50 million in floating
rate trust preferred raised to support the FleetBoston branch  acquisition,  and
advances under a $10 million line of credit tied to the 90 day libor rate with a
large regional  commercial bank. Capital market borrowings averaged $419 million
or 15% of total  funding  sources for fourth  quarter  2001,  a decline from the
fourth  quarter  2000  level  of $467  million  or 19% of total  funding  due to
short-term  borrowings being replaced with acquired deposits. As of December 31,
2001,  only 15% or $40  million  of capital  market  borrowings  (excluding  the
aforementioned  line of credit and trust  preferred  securities)  had  remaining
terms of one year or less.

During third quarter 2001,  approximately  $36 million in investments  was sold,
resulting  in $2.6  million in gains used to offset $2.7 million in penalties on
prepaying $95 million in  longer-term  advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank.
These   borrowings   were  replaced  by  core  deposits  from  the   FleetBoston
acquisition.  The swap  allowed the bank to reduce the  overall  cost of the $95
million in funds from 5.38% to 2.86%.

Investments

The objective of CBSI's  investment  portfolio is to provide  low-risk,  quality
assets to the balance sheet.  This must be  accomplished  within the constraints
of: (a)  absorbing  funds when loan demand is low or when  acquisitions  provide
additional net funding sources, and infusing funds when loan demand is high; (b)
implementing  certain  interest rate risk management  strategies which achieve a
relatively  stable  level  of  net  interest  income;  (c)  providing  both  the
regulatory and operational  liquidity  necessary to conduct day-to-day  business
activities;  (d)  considering  investment  risk-weights  as  determined  by  the
regulatory risk-based capital guidelines;  and (e) generating a favorable return
without undue compromise of the other requirements.

From December 31, 2000 to December 31, 2001, the book value of CBSI's investment
portfolio  increased  $209 million or 22.9% to $1.1  billion,  reflective of the
purchase strategies  described below,  partially offset by strategic  investment
sales.

Early in 2001,  prior to the First  Liberty  merger,  the bank's  balance  sheet
simulation  work pointed to an exposure to rising rates.  The inverted  treasury
yield curve was largely responsible for this profile. To minimize this exposure,
premium  collateralized  mortgage obligations (CMOs) and premium mortgage backed
pass throughs (MBSs) were purchased to improve the company's  interest income as
rates rise.

Following  the  First  Liberty  merger  in May 2001 and the  FleetBoston  branch
acquisition in November 2001,  the  asset/liability  profile of the bank changed
significantly  due to the  infusion  of the  long-term  core  deposits.  The new
liability  structure  shifted  the bank's  interest  rate risk to one of greater
exposure to falling interest rates. To protect against such risk, the bank began
to purchase intermediate municipal bonds and agency securities with a minimum of
five years of call protection.

Despite a falling rate environment,  the 2001 steepening yield curve allowed for
widening spreads over cost of funds on investment  transactions.  This situation
created favorable  opportunities to expand the company's  investment  portfolio,
which  increased $147 million on average  (excluding  Federal Funds sold) during
the  year.  Two  primary  components  of  this  expansion  were a  $140  million
securities  strategy made possible by First Liberty's ample capital position and
additional   purchases  of  $120  million  from  the  excess  cash  provided  by
FleetBoston branch acquisition.

During 2001,  approximately  $119 million of investments was sold,  resulting in
net investment  gains of  approximately  $2.5 million.  About $83 million of the
sales  (resulting in a slight net loss) was related to repositioning of acquired
investments  from Citizens  National Bank of Malone and First Liberty Bank Corp.
The remaining $36 million in sales,  which  resulted in a $2.6 million gain, was
used to offset  penalties  to  prepay  $95  million  in  Federal  Home Loan Bank
longer-term advances,  which were replaced by core deposits from the FleetBoston
branch acquisition.  The swap allowed the bank to reduce the overall cost of the
$95 million in funds from 5.38% to 2.86%.

Investment  interest  income in 2001 was $7.9  million or 12.4%  higher than the
prior  year as a  result  of the  higher  outstandings,  partially  offset  by a
decrease in the average  investment  yield from 7.18% to 6.96%. The large volume
of growth in 2001 being put on at declining  market rates was the primary  cause
of the change in average  investment yield.  Through September 30, 2001, the tax
equivalent investment yield was in the 91st peer percentile.

The  composition  of the  portfolio  continues  to  heavily  favor  U.S.  Agency
Debentures,  U.S.  Agency  mortgage-backed  pass-throughs,  U.S. Agency CMOs and
AAA-rated  insured  municipal  bonds.  As of year-end 2001,  these four security
types  (excluding  Federal Home Loan Bank stock and Federal  Reserve Bank stock)
accounted for over 95% of total  portfolio  investments  (17%,  16%, 36% and 26%
respectively).  Excluding the First Liberty investment  portfolio (much of which
was sold to reposition the combined  balance  sheet),  these four security types
comprised 91% of total  investments  as of December 31, 2000 at 33%, 6%, 32% and
19%,  respectively.  At year-end  2001, the average life of the portfolio was 11
years (with callable agency and municipal securities considered to maturity) and
the effective duration, which measures price sensitivity, was 5.20 years.

Since 1997, the company has utilized total return as its primary methodology for
managing investment portfolio assets. Under this analytical method,  shareholder
value is maximized  through both interest income and market value  appreciation.
For the third quarter of 2001 (prior to the FleetBoston branch acquisition), the
bank's five-year total return at 8.00% was in the excellent 98th peer percentile
per the Investment Performance Digest.

sale, any broad change in market value has a significant  impact on book equity.
As of year-end 2001, the pre-tax net market value gain over book value was $17.4
million (101.6 dollar price) versus a gain of $10.3 million as of year-end 2000.
This positive change of $7.1 million added $4.3 million to book equity, or $0.33
per share outstanding as of December 31, 2001.

The  following  table sets  forth the  amortized  cost and market  value for the
company's investment securities portfolio:

Market Risk/Interest Rate Risk

Market risk is the risk of loss in a financial  instrument  arising from adverse
changes in market rates or prices. The company's primary market risk exposure is
interest rate risk. The ongoing  monitoring  and  management of this risk,  over
both a  short-term  tactical  and  longer-term  strategic  time  horizon,  is an
important component of the company's  asset/liability  management process, which
is governed by policies  established  by its Board of Directors and reviewed and
approved annually. The Board of Directors delegates  responsibility for carrying
out the asset/liability  management  policies to the Asset/Liability  Management
Committee  (ALCO).  In this  capacity,  ALCO develops  guidelines and strategies
impacting  the  company's  asset/liability   management  activities  based  upon
estimated market risk  sensitivity,  policy limits,  and overall market interest
rate level and trends.

As the  company  does not believe it is  possible  to  reliably  predict  future
interest rate  movements,  it has maintained an  appropriate  process and set of
measurement  tools which enable it to identify and quantify  sources of interest
rate risk in varying rate environments.  The primary tool used by the company in
managing  interest  rate  risk is  income  simulation.  The  analysis  begins by
measuring the impact of  differences in maturity and repricing all balance sheet
positions.  Such work is further  augmented  by  adjusting  for  prepayment  and
embedded  option risk found  naturally in certain asset and  liability  classes.
Finally, balance sheet growth and funding expectations are added to the analysis
in order to reflect the strategic initiatives set forth by the company.

Changes in net interest  income are reviewed after  subjecting the balance sheet
to an array of treasury yield curve  possibilities.  The following  reflects the
company's  one-year net interest income sensitivity based on asset and liability
levels on  December  31,  2001,  assuming no growth in the  balance  sheet,  and
assuming an instantaneous  200 basis point increase and 150 basis point decrease
in the prime rate, federal funds rate and the entire treasury yield curve.

   - 150 bp                 ($4.3 million)                        (3.6%)
</TABLE>

The rising rate  environment  performs better than the falling rate  environment
due in large part to the increased 2001 level of core deposits, which are not as
volatile in terms of rate movement as are other funding sources.

Given the steepness in slope of the treasury  yield curve as of year-end 2001, a
second group of simulations was performed based on what the company  believes to
be  conservative  levels of balance  sheet  growth--high  single digit growth in
loans and investments, and low single digit growth in deposits, augmented by any
necessary increases in borrowings, with no growth in other major portions of the
balance sheet. On that basis, a variety of scenarios was tested,  including:  A)
raising  short term rates (fed funds and prime) by 200 BP over a one year period
while holding the long end of the treasury yield curve constant,  and B) holding
short term rates (fed funds and prime)  constant,  while flattening the long end
of the treasury curve. Under these sets of assumptions,  the bank's net interest
income shows a mild level of sensitivity to the flattening of the yield curve.

</TABLE>

The preceding  interest rate risk analysis does not represent a company forecast
and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results.
These hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions: the nature and
timing of interest rate levels  (including  yield curve shape),  prepayments  on
loans and  securities,  deposit  decay  rates,  pricing  decisions  on loans and
deposits,  reinvestment/replacement  of asset  and  liability  cash  flows,  and
others.  While the  assumptions  are developed  based upon current  economic and
local  market  conditions,  the  company  cannot make any  assurances  as to the
predictive nature of these  assumptions,  including how customer  preferences or
competitor influences might change.  Furthermore,  the sensitivity analysis does
not  reflect  actions  that ALCO might  take in  responding  to or  anticipating
changes in interest rates.

Liquidity

Due to the potential for unexpected  fluctuations in deposits and loans,  active
management of the company's liquidity is critical.  In order to respond to these
circumstances, adequate sources of both on- and off-balance sheet funding are in
place.

CBSI's  primary   approach  to  measuring   liquidity  is  known  as  the  Basic
Surplus/Deficit  model. It is used to calculate liquidity over two time periods:
first,  the  amount  of  cash  that  could  be  made  available  within  30 days
(calculated  as liquid  assets  less  short-term  liabilities);  and  second,  a
projection  of subsequent  cash  availability  over an  additional 60 days.  The
minimum policy level of liquidity  under the Basic  Surplus/Deficit  approach is
7.5% of total assets for both the 30- and 90-day time  horizons.  As of year-end
2001,  this ratio was 18.3% and 17.8%,  respectively,  excluding  the  company's
capacity to borrow additional funds from the Federal Home Loan Bank.

Forward-Looking Statements

This document contains  comments or information that constitute  forward-looking
statements (within the meaning of the Private  Securities  Litigation Reform Act
of 1995), which involve significant risks and uncertainties.  Actual results may
differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking  statements.
Moreover,  the company's plans,  objectives and intentions are subject to change
based on  various  factors  (some of which are beyond  the  company's  control).
Factors  that could cause actual  results to differ from those  discussed in the
forward-looking  statements  include:  (1)  risks  related  to  credit  quality,
interest rate sensitivity and liquidity; (2) the strength of the U.S. economy in
general and the strength of the local economies  where the company  conducts its
business;  (3) the effect of, and changes in,  monetary and fiscal  policies and
laws,  including interest rate policies of the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System; (4) inflation,  interest rate, market and monetary fluctuations;
(5) the timely development of new products and services and customer  perception
of the overall value thereof (including features,  pricing and quality) compared
to competing products and services; (6) changes in consumer spending,  borrowing
and savings habits; (7) technological  changes;  (8) any acquisitions or mergers
that might be  considered  by the company  and the costs and factors  associated
therewith;  (9) the ability to maintain  and  increase  market share and control
expenses; (10) the effect of changes in laws and regulations (including laws and
regulations concerning taxes, banking,  securities and insurance) and accounting
principles  generally  accepted  in  the  United  States;  (11)  changes  in the
company's  organization,  compensation and benefit plans and in the availability
of, and compensation levels for, employees in its geographic  markets;  (12) the
costs and effects of litigation and of any adverse  outcome in such  litigation;
and (13) the success of the company at managing the risks of the foregoing.

The foregoing list of important factors is not exclusive.  Such  forward-looking
statements speak only as of the date on which they are made and the company does
not undertake any obligation to update any  forward-looking  statement,  whether
written or oral, to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such
statement  is  made.  If  the  company  does  update  or  correct  one  or  more
forward-looking  statements,  investors  and others should not conclude that the
company will make additional updates or corrections with respect thereto or with
respect to other forward-looking statements.

expected to be consolidated into CISI in 2002. TMC operates the cash management,
investment,  and treasury  functions of the Bank,  and PFC primarily  engages in
investing of  residential  and  commercial  real estate loans.  EAM,  located in
Williamsville,  New York,  provides  asset  management  services  to the general
public.  FLSC provides banking related services to the Pennsylvania  branches of
the Bank.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated  financial  statements  include the accounts of the Company and
its wholly owned subsidiaries.  All inter-company accounts and transactions have
been eliminated in consolidation.

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally  accepted in the United States of America requires  management to make
estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of assets and
liabilities  and disclosure of contingent  assets and liabilities at the date of
the  financial  statements  and the  reported  amounts of revenues  and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Risk and Uncertainties

In the normal  course of its  business,  the  Company  encounters  economic  and
regulatory  risks.  There are three main  components of economic risk:  interest
rate risk,  credit risk and market risk. The Company is subject to interest rate
risk to the degree that its  interest-bearing  liabilities  mature or reprice at
different speeds, or on different bases from its  interest-earning  assets.  The
Company's  primary  credit  risk is the risk of  default on the  Company's  loan
portfolio that results from the borrowers'  inability or  unwillingness  to make
contractually  required payments.  Market risk reflects potential changes in the
value of collateral  underlying  loans, the fair value of investment  securities
and loans held for sale.

The  Company is subject to the  regulations  of various  governmental  agencies.
These  regulations can and do change  significantly  from period to period.  The
Company also undergoes  periodic  examinations by the regulatory  agencies which
may subject it to further changes with respect to asset  valuations,  amounts of
required  loss  allowances,   and  operating  restrictions  resulting  from  the
regulators'  judgements  based on  information  available to them at the time of
their examinations.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents  include cash on
hand,  amounts due from banks and federal funds sold.  Generally,  federal funds
are sold for one-day periods. The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet
for cash and cash equivalents approximate those assets' fair values.

                                       45
<PAGE>

Investment Securities

The Company has  classified  its  investments  in debt and equity  securities as
held-to-maturity or  available-for-sale.  Held-to-maturity  securities are those
for which the Company has the  positive  intent and ability to hold to maturity,
and are  reported at cost,  which is adjusted for  amortization  of premiums and
accretion of discounts.  Debt securities not classified as held-to-maturity  are
classified as available-for-sale  and are reported at fair market value with net
unrealized gains and losses  reflected as a separate  component of shareholders'
equity,  net of  applicable  income  taxes.  None  of the  Company's  investment
securities  has been  classified as trading  securities.  Equity  securities are
stated at cost and  include  stock of the Federal  Reserve  Bank of New York and
Federal Home Loan Bank of New York.

The average cost method is used in determining  the realized gains and losses on
sales of  investment  securities,  which  are  reported  under  other  income as
investment  security gain (loss),  net. Premiums and discounts on securities are
amortized and accreted,  respectively,  on a systematic basis over the period to
maturity, estimated life, or earliest call date of the related security.

Fair values for investment  securities are based on quoted market prices,  where
available.  If quoted market prices are not available,  fair values are based on
quoted market prices of comparable instruments.

Loans

Loans are stated at unpaid  principal  balances.  Fair values for variable  rate
loans that reprice  frequently,  with no  significant  credit risk, are based on
carrying values. Fair values for fixed rate loans are estimated using discounted
cash flows and interest  rates  currently  being  offered for loans with similar
terms to borrowers of similar credit  quality.  Mortgage loans held for sale are
carried at the lower of cost or market and are  included in loans as the balance
of such loans was not  significant.  The  carrying  amount of  accrued  interest
approximates its fair value.

Interest on Loans and Reserve for Loan Losses

Interest on commercial loans and mortgages is accrued and credited to operations
based upon the principal amount  outstanding.  Unearned  discount on installment
loans is  recognized  as income  over the term of the loan,  principally  by the
actuarial method. Non-refundable loan fees and related direct costs are deferred
and amortized over the life of the loan as an adjustment to loan yield using the
effective interest method.

The Bank  places a loan on  nonaccrual  status and  recognizes  income on a cash
basis  when it is more than  ninety  days  past due (or  sooner,  if  management
concludes  collection of interest is  doubtful),  except when, in the opinion of
management, it is well-collateralized and in the process of collection.

The reserve for loan losses reflects management's best estimate of probable loan
losses in the Company's loan  portfolio,  considering  evaluations of individual
credits and  concentrations of credit risk, changes in the quality of the credit
portfolio,  levels of nonaccrual loans, current economic conditions,  changes in
the size and  character of the credit  risks and other  pertinent  factors.  The
reserve  is  increased  by  provisions  charged to  expense  and  reduced by net
charge-offs.  A loan is considered  impaired,  based on current  information and
events,  if it is  probable  that  the  Bank  will  not be able to  collect  the
scheduled   payments  of  principal  or  interest  when  due  according  to  the
contractual  terms of the loan  agreement.  The measurement of impaired loans is
generally based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at
the historical  effective  interest rate,  except that all  collateral-dependent
loans are measured for impairment based on the fair value of the collateral.

Premises and Equipment

Premises and equipment  are stated at cost less  accumulated  depreciation.  The
annual provision for depreciation is computed using the straight-line  method in
amounts  sufficient  to  recognize  the cost of  depreciable  assets  over their
estimated  useful  lives.  Maintenance  and  repairs  are  charged to expense as
incurred.

Other Real Estate

Properties acquired through foreclosure, or by deed in lieu of foreclosure,  are
carried at the lower of the unpaid loan balance plus  settlement  costs, or fair
value less  estimated  costs of disposal.  At December 31, 2001 and 2000,  other
real  estate,   included  in  other  assets,  amounted  to  $1,427  and  $1,293,
respectively.

                                       46

Intangible Assets

Intangible assets represent  principally core deposit value,  goodwill and other
intangibles  arising from  acquisitions.  The Company  periodically  reviews the
carrying value of intangible assets using fair value methodologies. Core deposit
intangibles  are being  amortized  principally on an accelerated  basis over ten
years and  goodwill is being  amortized on a  straight-line  basis over 15 to 25
years.

Mortgage Servicing Rights

Originated  mortgage  servicing  rights are  recorded at their fair value at the
time of  transfer  and are  amortized  in  proportion  to and over the period of
estimated net  servicing  income or loss.  The Bank uses a valuation  model that
calculates the present value of future cash flows to determine the fair value of
servicing  rights.  In  using  this  valuation  method,  the  Bank  incorporates
assumptions  that  market  participants  would  use  in  estimating  future  net
servicing  income,  which includes  estimates of the cost of servicing per loan,
the discount rate, and prepayment  speeds.  The carrying value of the originated
mortgage  servicing rights is periodically  evaluated for impairment using these
same market  assumptions.  At December  31,  2001 and 2000,  mortgage  servicing
rights,  included  in other  assets,  amounted to  approximately  $567 and $526,
respectively.

Deposits

The fair  values  disclosed  for demand and  savings  deposits  are equal to the
carrying  amounts at the reporting date. The carrying  amounts for variable rate
money market accounts and certificates of deposit  approximate their fair values
at the reporting  date.  Fair values for fixed rate  certificates of deposit are
estimated using discounted cash flows and interest rates currently being offered
on similar  certificates.  The carrying value of accrued  interest  approximates
fair value.

Borrowings

The  carrying  amounts of federal  funds  purchased  and  short-term  borrowings
approximate  their  fair  values.  Fair  values  for  long-term  borrowings  are
estimated using discounted cash flows and interest rates currently being offered
on similar borrowings.

Income Taxes

Provisions for income taxes are based on taxes currently  payable or refundable,
and  deferred  taxes which are based on  temporary  differences  between the tax
basis of assets and  liabilities  and their  reported  amounts in the  financial
statements.  Deferred tax assets and  liabilities  are reported in the financial
statements  at currently  enacted  income tax rates  applicable to the period in
which the  deferred  tax assets and  liabilities  are expected to be realized or
settled.

Trust Department Assets

Assets held in fiduciary or agency  capacities for customers are not included in
the accompanying consolidated statements of condition,  since such items are not
assets of the Company.  Fees associated with providing trust management services
are  recorded  on cash basis of income  recognition  and are  included  in other
income.  Assets under  management  at December 31, 2001 and 2000 were $1,385 and
$1,417, respectively.

Earnings Per Share

Basic  earnings  per share is computed on the basis of actual  weighted  average
common shares  outstanding for the period.  Diluted  earnings per share reflects
the dilutive effect of outstanding common stock equivalents.

Treasury Stock

Treasury stock  purchases are recorded at cost.  During 2001, the Company issued
648,100 shares of treasury stock in connection  with the acquisition of Citizens
National Bank of Malone.  During 2000, the Company  purchased  100,000 shares of
treasury  stock at an average  cost of $22.88.  The Company  purchases  treasury
stock  primarily  in order to have  shares  available  for  issuance  under  its
incentive stock option,  restricted stock award, and non-qualified  stock option
plans and for other strategic purposes.


                                       47

Fair Values of Financial Instruments

The Company determines fair values based on quoted market values where available
or on  estimates  using  present  values or other  valuation  techniques.  Those
techniques are  significantly  affected by the assumptions  used,  including the
discount  rate and estimates of future cash flows.  In that regard,  the derived
fair value  estimates  cannot be  substantiated  by  comparison  to  independent
markets and, in many cases, could not be realized in immediate settlement of the
instrument.  Statement Financial Accounting Standard No. 107, "Disclosures about
Fair Value of Financial Instruments," excludes certain financial instruments and
all non-financial instruments from its disclosure requirements. Accordingly, the
aggregate fair value amounts  presented do not represent the underlying value of
the Company.

The fair values of investment  securities,  loans, deposits, and borrowings have
been disclosed in footnotes C, D, G, and H, respectively.

Accounting Pronouncements

In July 2001, the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board (FASB) issued SFAS No.
142,  "Goodwill  and  Other  Intangible   Assets",   which  addresses  financial
accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangibles  assets and
supercedes  APB Opinion No. 17,  "Intangible  Assets".  The statement  requires,
beginning  January  1,  2002,  that  the  Company  subject  goodwill  and  other
intangible assets to an annual  impairment  analysis to assess the need to write
down the balances and recognize an impairment loss. In addition, amortization of
goodwill  will no longer be  recorded  upon  adoption  of this  statement.  Core
deposit  intangibles,   net  and  other  intangibles,   net  related  to  branch
acquisitions  totaling  $122,528  at  December  31,  2001  will  continue  to be
amortized.  The Company  expects  that the adoption of this  pronouncement  will
reduce annual amortization expense by approximately $1,300.

In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144,  "Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal  of  Long-Lived  Assets,"  which  addresses  financial  accounting  and
reporting for the impairment of long-lived  assets and for long-lived  assets to
be  disposed  of,  including  long-term  customer  relationships  of a financial
institution,  such as core deposit  intangibles.  This Statement supersedes SFAS
121,  "Accounting  for the  Impairment of Long-Lived  Assets and for  Long-Lived
Assets to Be Disposed  Of,"  however,  this  Statement  retains the  fundamental
provisions  of  Statement  121  for  (a)  recognition  and  measurement  of  the
impairment  of  long-lived  assets  to be held and used and (b)  measurement  of
long-lived  assets to be disposed of by sale.  The  provisions of this Statement
are effective for financial  statements  issued for fiscal year beginning  after
December 15, 2001, and interim  periods  within those fiscal years.  The Company
has not yet determined what the impact of adopting SFAS No. 144 will have on the
financial statements.

NOTE B:  ACQUISITIONS

FleetBoston Financial Corporation

On November  16,  2001,  the  Company  acquired  36  branches  from  FleetBoston
Financial  Corporation  with $470 million in deposits and $177 million in loans.
The branches  are located in the  Southwestern  and Finger Lakes  Regions of New
York.  The  results  of the 36  branch  operations  have  been  included  in the
consolidated   financial  statements  since  that  date.  As  a  result  of  the
acquisition,  the Company's core deposit funding increased,  and the addition of
new markets with  expanded  lending and  financial  service  opportunities  will
enable the Company to grow in an increasingly competitive banking environment.

Citizens National Bank of Malone

On January  26,  2001,  the Company  acquired  the  $111-million-asset  Citizens
National Bank of Malone, an  eighty-year-old  commercial bank with five branches
throughout  Franklin and St.  Lawrence  counties in New York State.  The Company
issued 952,000 shares of its common stock to the former  shareholders  at a cost
of $26.50 per share.  All of the 648,100  shares held in the Company's  treasury
were issued in this  transaction.  The  acquisition is being accounted for under
the purchase method of accounting.

The following table  summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets acquired
and liabilities  assumed as of the date  FleetBoston  Financial  Corporation and
Citizens National Bank of Malone were acquired. The Company is in the process of
finalizing  third-party  valuations  of the fair value of loans and premises and
equipment for the  FleetBoston  Financial  Corporation  acquisition;  thus,  the
allocation of the purchase price may be subject to refinement.

Of the $91,957 of intangible assets, $28,100 represents core deposit intangibles
and is being amortized over a weighted-average  useful life of 7 years;  $13,311
is considered  goodwill and will be evaluated  annually for impairment;  and the
remaining $50,546 is considered other intangibles and is being amortized over 15
years. The other intangibles are expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

First Liberty Bank Corp.

On May 11, 2001,  Company  completed its  acquisition of the  $648-million-asset
First Liberty Bank Corp. ("First Liberty"). Pursuant to the terms of the merger,
each share of First  Liberty stock was exchanged for .56 shares of the Company's
common stock,  which amounted to  approximately  3.6 million shares.  The merger
constituted a tax-free reorganization and has been accounted for as a pooling of
interests under  Accounting  Principles Board Opinion No. 16.  Accordingly,  the
consolidated  financial  statements for the periods presented have been restated
to include the combined results of operations, financial position and cash flows
of the Company and First Liberty.  Certain  reclassifications were made to First
Liberty's   prior  year  financial   statements  to  conform  to  the  Company's
presentation.

Elias Asset Management, Inc.

On April 3, 2000,  Community Bank System,  Inc.  acquired all the stock of Elias

==================================================

The estimated  fair value of long term  borrowings at December 31, 2001 and 2000
were $338,801 and $271,894, respectively.

On  September  10, 2001 the Company  prepaid  $95,000 of Federal  Home Loan Bank
advances with maturity dates ranging from December 17, 2002 to February 23, 2004
and a weighted average rate of 5.38%. These long-term  borrowings were paid with
gains  resulting  from  investment  sales of $36  million.  As a  result  of the
prepayment,  the Company incurred penalties of $2,659 that has been reflected in
the  consolidated  statements  of income as an  extraordinary  loss,  net of tax
benefit of $1,077.

On July 16,  2001,  the  Company  formed a wholly  owned  subsidiary,  Community
Capital Trust II, a Delaware business trust. The trust issued $25,000 of 30 year
floating rate  Company-obligated  pooled Capital Securities of Community Capital
Trust II Holding Solely Parent Debentures.  On July 31, 2001, the Company formed
a wholly owned subsidiary, Community Statutory Trust III, a Connecticut business
trust.  The trust  issued  $24,450 of 30 year  floating  rate  Company-obligated
pooled Capital Securities of Community Statutory Trust III Holding Solely Parent
Debentures. The Company borrowed the proceeds of the Capital Securities from its
Subsidiaries   by  issuing  Deeply   Subordinated   Junior   Debentures   having
substantially  similar  terms.  The  Capital  Securities  mature in 2031 and are
treated  as Tier I capital by the  Federal  Reserve  Bank of New York.  Trust II
Capital  Securities are a pooled trust preferred fund of MM Community Funding I,
Ltd,  and are tied to the six  month  LIBOR  plus  3.75%,  with a five year call
provision.  Trust III Capital  Securities  are a pooled trust  preferred fund of
First  Tennessee/KBW  Pooled Trust  Preferred Deal III and are tied to the three
month LIBOR plus 3.58%, with a five year call provision. All of these securities
are guaranteed by the Company.

On February 3, 1997, the Company formed a subsidiary  business trust,  Community
Capital Trust I (Trust),  for the purpose of issuing preferred  securities which
qualify as Tier I capital (see Note P). Concurrent with its formation, the Trust
issued  $30,000  of  9.75%  preferred  securities  in an  exempt  offering.  The
preferred  securities  are  non-voting,  mandatorily  redeemable  in  2027,  and
guaranteed  by the  Company.  The  entire  net  proceeds  to the Trust  from the
offering were invested in junior  subordinated  obligations of the Company.  The
costs related to the issuance of these  securities are capitalized and amortized
over the life of the period to redemption on a straight-line basis.

The Company has  determined  that no  valuation  allowance is necessary as it is
more likely than not that deferred tax assets will be realized through carryback
of future  deductions  to taxable  income in prior  years,  future  reversals of
existing temporary differences, and through future taxable income.

A  reconciliation  of the differences  between the federal  statutory income tax
rate and the effective tax rate for the years ended  December 31 is shown in the
following table:

NOTE J:  LIMITS ON DIVIDENDS AND OTHER REVENUE SOURCES

The Company's  ability to pay dividends to its shareholders is largely dependent
on the Bank's ability to pay dividends to the Company.  In addition to state law
requirements and the capital  requirements  discussed  below, the  circumstances
under  which  the  Bank may pay  dividends  are  limited  by  federal  statutes,
regulations, and policies. For example, as a national bank, the Bank must obtain
the approval of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) for payments
of dividends if the total of all  dividends  declared in any calendar year would
exceed  the  total  of  the  Bank's  net  profits,   as  defined  by  applicable
regulations,  for that year,  combined  with its  retained  net  profits for the
preceding two years.  Furthermore,  the Bank may not pay a dividend in an amount
greater than its undivided  profits then on hand after  deducting its losses and
bad debts, as defined by applicable regulations.  At December 31, 2001, the Bank
had  approximately  $26,586  in  undivided  profits  legally  available  for the
payments of dividends.


                                       55
<PAGE>

In addition,  the Federal  Reserve Board and the OCC are authorized to determine
under certain  circumstances that the payment of dividends would be an unsafe or
unsound practice and to prohibit payment of such dividends.  The Federal Reserve
Board has indicated that banking  organizations  should  generally pay dividends
only out of current operating earnings.

There are also  statutory  limits on the transfer of funds to the Company by its
banking subsidiary,  whether in the form of loans or other extensions of credit,
investments  or  assets  purchases.  Such  transfer  by the Bank to the  Company
generally is limited in amount to 10% of the Bank's capital and surplus,  or 20%
in the aggregate.  Furthermore, such loans and extensions of credit are required
to be collateralized in specific amounts.

NOTE K:  BENEFIT PLANS

The Company has a  noncontributory  defined  benefit  pension plan  covering the
majority of its  employees and  retirees.  The Company also provides  health and
life  insurance  benefits for eligible  retired  employees and  dependents.  The
following table shows the funded status of the Company's  Plans  reconciled with
amounts reported in the Company's consolidated statements of condition,  and the
assumptions  used in  determining  the  actuarial  present  value of the benefit
obligations:

Financial Accounting  Standards Board Statement No. 87 ("SFAS 87"),  "Employers'
Accounting  for  Pensions"  requires  recognition  in the  balance  sheet  of an
additional  minimum  liability  for pension plans with  accumulated  benefits in
excess of plan assets. At December 31, 2001, the accumulated  benefit obligation
exceeded the plan assets  resulting in the recognition of an additional  minimum
pension  liability of $5,016,  which was  recorded as a charge to  shareholders'
equity, net of tax benefit of $1,966.

The defined  benefit pension plan maintained by the Bank is authorized to invest
up to 10% of the fair  value of its total  assets in common  stock of  Community
Bank  System,  Inc. At December  31,  2001 and 2000,  the plan holds  45,500 and
46,500 shares, respectively, of the sponsor Company common stock.

Health  care cost  assumptions  have no effect on the amounts  reported  for the
health  care  plans,   since  the  plan  changed  to  a  fixed  dollar  employee
contribution plan in 1999.

The  Company  also  has an  Employee  Savings  and  Retirement  Plan,  which  is
administered  by the Trust  Department  of  Community  Bank,  N. A. The Employee
Savings and Retirement  Plan includes  Section  401(k) and Thrift  provisions as
defined under the Internal  Revenue  Code.  Company  contributions  to the trust
amounted to $979, $838, and $830 in 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively.

The Company has deferred compensation agreements with several current and former
executives  and  officers  whereby  monthly  payments  are to be  provided  upon
retirement over periods ranging from ten to twenty-five years. Additionally,  in
connection  with the  acquisition  of First  Liberty,  the  Company  maintains a
Supplemental  Retirement  Plan (the  Plan)  for  certain  of the  First  Liberty
executive  officers and directors which provides that the participants  share in
the rights to the death  benefits of a split-dollar  life  insurance  policy and
provides for additional  compensation to the  participants,  equal to any income
tax consequences  related to the Plan until retirement.  Additional benefits for
certain participants in the Plan are calculated as (1) the amount of the benefit
obligation  increased  or  decreased  each year by an amount equal to the annual
BOLI policy  earnings less the Company's  cost of funds or (2) the amount of the
benefit obligation  increased by interest rates of between 11%-12%.  To fund the
annual premium on the  split-dollar  policy and mitigate the  obligations  under
this Plan, the Company has purchased a bank owned life  insurance  (BOLI) policy
on the participants' lives.

Expense  recognized  during  2001,  2000,  and  1999  related  to  the  deferred
compensation and supplemental  retirement plans amounted to approximately  $469,
$328, and $367, respectively. The Company has recorded a liability of $2,796 and
$1,985 at December  31, 2001 and 2000,  respectively.  At December  31, 2001 and
2000, the Company had $3,670 and $3,509,  respectively,  in cash surrender value
of BOLI.

The  Company  has a Stock  Balance  Plan  for  non-employee  directors  who have
completed  six months of service.  The Plan is a  nonqualified,  noncontributory
defined benefit plan. The Plan provides benefits for periods of service prior to
January  1,  1996  based  on  a  predetermined  formula.   Amounts  credited  to
participant  accounts for all creditable service after January 1, 1996 are based
on performance of the Company's  stock.  Participants  become fully vested after
six years of service.  Benefits  are payable in the form of stock of the Company
on the first of the month following the later of a participant's  disassociation
from the Board or attainment of age 70.  Unrecognized prior service cost of $381
at December 31, 2001 is being  amortized  over 8 years.  Expense  related to the
Plan  recognized  in  2001,  2000,  and  1999,  approximated  $4,  $9,  and $20,
respectively.  The accrued pension liability was approximately  $283 and $349 at
December  31, 2001 and 2000,  respectively.  The net  periodic  pension cost was
calculated using discount rates of 6.75% and 7.00% and stock price  appreciation
of 10.00% and 6.00% in 2001 and 2000, respectively.

NOTE L:  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS

The Company has  long-term,  stock-based  incentive  compensation  programs  for
directors,  officers,  and key  employees,  including  incentive  stock  options
(ISO's),  restricted stock awards (RSA's),  nonqualified stock options (NQSO's),
warrants,  retroactive stock appreciation  rights, and discounted  options.  The
Company has  authorized  the grant of options for up to 2,537,000  shares of the
Company's  common stock.  All options granted under these programs have ten-year
terms  and  vest  and  become  fully  exercisable  at the end of five  years  of
continued  employment.  In addition,  The Company grants options as an offset to
its Stock Balance Plan for non-employee directors (See Note K). The options vest
immediately and expire at the date the director retires. Activity in these plans
for 2001, 2000, and 1999 was as follows:

Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards  (SFAS) No. 123,  "Accounting  for
Stock-Based  Compensation," provides for a fair-value-based method of accounting
for stock  compensation  plans with  employees  and others.  Alternatively,  the
statement   allows  that  entities  may  continue  to  account  for  stock-based
compensation plans in accordance with Accounting  Principles Board (APB) Opinion
No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," with disclosure of pro forma
amounts reflecting the difference between cost charged to operations pursuant to
APB No. 25 and compensation  cost that would have been charged to operations had
SFAS No. 123 been applied. The Company has elected to continue following APB No.
25 in accounting  for its  stock-based  compensation  plans.  Application of the
fair-value based  accounting  provision of SFAS No. 123 results in the following
pro forma amounts of net income and earnings per share:

============================================================

The fair  value of these  options  was  estimated  at the date of grant  using a
Black-Scholes   options  pricing  model  with  the  following  weighted  average
assumptions for 2001, 2000 and 1999:  risk-free interest rates by grant of 5.11%
during  2001,  4.65% to 6.93%  during  2000,  and  4.65% to 5.78%  during  1999;
dividend yields of 3.00% during 2001, 2000 and 1999;  volatility  factors of the
expected market price of the Company's  common stock of 28.14% for 2001,  29.15%
for 2000 and 30.78% for 1999; and a weighted-average expected life of the option
of 7.02 years in 2001, 7.11 in 2000 and 6.70 for 1999.

For the  purposes  of pro forma  disclosures,  the  estimated  fair value of the
options is amortized to expense over the options' vesting period. Therefore, the
preceding results are not likely to be representative of the effects on reported
net income for future years due to additional years of vesting.  At December 31,
2001 the weighted average  information for outstanding and exercisable shares is

Directors  may elect to defer all or a portion  of their  director  fees until a
certain  distribution  date  pursuant  to  a  Deferred  Compensation  Plan.  The
administrator  has  established an account for each  participating  director and
credits to such account the number of shares of Company common stock which would
have been  purchased  with the  director  fees and shares equal to the amount of
dividends which would have been received. On the distribution date, the director
shall be entitled to receive  either shares of the Company common stock equal to
the number of shares accumulated or at the Company's election, cash equal to the
fair value of the number of shares accumulated. As of December 31, 2001 and 2000
there were 31,473 and 25,239 shares credited to participant accounts,  for which
a liability of $933 and $769 was accrued,  respectively.  The expense recognized
under this plan for the years ended  December 31, 2001,  2000 and 1999 was $164,
$130, and $146, respectively.

NOTE N:  COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND RESTRICTIONS

The Company is a party to financial instruments with  off-balance-sheet  risk in
the normal  course of business  to meet the  financing  needs of its  customers.
These financial  instruments  consist primarily of commitments to extend credit,
which  involve,  to varying  degrees,  elements  of credit risk in excess of the
amount  recognized in the statement of condition.  The contract  amount of those
commitments to extend credit  reflects the extent of involvement the Company has
in this  particular  class of financial  instrument.  The Company's  exposure to
credit loss in the event of  nonperformance  by the other party to the financial
instrument for  commitments  to extend credit is represented by the  contractual
amount of the  instrument.  The Company uses the same credit  policies in making
commitments as it does for on-balance-sheet instruments.

Financial  instruments  whose  contract  amounts  represent  credit  risk are as
follows at December 31:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                         2001         2000
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Financial instruments whose contract
  amounts represent credit risk at December 31:
     Letters of credit                                 $ 18,059     $ 18,682
     Commitments to make or purchase loans
        or to extend credit on lines of credit          336,218      226,285
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          Total                                        $354,277     $244,967
================================================================================

The fair value of these financial instruments is not significant.

Commitments  to extend  credit are  agreements  to lend to a customer as long as
there is no violation of any condition established in the contract.  Commitments
generally  have fixed  expiration  dates or other  termination  clauses  and may
require  payment of a fee. Since some of the  commitments are expected to expire
without  being  drawn  upon,  the total  commitment  amounts do not  necessarily
represent future cash requirements. The Company evaluated each customer's credit
worthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed
necessary by the Company  upon  extension  of credit,  is based on  management's
credit  evaluation  of the  customer.  Collateral  held  varies but may  include
residential real estate,  income-producing  commercial properties,  and personal
property. The Company has unused lines of credit totaling $3,900 at December 31,
2001  and  2000.  The  Company  has  additional  unused  borrowing  capacity  of
approximately $260,000 through collateralized transactions with the Federal Home
Loan Bank.

The Company is required to maintain a reserve  balance,  as  established  by the
Federal  Reserve Bank of New York.  The required  average  total reserve for the
14-day maintenance  period ended December 31, 2001 was $34,063,  of which $2,000
was  required to be on deposit with the Federal  Reserve  Bank of New York.  The
remaining $32,063 was represented by cash on hand.

NOTE O:  LEASES

The Company leases  buildings and office space under  agreements  that expire in
various years. Rental expense included in operating expenses amounted to $1,620,
$1,014 and $991 in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The future minimum rental
commitments as of December 31, 2001 for all noncancelleable operating leases are
as follows:

2002             $ 1,483
2003               1,341
2004               1,127
2005                 750
2006                 627
Thereafter         2,555

NOTE P:  REGULATORY MATTERS

The Bank is subject to various regulatory capital  requirements  administered by
the federal banking agencies.  Failure to meet minimum capital  requirements can
initiate  certain  mandatory and possibly  additional  discretionary  actions by
regulators  that,  if  undertaken,  could have a direct  material  effect on the
Bank's  financial   statements.   Under  capital  adequacy  guidelines  and  the
regulatory  framework for prompt corrective  action, the Bank must meet specific
capital  guidelines  that involve  quantitative  measures of the Bank's  assets,
liabilities,  and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory
accounting  practices.  The Bank's capital amounts and  classification  are also
subject to  qualitative  judgments  by the  regulators  about  components,  risk
weightings, and other factors.

Quantitative  measures  established  by  regulation to ensure  capital  adequacy
require the Bank to maintain  minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the table
below)  of  total  and  Tier  I  capital  (as  defined  in the  regulations)  to
risk-weighted assets (as defined), and of Tier I capital (as defined) to average
assets (as defined).  Management believes,  as of December 31, 2001 and December
31, 2000, that the Bank meets all capital  adequacy  requirements to which it is
subject  and is "well  capitalized"  under the  regulatory  framework  of prompt
corrective  action.  To be  categorized  as "well  capitalized,"  the Bank  must
maintain minimum total risk-based, Tier I risk-based, and Tier I leverage ratios
as set forth in the following table.

On November  16, 2001 and  December 12, 2001 the Company  issued  1,200,000  and
108,800 shares of common stock at a price of $26.35.  Proceeds from the issuance
of common stock, net of issuance costs were $32,064.

On February  21,  1995,  the Company  adopted a  Stockholder  Protection  Rights
Agreement  and  declared a dividend of one right for each  outstanding  share of
common stock.  The rights can only be exercised  when an individual or group has
acquired or attempts to acquire 15% or more of the Company's  common  stock,  if
such action the Board of Directors  believes is not in the best  interest of the
stockholders. Each right then entitles the holder to acquire common stock having
a market value  equivalent to two times the stated  exercise  price.  The rights
expire in  February  2005 and may be redeemed by the Company in whole at a price
of $.01 per right.

of cash flows present fairly, in all material  respects,  the financial position
of Community Bank System,  Inc. and  Subsidiaries at December 31, 2001 and 2000,
and the results of their  operations  and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended  December  31, 2001,  in  conformity  with  accounting
principles  generally accepted in the United States of America.  These financial
statements   are  the   responsibility   of  the   Company's   management;   our
responsibility  is to express an opinion on these financial  statements based on
our audits.  We conducted  our audits of these  statements  in  accordance  with
auditing  standards  generally  accepted in the United States of America,  which
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable  assurance about
whether the financial  statements  are free of material  misstatement.  An audit
includes  examining,  on a test  basis,  evidence  supporting  the  amounts  and
disclosures in the financial  statements,  assessing the  accounting  principles
used and  significant  estimates made by management,  and evaluating the overall
financial  statement  presentation.   We  believe  that  our  audits  provide  a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

(1) The 3rd quarter 10Q  previously  netted  reported  prepayment  penalties  of
$2,659  incurred  on  the  early  retirement  of  long-term  borrowings  against
investment  security  gain  (loss),  net. The 3rd quarter  information  has been
restated to reflect these penalties as an extraordinary loss, net of tax benefit
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  The effect of this
restatement  was to increase  amounts  previously  reported  for other income by
$2,659, decrease income before extraordinary item by $834 and increase basic and
diluted  earnings  per share  before  extraordinary  item by $.13.  There was no
impact on net  income as  previously  reported,  nor any effect on cash flows or
financial condition.
