<P align=center><B><FONT face=serif size=2>PART I</FONT></B></P>

<P align=justify><B><FONT face=serif size=2>Item 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Business Overview. </FONT></B></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>Albemarle Corporation was incorporated in Virginia in 1993. Our principal executive offices are located at 330 South Fourth Street, Richmond, Virginia 23219, and our principal operations offices are located at 451 Florida Street, Baton Rouge, Louisiana 70801. Unless the context otherwise indicates, the terms &#147;Albemarle,&#148; &#147;we,&#148; &#147;us,&#148; &#147;our&#148; or &#147;the company&#148; mean Albemarle Corporation and our consolidated subsidiaries. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>We are a leading global developer, manufacturer and marketer of highly-engineered specialty chemicals. Our products and services enhance the value of our customers&#146; end-products by improving performance, providing essential product attributes, lowering cost and simplifying processing.

We serve more than 3,400 customers in over 100 countries. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><B><FONT face=serif size=2>Business Segments </FONT></B></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>Our operations are managed and reported as three operating segments: Polymer Additives, Catalysts and Fine Chemicals. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT face=serif></FONT><FONT face=serif size=2><FONT size=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT>For financial information regarding our operating segments, including revenues generated for each of the last three fiscal years from each of the product categories included in our operating segments, and geographic areas, see Note 19, &#147;Operating Segments and Geographic Area Information&#148; to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 beginning on <FONT size=2>page 37.</FONT> </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><B><FONT face=serif size=2>Polymer Additives </FONT></B></P>

<P align=justify><FONT face=serif size=2><FONT size=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT>Our Polymer Additives segment consists of two product categories: flame retardants and stabilizers and curatives. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I><FONT face=serif size=2>Flame Retardants. </FONT></I></B><FONT face=serif size=2>Our flame retardants help materials in a wide variety of finished products meet fire-safety requirements. Some of the products that benefit from our flame retardants include plastic enclosures for consumer electronics, printed circuit boards, wire and cable, electrical connectors, foam seating in furniture and automobiles and textiles. We compete in all of the major flame retardant markets: brominated, mineral and phosphorus. Our brominated flame retardants include products such as Saytex</FONT><SUP><FONT face=serif size=2>&#174;</FONT></SUP><FONT face=serif size=2> and Pyro-Chek</FONT><SUP><FONT face=serif size=2>&#174;</FONT></SUP><FONT face=serif size=2>, our mineral-based flame retardants include products such as Martinal</FONT><SUP><FONT face=serif size=2>&#174;</FONT></SUP><FONT face=serif size=2> and Magnifin</FONT><SUP><FONT face=serif
size=2>&#174;</FONT></SUP><FONT face=serif size=2> and our phosphorus-based flame retardants include products such as Antiblaze</FONT><SUP><FONT face=serif size=2>&#174;</FONT></SUP><FONT face=serif size=2> and Ncendx</FONT><SUP><FONT face=serif size=2>&#174;</FONT></SUP><FONT face=serif size=2>. Our strategy is to have a broad range of chemistries applicable to each major flame retardant application. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I><FONT face=serif size=2>Stabilizers and Curatives. </FONT></I></B><FONT face=serif size=2>We produce plastic and other additives, such as curatives, antioxidants and stabilizers, which are often specially developed and formulated for a customer&#146;s specific manufacturing requirements. Our plastic additives products include curatives for polyurethane and epoxy system polymerization, as well as for ultraviolet curing of various inks and coatings. This business also produces antioxidants and stabilizers to improve the performance integrity of thermoplastic resins. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>Our Ethacure</FONT><SUP><FONT face=serif size=2>&#174;</FONT></SUP><FONT face=serif size=2> curatives are used in cast elastomers, coatings, reaction injection molding (RIM) and specialty adhesives that are incorporated into products such as wheels, tires and rollers. Our line of Ethanox</FONT><SUP><FONT face=serif size=2>&#174; </FONT></SUP><FONT face=serif size=2>antioxidants is used by manufacturers of polyolefins to maintain physical properties during the manufacturing process, including the color of the final product. These antioxidants are found in applications such as slit film, wire and cable, food packaging and pipes. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>We also produce antioxidants used in fuels and lubricants. Our line of Ethanox</FONT><SUP><FONT face=serif size=2>&#174;</FONT></SUP><FONT face=serif size=2> fuel and lubricant antioxidants are used by refiners and fuel marketers to extend fuel storage life and protect fuel systems, and by oil marketers and lubricant manufacturers to extend the useful life of lubricating oils, fluids and greases used in engines and various types of machinery.</FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>Our joint venture, Stannica LLC, produces organic and inorganic tin intermediates used as a key raw material in the production of tin based PVC heat stabilizers. Tin stabilizers are used in the processing of rigid (pipe, window profiles, siding, fencing) and some flexible (packaging) PVC applications. PVC heat stabilizers help prevent the thermal degradation of PVC resins during periods of elevated temperature exposure, such as during processing, and help extend the useful life of finished products.</FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT face=serif size=2><FONT size=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><B><I>Customers </I></B></FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>The Polymer Additives segment offers more than 70 products to a variety of end-markets. We sell our products mostly to chemical manufacturers and processors, such as polymer resin suppliers, lubricant manufacturers, refiners and other specialty chemical companies. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>Sales of polymer additives are growing rapidly in Asia due to the underlying growth in consumer demand and the shift of the production of consumer electronics from the United States and Europe to Asia. In response to this development, we have established a sales and marketing network in China, Japan, Korea and Singapore with products sourced from the United States, Europe and the Middle East. In addition, we have joint venture manufacturing sites in China. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>A number of customers of our Polymer Additives segment manufacture products for cyclical industries, including the consumer electronics, building and construction, and automotive industries. As a result, demand from our customers in such industries is also cyclical. However, because our Polymer Additives products are used in many different industries and for a wide variety of uses, there is little seasonal variation in revenues or earnings, except with respect to certain consumer electronics-related flame retardants. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT face=serif size=2><FONT size=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><B><I>Competition </I></B></FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>The markets served by our Polymer Additives segment are highly competitive. We invest in research and development, product and process improvements and specialized customer services in order to compete effectively in the Polymer Additives marketplace. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>Competition also arises from the substitution of different polymers in end-products in an effort to reduce costs or change product qualities. For flame retardants, competition can be introduced from alternative chemistries, which has caused us to expand our product portfolio to include bromine, phosphorus and mineral chemistries that are common in over 80% of end uses today. For other additives, competition is introduced by low-cost antioxidant suppliers. We have begun to offer our basic products from lower cost sources, and have pursued new blending technology to produce better, more easily processed forms of antioxidant blends. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>Our most significant competitors in the brominated flame retardant business are Chemtura Corporation and Israel Chemicals Ltd. Industrial Products division, or Israel Chemicals, our most significant competitor in the phosphorus-based flame retardant business is Supresta LLC. Our competitors in the mineral-based flame retardants business are Almatis, Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co., Ltd and Nabaltec GmbH. Our most significant competitors in the plastic additives business are Ciba Specialty Chemicals, Akzo Nobel and Rohm and Haas. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT face=serif size=2><FONT size=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><B><I>Raw Materials and Significant Supply Contracts </I></B></FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>The major raw materials we use in our Polymer Additives operations are bromine, bisphenol-A and phenol, caustic soda, phosphorus oxychloride, aluminum trihydrate, polystyrene, isobutylene and phosphorous derivatives, most of which are readily available from numerous independent suppliers and are purchased under contracts at prices we believe are competitive. The cost of raw materials is generally based on market prices, although we may use contracts with price caps or other tools, as appropriate, to mitigate price volatility. Many of our customers operate under long-term supply contracts that provide for either the pass-through of raw material and energy cost changes, or pricing based on short-term &#147;tenders&#148; in which changing market conditions are quickly reflected in the pricing of the finished product. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>The bromine we use in our Polymer Additives segment comes from our brine reserves in Arkansas, which are supported by an active brine rights leasing program. We believe that we have in excess of 50 years of proven bromine reserves in Arkansas. In addition, through our 50% interest in Jordan Bromine Company Limited, or JBC, a consolidated joint venture with operations in Safi, Jordan, we produce bromine from the Dead Sea. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>Our subsidiary, Martinswerk GmbH, has certain contracts that require it to purchase certain minimum annual quantities of aluminum trihydrate from its suppliers. Our annual requirements for aluminum trihydrate currently exceed these minimum purchase requirements. We also entered into a range of phosphorus derivative supply agreements with Rhodia S.A. as part of the acquisition of the Rhodia polyurethane flame retardants business. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><B><FONT face=serif size=2>Catalysts </FONT></B></P>

<P align=justify><FONT face=serif size=2><FONT size=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT>Our Catalysts segment includes refinery catalysts and polyolefin catalysts product categories. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I><FONT face=serif size=2>Refinery Catalysts. </FONT></I></B><FONT face=serif size=2>Our two main catalysts product lines are hydroprocessing, or HPC, catalysts, and fluidized catalytic cracking, or FCC, catalysts and additives. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>HPC catalysts are primarily used to reduce the quantity of sulfur and other impurities in petroleum products as well as to convert heavy feedstock into lighter, more valuable products. FCC catalysts assist in the cracking of petroleum streams into derivative, higher-</FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT face=serif size=2>value products such as fuels and petrochemical feedstock. Our FCC additives can be used to remove sulfur in gasoline and to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide in FCC units, to increase LPG olefins yield and to boost octane in gasoline. We offer more than 90 different HPC catalysts products and more than 70 different FCC catalysts and additives products to our customers. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I><FONT face=serif size=2>Polyolefin Catalysts</FONT></I></B><I><FONT face=serif size=2>. </FONT></I><FONT face=serif size=2>We manufacture aluminum- and magnesium-alkyls, which are used as co-catalysts in the production of polyolefins, such as polypropylene and polyethylene used in plastic products, elastomers, alpha olefins, such as hexene, octene and decene, and organotin heat stabilizers and in the preparation of organic intermediates. We also produce metallocene/single-site catalysts, which aid in the development and production of new polymers that increase impact strength, clarity and melt characteristics of plastic films. We are continuing to build on our organometallics base and to expand the portfolio of products and capabilities we offer our customers. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT face=serif size=2><FONT size=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><B><I>Customers </I></B></FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>The customers of our Catalysts segment include multinational corporations such as ExxonMobil Corporation, Royal Dutch Petroleum Company and ChevronTexaco Corporation; independent petroleum refining companies such as Valero Energy Corporation and Tesoro Petroleum Corporation; and national petroleum refining companies such as Saudi Aramco Mobil Refinery Company Ltd., Petr&#243;leo Brasileiro S.A. and Petr&#243;leos Mexicanos. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>We estimate that there are currently approximately 450 FCC units being operated globally, each of which requires a constant supply of FCC catalysts. In addition, we estimate that there are approximately 2,000 HPC units being operated globally, each of which typically requires replacement HPC catalysts once every one to three years. We believe that our existing relationships with global petroleum refiners developed by our other business segments present opportunities to grow the market share of our new refinery catalysts business. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT face=serif size=2><FONT size=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><B><I>Competition </I></B></FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>In the Catalysts segment, HPC and FCC catalysts competition is primarily from major catalysts companies. Our major competitors in the HPC catalysts market are Criterion Catalysts and Technologies and W.R. Grace &amp; Co./Advanced Refining Technologies, and our major competitors in the FCC catalysts market are W.R. Grace &amp; Co. and Engelhard Corporation. Some of the major catalysts companies have alliances with global major refiners to facilitate new product development and introduction. Our major competitors in the polyolefin market include Akzo Nobel N.V., Axens NV, Basell Service Company B.V., Chemtura Corporation, Tosoh Corporation, Univation Technologies LLC and W.R. Grace &amp; Co. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>We seek to enhance our competitive position by developing product and process improvements and specialized customer services.

The cost of raw materials is generally based on market prices, although we may use contracts with price caps or other tools, as appropriate, to mitigate price volatility. Certain critical raw materials may nevertheless be subject to significant volatility. For example, molybdenum prices increased more than four-fold in 2004 and remained at over</FONT><B><FONT face=sans-serif size=2> </FONT></B><FONT face=serif size=2>600% of the 10-year average in 2005. Our profitability may be reduced if we are unable to pass along such price increases to our customers. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><B><FONT face=serif size=2>Fine Chemicals </FONT></B></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>Our Fine Chemicals segment consists of two product categories: performance chemicals and fine chemistry services and intermediates. </FONT></P>

Our products include orthoalkylated anilines used in the acetanilide family of pre-emergent herbicides used with corn, soybeans and other crops and methyl bromide, which is used as a soil fumigant. We also manufacture and supply a variety of custom chemical intermediates for the agricultural industry. </FONT><FONT face=sans-serif size=2></FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>In recent years, the market for methyl bromide has changed significantly, driven by the Montreal Protocol of 1990 and related regulation prompted by findings regarding the chemical's potential to deplete the ozone layer. Methyl bromide is injected into the soil by end users before planting to eliminate bacteria, nematodes, fungus and weeds. Methyl bromide is used on high-value crops, such as strawberries, tomatoes, melons and peppers. </FONT><FONT face=sans-serif size=2></FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>Current regulations allow us to continue to sell methyl bromide into our current markets through 2006 with a reduction allowance for critical uses of 11% from our 2005 allowance amount. In accordance with the Montreal Protocol and the U.S. Clean Air Act, completion of the phase-out of methyl bromide as a fumigant in the United States, Western Europe and Japan took effect in 2005. Methyl bromide, however, can continue to be used for "critical uses" where there are no other alternatives. Growers submit applications on a yearly basis detailing the amount of methyl bromide they will need for critical uses. Once approved by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or the EPA, the United States submits the application for approval by the parties to the Montreal Protocol. The critical use process is done annually and will continue until feasible alternatives are available. Certain other markets for methyl bromide, including quarantine and
pre-shipment and chemical intermediate uses, are not restricted by the Montreal Protocol. </FONT><FONT face=sans-serif size=2></FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>The Fine Chemicals segment manufactures more than 100 products, which are used in a variety of end-markets. Sales of products and services are mostly to chemical manufacturers and processors, including pharmaceutical, agricultural, drilling, water treatment and photographic companies, and to other specialty chemical companies. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>Pricing for many of our fine chemicals is based upon negotiation with customers. The critical factors that affect prices are the level of technology differentiation we provide, the maturity of the product and the level of assistance required to bring a new product through a customer&#146;s developmental process. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT face=serif size=2><FONT size=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><B><I>Competition </I></B></FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>Competition in the Fine Chemicals segment is intense and varies within each of our different product groups. In the bromine-based products groups, we primarily compete with two other integrated global bromine producers, Chemtura Corporation and Israel Chemicals. In pharmaceutical bulk actives (</FONT><I><FONT face=serif size=2>i.e</FONT></I><FONT face=serif size=2>. ibuprofen and propofol), we primarily compete with a few major Western competitors, such as BASF Corporation, AstraZeneca PLC, Clariant Ltd. and Cilag AG; however, there is increasing competition from Asian sources. We are seeking to differentiate ourselves from our competitors by developing new innovative products, offering cost reductions and enhancing the services that we offer. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>The major raw materials we use in our Fine Chemicals operations include potassium chloride, chlorine, ammonia, aluminum chloride, alpha olefins, methyl amines and propylene, most of which are readily available from numerous independent suppliers. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>The bromine that we use in our Fine Chemicals segment comes from three primary sources, Arkansas, Jordan and Israel Chemicals. The Arkansas brine reserves are supported by an active brine rights leasing program, where we believe that we have in excess of 50 years of proven bromine reserves. In addition, through our 50% interest in JBC, a consolidated joint venture with operations in Safi, Jordan, we produce bromine from the Dead Sea, which has unlimited reserves. Finally, we purchase bromine used in our facility in Thann, France from Israel Chemicals pursuant to a long-term contract.</FONT></P>

<P align=justify><B><FONT face=serif size=2>Research and Development </FONT></B></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>We believe that in order to maintain our margins and remain competitive, we must continually invest in research and development, product and process improvements and specialized customer services. Through research and development, we continue to seek increased margins by introducing value-added products and processes based on proprietary technologies. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>Our research and development efforts support each of our business segments. The focus of research in Polymer Additives is divided among new and improved flame retardants, plastic and other additives and blends, and curing agents. Flame retardant research is focused primarily on developing new flame retardants and improving existing flame retardants to meet higher performance requirements required by today&#146;s polymer producers, formulators, and original equipment manufacturers. Plastic and other additives research is focused primarily on developing improved capabilities to deliver commodity and value added plastic and other additive blends to the polymer market. Curatives research is focused primarily on improving and extending our line of curing agents and formulations. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>Catalysts research is focused on the needs of both our refinery catalysts customers and our polyolefin catalysts customers. Refinery catalysts research is focused primarily on the development of more effective catalysts and related additives to produce clean fuels and to maximize the production of the highest value refined products. In the polyolefin area, we are focused primarily on developing catalysts, cocatalysts and finished catalysts systems to polymer producers to meet the market&#146;s demand for improved polyolefin polymers and elastomers. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>The primary focus of our Fine Chemicals research program is the development of efficient processes for the manufacture of chemical intermediates and actives for the pharmaceutical and agrichemical industries. Another area of research is the development of biocides for industrial and recreational water treatment and other applications, especially products based on bromine chemistry. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>We spent $41.7 million, $31.3 million and $18.4 million in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS, No. 2, &#147;Accounting for Research and Development Costs,&#148; in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, on research and development.

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>Our business is subject to a broad array of employee health and safety laws and regulations, including those under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, or OSHA. We also are subject to similar state laws and regulations, and foreign laws and regulations for our non-U.S. operations. We devote significant resources and have developed and implemented comprehensive programs to promote the health and safety of our employees. We maintain an active health, safety and environmental program. We finished 2005 with a company record low OHSA recordable injury rate/illness rate of 0.37. Over the past two years, our OSHA recordable injury incidence rate was in the top 10% of all chemical companies who are members of the American Chemistry Council, or the ACC. </FONT></P>

Our significant manufacturing presence and sales activities in the European Union would likely require us to incur significant additional compliance costs, including the hiring of additional employees to coordinate the additional reporting requirements, and may result in increases in the costs of raw materials we purchase and the products we sell. Increases in the costs of our products could result in a decrease in their overall demand.</FONT></P>

<P align=justify><B><FONT face=serif size=2>Environmental Regulation </FONT></B></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>We are subject to numerous foreign, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated properties. Ongoing compliance with such laws and regulations is an important consideration for us. Key aspects of our operations are subject to them, and we incur substantial capital and operating costs in our efforts to comply with them. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>Liabilities associated with the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances, as well as personal injury, property damages, or natural resource damages arising from the release of, or exposure to, such hazardous substances, may be imposed in many situations without regard to violations of laws or regulations or other fault, and may also be imposed jointly and severally (so that a responsible party may be held liable for more than its share of the losses involved, or even the entire loss). Such liabilities also may be imposed on many different entities with a relationship to the hazardous substances at issue, including, for example, entities that formerly owned or operated the property affected by the hazardous substances and entities that arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at the affected property, as well as entities that currently own or operate such property. We are subject to such laws, including the
federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as CERCLA or Superfund, in the United States, and similar foreign and state laws. Our management is actively involved in evaluating environmental matters and, based on information currently available to us, we have concluded that our outstanding environmental liabilities for unresolved waste sites currently known to us should not be material to operations. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>We record accruals for environmental and asset retirement obligation matters in accordance with the guidelines of the AICPA Statement of Position 96-1, &#147;Environmental Remediation Liabilities&#148; and SFAS No. 143 &#147; Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,&#148; respectively, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. Future developments, including developments affecting contractual indemnification rights we believe we have as well as contractual or other obligations that we may have, and increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations could require us to make additional unforeseen environmental expenditures. We cannot assure you that, as a result of former, current or future operations, there will not be some future impact on us relating to new regulations or additional environmental remediation or restoration liabilities.

<P align=justify><B><FONT face=serif size=2>Other Recent Acquisitions and Joint Ventures </FONT></B></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>Over the last three years, we have devoted a significant amount of resources to acquisitions, including the subsequent integration of acquired businesses, and to joint ventures. These acquisitions and joint ventures have expanded our base business, provided our customers with a wider array of products and presented new alternatives for discovery through additional chemistries. The following is a summary of our acquisitions and joint ventures during the last three years:</FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>On July 31, 2004, we completed the acquisition of the Akzo Nobel refinery catalysts business for approximately $763 million, including expenses, at applicable exchange rates. During 2004 and 2005, we increased the purchase price by approximately $23 million and $8 million, respectively, due primarily to payments to Akzo Nobel as part of the post-closing working capital adjustments. During 2005, significant progress was made in the determination of the final purchase price allocation versus the estimated allocation at December 31, 2004. However, none of the changes made to the December 31, 2004 allocation were material to our financial position or results of operations. As part of the acquisition, we acquired 50% ownership of non-consolidated joint ventures in Brazil (F&#225;brica Carioca de Catalisadores S.A.), Japan (Nippon Ketjen Co., Ltd,) and France (Eurecat S.A. with affiliates in the United States, Saudi Arabia and Italy).

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>Effective January 1, 2004, we acquired the business assets, customer lists and other intangibles of Taerim International Corporation for approximately $3 million and formed Albemarle Korea Corporation, which is located in Seoul, South Korea. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>On December 2, 2003, we acquired the bromine fine chemicals business of Atofina Chemicals, Inc. for approximately $8.5 million plus the assumption of certain liabilities. The acquisition included Atofina&#146;s production facility in Port de Bouc, France, as well as a long-term supply agreement with Atofina for certain fine chemicals. The acquisition provided us with flexibility in raw material supply and complemented our existing network of bromine-based facilities. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I><FONT face=serif size=2>You should consider carefully the following risks when reading the information, including the financial information, contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. </FONT></I></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I><FONT face=serif size=2>Our inability to pass through increases in costs and expenses for raw materials and energy, on a timely basis or at all, could have a material adverse effect on the margins of our products. </FONT></I></B></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>Our raw material and energy costs increased significantly in 2005. The increases were primarily driven by significantly tighter market conditions and major increases in pricing of basic building blocks for our products such as crude oil, chlorine and metals, including molybdenum, which is used in the refinery catalysts business. We generally attempt to pass changes in the prices of raw materials and energy to our customers, but we may be unable to or be delayed in doing so. Our inability to pass through price increases or any limitation or delay in our passing through price increases could adversely affect our margins. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>In addition to raising prices, raw material suppliers may extend lead times or limit supplies. Constraints on the supply or delivery of critical raw materials could disrupt production and adversely affect the performance of our business. </FONT></P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I><FONT face=serif size=2>We face competition from other specialty chemical companies, which places downward pressure on the prices and margins of our products. </FONT></I></B><FONT face=serif></FONT>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>We operate in a highly competitive marketplace, competing against a number of domestic and foreign specialty chemical producers. Competition is based on several key criteria, including product performance and quality, product price, product availability and security of supply, responsiveness of product development in cooperation with customers and customer service. Some of our competitors are larger than we are and may have greater financial resources. These competitors may also be able to maintain significantly greater operating and financial flexibility than we do. As a result, these competitors may be better able to withstand changes in conditions within our industry, changes in the prices of raw materials and energy and in general economic conditions. Additionally, competitors&#146; pricing decisions could compel us to decrease our prices, which could affect our margins and profitability adversely. Our ability to maintain or
increase our profitability is, and will continue to be, dependent upon our ability to offset decreases in the prices and margins of our products by improving production efficiency and volume, shifting to higher margin chemical products and improving existing products through innovation and research and development. If we are unable to do so or to otherwise maintain our competitive position, we could lose market share to our competitors. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT face=serif size=2><FONT size=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><B><I>Downturns in our customers&#146; cyclical industries could adversely affect our sales and profitability. </I></B></FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>Downturns in the businesses that use our specialty chemicals will adversely affect our sales. Many of our customers are in industries, including the electronics, building and construction, and automotive industries, that are cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions. Historically, downturns in general economic conditions have resulted in diminished product demand, excess manufacturing capacity and lower average selling prices, and we may experience similar problems in the future. A decline in economic conditions in our customers&#146; cyclical industries may have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I><FONT face=serif size=2>Our results are subject to fluctuation because of irregularities in the demand for our HPC catalysts and certain of our agrichemicals. </FONT></I></B></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>Our HPC catalysts are used by petroleum refiners in their processing units to reduce the quantity of sulfur and other impurities in petroleum products. The effectiveness of HPC catalysts diminishes with use, requiring the HPC catalysts to be replaced, on average, once every one to three years. The sales of our HPC catalysts, therefore, are largely dependent on the useful life cycle of the HPC catalysts in the processing units. Sales of our agrichemicals are also subject to fluctuation as demand varies depending on climate and other environmental conditions, which may prevent farming for extended periods. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT face=serif size=2><FONT size=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><B><I>Changes in our customers&#146; products can reduce the demand for our specialty chemicals. </I></B></FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>Our specialty chemicals are used for a broad range of applications by our customers. Changes in our customers&#146; products or processes may enable our customers to reduce consumption of the specialty chemicals that we produce or make our specialty chemicals unnecessary. Customers may also find alternative materials or processes that no longer require our products. For example, many of our flame retardants are incorporated into resin systems to enhance the flame retardancy of a particular polymer. Should a customer decide to use a different polymer due to price, performance or other considerations, we may not be able to supply a product that meets the customer&#146;s new requirements. Consequently, it is important that we develop new products to replace the sales of products that mature and decline in use. Our business, results of operations, cash flows and margins could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to manage
successfully the maturation of our existing products and the introduction of new products. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I><FONT face=serif size=2>Our research and development efforts may not succeed and our competitors may develop more effective or successful products. </FONT></I></B></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>The specialty chemicals industry is subject to periodic technological change and ongoing product improvements. In order to maintain our margins and remain competitive, we must successfully develop, manufacture and market new or improved products. As a result, we must commit substantial resources each year to research and development. Ongoing investments in research and development for future products could result in higher costs without a proportional increase in revenues. Additionally, for any new product program, there is a risk of technical or market failure in which case we may not be able to develop the new commercial products needed to maintain our competitive position or we may need to commit additional resources to new product development programs. Moreover, new products may have lower margins than the products they replace. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>We also expect competition to increase as our competitors develop and introduce new and enhanced products. For example, the Fine Chemicals segment is experiencing increased competition from large-scale producers of pharmachemicals, particularly from Asian sources. In our Catalysts segment, our petroleum refinery customers are processing crude oil feedstocks of declining quality, while at the same time operating under increasingly stringent regulations requiring the gasoline, diesel and other fuels they produce to contain fewer impurities, including sulfur. As a result, our petroleum refining customers are demanding more effective and efficient catalysts products, and the average life cycle for new catalysts products has declined. As new products enter the market, our products may become obsolete or competitors&#146; products may be marketed more effectively than our products. If we fail to develop new </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I><FONT face=serif size=2>We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, which may adversely affect our operating results and net income. </FONT></I></B></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif></FONT><FONT face=serif size=2>We conduct our business and incur costs in the local currency of most of the countries in which we operate. The financial condition and results of operations of each foreign operating subsidiary and joint venture are reported in the relevant local currency and then translated to U.S. dollars at the applicable currency exchange rate for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. Changes in exchange rates between these foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar will affect the recorded levels of our assets and liabilities as foreign assets and liabilities that are translated into U.S. dollars for presentation in our financial statements as well as our net sales, cost of goods sold and operating margins and could result in exchange losses. The main foreign currencies for which we have exchange rate fluctuation exposure are the European Union euro, Japanese yen and British pound sterling. Exchange rates
between these currencies and the U.S. dollar in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may do so in the future. Significant changes in these foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could also have an adverse effect on our ability to meet interest and principal payments on any foreign currency-denominated debt outstanding. In addition to currency translation risks, we incur currency transaction risks whenever one of our operating subsidiaries or joint ventures enters into either a purchase or a sales transaction using a different currency from the currency in which it receives revenues. Our operating results and net income may be affected by any volatility in currency exchange rates and our ability to manage effectively our currency transaction and translation risks. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT face=serif size=2><FONT size=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><B><I>We incur substantial costs in order to comply with extensive environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. </I></B></FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>In the jurisdictions in which we operate, we are subject to numerous federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated properties. Ongoing compliance with such laws and regulations is an important consideration for us and we incur substantial capital and operating costs in our compliance efforts. Environmental laws have become increasingly strict in recent years. We expect this trend to continue and anticipate that compliance will continue to require increased capital expenditures and operating costs. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I><FONT face=serif size=2>Violations of environmental, health and safety laws and regulations may subject us to fines, penalties and other liabilities and may require us to change certain business practices. </FONT></I></B></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>If we violate environmental, health and safety laws or regulations, in addition to being required to correct such violations, we can be held liable in administrative, civil or criminal proceedings for substantial fines and other sanctions could be imposed that could disrupt or limit our operations. Liabilities associated with the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances, as well as personal injury, property damages or natural resource damages arising out of such hazardous substances, may be imposed in many situations without regard to violations of laws or regulations or other fault, and may also be imposed jointly and severally (so that a responsible party may be held liable for more than its share of the losses involved, or even the entire loss). Such liabilities may also be imposed on many different entities with a relationship to the hazardous substances at issue, including, for example, entities that formerly owned or
operated the property affected and entities that arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at the affected property, as well as entities that currently own or operate such property. Such liabilities can be difficult to identify and the extent of any such liabilities can be difficult to predict. We use, and in the past have used, hazardous substances at many of our facilities, and we have in the past, and may in the future, be subject to claims relating to exposure to hazardous materials and the associated liabilities may be material. We also have generated, and continue to generate, hazardous wastes at a number of our facilities. Some of our facilities also have lengthy histories of manufacturing or other activities that have resulted in site contamination. We have also given contractual indemnities for environmental conditions relating to facilities we no longer own or operate. The nature of our business, including historical operations at our current and former facilities, exposes us to
risks of liability under these laws and regulations due to the production, storage, use, transportation and sale of materials that can cause contamination or personal injury if released into the environment. Additional information may arise in the future concerning the nature or extent of our liability with respect to identified sites, and additional sites may be identified for which we are alleged to be liable, that could cause us to materially increase our environmental accrual or the upper range of the costs we believe we could reasonably incur for such matters. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>At several of our properties where hazardous substances are known to exist (including some sites where hazardous substances are being investigated or remediated), we believe we are entitled to contractual indemnification from one or more former owners or operators; however, in the event we make a claim, the indemnifier may disagree with us. In 2004, we commenced an arbitration proceeding against Aventis S.A. concerning its obligations with respect to contamination at our Thann, France facility after Aventis refused to accept our demands for indemnification under the contract pursuant to which we acquired the facility. If our contractual indemnity is not upheld, our accrual and/or our costs for the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances could increase materially. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I><FONT face=serif size=2>Concern about the impact of some of our products on human health or the environment may lead to regulation, or reaction in our markets independent of regulation, that could reduce or eliminate markets for such products. </FONT></I></B></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>We manufacture or market a number of products that are or have been the subject of attention by regulatory authorities and environmental interest groups. For example, for many years we have marketed methyl bromide, a chemical that is particularly effective as a soil fumigant. In recent years, the market for methyl bromide has changed significantly, driven by the Montreal Protocol of 1990 and related regulation prompted by findings regarding the chemical's potential to deplete the ozone layer. Completion of the phase-out of methyl bromide as a fumigant took effect January 1, 2005 with continued use for critical uses allowed on an annual basis until feasible alternatives are available. </FONT><FONT face=sans-serif size=2></FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>In addition, there has been increased scrutiny by regulatory authorities and environmental interest groups of polybrominated diphenylethers, or PBDEs, which are used as flame retardants. We manufacture decabrom-PDE, a type of PBDE compound. In 2005, our net sales of decabrom-PDE were less than 3% of total net sales. Government regulation, if it occurs, or the threat of regulation, even if governmental regulation does not occur, may result in a decline in our net sales of decabrom-PDE.</FONT><FONT face=serif size=1> </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>Our products provide important performance attributes to our customers&#146; products. If a product fails to perform in a manner consistent with quality specifications or has a shorter useful life than guaranteed, a customer could seek replacement of the product or damages for costs incurred as a result of the product failing to perform as guaranteed. These risks apply to our refinery catalysts in particular because, in certain instances, we sell our refinery catalysts under agreements that contain limited performance and life cycle guarantees. A successful claim or series of claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could result in a loss of one or more customers. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I><FONT face=serif size=2>We will need a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control. </FONT></I></B></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>Our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled payments on our debt depends on a range of economic, competitive and business factors, many of which are outside our control. Based on an average interest rate of 5.17% at February 28, 2006 and outstanding borrowings at that date of $843.6 million, our annual interest expense would be $43.6 million. A change of 0.125% in the interest rate applicable to such borrowings would change our annualized interest expense by approximately $1.1 million. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt obligations, particularly if currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements are not realized on schedule or at all. If we are unable to service our debt obligations, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity, reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets or raise
additional equity. We may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness, sell assets or raise additional equity on commercially reasonable terms or at all, which could cause us to default on our obligations and impair our liquidity. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>Our senior credit agreement and the indenture governing the senior notes contain restrictive covenants.

S&amp;P has rated our senior unsecured long-term debt as BBB- and Moody&#146;s has rated our senior unsecured long-term debt as Baa3. S&amp;P and/or Moody&#146;s may, in the future, downgrade our ratings. The downgrading of our ratings or an increase in benchmark interest rates would result in an increase of our interest expense on borrowings under our senior credit agreement.

In addition, a large number of our employees are employed in countries in which employment laws provide greater bargaining or other rights to employees than the laws of the United States. Such employment rights require us to work collaboratively with the legal representatives of the employees to effect any changes to labor arrangements.

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>During 2005, we made no contributions to our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans. Our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans in aggregate were approximately 130% funded on an IRS funding basis as of December 31, 2005 and, as a result, there are no required cash contributions to the plans in 2006. However, the actual amount of contributions made subsequent to 2005 will depend upon asset returns, then-current interest rates, and a number of other factors. The amount we may elect or be required to contribute to our pension plans in the future may increase significantly. Specifically, if year-end accumulated obligations exceed assets, we may elect to make a voluntary contribution, over and above the minimum required, in order to avoid additional minimum liability charges to our balance sheet and consequent reductions to shareholders&#146; equity. These contributions could be substantial and would reduce the cash
available for our business. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I><FONT face=serif size=2>The occurrence or threat of extraordinary events, including domestic and international terrorist attacks, may disrupt our operations and decrease demand for our products. </FONT></I></B></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>Chemical-related assets may be at greater risk of future terrorist attacks than other possible targets in the United States, or U.S., and throughout the world. As an ACC member company, we have completed vulnerability assessments of our U.S. manufacturing locations and met the requirements of this industry standard. We have a corporate security standard and audit our facilities for compliance. Recent investments have been made to upgrade site security. However, federal legislation is under consideration that could impose new site security requirements, specifically on chemical manufacturing facilities, which may increase our overhead expenses. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>New federal regulations have already been adopted to increase the security of the transportation of hazardous chemicals in the United States. We believe we have met these requirements but additional federal and local regulations that limit the distribution of hazardous materials are being considered. We ship and receive materials that are classified as hazardous. Bans on movement of hazardous materials through cities like Washington, D.C. could affect the efficiency of our logistical operations. Broader restrictions on hazardous material movements could lead to additional investment to produce hazardous raw materials and change where and what products we manufacture. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>The occurrence of extraordinary events, including future terrorist attacks and the outbreak or escalation of hostilities, cannot be predicted, and their occurrence can be expected to continue to affect negatively the economy in general, and specifically the markets for our products. The resulting damage from a direct attack on our assets, or assets used by us, could include loss of life and property damage. In addition, available insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all of the damage incurred or, if available, may be prohibitively expensive. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><B><FONT face=serif size=2>Item 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Legal Proceedings. </FONT></B></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>On April 2, 2004, Albemarle Overseas Development Company, or AODC, one of our wholly owned subsidiaries, initiated a Request for Arbitration against Aventis S.A., the predecessor in interest to Sanofi Aventis, or Aventis, through the International Chamber of Commerce, International Court of Arbitration, Paris, France. The dispute arises out of a 1992 Stock Purchase Agreement, or Agreement, between AODC and a predecessor to Aventis under which 100% of the stock of Potasse et Produits Chimiques, S.A., now known as Albemarle PPC, or APPC, was acquired by AODC. The dispute relates to a chemical facility in Thann, France, owned by APPC, where the French government has required a detailed risk study of groundwater contamination, and in 2005 instructed APPC to conduct a number of additional tests and studies and take certain measures with respect to the containment of certain contamination at and the emission of certain materials from the
Thann facility. By reason of certain intervening assignments of rights, Albemarle France SAS, another wholly owned subsidiary of Albemarle Corporation, was substituted for ADOC as the party in interest in the arbitration. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>The Request for Arbitration requests indemnification by Aventis for certain costs incurred by APPC, in connection with any environmental claims of the French government for the APPC facility and a declaratory judgment as to the liability of Aventis under the Agreement for costs to be incurred in the future by APPC in connection with such claims. Under the terms of the Agreement, we believe that Aventis is obligated to indemnify AODC and APPC, and hold them harmless from certain claims, losses, damages, costs or any other present or prospective liabilities arising out of certain soil and groundwater contamination at the site in Thann. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>Arbitration hearings related to the question of liability took place in June 2005 and we currently expect a response from the arbitration panel in 2006. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>At this time, it is not possible to predict what additional studies or measures, if any, the French government may require since these matters are in the initial stages and environmental matters are subject to many uncertainties. We believe, however, that we are entitled to be fully indemnified by Aventis for all liabilities arising from these matters, but no assurance can be given that we will prevail in the arbitration. If we do not prevail in the arbitration and the government requires additional remediation, the costs of remediation could be significant.</FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>In addition, we are involved from time to time in legal proceedings of types regarded as common in our businesses, particularly administrative or judicial proceedings seeking remediation under environmental laws, such as Superfund, products liability and premises liability litigation. We maintain a financial accrual for these proceedings that includes defense costs and potential damages, as estimated by our general counsel. We also maintain insurance to mitigate certain of such risks.</FONT></P>

<P align=justify><B><FONT face=serif size=2>Changes in Reporting </FONT></B></P>

<P align=justify><I><FONT face=serif size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp; Segments </FONT></I></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>Our Polymer Additives segment is comprised of the flame retardants and stabilizers and curatives product areas. Our Catalysts segment is comprised of the refinery catalysts and polyolefin catalysts product areas. Our Fine Chemicals segment is comprised of the performance chemicals and fine chemistry services and intermediates product areas. Effective January 1, 2005, we revised the way we evaluate the performance of our segment results to reflect the manner in which the chief operating decision makers now review our three segments. We now include the operating results of our joint ventures termed &#147;equity in net income (losses) of unconsolidated investments&#148; along with our operating profit, which represents income before income taxes, minority interests, equity in net income (losses) of unconsolidated investments and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net and before interest and financing expenses and
other income (expenses), net. The change to segment income versus segment operating profit was brought about by the material effect of the refinery catalysts business joint ventures acquired in July 2004 on our consolidated operating results. Segment data continues to include intersegment transfers of raw materials at cost and foreign exchange transaction gains and losses, as well as allocations for certain corporate costs. Segment results including effective income tax rate calculations for years 2004 and 2003 have been reclassified to reflect the impact of the revisions. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>In addition, effective August 1, 2005, we began consolidating our 50% ownership interest in Jordan Bromine Company Limited, or JBC, a Jordanian-American joint venture company that manufactures and markets bromine and bromine derivatives products from raw materials extracted from the Dead Sea. We previously accounted for this investment on the equity basis. However, as a result of August 2005 amendments to the related joint venture agreement, our management concluded that consolidation accounting for this investment was appropriate under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. This change in accounting has no impact on our net income. Segment results for the seven months ended July 31, 2005 and years 2004 and 2003 were not restated for the impact of this change. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><I><FONT face=serif size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp; Other Income (Expenses), Net </FONT></I></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>Effective July 1, 2005 we reclassified our minority ownership interest in Stannica LLC from &#147;other income (expenses), net&#148; to a separate disclosure line entitled &#147;minority interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries&#148; in the consolidated statements of income. Reclassifications have been made herein for years 2004 and 2003 totaling ($5.1 million) and ($2.6 million), respectively, to reflect the change. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><B><FONT face=serif size=2>Overview and Outlook </FONT></B></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>We are a leading global developer, manufacturer and marketer of highly-engineered specialty chemicals. Our products and services enhance the value of our customers&#146; end-products by improving performance, providing essential product attributes, lowering cost and simplifying processing. We sell a highly diversified mix of products to a wide range of customers, including manufacturers of consumer electronics, building and construction materials, automotive parts, packaging, pharmachemicals and agrichemicals, and petroleum refiners. We believe that our commercial and geographic diversity, technical expertise, flexible, low-cost global manufacturing base, and experienced management team enable us to maintain leading market positions in those areas of the specialty chemicals industry in which we operate. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>Growth of our Polymer Additives segment is expected to be derived from increasing demand for electrical and electronic equipment, new construction and increasingly stringent fire-safety regulations in many countries around the world. Growth in our Catalysts segment is expected to be driven by increasing demand for petroleum products, generally deteriorating quality of crude oil feedstock and implementation of more stringent fuel quality requirements as a part of anti-pollution initiatives. The Fine Chemicals segment continues to benefit from the continued rapid pace of innovation and the introduction of new products, coupled with a movement by pharmaceutical companies to outsource certain research, product development and manufacturing functions. </FONT><B><FONT face=serif size=2></FONT></B></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><FONT face=serif size=2>Polymer Additives: </FONT></B><FONT face=serif size=2>Polymer Additives volumes were flat in 2005 after record growth in 2003 and 2004. We expect volumes in 2006 to meet or exceed those in 2005. We will continue our focus on restoring margins in this segment and will continue to drive price increases where warranted. We announced 5 to 10% price increases for brominated flame retardants effective April 1, 2006 and announced 12% mineral flame retardant increases effective the same date. Key raw materials needed to manufacture these products continue to rise, forcing us to raise prices to offset these costs.</FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>We expect that our technology center in Nanjing, China will be operational in 2006, allowing us to provide polymer additives technical customer support in the Asia Pacific region.

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>We will continue our efforts to educate manufacturers and the public about the safety and benefits of our flame retardants. In early 2006, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission mandated flammability standards for mattresses that could support greater demand for the use of flame retardants, depending on how manufacturers elect to flame retard their mattresses. In addition, various groups continue to evaluate the safety of brominated flame retardants and we intend to continue our support of sound scientific testing of these materials. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><FONT face=serif size=2>Catalysts</FONT></B><FONT face=serif size=2>: We expect HPC volumes to remain robust in 2006 as new diesel sulfur specifications go into effect mid-year. In addition, as oil prices remain elevated, refiners will use more sour crudes, which will require HPC catalysts to remove the metals and impurities, further driving demand for these catalysts. We have begun construction on our new HPC plant at Bayport, Texas, which is expected to be operational in late 2006. This plant will add 10,000 metric tons to our capacity.</FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>Our focus in FCC catalysts is on improving margins by driving price increases to support the value these products bring to the market. In 2005, we announced the first significant price increase for these catalysts in over ten years and will focus intently in 2006 on achieving these increases. We believe that this 20% price increase, along with announced surcharges, will help offset the continuing raw material and energy costs to manufacture these catalysts and will allow margin recovery and expansion for this key catalyst.</FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>We are focused on new product development in catalysts, and have introduced high-throughput experimentation to more rapidly test and develop new technologies. Our marketing and research groups are tightly aligned so we can continue to bring innovative technologies to the market. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>We will continue to explore new opportunities for our catalysts in the rapidly growing gas to liquids (GTL) and coal to liquids (CTL) markets, which remain viable as oil remains at historically high levels. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><FONT face=serif size=2>Fine Chemicals: </FONT></B><FONT face=serif size=2>We expect to continue the &#147;turnaround&#148; of our fine chemicals portfolio in 2006. We are implementing the announced shutdown of our seawater bromine facility in France, and will continue evaluating other assets as we seek to improve the margins in this segment. We are optimistic for the prospects of our single site plant in Orangeburg, South Carolina, that we recently converted into a multi-purpose asset, enabling us to take advantage of new products commercializing from our R&amp;D pipeline. We will continue to explore other similar ways to profitably redeploy assets where possible.</FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>In addition to an overall focus on margin improvement, our two strategic areas of focus in Fine Chemicals will be to maximize our bromine franchise value and to continue the growth of our fine chemistry services business. Our goal is to profitably grow our globally competitive, bromine and derivatives production network to serve all major bromine consuming products and markets. We will also continue our focus on developing our fine chemistry services business. Our new products pipeline in this business has approximately doubled in the last three years, allowing us to develop preferred outsourcing positions serving leading chemical innovators in diverse industries. We remain confident in continuing to generate growth in profitable niche products leveraged from this service business.</FONT><B><FONT face=serif size=2> </FONT></B></P>

<IMG src="albemarle_10k1x23x2.jpg" border=0> <BR>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>For 2005, our net sales were $2,107.5 million, an increase of $593.8 million, or 39%, from 2004. In our Polymer Additives segment, net sales were $797.8 million, up $71.5 million, or 10%. This increase was due to $73.0 million of higher pricing in flame retardants, which was offset, in part, by $26.1 million of lower shipments, $27.1 million of higher pricing in stabilizers and curatives, which was offset, in part, by $5.4 million of lower shipments, and the favorable impact of $3.0 million of foreign exchange. In our Catalysts&#146; segment, net sales were $737.6 million, up $454.2 million, or 160% primarily due to the July 2004 acquisition of the refinery catalysts business. In our Fine Chemicals segment, net sales were $572.1 million, up $68.0 million, or 13%, due to higher pricing and higher shipments of $36.9 million and $10.9 million, respectively, and the favorable impact of $2.6 million of foreign exchange in performance
chemicals and higher pricing and shipments of $10.3 million and $7.2 million, respectively, in fine chemistry services and intermediates.</FONT></P>

In our Polymer Additives segment, net sales were $726.3 million, up $178.8 million, or 33%. This increase was due to higher shipments and pricing of $109.9 million and $3.9 million, respectively, in flame retardants, higher shipments and pricing of $29.6 million and $11.2 million, respectively, in stabilizers and curatives and the favorable impact of $21.6 million of foreign exchange. In our Catalysts segment, net sales were $283.4 million, up $200.4 million, or 242%. This increase was primarily due to the acquisition of the refinery catalysts business. In our Fine Chemicals segment, net sales were $504.1 million, up $24.3 million, or 5%. This increase was primarily due to higher shipments of $26.3 million and the favorable impact of $1.2 million of foreign exchange in fine chemistry services and intermediates, which was offset, in
part, by lower pricing of $6.7 million. Net sales in our Fine Chemicals segment also increased as a result of the favorable impact of foreign exchange of $17.6 million and $1.2 million of higher pricing in performance chemicals, which was offset by $15.3 million of lower volumes primarily due to the impact of our exit from the detergent zeolite business in early 2004.</FONT></P>

Income taxes for 2005 benefited $5.6 million from the repatriation of overseas earnings under the provisions of the American Jobs Creaion Act of 2004, known as the Homeland Investment Act, and $6.7 million from foreign tax credits related to repatriation of high taxed earnings from foreign subsidiaries. In the fourth quarter of 2005, we determined that certain of our reported income tax accounts were overstated based on our detailed reviews. Accordingly, we recorded an income tax benefit of $7.6 million associated with the revaluation of deferred tax balances related to Netherlands income tax rate changes. In addition, the deferred income tax account, as recorded under Accounting Principles

The net impact of these two adjustments, amounting to an income tax benefit of $2.4 million, did not have a material effect on our reported financial position and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 or any prior periods presented. Income taxes for 2004 benefited from $1.4 million related to the reversal of certain income tax reserves and the net favorable effect of $1.1 million in adjustments associated with the reconciliation of certain tax accounts. Income taxes for 2003 included the favorable benefit of $7.5 million related to the revaluation of reserve requirements as the IRS closed audits related to tax years 1998 and 1999 as well as the impact of an income tax settlement with the IRS related to tax

</LI></UL>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>During 2005, we made changes to the assumptions related to the discount rate, the rate of compensation increase (for salary related plans) and the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits. We consider available information that we deem relevant when selecting each of these assumptions. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>In selecting the discount rate, consideration is given to fixed-income security yields, including high quality bonds (Moody&#146;s Aa and the International Index Company, or iBoxx, AA corporate bond rates), along with a yield curve applied to the payments we expect to make out of our retirement plans. The yield curve was produced for a universe containing U.S.-issued Aa-graded corporate bonds, all of which were non-callable, non-putable, and non-sinkable. For each plan, the discount rate was developed as the level equivalent rate that would produce the same present value as that using spot rates aligned with the projected benefit payments. At December 31, 2005, the weighted-average discount rate was reduced for the plans from 5.49% to 5.44% as a result of decreased yields for long-term high quality bonds. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>In estimating the expected return on plan assets, we consider past performance and future expectations for the types of investments held by the plan as well as the expected long-term allocation of plan assets to these investments. At December 31, 2005, the weighted-average expected rate of return on pension plan assets was reduced from 8.36% to 8.31% and there was no change in the weighted-average expected 7.00% return on other postretirement benefit plan assets. Our U.S. defined benefit plan for non-represented employees was closed to new participants effective March 31, 2004. We adopted a defined contribution pension plan for U.S. employees hired after March 31, 2004. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>In projecting the rate of compensation increase, we consider past experience in light of movements in inflation rates. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the assumed weighted-average rate of compensation increase was 2.82% and 2.53%, respectively, for the pension plans. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>In selecting the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits, we consider past performance and forecasts of future health care cost trends. At December 31, 2005, the previously assumed rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits for U.S. retirees was increased. The assumed health care cost trend rate for 2005 for pre-65 coverage was 9% per year, dropping by 1% per year to an ultimate rate of 5%, while the trend rate for post-65 coverage was 10% per year, dropping by 1% per year to an ultimate rate of 5%. The assumed health care cost trend rate for 2004 for pre-65 coverage was 9% per year, dropping by 1% per year to an ultimate rate of 6%, the trend rate for post-65 coverage was 11% per year, dropping by 1% per year to an ultimate rate of 6%. For 2006, the trend rate for pre-65 coverage is 9% per year, dropping by 1% per year to an ultimate rate of 5%; the trend rate for
post-65 coverage is 10% per year, dropping by 1% per year to an ultimate rate of 5%. The postretirement medical benefits provided to employees in the Netherlands who retire after August 2009 includes an assumed increase in benefits of 1.5% per year.</FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>The effect of a 1% increase in the U.S. health care cost trend rate would increase the total service and interest components by $0.043 million and would increase the benefit obligation by $0.553 million. A 1% decrease in the U.S. heath care cost trend rate would decrease the total service and interest components by $0.057 million and would decrease the benefit obligation by $0.714 million.</FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>A variance in the assumptions discussed above would have an impact on the projected benefit obligations, the accrued other postretirement benefit liabilities, and the annual net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost.

Our portion of the common stock offering sale, after the inclusion of 573,000 over-allotment shares requested and sold by our underwriters, which was completed on January 28, 2005, totaled 4,573,000 shares. The shares of common stock were offered and sold at a public offering price of $34.00 per share and the senior notes were offered and sold at a public offering price of 99.897% of par. We used the net proceeds from both of our offerings to repay the $450.0 million 364-day bridge loan that we incurred in connection with our acquisition of the refinery
catalysts business. </FONT></P>

<P align=left><B><FONT face=serif size=2>Safety and Environmental Matters </FONT></B></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>We are subject to federal, state, local and foreign requirements regulating the handling, manufacture and use of materials (some of which may be classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory agencies), the discharge of materials into the environment and the protection of the environment. To our knowledge, we are currently complying and expect to continue to comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws, regulations, statutes and ordinances. Compliance with existing federal, state, local and foreign environmental protection laws is not expected to have in the future a material effect on earnings or our competitive position, but increased legal or regulatory requirements could have an adverse effect on our results. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>Among other environmental requirements, we are subject to the federal Superfund law, and similar state laws, under which we may be designated as a potentially responsible party, or PRP, and may be liable for a share of the costs associated with cleaning up various hazardous waste sites. Management believes that in most cases, our participation is de minimis. Further, almost all such sites represent environmental issues that are quite mature and have been investigated, studied and in many cases settled. In de minimis situations, our policy generally is to negotiate a consent decree and to pay any apportioned settlement, enabling us to be effectively relieved of any further liability as a PRP, except for remote contingencies. In other than de minimis PRP matters, our records indicate that unresolved PRP exposures should be immaterial. We accrue and expense our proportionate share of PRP costs. Because management has been actively
involved in evaluating environmental matters, we are able to conclude that the outstanding environmental liabilities for unresolved PRP sites should not be material to operations. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>Our environmental and safety operating costs charged to expense were approximately $30.6 million in 2005 versus approximately $29.5 million in 2004 and $23.7 million in 2003, excluding depreciation of previous capital expenditures, and are expected to be in the same range in the next few years. Costs for remediation have been accrued and payments related to sites are charged against accrued liabilities, which at December 31, 2005 totaled approximately $28.9 million, down $4.8 million from December 31, 2004. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>We believe that most of the amount we may be required to pay in connection with environmental remediation and asset retirement obligation matters in excess of the amounts recorded, if any, should occur over a period of time and should not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations, but could have a material adverse impact in any particular quarterly reporting period. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>Capital expenditures for pollution-abatement and safety projects, including such costs that are included in other projects, were approximately $9.5 million, $11.1 million and $9.7 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. For each of the next few years, capital expenditures for these types of projects may increase due to more stringent regulatory requirements. Management&#146;s estimates of the effects of compliance with governmental pollution-abatement and safety regulations are subject to (i) the possibility of changes in the applicable statutes and regulations or in judicial or administrative construction of such statutes and regulations, and (ii) uncertainty as to whether anticipated solutions to pollution problems will be successful, or whether additional expenditures may prove necessary. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><B><FONT face=serif size=2>Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements </FONT></B></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, &#147;Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4,&#148; or SFAS No. 151</FONT><I><FONT face=serif size=2>.</FONT></I><FONT face=serif size=2> SFAS No. 151 amends the guidance in ARB No. 43, Chapter 4, Inventory Pricing, to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handing costs, and spoilage. This statement requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of &#147;so abnormal&#148; which was the criterion specified in ARB No. 43. In addition, this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the cost of production be based on normal capacity of the production facilities. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. The adoption of SFAS No. 151 is not expected to have a significant impact on our reported results of
operations. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>In December 2004, FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), &#147;Share-Based Payment,&#148; or SFAS No. 123R, which supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, &#147;Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,&#148; or APB No. 25, and its related implementation guidance. SFAS No. 123R will be effective as of the first annual reporting period that begins after June 15, 2005, which to us will be March 31, 2006. SFAS No. 123R will result in the recognition of additional compensation expense relating to our incentive plans. This revision will require us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award. The cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. We currently use the intrinsic value method from APB No. 25 to measure compensation expense for stock-based awards to our
employees. Under this standard, we generally do not recognize any compensation related to stock option grants we issue under our incentive plans. Under the new rules, we are required to adopt a fair-value-based method for measuring the compensation expense related to incentive stock awards. The adoption of SFAS No. 123R is not expected to have a significant impact on our reported results of operations. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 47, &#147;Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143,&#148; or FIN 47. FIN 47 clarifies that conditional asset retirement obligations meet the definition of liabilities and should be recognized when incurred if their fair values can be reasonably estimated. FIN 47 is effective no later than December 31, 2005. We adopted FIN 47 in 2005 without any impact on our consolidated financial statements. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, &#147;Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3,&#148; or SFAS No. 154. SFAS No. 154 replaces APB Opinion No. 20, &#147;Accounting Changes,&#148; and FASB Statement No. 3, &#147;Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements,&#148; and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle. SFAS No. 154 applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle. It also applies to changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><B><FONT face=serif size=2>Item 7A.&nbsp;&nbsp; Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. </FONT></B></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>In the normal course of operations, we are exposed to changes in financial market conditions due to the denomination of our business transactions in diverse foreign currencies and our ongoing manufacturing and funding activities. As a result, future earnings, cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities are subject to market risk. We have established policies, procedures and internal processes governing our management of uncertain market conditions, and we use both operational and financial market actions in our risk management activities, which include the use of derivative instruments. We do not use derivative instruments for trading purposes. We only enter into derivative contracts based on economic analysis of underlying exposures anticipating that adverse impacts on future earnings, cash flows and fair values due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will be offset by the proceeds from and changes in fair
value of the derivative instruments. We do not hedge our exposure to market risks in a manner that completely eliminates the effects of changing market conditions on earnings, cash flows and fair values. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>Short-term exposures to changing foreign currency exchange rates are primarily due to operating cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. We cover certain known and anticipated operating exposures by using forward contracts. </FONT></P>

<P align=center><FONT face=serif size=2>34</FONT></P>

<HR align=center width="100%" noShade SIZE=2>


<PAGE>

<P align=left><IMG src="albemarle_10k2x3x1.jpg" border=0></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>The primary currencies for which we have foreign currency exchange rate exposure are the Euro, Japanese yen, British pound sterling and the U.S. dollar (in certain of its foreign locations). In response to the greater fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in recent periods, we have increased the degree of risk management activities to minimize the impact on earnings of future periods. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>We manage our foreign currency exposures by balancing certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and through the use, from time-to-time, of foreign currency forward contracts. The principal objective of these contracts is to minimize the risks and/or costs associated with global operating activities. We do not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes. The counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions with which we generally have other financial relationships. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>We enter into foreign currency forward contracts, which generally expire within one year, in the regular course of business to assist in managing our exposure against foreign currency fluctuations on sales and intercompany transactions. The primary method to cover foreign currency exposure is to seek a natural hedge, in which the operating activities denominated in respective currencies balance in respect to timing and the underlying exposures. In the event a natural hedge is not available, a foreign currency forward contract may be employed to reduce currency exposure. While these contracts are subject to fluctuations in value, such fluctuations are generally offset by the value of the underlying foreign currency exposures being hedged. Gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts are recognized currently in income. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>Our financial instruments, subject to foreign currency exchange risk, consist of foreign currency forward contracts and represented a net asset position of $0.01 million at December 31, 2005. We conducted a sensitivity analysis on the fair value of our foreign currency hedge portfolio assuming instantaneous 10% changes in foreign currency exchange rates from their levels as of December 31, 2005, with all other variables held constant. A 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies would result in an increase of $0.5 million in the fair value of our foreign currency exchange hedging contracts. A 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies would result in a decrease of $0.6 million in the fair value of our foreign currency exchange hedging contracts. The sensitivity in fair value of our foreign currency hedge portfolio represents changes in fair values estimated based on market conditions as of
December 31, 2005, without reflecting the effects of underlying anticipated transactions. When those anticipated transactions are realized, actual effects of changing foreign currency exchange rates could have a material impact on our earnings and cash flows in future periods. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>In connection with the acquisition of the refinery catalysts business, we entered into foreign currency forward hedging contracts to partially hedge the purchase price, which was denominated in Euros. As a result, we incurred a net charge of approximately $12.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2004. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>We are exposed to changes in interest rates that could impact our results of operations and financial condition. We manage the worldwide exposure of our interest rate risks and foreign exchange exposure through our regular operations and financing activities. We had outstanding variable interest rate borrowings at December 31, 2005 of $420.9 million, bearing an average interest rate of 4.62% . A change of 0.125% in the interest rate applicable to these borrowings would change our annualized interest expense by approximately $0.5 million. We intend to use our senior credit agreement as the primary source of financing supplemented by several uncommitted line agreements, which could expose us to changes in interest rates, if various financial covenants are not met. We manage our ratio of debt-to-capitalization with the objective of achieving the lowest cost of capital possible.</FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>Our raw materials are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions, political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors. Historically, we have not used futures, options and swap contracts to manage the volatility related to the above exposures. However, the refinery catalysts business has used financing arrangements (certain of which contain embedded derivatives) to provide long-term protection against changes in metals prices. We seek to limit our exposure by entering into long-term contracts when available, and we seek price increase limitations through contracts. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>Due to the increase in our outstanding indebtedness as a result of the acquisition of the refinery catalysts business, we may enter into interest rate swaps, collars or similar instruments with the objective of reducing interest rate volatility relating to our borrowing costs. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>In 2004, we entered into treasury lock agreements, or T-locks, with a notional value of $275.0 million, to fix the yield on the U.S. Treasury security used to set the yield for approximately 85% of our January 2005 public offering of senior notes. The T-locks fixed the yield on the U.S. Treasury security at approximately 4.25% . The value of the T-locks resulted from the difference between (1) the yield-to-maturity of the 10-year U.S. Treasury security that had the maturity date most comparable to the maturity date of the notes issued and (2) the fixed rate of approximately 4.25% . The cumulative loss effect of the T-lock agreements was $2.2 million and is being amortized over the life of the notes as an adjustment to the notes interest expense. At December 31, 2005, there were unrealized losses of approximately $2.0 million ($1.3 million after income taxes) in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) that remain to be
expensed. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>In addition, certain of our operations use natural gas as a source of energy which can expose our business to market risk when the price of natural gas changes suddenly. In an attempt to mitigate the impact and volatility of price swings in the natural gas market, we purchase natural gas contracts, when appropriate, for a portion of our 12-month rolling forecast for North American natural gas requirements.</FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>Our natural gas hedge transactions are executed with a major financial institution. Such derivatives are held to secure natural gas at fixed prices and not for trading. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>Our natural gas contracts qualify as cash flow hedges and are marked to market. The unrealized gains and/or losses on them are deferred and accounted for in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to the extent that the unrealized gains and losses are offset by the forecasted transaction. At December 31, 2005, there were no natural gas hedge contracts outstanding. Additionally, any unrealized gains and/or losses on the derivative instrument that are not offset by the forecasted transaction are recorded in earnings as appropriate. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><B><FONT face=serif size=2>REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM</FONT></B></P>

<P align=justify><B><FONT face=serif size=2>To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Albemarle Corporation: </FONT></B><FONT face=serif size=2></FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>We have completed integrated audits of Albemarle Corporation&#146;s 2005 and 2004 consolidated financial statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005 and an audit of its 2003 consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our opinions, based on our audits, are presented below.</FONT></P>

<P align=justify><U><FONT face=serif size=2>Consolidated financial statements</FONT></U></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Albemarle Corporation and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#146;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.</FONT></P>

<P align=justify><FONT face=serif size=2><FONT size=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT>As discussed in Note 21, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for asset retirement obligations as of January 1, 2003.</FONT></P>

<P align=justify><U><FONT face=serif size=2>Internal control over financial reporting</FONT></U></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>Also, in our opinion, management&#146;s assessment, included in Management&#146;s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A, that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005 based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. The Company&#146;s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.
Our responsibility is to express opinions on management&#146;s assessment and on the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management&#146;s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.</FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.</FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.</FONT></P>

<P align=justify><I><FONT face=serif size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp; Basis of Consolidation </FONT></I></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>The consolidated financial statements include the accounts and operations of Albemarle Corporation and our wholly owned, majority owned and controlled subsidiaries. Unless the context otherwise indicates, the terms &#147;Albemarle,&#148; &#147;we,&#148; &#147;us,&#148; &#147;our&#148; or &#147;the company&#148; mean Albemarle Corporation and our consolidated subsidiaries. We apply the equity method of accounting for investments in which we have an ownership interest from 20% to 50% owned or where we exercise significant influence over the related investee&#146;s operations. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Minority shareholders&#146; interests in consolidated subsidiaries are included in &#147;other noncurrent liabilities&#148; in the consolidated balance sheets and &#147;minority interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries&#148; in the consolidated statements of
income.</FONT></P>

<P align=justify><I><FONT face=serif size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp; Changes in Reporting </FONT></I></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>Effective January 1, 2005, we revised the way we evaluate the performance of our segment results to include the operating results of our joint ventures, termed &#147;equity in net income (losses) of unconsolidated investments,&#148; in our segment income (losses). Segment results for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 have been reclassified to reflect the manner in which our chief operating decision maker reviews our three segments. The change in segment income results versus segment operating profit resulted from the material effect of the catalysts business joint ventures acquired from Akzo Nobel N.V., or Akzo Nobel, as part of our July 31, 2004 acquisition of Akzo Nobel&#146;s refinery catalysts business, or refinery catalysts business, on our consolidated operating results. This change in presentation had no impact on our reported net income for the years presented.</FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>Effective August 1, 2005, we began consolidating our 50% ownership interest in Jordan Bromine Company Limited, or JBC, a Jordanian-American joint venture company that manufactures and markets bromine and bromine derivatives products from raw materials extracted from the Dead Sea. We previously accounted for this investment on the equity basis. However, as a result of August 2005 amendments to the related joint venture agreement, our management concluded that consolidation accounting for this investment was appropriate under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. This change in accounting has no impact on our net income for the year ended December 31, 2005. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>Additionally, we revised the presentation of our minority ownership interest in our controlled subsidiary, Stannica LLC, in the accompanying consolidated statements of income from &#147;other income (expenses), net&#148; to a separate disclosure line &#147;minority interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries.&#148; Reclassifications were made in the accompanying consolidated statements of income herein for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 totaling ($5,101) and ($2,564), respectively, to reflect the changes. We also reclassified &#147;equity in net income (losses) of unconsolidated investments&#148; for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 to comply with our current presentation. Both reclassifications impacted the disclosures for income before income taxes, minority interests, equity in net income (losses) of unconsolidated investments and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net and the
effective income tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 in the income tax footnote. See Note 14. These reclassifications had no impact on our reported net income for the years presented. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><I><FONT face=serif size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp; Revenue Recognition </FONT></I><I><FONT face=serif></FONT></I></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>We recognize sales when the revenue is realized or realizable, and has been earned, in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission&#146;s Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, &#147;Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements.&#148; Net sales are recognized as risk and title to the product transfer to the customer, which usually occurs at the time shipment is made. The majority of our sales are sold FOB or free on board, shipping point or on an equivalent basis, other transactions are based upon specific contractual arrangements. Our standard terms of delivery are typically included in our contracts of sale, order confirmation documents and invoices. Revenue from services is recognized when performance of the services has been completed. We have a limited amount of consignment sales that are billed to our customers based upon monthly notification of use by the customer. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify><I><FONT face=serif size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp; Performance and Life Cycle Guarantees </FONT></I></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>We provide customers certain performance guarantees and life cycle guarantees. These guarantees entitle the customer to claim compensation if the product does not conform to performance standards originally agreed upon. Performance guarantees relate to minimum technical specifications that products produced with the delivered product must meet, such as yield and product quality. Life cycle guarantees relate to minimum periods for which performance of the delivered product is guaranteed.

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements.

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>Accounts include costs of assets constructed, purchased or leased, related delivery and installation costs and interest incurred on significant capital projects during their construction periods. Expenditures for renewals and betterments also are capitalized, but expenditures for normal repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. The cost and accumulated depreciation applicable to assets retired or sold are removed from the respective accounts, and gains or losses thereon are included in income. Depreciation is computed primarily by the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets. We have a policy where our internal Engineering Group provides asset life guidelines for book purposes. These guidelines are reviewed against the economic life of the business for each project, and asset life is determined as the lesser of the manufacturing life or the &#147;business&#148; life. The engineering guidelines
are reviewed periodically. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>We evaluate historical and expected undiscounted operating cash flows of our business segments to determine the future recoverability of any property, plant and equipment recorded.

<P align=justify><I><FONT face=serif size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp; Investments </FONT></I></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>Investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting if the investment gives us the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control over, the investee. Significant influence is generally deemed to exist if we have an ownership interest in the voting stock of the investee between 20% and 50%, although other factors, such as representation on the investee&#146;s board of directors and the impact of commercial arrangements, are considered in determining whether the equity method of accounting is appropriate. Under the equity method of accounting, we record our investments in equity-method investees in the consolidated balance sheet as &#147;Investments&#148; and our share of the investees&#146; earnings or losses together with other-than temporary impairments in value as &#147;Equity in net income (losses) of unconsolidated investments&#148; in the consolidated statement of income. The excess of the cost of
investments in unconsolidated investments over the values assigned to assets and liabilities is shown as goodwill and is subject to the impairment provisions of SFAS No. 142, &#145;&#145;Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.&#146;&#146; </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>Investments also consist of certain mutual fund investments, which are accounted for as trading equities and are marked-to-market on a monthly basis through the consolidated statement of income.

<P align=justify><FONT face=serif size=2><FONT size=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT>We accrue for environmental remediation costs and post-remediation costs on an undiscounted basis at facilities or off-plant disposal sites that relate to existing conditions caused by past operations in the accounting period in which responsibility is established and when the related costs are estimable. In developing these cost estimates, evaluation is given to currently available facts regarding each site, with consideration given to existing technology, presently enacted laws and regulations, prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites, the financial capability of other potentially responsible parties and other factors, subject to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process. Additionally, these estimates are reviewed periodically, with adjustments to the accruals recorded as necessary. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>We test goodwill for impairment using a two-step method by comparing the estimated fair value of our reporting units to the related carrying value.

<P align=justify><I><FONT face=serif size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp; Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits </FONT></I></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>We follow the guidance of SFAS No. 87, &#147;Employers&#146; Accounting for Pensions,&#148; and SFAS No. 106, &#147;Employers&#146; Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions,&#148; when accounting for pension and postretirement benefits. Under these accounting standards, assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets. Delayed recognition of differences between actual results and expected or estimated results is a guiding principle of these standards. This delayed recognition of actual results allows for the recognition of changes in benefit obligations and plan performance over the working lives of the employees who benefit under the plans. The primary assumptions are as follows:</FONT></P>

<P align=justify><I><FONT face=serif size=2>Discount Rate </FONT></I><FONT face=serif size=2>&#151; The discount rate is used in calculating the present value of benefits, which is based on projections of</FONT> <FONT face=serif size=2>benefit payments to be made in the future.</FONT></P>

<P align=justify><I><FONT face=serif size=2>Rate of Increase in the Per Capita of Covered Health Care Benefits </FONT></I><FONT face=serif size=2>&#151; We project the expected increases in the cost of</FONT> <FONT face=serif size=2>covered health care benefits.</FONT></P>
</LI></UL>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>During 2005, we made changes to the assumptions related to the discount rate, the rate of compensation increase (for salary related plans) and the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits. We consider available information that we deem relevant when selecting each of these assumptions. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>In selecting</FONT><FONT face=sans-serif size=2> </FONT><FONT face=serif size=2>the discount rate, consideration is given to fixed-income security yields, including high quality bonds (Moody&#146;s Investors Services, or Moody&#146;s Aa and the International Index Company, or iBoxx, AA corporate bond rates), along with a yield curve applied to the payments we expect to make out of our retirement plans. The yield curve was produced for a universe containing U.S.-issued Aa-graded corporate bonds, all of which were non-callable, non-putable, and non-sinkable. For each plan, the discount rate was developed as the level equivalent rate that would produce the same present value as that using spot rates aligned with the projected benefit payments. At December 31, 2005, the weighted-average discount rate was reduced for the plans from 5.49% to 5.44% as a result of decreased yields for long-term high quality bonds. </FONT><FONT
face=serif></FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>In estimating the expected return on plan assets, we consider past performance and future expectations for the types of investments held by the plan as well as the expected long-term allocation of plan assets to these investments. At December 31, 2005, the weighted-average expected rate of return on pension plan assets was reduced from 8.36% to 8.31% and there was no change in the weighted-average expected 7.00% return on other postretirement benefit plan assets. Our U.S. defined benefit plan for non-represented employees was closed to new participants effective March 31, 2004. We adopted a defined contribution pension plan for U.S. employees hired after March 31, 2004.</FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>In projecting the rate of compensation increase, we consider past experience in light of movements in inflation rates. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the assumed weighted-average rate of compensation increase was 2.82% and 2.53%, respectively, for the plans. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>In selecting the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits, we consider past performance and forecasts of future health care cost trends. At December 31, 2005, the previously assumed rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits for U.S. retirees was increased. The assumed health care cost trend rate for 2005 for pre-65 coverage was 9% per year, dropping by 1% per year to an ultimate rate of 5%, while the trend rate for post-65 coverage was 10% per year, dropping by 1% per year to an ultimate rate of 5%. The assumed health care cost trend rate for 2004 for pre-65 coverage was 9% per year, dropping by 1% per year to an ultimate rate of 6%, the trend rate for post-65 coverage was 11% per year, dropping by 1% per year to an ultimate rate of 6%. For 2006, the trend rate for pre-65 coverage is 9% per year, dropping by 1% per year to an ultimate rate of 5%; the trend rate for
post-65 coverage is 10% per year, dropping by 1% per year to an ultimate rate of 5%. The postretirement medical benefits provided to employees in the Netherlands who retire after August 2009 includes an assumed increase in benefits of 1.5% per year. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>We maintain an Executive Deferred Compensation Plan, or the Plan, that was adopted in 2001 and subsequently amended. The purpose of the Plan is to provide current tax planning opportunities as well as supplemental funds upon the retirement or death of certain employees of Albemarle. The Plan is intended to aid in attracting and retaining employees of exceptional ability by providing them with these benefits. We also maintain a Benefit Protection Trust, or the Trust, that was set up to provide a source of funds to assist in meeting the obligations of the Plan, subject to the claims of our creditors in the event of our insolvency. Assets of the Trust are consolidated in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force No. 97-14.

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>Except as otherwise noted, it is our policy to record deferred income tax liabilities on our undistributed earnings of foreign&nbsp;operations that are not deemed to be permanently reinvested in those operations.

In general, to the extent our financial reporting book basis over tax basis of a foreign subsidiary exceeds these E&amp;P amounts, deferred taxes have not been recorded as they are essentially permanent in duration.

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) is comprised principally of foreign currency translation adjustments, changes in realized loss on treasury lock agreements, changes in minimum pension liability, changes in marketable equity securities and changes in hedging derivatives. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>The assets and liabilities of all foreign subsidiaries were prepared in their respective local currencies and translated into U.S. dollars based on the current exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet dates, while income and expenses were translated at average exchange rates for the periods presented. Translation adjustments are reflected as a separate component of shareholders&#146; equity. Transaction adjustments are included in cost of goods sold.

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>While these contracts are subject to fluctuations in value, such fluctuations are generally offset by the value of the underlying foreign currency exposures being hedged.

For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, we recognized (losses) gains of ($294), $211 and $40, respectively, in income before income taxes, minority interests, equity in net income (losses) of unconsolidated investments and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net on our exchange contracts. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>In 2004, we entered into treasury lock agreements, or T-locks, with a notional value of $275,000, to fix the yield on the U.S. Treasury security used to set the yield for approximately 85% of our January 2005 public offering of $325,000 aggregate amount of senior notes due 2015. The T-locks fixed the yield on the U.S. Treasury security at approximately 4.25% . The value of the T-locks resulted from the difference between (1) the yield-to-maturity of the 10-year U.S. Treasury security that had the maturity date most comparable to the maturity date of the notes issued and (2) the fixed rate of approximately 4.25% . The cumulative loss effect of the T-lock agreements was $2,169 and is being amortized over the life of the notes as an adjustment to the notes interest expense. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, there were unrealized losses of approximately $1,969 ($1,254 after income taxes) and $705 ($449 after income taxes), respectively,
in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). </FONT></P>

To the extent that these contracts are effective in hedging our exposure to price changes, changes in the fair value of the hedge contracts are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified to cost of sales when the natural gas is purchased. At December 31, 2005 we did not have any open contracts. At December 31, 2004 there were unrealized losses of approximately $451 ($287 after income taxes) in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

This statement requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of &#147;so abnormal&#148; which was the criterion specified in ARB No. 43. In addition, this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the cost of production be based on normal capacity of the production facilities. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. The adoption of SFAS No. 151 is not expected to have a significant
impact on our reported results of operations. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), &#147;Share-Based Payment,&#148; or SFAS No. 123R, which supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, &#147;Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,&#148; or APB No. 25, and its related implementation guidance. SFAS No. 123R will be effective as of the first annual reporting period that begins after June 15, 2005, which to us will be March 31, 2006. SFAS No. 123R will result in the recognition of additional compensation expense relating to our incentive plans. This revision will require us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award. The cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. We currently use the intrinsic value method from APB No. 25 to measure compensation expense for stock-based awards to our
employees. Under this standard, we generally do not recognize any compensation related to stock option grants we issue under our incentive plans. Under the new rules, we are required to adopt a fair-value-based method for measuring the </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 47, &#147;Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143,&#148; or FIN 47. FIN 47 clarifies that conditional asset retirement obligations meet the definition of liabilities and should be recognized when incurred if their fair values can be reasonably estimated. FIN 47 is effective no later than December 31, 2005. We adopted FIN 47 in 2005 without any impact on our consolidated financial statements. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, &#147;Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3,&#148; or SFAS No. 154. SFAS No. 154 replaces APB Opinion No. 20, &#147;Accounting Changes,&#148; and FASB Statement No. 3, &#147;Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements,&#148; and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle. SFAS No. 154 applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle. It also applies to changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions.

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>On July 29, 2004, in connection with the acquisition of the refinery catalysts business, we entered into (1) a senior credit agreement, with a group of lenders, consisting of a $300,000 revolving credit facility ($20,000 outstanding at December 31, 2004) and a $450,000 five-year term loan facility ($382,500 and $427,500 outstanding at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively) and (2) a $450,000 364-day loan agreement ($450,000 outstanding at December 31, 2004). There were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility or 364-day loan agreement at December 31, 2005. We used the initial borrowings under the senior credit agreement and the 364-day loan agreement to consummate the acquisition, refinance our then-existing credit agreement and pay related fees and expenses incurred in connection therewith. The $450,000 five-year loan facility is payable in quarterly installments of $11,250 through June 30, 2008, with three
final quarterly payments of $90,000 beginning September 30, 2008 through March 31, 2009.</FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>The average interest rate on borrowings under our previous credit agreement for the year ended December 31, 2004 was 1.83% . We amended our current revolving credit facility on July 8, 2005, to (1) reduce the applicable borrowing rates and fees payable under the revolving credit facility and five-year term loan facility, based on the ratings of our senior unsecured long-term debt as rated by outside credit rating agencies, (2) eliminate certain conditions for borrowings under the revolving credit facility, and (3) provide an option to increase the amount available for borrowings under the revolving credit facility by up to $50,000.</FONT></P>

There were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility or the 364-day loan agreement at December 31, 2005. Borrowings under the five-year term loan facility bore variable interest rates of 4.75% and 3.47% at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility, the five-year term loan facility, and the 364-day loan agreement bear interest at variable rates based on an average London inter-bank offered rate (&#147;LIBOR&#148;) for deposits in the relevant currency plus an applicable rate (0.75% as of December 31, 2005 and 1.0% as of December 31, 2004).

As a result of the issuance of the senior notes, the amount outstanding under the 364-day loan at December 31, 2004, $450,000, was classified as long-term debt. In addition, $325,000 of this amount was reflected in the debt maturities as due in 2015, consistent with the senior notes maturity date, and the difference of $125,000 was reflected in the debt maturities as due in 2005 as the proceeds from the

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>At December 31, 2005, we have three existing incentive plans (1994, 1998 and 2003 plans). The plans generally provide for incentive awards payable either in cash or our common stock, qualified and non-qualified stock options, or stock options, stock appreciation rights, or SARs, and restricted stock awards and performance awards, or stock awards.</FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>Under the 1994 plan, a maximum of 3,200,000 shares of our common stock were authorized for issuance pursuant to the exercise of stock options (491,000 outstanding at December 31, 2005), SARs or the grant of stock awards. No further grants or awards can be made under the 1994 plan.</FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>Under the 1998 plan, a maximum aggregate number of 3,000,000 shares of our common stock were authorized for issuance as incentive awards, stock options (1,849,150 outstanding at December 31, 2005), SARs or stock awards subject to certain limitations. The maximum aggregate number of shares that could be issued pursuant to the exercise of options is 2,600,000. No further grants or awards can be made under the 1998 plan.</FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>Stock options outstanding under the three plans have been granted at prices that are equal to the market value of the stock on the date of grant and expire seven to ten years after issuance. The stock options granted become exercisable based upon either (a) growth in operating earnings as defined from the base-year earnings, (b) the increase in fair market value of our common stock, during a specified period, from the fair market value on the date of grant, or (c) at the end of a fixed period as defined in the individual agreements. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>In January 2002, the Executive Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors approved the conversion of certain performance based restricted stock awards to performance based unit awards, reducing the potential number of shares to be issued upon meeting the original performance criteria. If the original performance criteria is met, 50% of the value of the incentive award is payable in cash and 50% of the value of the incentive award is payable in shares of our common stock, based on the closing market price of Albemarle common stock on the date of vesting. The cash and stock awards vest over a three-year period. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>Recorded liabilities decreased $4,843 from December 31, 2004 primarily due to foreign exchange and reduction of reserves for certain environmental sites. The increase of $4,617 from December 31, 2003 is primarily due to additional indemnified liabilities associated with acquired sites and the inclusion of a reserve amounting to $700 related to pump and treat costs at our Thann, France facility that are currently in arbitration.

<P align=justify><FONT face=serif size=2><FONT size=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT>The amounts recorded represent our future remediation and other anticipated environmental liabilities. Although it is difficult to quantify the potential financial impact of compliance with environmental protection laws, management estimates (based on the latest available information) there is a reasonable possibility that future environmental remediation costs associated with our past operations, in excess of amounts already recorded, could be up to approximately $12,000 before income taxes.</FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>We believe that any sum we may be required to pay in connection with environmental remediation matters in excess of the amounts recorded should occur over a period of time and should not have a material adverse effect upon results of operations, financial condition or cash flows on a consolidated annual basis although any such sum could have a material adverse impact in a particular quarterly reporting period.</FONT></P>

<P align=justify><I><FONT face=serif size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp; Litigation </FONT></I></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>On April 2, 2004, Albemarle Overseas Development Company, or AODC, one of our wholly owned subsidiaries, initiated a Request for Arbitration against Aventis S.A., the predecessor in interest to Sanofi Aventis, or Aventis, through the International Chamber of Commerce, International Court of Arbitration, Paris, France. The dispute arises out of a 1992 Stock Purchase Agreement, or Agreement, between AODC and a predecessor to Aventis under which 100% of the stock of Potasse et Produits Chimiques, S.A., now known as Albemarle PPC, or APPC, was acquired by AODC. The dispute relates to a chemical facility in Thann, France, owned by APPC, where the French government has required a detailed risk study of groundwater contamination, and in 2005 instructed APPC to conduct a number of additional tests and studies and take certain measures with respect to the containment of certain contamination at and the emission of certain materials from the
Thann facility. By reason of certain intervening assignments of rights, Albemarle France SAS, another wholly owned subsidiary of Albemarle Corporation, was substituted for ADOC as the party in interest in the arbitration. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>The Request for Arbitration requests indemnification by Aventis for certain costs incurred by APPC, in connection with any environmental claims of the French government for the APPC facility and a declaratory judgment as to the liability of Aventis under the Agreement for costs to be incurred in the future by APPC in connection with such claims. Under the terms of the Agreement, we believe that Aventis is obligated to indemnify AODC and APPC, and hold them harmless from certain claims, losses, damages, costs or any other present or prospective liabilities arising out of certain soil and groundwater contamination at the site in Thann. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>Arbitration hearings related to the question of liability took place in June 2005 and we currently expect a response from the arbitration panel in 2006. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>At this time, it is not possible to predict what additional studies or measures, if any, the French government may require since these matters are in the initial stages and environmental matters are subject to many uncertainties. We believe, however, that we are entitled to be fully indemnified by Aventis for all liabilities arising from these matters, but no assurance can be given that we will </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>In addition, we are involved from time to time in legal proceedings of types regarded as common in our businesses, particularly administrative or judicial proceedings seeking remediation under environmental laws, such as Superfund, products liability and premises liability litigation.

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>We have certain noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering certain U.S., Belgian, French, German, Japanese and the Netherlands employees. The benefits for these plans are based primarily on compensation and/or years of service. The funding policy for each plan complies with the requirements of relevant governmental laws and regulations. The pension information for all periods presented includes amounts related to salaried and hourly plans. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>Our U.S. defined benefit plan for non-represented employees was closed to new participants effective March 31, 2004. In 2005, the defined benefit plan for non-represented employees was further amended to provide that for participants who retire on or after December 31, 2010, final average earnings shall be determined as of December 31, 2010, except that for participants who retire on or after December 31, 2015, final average earnings shall be determined as of December 31, 2012, and for participants who retiree on or after December 31, 2020, final average earnings shall be determined as of December 31, 2014. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>On March 31, 2004, a new defined contribution pension plan for U.S. non-represented employees hired after March 31, 2004 was adopted. The new annual contribution to the defined contribution plan is based on 5% of eligible employee compensation and amounted to $1,371 and $509 in 2005 and 2004, respectively. A defined contribution pension plan for employees in the United Kingdom is also in existence. The annual contribution to the United Kingdom defined contribution plan is based on a percentage of eligible employee compensation and amounted to $536 and $544 in 2005 and 2004, respectively. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>As a result of our refinery catalysts business acquisition, we assumed the obligation under the defined benefit plan that covers employees in the Netherlands and the actual plan assets were transferred beginning in 2005 and to be completed in early 2006.

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>Pension coverage for the employees of our other foreign subsidiaries is provided through separate plans. The plans are funded in conformity with the funding requirements of applicable governmental regulations.

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>Postretirement medical benefits and life insurance is provided for certain groups of U.S. retired employees. Medical and life insurance benefit costs are funded principally on a pay-as-you-go basis. Although the availability of medical coverage after retirement varies for different groups of employees, the majority of employees who retire before becoming eligible for Medicare can continue group coverage by paying a portion of the cost of a monthly premium designed to cover the claims incurred by retired employees subject to a cap on payments allowed. The availability of group coverage for Medicare-eligible retirees also varies by employee group with coverage designed either to supplement or coordinate with Medicare. Retirees generally pay a portion of the cost of the coverage. Plan assets for retiree life insurance are held under an insurance contract and reserved for retiree life insurance benefits. As a result of the acquisition
of the refinery catalysts business, we assumed the obligation for postretirement medical benefits for employees in the </FONT></P>

In 2005, the postretirement medical benefit available to U.S. employees was changed to provide that employees who are under age 50 as of December 31, 2005 would no longer be eligible for a company paid retiree medical premium subsidy.

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>The investment objective of the U.S. pension plan assets is maximum return with a strong emphasis on preservation of capital. Assets should participate in rising markets, with defensive action in declining markets expected to an even greater degree. Target asset allocations include 60% in long equity managers and the remaining 40% in asset classes that provide diversification from traditional long equity holdings. Depending on market conditions, the broad asset class targets may range 10%. These asset classes include, but are not limited to hedge fund of funds, bonds and other fixed income vehicles, high yield equities and distressed debt.

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>We have a supplemental executive retirement plan, or the SERP, which provides unfunded supplemental retirement benefits to certain management or highly compensated employees. The SERP provides for incremental pension payments to offset the limitations imposed by federal income tax regulations. Expenses relating to the SERP of $1,578, $1,357 and $1,481 were recorded for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The accumulated benefit obligation for the SERP recognized in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $13,962 and $11,200, respectively. The benefit expenses and obligations of this SERP are included in the tables above. Benefits of $1,231 are expected to be paid to SERP retirees in 2006. In 2005, the SERP was amended to reflect the same changes as the U.S. qualified defined benefit plan. For participants who retire on or after December 31, 2010, final average earnings shall be
determined as of December 31, 2010, except that for participants who retire on or after December 15, 2015, final average earnings shall be determined as of December 31, 2012, and for participants who retire on or after December 31, 2020, final average earnings shall be determined as of December 31, 2014. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>At December 31, 2005, the previously assumed rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits for U.S. retirees was increased. The assumed health care cost trend rate for 2005 for pre-65 coverage was 9% per year, dropping by 1% per year to an ultimate rate of 5%, while the trend rate for post-65 coverage was 10% per year, dropping by 1% per year to an ultimate rate of 5%. The assumed health care cost trend rate for 2004 for pre-65 coverage was 9% per year, dropping by 1% per year to an ultimate rate of 6%, the trend rate for post-65 coverage was 11% per year, dropping by 1% per year to an ultimate rate of 6%. For 2006, the trend rate for pre-65 coverage is 9% per year, dropping by 1% per year to an ultimate rate of 5%; the trend rate for post-65 coverage is 10% per year, dropping by 1% per year to an ultimate rate of 5%. The postretirement medical benefits provided to employees in the Netherlands who retire
after August 2009 includes an assumed increase in benefits of 1.5% per year.</FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>The effect of a 1% increase in the U.S. health care cost trend rate would increase the total service and interest components by $43 and would increase the benefit obligation by $553.

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>On July 31, 2004, we completed the acquisition of the refinery catalysts business of Akzo Nobel N.V. for approximately $763,000, including expenses, at applicable exchange rates, funded by a combination of a bridge loan and long-term financing. During 2004 and 2005, we adjusted the purchase price by approximately $23,000 and $8,000, respectively, due primarily to payments to Akzo Nobel as part of the post-closing working capital adjustments. During 2005, significant progress was made in the determination of the final purchase price allocation versus the estimated allocation at December 31, 2004. However, none of the changes made to the December 31, 2004 allocation were material to our financial position or results of operations. Following this acquisition, we transferred our existing polyolefin catalysts business from the Polymer Chemicals segment, which was renamed Polymer Additives, to a newly created Catalysts segment, which
also included the assets acquired from Akzo Nobel. Our operations are now managed and reported as three operating segments: Polymer Additives; Catalysts; and Fine Chemicals. Additionally, we acquired 50% ownership of non-consolidated joint ventures in Brazil (F&#225;brica Carioca de Catalisadores S.A.), Japan (Nippon Ketjen Co., Ltd.) and France (Eurecat S.A. with affiliates in the United States, Saudi Arabia and Italy).

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>The management of Albemarle Corporation (the &#147;Company&#148;) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>The Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>The Company&#146;s management assessed the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005. In making this assessment, management used the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in &#147;Internal Control-Integrated Framework.&#148; Based on the assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2005, the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria. </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>Management&#146;s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears on page 37.</FONT></P>
