ITEM 1. BUSINESS

CNB FINANCIAL CORPORATION

     CNB Financial Corporation (the Corporation) is a Bank Holding Company
registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. It was
incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1983 for the
purpose of engaging in the business of a Bank Holding Company. On April 26,
1984, the Corporation acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of County
National Bank (the Bank), a national banking chartered institution. The
Corporation is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. In general, the Corporation is
limited to owning or controlling banks and engaging in such other activity as
proper incident thereto. The Corporation is currently engaged in two non-banking
activities through its wholly owned subsidiaries CNB Investment Corporation and
County Reinsurance Company. CNB Investment Corporation was formed in November
1998 to hold and manage investments that were previously owned by County
National Bank and the Corporation and to provide the Corporation with additional
latitude to purchase other investments. County Reinsurance Company was formed in
June of 2001 as a corporation in the state of Arizona. The company provides
accidental death and disability and life insurance as a part of lending
relationships of the Bank.

     The Corporation does not currently engage in any operating business
activities, other than the ownership and management of County National Bank, CNB
Investment Corporation and County Reinsurance Company

COUNTY NATIONAL BANK

     The Bank is a nationally chartered banking institution incorporated in
1934. The Bank's Main Office is located at 1 South Second Street,
Clearfield,(Clearfield County) Pennsylvania. The Bank's primary marketing area
consists of the Pennsylvania Countries of Clearfield, Elk (excluding the
Townships of Millstone, Highland and Spring Creek), Mckean Cambria and Cameron.
It also includes a portion of western Centre County including Philipsburg
Borough, Rush Township and the western portions of Snow Shoe and Burnside
Townships and a portion of Jefferson County, consisting of the boroughs of
Brockway, Falls Creek, Punxsutawney, Reynoldsville and Skyesville, and the
townships of Washington, Winslow and Henderson. The approximate population of
the general trade area is 150,000. The economy is diversified and includes
manufacturing industries, wholesale and retail trade, services industries,
family farms and the production of natural resources of coal, oil, gas and
timber.

     In addition to the Main Office, the Bank has 18 full-service branch offices
and 1 limited service branch facility located in various communities in its
market area.

     The Bank is a full-service bank engaging in a full range of banking
activities and services for individual, business, governmental and institutional
customers. These activities and services principally include checking, savings,
time and deposit accounts; real estate, commercial, industrial, residential and
consumer loans, and a variety of other specialized financial services. Its Trust
division offers a full range of client services.

     The Bank's customer base is such that loss of one customer relationship or
a related group of depositors would not have a materially adverse effect on the
business of the Bank.

     The Bank's portifolio is diversified so that one industry, group of related
industries or changes in household economic conditions does not comprise a
material portion of the loan portfolio.

     The Bank's business is not seasonal not does it have any risks attendant to
foreign sources.

COMPETITION

     The banking industry in the Bank's service area continues to be extremely
competitive, both among commercial banks and with financial service providers
such as consumer finance companies, thrifts, investment firms, mutual funds and
credit unions. The increased competition has resulted from changes in the legal
and regulatory guidelines as well as from economic conditions. Mortgage banking
firms, leasing companies, financial affiliates of industrial companies brokerage
firms, retirement fund management firms, and even government agencies provide
additional competitions for loans and other financial services. Some of the
financial service providers operating in the Bank's market area operate on a
large-scale regional basis and possess resources greater than those of the Bank
and the Corporation. The Bank is generally competitive

                                                                               3
<PAGE>

with all competing financial institutions in its service area with respect to
interest rates paid on time and savings deposits, service charges on deposit
accounts and interest rates charged on loans.

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION

     The Bank is subject to supervision and examination by applicable federal
and state banking agencies, including the Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency. In addition, the Bank is insured by and subject to some or all of the
regulations of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"). The Bank is
also subject to various requirements and restrictions under federal and state
law, including requirements to maintain reserves against deposits, restrictions
on the types, amounts and terms and conditions of loans that may be granted, and
limitation on the types of investments that may be made and the types of
services that may be offered. Various consumer laws and regulations also affect
the operation of the Bank. In addition to the impact of regulation, commercial
banks are affected significantly by the actions of the Federal Reserve Board,
including actions taken with respect to interest rates, as it attempts to
control the money supply and credit availability in order to influence the
economy.

     Officers are elected annually at the reorganization meeting of the Board of
Directors. There are not any arrangements or understandings between any and all
of the above officers and any other persons pursuant to which they were selected
as officers. In addition, there are not any family relationships between the
above officers.

EMPLOYEES

     The Corporation has no employees who are not employees of County National
Bank. As of December 31, 2001, the Bank had a total of 239 employees of which
173 were full time and 66 were part time.

MONETARY POLICIES

     The earnings and growth of the banking industry are affected by the credit
policies of monetary authorities, including, the Federal Reserve System. An
important function of the Federal Reserve System is to regulate the national
supply of bank credit in order to control recessionary and inflationary
pressures. Among the instruments of monetary policy used by the Federal Reserve
to implement these objectives are open market activities in U.S. Government
Securities, changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowings and changes
in reserve requirements against member bank deposits. These operations are used
in varying combinations to influence overall economic growth and indirectly,
bank loans, investments, and deposits. These variables may also affect interest
rates charged on loans or paid for deposits. The monetary policies of the
Federal Reserve authorities have had a significant effect on the operating
results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to have
such an effect in the future.

     In view of the changing conditions in the national economy and in the money
markets, as well as the effect of actions by monetary and fiscal authorities
including the Federal Reserve System, no prediction can be made as to possible
future changes in interest rates, deposit levels, loan demand or their effect on
the business and earnings of the Corporation and the Bank.

1.   In determining the allocation of the allowance for possible credit losses.
     County National Bank considers economic trends, historical patterns and
     specific credit reviews.
2.   With regard to the credit reviews, a "watchlist" is evaluated on a monthly
     basis to determine potential commercial losses. Consumer loans and mortgage
     loans are allocated using historical loss experience. The total of these
     reserves is deemed "allocated", while the renaming balance is
     "unallocated".
