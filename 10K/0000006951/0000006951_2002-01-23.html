<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">PART I</P>

<P>Item 1:  Business</P>

</B><P>Organized in 1967, Applied develops, manufactures, markets and services
semiconductor wafer fabrication equipment and related spare parts for the
worldwide semiconductor industry. Customers for these products include
semiconductor wafer manufacturers and semiconductor integrated circuit (or chip)
manufacturers, who either use the chips they manufacture in their own products
or sell them to other companies. These chips are key components in most advanced
electronic products for the Internet, communications, computers and digital
devices. </P>

<P>Most chips are built on a base of silicon, called a wafer, and include
multiple layers of wiring that connect a variety of circuit components, such as
transistors and other structures. As the density of the circuit components is
increased to enable smaller chips and greater computing power, the complexity of
building the chip also increases, necessitating the formation of smaller
structures and more intricate wiring schemes. To build a chip, the transistors,
capacitors and other circuit components are first created on the surface of the
wafer by performing a series of processes to deposit and remove selected film
layers. Similar processes are then used to build the layers of wiring structures
on the wafer. A typical, simplified process sequence for building the wiring
portion of new copper-based chips involves initially depositing a dielectric
film layer onto the base layer of circuit components using a chemical vapor
deposition (CVD) system. An etch system is then used to create openings and
patterns in the dielectric layer. To form the metal wiring, these openings and
patterns are subsequently filled with copper material using physical vapor
deposition (PVD) and electroplating technologies. A chemical mechanical
polishing (CMP) step then polishes the wafer to maintain a flat surface.
Additional deposition, etch and CMP steps are then performed to build up the
layers of wiring needed to complete the interconnection of the circuit elements
to form the chip. Advanced chip designs require well over 300 individual process
steps to complete the manufacturing of the wafer, and many of these processes
are performed multiple times. </P>

<P>Applied operates in a single industry segment for the manufacture, marketing
and servicing of semiconductor wafer fabrication equipment. Applied currently
manufactures systems that perform most of the primary steps in the chip
fabrication process, including: CVD, PVD, electroplating, etch, ion
implantation, rapid thermal processing (RTP), CMP, metrology and wafer/reticle
inspection. Applied's subsidiary, AKT, Inc. (AKT), manufactures CVD systems used
to make flat panel displays (FPDs) that are used in notebook computers, desktop
monitors, televisions and other applications. Applied's subsidiary, Etec
Systems, Inc. (Etec), is a leading manufacturer of systems used to generate
circuit patterns on reticles used in the photolithography process. Applied also
provides manufacturing facility (fab) management software to the semiconductor
industry. </P>

<P>Most of Applied's products are single-wafer systems designed with two or more
process chambers attached to a base platform. The platform feeds a wafer to each
chamber, allowing the simultaneous processing of several wafers to enable high
manufacturing productivity and precise control of the process. Applied sells
most of its single-wafer, multi-chamber systems based on four main platforms:
the Centura<SUP>&reg;</SUP>, the Endura<SUP>&reg;</SUP>, the Endura SL&#153;
and the Producer<SUP>&reg;</SUP>. These platforms currently support CVD, PVD,
etch and RTP technologies. </P>

<P>Throughout its history, the semiconductor industry has migrated to
increasingly larger wafer sizes, from one-inch wafers to the 200mm (eight
inches) standard predominant today. To gain the economic advantages of a larger
surface area, the industry has begun using 300mm (12 inches) wafers as the next
wafer size. The surface area of a 300mm wafer is more than two times that of a
200mm wafer. New hardware is needed to process 300mm wafers, although some
&quot;bridge tools&quot; have dual 200mm-300mm capabilities. Applied has
developed and launched a comprehensive line of systems for 300mm wafer
processing for all of its core technologies, supporting more than 90 process
applications. These new systems encompass almost 75 percent of the processes
needed to fabricate advanced 0.13 micron and beyond devices on the wafer,
including deposition, etch, RTP, CMP, ion implantation and inspection
technologies. </P>










<B><P>Products </B></P>

<P>The following summarizes Applied's portfolio of process technologies,
most of which are available for both 200mm and 300mm wafer processing.</P>

<B><I><P>Deposition </B></I><br>
Deposition is a fundamental step in fabricating a chip. During
deposition, a layer of either dielectric (material used as insulation between
conductors) or electrically conductive (material used to carry current) film is
deposited or grown on a wafer. Applied currently provides equipment to perform
the three main types of deposition: CVD, PVD and electroplating. Applied also
offers certain types of dielectric deposition processes using its RTP systems.
</P>

<U><P>Chemical Vapor Deposition</U><br>

CVD is used by chipmakers to deposit dielectric films (insulators) and
metal films (conductors) on a wafer. During the CVD process, gases that contain
atoms of the material to be deposited react on the wafer surface, forming a thin
film of solid material. Films deposited by CVD may be silicon oxide,
single-crystal epitaxial silicon, silicon nitride, dielectric anti-reflective coatings,
low </FONT><FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=2>k</FONT><FONT SIZE=2> (highly efficient
insulating materials), high </FONT><FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=2>k </FONT><FONT
SIZE=2>(electrical charge storing materials), aluminum, titanium, titanium
nitride, tantalum pentoxide, polysilicon, tungsten, refractory metals or
silicides. Applied offers the following CVD products and technologies: </P>

<I><P>Producer </I>- The Producer<B> </B>CVD platforms feature Twin-Chamber&#153;
modules that have two single-wafer process chambers per unit. Up
to three Twin-Chamber modules can be mounted on each Producer platform, giving
it a maximum processing capacity of six wafers at a time for high-throughput
manufacturing. Many of Applied's dielectric CVD film processes can be performed
on this platform. In June 2001, Applied introduced its Producer SE system, which
features advanced productivity for a wide range of dielectric CVD applications.
The Producer platform also features integrated metrology technology that
automatically measures the thickness and uniformity of the deposited film. By
mid-fiscal 2001, over 350 Producer systems had been shipped to customers
worldwide.</P>

<I><P>Ultima HDP-CVD&#153; Centura</I> - High-density plasma CVD (HDP-CVD) is
used to fill very small, deep spaces with dielectric film. One of the processes
offered on the system is fluorinated silicate glass (FSG), a material that has
better insulating capability than conventional oxide materials. These types of
films are referred to as low dielectric constant (low </FONT><FONT FACE="Symbol"
SIZE=2>k</FONT><FONT SIZE=2>) materials. These low </FONT><FONT FACE="Symbol"
SIZE=2>k </FONT><FONT SIZE=2>films enable faster chip performance. A number of
major customers have been using FSG deposition for manufacturing, making it the
first low </FONT><FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=2>k</FONT><FONT SIZE=2>
dielectric film to be used for production chipmaking. The new Ultima X
system, launched in May 2001, incorporates several new technology advances that
extend the Ultima's process applications to 100 nanometer (100nm or 0.10 micron)
and below chipmaking. </P>

<I><P>Other Low </FONT><FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=2>k</FONT><FONT SIZE=2>
Dielectric Films</I> - Throughout fiscal 2001, Applied accelerated its programs
for developing dielectric films with lower </FONT><FONT FACE="Symbol"
SIZE=2>k</FONT><FONT SIZE=2> values to complement the trend of using copper
material for even faster chip speeds. Applied has introduced several low
</FONT><FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=2>k</FONT><FONT SIZE=2> dielectric materials
using its established CVD technologies. Black Diamond&#153;, a silicon-based
low </FONT><FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=2>k</FONT><FONT SIZE=2> dielectric film
launched in fiscal 1999, is designed for copper-based interconnect structures. A
second low </FONT><FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=2>k</FONT><FONT SIZE=2> dielectric,
called BLO</FONT><FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=2>k</FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&#153;
(Barrier Low </FONT><FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=2>k</FONT><FONT SIZE=2>), provides
a low </FONT><FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=2>k</FONT><FONT SIZE=2> solution for
critical barrier layers in semiconductor devices, enabling the complete, multi-layer
dielectric chip structure to benefit from low </FONT><FONT FACE="Symbol"
SIZE=2>k</FONT><FONT SIZE=2> technology. </P>

<I><P>High </FONT><FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=2>k</FONT><FONT SIZE=2> Dielectric
Films</I> - In fiscal 2000, Applied introduced the Giga-Cap&#153; TanOx&#153;
Centura for the deposition of high </FONT><FONT FACE="Symbol"
SIZE=2>k</FONT><FONT SIZE=2> tantalum pentoxide films. The system, which
integrates CVD and RTP technologies, is used to fabricate capacitor structures
in advanced memory chips.</P>

<I><P>Epitaxial Deposition</I> - Epitaxial silicon (epitaxy or epi), used in some
semiconductor devices, is a layer of pure silicon grown in a uniform crystalline
structure on the wafer to form a high quality base for the device circuitry.
Applied has manufactured epitaxial deposition systems for over 30 years. In
fiscal 2000, Applied introduced its latest model, the Epi&nbsp;xP&#153;
Centura, that integrates pre- and post-epi processes on the system to reduce
total epi production costs.</FONT><FONT SIZE=2 COLOR="#0000ff"> </FONT><FONT
SIZE=2>In addition to silicon applications, Applied offers an Epi Centura system
for silicon-germanium (SiGe) epi process technology, which can reduce power
usage and increase speed in certain kinds of advanced chips. </P>

<I><P>Polysilicon Deposition</I> - Polysilicon is a type of silicon used to form
portions of the transistor structure within the semiconductor device. Applied's
latest system, introduced in fiscal 2000, is the PolyGen&#153; Centura, a
single-wafer, multi-chamber product that deposits thin polysilicon films at high
temperatures with improved productivity and process control. A variant of the
system, the Polycide Centura, combines chambers for polysilicon and tungsten
silicide deposition on the Centura platform in an integrated process to create
the polycide structures found in advanced semiconductors. To address the
challenging requirements of 0.15 micron and below devices, Applied has combined
its RTP and polysilicon technologies on one system called the Gate Stack
Centura. This single-system integration of polysilicon with advanced RTP
oxidation and nitridation technology provides superior film quality and material
properties, as well as improved process control. Integrating these technologies
on one high-productivity system lets customers use fewer process steps and
reduce cycle time for their gate fabrication sequence. The process control
provided by the single-wafer approach is superior to batch processing, and is
expected to become increasingly important as transistor structures shrink to
smaller dimensions and as chipmakers move to larger wafer diameters. </P>

<I><P>Silicon Nitride Deposition</I> - Applied offers a single-wafer,
high-temperature system to deposit silicon nitride films, called the SiNgen&#153;
Centura. This system operates at a lower deposition temperature than
conventional methods to minimize the amount of time the wafer is exposed to high
temperatures and to reduce particles while improving many areas of operating
cost and productivity in critical transistor nitride layers for sub-0.18 micron
devices.</P>

<I><P>Tungsten Deposition</I> - Tungsten is the basic material used to connect the
multiple layers of metal wiring on a chip. For many years, Applied has been a
leading provider of systems to deposit tungsten. In fiscal 2001, Applied
launched the Sprint&#153; Plus Centura to fill the tight geometries required in
100nm generation chip designs. In addition, Applied introduced an ALD (Atomic
Layer Deposition) chamber that can be integrated with the Sprint Plus system for
depositing tungsten and titanium-based films.</P>

<U><P>Physical Vapor Deposition </U><br>
PVD, also called sputtering, is a physical process in which atoms of a
gas, such as argon, are accelerated at a metal target. The metal atoms chip off,
or sputter away, and are then deposited on the wafer. The Endura PVD platform
offers a broad range of advanced deposition processes, including aluminum,
titanium/titanium nitride (Ti/TiN), tantalum/tantalum nitride and copper (Cu).
This platform passed its 2,000<SUP>th</SUP> system shipment by the end of fiscal
2000. The Endura's highly flexible, multi-chamber architecture allows the
integration of multiple PVD processes or combinations of metal CVD and PVD
technologies on the same system. The Endura's PVD Ti technology can be coupled
with either CVD TiN or PVD TiN processes to form the critical lining layers of
interconnect structures. These structures are subsequently bulk-filled with
tungsten, aluminum or other film materials. A new, high-throughput version of
the Endura platform, called Endura SL, was introduced in fiscal 2000 for
applications benefiting from its efficient wafer handling and greater
operational flexibility. A new technology for depositing critical barrier/seed
films in copper-based devices and liner/barrier films in aluminum-based chips,
called SIP&#153; (self-ionized plasma), was introduced in early fiscal 2001 to
extend PVD to smaller geometries. </P>

<I><P>Systems for Copper-Based Devices</I> - A majority of
process steps used in chipmaking are performed to build the interconnect, a
complex matrix of microscopic wires that carry electrical signals to connect the
transistor and capacitor components of the chip. Chipmakers are beginning to
shift from using aluminum as the main conducting material for the interconnect
circuitry to copper, which has lower resistance than aluminum and can carry more
current in a smaller area. </P>

<P>Applied is a leading supplier of systems for copper-based chipmaking, with
systems that perform deposition of the barrier and seed layers (Endura Electra
Cu<SUP>&reg;</SUP> Barrier &amp; Seed), copper bulk-fill by electroplating
(Electra Cu ECP), and copper planarization by CMP (Mirra Mesa&#153;). In
addition, Applied makes a full line of systems for depositing and etching the
dielectric layers used in the copper interconnect and for inspection and
metrology.</P>

<P>The Endura Electra Cu Barrier &amp; Seed system, launched in fiscal 1998, is
widely used by chipmakers for fabricating copper-based chips. Using PVD
technology, the system sequentially deposits the critical layers that prevent
copper material from entering other areas of the device and prime the structure
for subsequent deposition of bulk copper material by electroplating. This year,
Applied announced the industry's first CVD titanium silicon nitride (TiSiN)
process for the Endura system, enabling high-performance barrier films for
sub-100nm device generations.</P>

<U><P>Electroplating</U><br>
Electroplating is a process by which metal atoms are removed from a
chemical fluid (an electrolyte) and deposited on the surface of an object
immersed in the electrolyte. Its main application is to deposit copper in
circuit wiring structures following the deposition of barrier and seed
layers.</P>



<P>Launched in April 1999, the Electra Cu ECP (ElectroChemical Plating) was
Applied's first system to use electroplating technology. The Electra Cu ECP
system offers the first completely automated ECP chemical management technology
to the industry and provides process control and productivity not available in
manually controlled systems. The Electra Cu ECP's high-throughput system
architecture features two twin-cell modules that allow the simultaneous
processing of four wafers. In fiscal 2000, Applied introduced the industry's
first integrated ECP system, combining copper deposition with critical heat
treatment and wafer edge clean processes on a single platform. </P>


<B><I><P>Etch<br>
</B></I>Etching is used many times throughout the semiconductor manufacturing
process to selectively remove material from the surface of a wafer. Before
etching begins, the wafer is coated with a light-sensitive film, called
photoresist,<B> </B>and is exposed to a circuit pattern during a
photolithography process step that projects the circuit pattern onto the wafer.
Etching removes material only from areas dictated by the photoresist pattern. </P>

<P>Applied offers systems for etching three basic types of materials: metal,
silicon and dielectric films. Applied extended an established etch technology,
called magnetically enhanced reactive ion etch, into the 0.18 to 0.13 micron
generation where it operates with high productivity and low cost of ownership in
high-volume production environments. The Dielectric Etch eMax&#153; Centura was
introduced in fiscal 2000 as an extension of Applied's MxP+ and Super
<I>e</I>&#153; dielectric process chamber designs. </P>

<P>For etching advanced conducting films, Applied launched its latest
generations of DPS systems in fiscal 2001, the Metal Etch DPS&#153; II and
Silicon Etch DPS&#153; II Centura systems, offering customers the technology,
productivity and reliability required for 100nm and below processing. Applied
also introduced a new system, the Silicon Etch HART&#153;, for etching very
small and deep structures. The Transforma&#153; etch patterning system combines
silicon etch technology with new optical critical dimension metrology capability
to enable chipmakers to improve process control, device yield and overall fab
cycle time. </P>

<B><I><P>Ion Implantation<br>
</B></I>During ion implantation, silicon wafers are bombarded by a
high-velocity beam of ions, called dopants, that penetrate (or implant) the film
surface to a desired depth. Implantation occurs in the transistor structure and
changes the properties of the material in which the dopants are implanted to
achieve a particular electrical performance. </P>

<P>Fiscal 2001 saw the acceleration of an industry trend toward low-energy
implantation, which enables the fabrication of smaller structures and thus
contributes to faster transistor performance. Applied's industry-leading
low-energy implantation technology, featuring the Quantum&#153; LEAP (low-energy
advanced processing) system, has gained major acceptance<B> </B>by many
chipmakers to create thinner, more advanced transistor structures. </P>

<P>In early fiscal 2001, Applied launched an ion implantation system, called
Swift<SUP>&reg;</SUP>, that combines the functions of two traditional implant
technologies - high-energy and medium current - in one system. This system
introduces several advances in doping accuracy and wafer positioning that will
be required for devices as they approach the 100nm generation. With the Swift
system, Applied has broadened its product line to include virtually every ion
implant application for advanced chip production. </P>



<B><I><P>Rapid Thermal Processing<br>
</B></I>RTP subjects a wafer to a very brief burst of intense heat that can
take the wafer from room temperature to more than 1,000 degrees Celsius in less
than 10 seconds. RTP, used mainly for modifying the properties of deposited
films, activates dopant atoms in the device after implantation by using
processes such as annealing. Applied's RTP systems, which include the RTP
Xe<I>plus&#153;</I> and Radiance&#153; Centura products, offer advances in
temperature and ramp rate control as well as other features aimed at providing
leading-edge capability for sub-0.15 micron generations. These single-wafer
systems have also gained increasing acceptance for growing high quality oxide
and oxynitride films, deposition steps that have traditionally been assigned to
furnaces. This trend to single-wafer processing versus batch furnaces is
expected to continue as the industry transitions to larger 300mm wafers. </P>




<B><I><P>Chemical Mechanical Polishing<br>
</B></I>CMP removes material from a wafer to create a flat (planarized)
surface. This allows subsequent photolithography patterning steps to take place
with greater accuracy and enables film layers to build up with minimal height
variations. CMP is performed primarily in the interconnect structure of the
chip, where it is used multiple times, and is especially crucial to fabricating
copper-based chips to define the circuit wires that create the interconnect.
Applied entered the CMP market in 1995 with its Mirra<SUP>&reg;</SUP> system and
has since added several important features to this product, including integrated
film measurement and inspection capabilities. In fiscal 1999, the Mirra Mesa was
introduced to provide customers with integrated cleaning technology. By
mid-fiscal 2001, Applied had shipped its 1,000<SUP>th</SUP> CMP system, including
over 100 systems for polishing copper.</P>

<B><I><P>Metrology and Wafer/Reticle Inspection<br>
</B></I>Applied produces several types of products that are used to inspect
the wafer during various stages of the fabrication process. Applied also
supplies an inspection system to photomask manufacturers that is used to detect
defects on quartz plates, called reticles or masks. These reticles are used by
photolithography systems to transfer microscopic circuit designs onto wafers.
The reticle must be defect-free with perfect image fidelity because any
imperfection will be replicated on the wafer.</P>


<U><P>Critical Dimension and Defect Review Scanning Electron Microscopes
(CD-SEMs and DR-SEMs)<BR>
</U>Scanning electron microscopes (SEMs) use an electron beam to form images of
microscopic features of a semiconductor wafer at extremely high magnification.
Applied provides chipmakers with operator-free automation, along with the high
accuracy and sensitivity needed for measuring advanced-generation feature sizes.
Introduced in fiscal 1999, the VeraSEM&#153; extends CD-SEM technology beyond
critical dimension measurement to also enable the monitoring of multiple process
parameters. In fiscal 2000, Applied introduced the VeraSEM 3D, which enables
users to perform three-dimensional imaging of chip features down to 0.10 micron
and achieves greater efficiency. </P>

<P>DR-SEMs review defects on the wafer (i.e., particles, scratches or residues)
that are first located by other detection systems and then classify the defects
to identify their source. The high-throughput, fully automatic technology of
Applied's SEMVision&#153; DR-SEM enables customers to use DR-SEM technology as
an integral part of their production lines, rather than using it off-line to
occasionally sample wafers. Over 100 SEMVision systems had been shipped to
customers by early fiscal 2001.</P>





<U><P>Wafer Inspection <br>
</U>Using laser-based technology, defects can be detected on patterned wafers
(wafers with circuit images printed on them) as they move between processing
steps. Defects may include particles, open circuit lines, shorts between lines
or other problems. In July 2000, Applied introduced Compass&#153;, the
industry's first system to detect critical defects in devices with design rules
as small as 0.10 micron and below at the high speeds required for chipmakers'
volume production lines. A second system, called Excite&#153;, was also
introduced for monitoring the condition of process tools. The system identifies
particle excursions right after processing, reducing the need for costly
monitoring of wafers and increasing overall fab efficiency.</P>



<U><P>Reticle Inspection<br>
</U>The ARIS-100i&#153; system is an automated, ultraviolet wavelength-based
advanced inspection system for reticles used in 0.18 micron<B> </B>and below
generation devices. The system features enhanced image acquisition technology,
data handling capabilities and sensitivity for the most advanced mask
designs.</P>

<B><I><P>Flat Panel Displays <br>
</B></I>The most advanced FPDs are manufactured using technologies similar to
those for making semiconductors. One difference is the vastly larger area of the
substrate (panel). Compared to today's largest wafers (300mm diameter), the
panels can be up to 15 times larger. Applied began development of FPD process
technology in 1990, beginning with a CVD process. In fiscal 2000, AKT introduced
several new systems and technology capabilities. The AKT 5500 CVD system and AKT
10K CVD systems expanded its product line to include systems for larger
substrate sizes, including the one square meter Generation 5 size represented by
the 10K system. In addition, a new CVD process was introduced to enable the
manufacture of polysilicon-based screens used in next-generation communications
applications. </P>


<B><I><P>Factory Management Software<br>
</B></I>The Consilium WorkStream&#153; and FAB300&#153; products are
designed for semiconductor and FPD manufacturers to control and optimize their
facility operations. In fiscal 2000, FAB300 version 2.0 was announced, a wafer
fab management software package specifically designed to meet the requirements
of 300mm wafer production. The FAB300 2.0 product integrates a full complement
of operating modules, enabling chipmakers to easily manage 300mm wafer movement
and equipment operation in a single, fully automated, fab-wide solution. </P>





<B><I><P>Mask Pattern Generation Systems<br>
</B></I>Mask pattern generation systems use precision lasers or electron
beams to write (or pattern) each layer of a semiconductor chip's design onto a
piece of chrome-coated quartz glass. Introduced in 2001, the advanced
MEBES<SUP>&reg;</SUP> eXara&#153; is an electron-beam system for leading-edge
maskmaking. The latest ALTA<SUP>&reg;</SUP> 4000, a laser beam system launched
in 2001, provides mainstream, high-throughput production capability. A new
system was introduced in fiscal 2001 for etching photomasks, the Tetra&#153;
Photomask Etch system. This product uses dry etch technology to fabricate the
most advanced photomasks, which are required for 100nm and below chipmaking.</P>


<B><P>Customer Service and Support</P>

</B><P>Applied's customer service organization plays a critical role in
Applied's ability to continuously satisfy its customers' production
requirements. Approximately 4,000 highly trained customer engineers and process
support engineers are deployed in more than a dozen countries. These engineers
are usually located at or near the customers' fab sites and service
approximately 17,000 Applied systems. </P>

<P>In fiscal 1999, Applied introduced a new line of service products, called
Total Service Solutions&#153; (TSS), that offers an innovative approach to
maintaining and servicing Applied's equipment in the fab. In one aspect of the
TSS program, called Total Parts Management<SUP>&reg;</SUP> (TPM), Applied is
responsible for the spare parts used in its equipment at a customer's fab site.
Under TPM, chipmakers no longer need to own or manage inventory for their
Applied systems. A second product, called Total Support Package<SUP>&reg;</SUP>
(TSP), is a comprehensive equipment service solution that includes parts
inventory management and maintenance, with operating cost reduction and system
performance improvement guarantees for their Applied equipment. Launched in
2001, SparesSolutions&#153; is an on-line customer support application that
provides a simple, fast and cost-effective way for customers to obtain spare
parts for their Applied systems.</P>




<B><P>Backlog</P>

</B><P>Applied's backlog decreased from $4.4 billion at October 29, 2000 to $2.7
billion at October 28, 2001. Backlog adjustments for fiscal 2001 included
cancellations of $882 million and currency and other adjustments of $229
million, partially offset by a positive adjustment of $571 million to reinstate
backlog for revenue that will be recognized in future periods due to the
implementation of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 (SAB 101), &quot;Revenue
Recognition in Financial Statements.&quot; For further details regarding the
implementation of SAB 101, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements. Applied schedules production of its systems based on order backlog
and customer commitments. Backlog includes only orders for which written
authorizations have been accepted, shipment dates within 12 months have been
assigned and revenue has not been recognized. However, customers may delay
delivery of products or cancel orders suddenly and without sufficient notice,
subject to possible cancellation penalties. Due to possible customer changes in
delivery schedules and cancellations of orders, Applied's backlog at any
particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding
period. Delays in delivery schedules and/or a reduction of backlog during any
particular period could have a material adverse effect on Applied's business and
results of operations.</P>

<B><P>Manufacturing, Raw Materials and Supplies</P>

</B><P>Applied's manufacturing activities consist primarily of assembling
various commercial and proprietary components into finished systems, with pilot
manufacturing principally located in Santa Clara, California and volume
manufacturing in Austin, Texas. Applied also has manufacturing operations in
Hayward, California; Hillsboro, Oregon; Horsham, England and Rehovot, Israel.
Production requires some raw materials and a wide variety of mechanical and
electrical components to be manufactured to Applied's specifications. Applied
uses numerous domestic and international vendors to supply parts, components and
subassemblies (collectively, &quot;parts&quot;) for the manufacture and support
of its products. Applied has embarked on a strategy of increasing the value-add
of subassembly suppliers in the manufacture of many of its new products.
Although Applied makes reasonable efforts to ensure that parts are available
from multiple qualified suppliers, this is not always possible; accordingly,
some key parts may be obtained only from a single supplier or a limited group of
suppliers. Applied has sought, and will continue to seek, to minimize the risk
of production and service interruptions and/or shortages of key parts by: 1)
selecting and qualifying alternative suppliers for key parts; 2) monitoring the
financial stability of key suppliers; and 3) maintaining appropriate inventories
of key parts. If Applied does not receive a sufficient quantity of parts in a
timely and cost-effective manner to meet its production requirements, Applied's
results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.</P>


<B><P>Research, Development and Engineering </P>

</B><P>Applied's long-term growth strategy requires continued development of new
semiconductor and FPD manufacturing products. Applied's significant investment
in research, development and engineering (RD&amp;E) has generally enabled it to
deliver new products and technologies before the emergence of strong demand,
thus allowing customers to incorporate these products into their manufacturing
plans at an early stage in the technology selection cycle. Applied works closely
with its global customers to design systems that meet their planned technical
and production requirements. Engineering organizations are located in the United
States, the United Kingdom, Israel and Japan, with process support and customer
demonstration laboratories in the United States, the United Kingdom, Israel,
Japan and Taiwan.</P>

<P>Applied invested $740 million (14.5 percent of net sales) for fiscal 1999,
$1.1 billion (11.6 percent of net sales) for fiscal 2000 and $1.2 billion (16.3
percent of net sales) for fiscal 2001 in RD&amp;E for product development and
engineering programs to improve or sustain existing product lines. Applied has
spent an average of 14.2 percent of net sales on RD&amp;E over the last five
years. In addition to RD&amp;E for specific product technologies, Applied
maintains ongoing programs in software, automation control systems, materials
research and environmental control that have applications to its products. Key
activities during fiscal 2001 included development of wafer fabrication
equipment for smaller chip feature sizes, copper-based devices and 300mm wafers.
Applied also continued the development of its Process Module&#153; concept, the
integration of multiple individual systems with metrology and inspection
capabilities and specialized software for feedforward/feedback process control.
These systems operate as a single, highly automated unit to perform a particular
wafer processing application in a customer's manufacturing process to a
specified level of performance. Applied expects this concept to save customers
critical process development and facility start-up time, enabling them to bring
new chip technologies to market more quickly.</P>


<B><P>Marketing and Sales</P>

</B><P>Because of the highly technical nature of its products, Applied markets
and sells its products worldwide through a direct sales force. For fiscal 2001,
net sales as a percent of Applied's total net sales to customers in each region
were: North America (primarily the United States) 29 percent, Japan 26 percent,
Taiwan 15 percent, Europe 15 percent, Asia-Pacific 9 percent and Korea 6
percent. Applied's business is usually not seasonal in nature, but it is
cyclical based on the capital equipment investment patterns of major
semiconductor manufacturers. These expenditure patterns are based on many
factors, including anticipated market demand for integrated circuits, the
development of new technologies and global and regional economic conditions.</P>

<P>Information on net sales to unaffiliated customers and
long-lived assets attributable to Applied's geographic regions is included in
Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For fiscal 1999 and
fiscal 2001, Intel Corporation accounted for more than 10 percent of Applied's
net sales. For fiscal 2000, no individual customer accounted for more than 10
percent of Applied's net sales. </P>




<B><P>Competition</P>

</B><P>The global semiconductor equipment industry is highly competitive and is
characterized by increasingly rapid technological advancements and demanding
worldwide service requirements. Applied's ability to compete depends on its
ability to commercialize its technology and continually improve its products,
processes and services, as well as its ability to develop new products that meet
constantly evolving customer requirements. Significant competitive factors for
succeeding in the semiconductor manufacturing equipment market include the
equipment's technical capability, productivity and cost-effectiveness, overall
reliability, ease of use and maintenance, contamination and defect control, and
the level of technical service and support provided by the vendor. The
importance of each of these factors varies depending on the specific customer's
needs and criteria, including considerations such as the customer's process
application, product requirements, timing of the purchase and particular
circumstances of the purchasing decision. The pace of technological change is
rapid, with customers continually moving to smaller critical dimensions and
larger wafer sizes and adopting new materials for use in semiconductor
manufacturing. Sometimes, existing technology can be adapted to the new
requirements; however, the new requirements sometimes create the need for an
entirely new technical approach. The rapid pace of technological change
continually creates new opportunities for existing competitors and start-ups,
and can quickly diminish the value of existing technologies.</P>

<P>Substantial competition exists for each of Applied's products. Competitors
range from small companies that compete with a single innovative product to
companies with a large and diverse line of semiconductor processing products.
Competitors in a given technology tend to have different degrees of market
presence in the various regional markets. Management believes that Applied is a
strong competitor and that Applied's competitive position is based on the
ability of its products and services to continue to address customer
requirements. Success for Applied will require a continued high level of
investment in RD&amp;E and in sales and marketing. However, new products, rapid
changes in technology and other competitive actions from both new and existing
competitors could materially and adversely affect Applied's market position.</P>



<B><P>Patents and Licenses</P>

</B><P>Management believes that Applied's competitive position is significantly
dependent upon skills in engineering, production and marketing, rather than just
on its patent position. However, protection of Applied's technology assets by
obtaining and enforcing patents is important. Therefore, Applied has a program
to file patent applications in the U.S. and other countries for inventions that
Applied considers significant. Applied has a number of patents in the U.S. and
other countries, and additional applications are pending for new developments in
its equipment and processes. In addition to patents, Applied also possesses
other proprietary intellectual property, including trademarks, know-how, trade
secrets and copyrights.</P>

<P>Applied enters into patent and technology licensing agreements with other
companies when management determines that it is in Applied's best interest to do
so. Applied pays royalties under existing patent license agreements for the use,
in several of its products, of certain patented technologies that are licensed
to Applied for the life of the patents. Applied also receives royalties from
licenses granted to third parties. Royalties received from third parties have
not been, and are not expected to be, material.</P>

<P>In the normal course of business, Applied from time to time receives and
makes inquiries regarding possible patent infringement. In dealing with such
inquiries, it may become necessary or useful for Applied to obtain or grant
licenses or other rights. However, there can be no assurance that such licenses
or rights will be available to Applied on commercially reasonable terms.
Although there can be no assurance about the outcome of existing patent
infringement inquiries, Applied believes it is unlikely that their resolution
will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of
operations.</P>




<B><P>Environmental Matters</P>

</B><P>Two of Applied's locations have been designated as environmental cleanup
sites since 1987. The United States Environmental Protection Agency designated
one of the locations, in Santa Clara, California, as a Superfund site and named
Applied as a &quot;Responsible Party.&quot; Cleanup activities have been
underway at this site since 1984. The California Regional Water Quality Control
Board has designated Applied as a &quot;Discharger&quot; with respect to the
other site in Sunnyvale, California. Applied was named a Discharger at the
Sunnyvale site because it currently owns the site in question, although prior
owners and operators are being required to perform cleanup and monitoring
activities. Applied has also been cited by local authorities for instances of
noncompliance with local and/or state environmental laws, and in each such
instance, those allegations have been resolved. Neither compliance with federal,
state and local provisions regulating discharge of materials into the
environment, nor remedial agreements or other actions relating to the
environment, has had, or is expected to have, a material effect on Applied's
capital expenditures, financial condition, results of operations or competitive
position.</P>

<B><P>Employees</P>

</B><P>At October 28, 2001, Applied employed 17,365 regular employees. On
December 12, 2001, Applied announced a headcount reduction of approximately
1,700 positions, or 10 percent of its global workforce, in response to the
continuing downturn in the semiconductor industry. At December 23, 2001, Applied
employed 16,263 regular employees. In the high-technology industry, competition
for highly-skilled employees is intense. Applied believes that its future
success is highly dependent upon on its continued ability to attract and retain
qualified employees. There can be no assurance that Applied will be able to
attract, hire, assimilate and retain a sufficient number of qualified people.
None of Applied's employees are represented by a trade union, and management
considers its relations with employees to be good.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Item 3:  Legal Proceedings</P>

<P>Novellus</B><br>
After Varian Associates, Inc. (Varian) failed to respond to requests by
Applied to discuss patent issues, on June 13, 1997, Applied filed a lawsuit
against Varian, captioned Applied Materials, Inc. v. Varian Associates, Inc.
(case no. C-97-20523-RMW) in the United States District Court for the Northern
District of California, alleging infringement of several of Applied's patents
concerning PVD technology. On July 7, 1997, Applied amended that action to
allege infringement of those same Applied PVD patents against Novellus Systems,
Inc. (Novellus) and to add Novellus as a defendant, as a result of Novellus'
acquisition of Varian's thin film systems PVD business. On June&nbsp;23, 1997,
Novellus filed a separate lawsuit against Applied captioned Novellus Systems,
Inc. v. Applied Materials, Inc. (case no. C-97-20551-EAI) in the United States
District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging infringement by
Applied of several PVD technology patents that were formerly owned by Varian.
Novellus seeks damages for past infringement, a permanent injunction, treble
damages for willful infringement, pre-judgment interest and attorneys' fees. In
September 2000, Applied and Varian settled their disputes, and on October 3,
2000, Applied's claims against Varian and Varian's claims and counterclaims
against Applied were dismissed with prejudice. The litigation with Novellus
continues. Fact discovery has closed in the actions. The court has canceled an
August 2001 trial date and no new trial date has been set. Applied believes it
has meritorious claims and defenses and intends to pursue them vigorously.</P>

<B><P>Plasma Physics</B><br>
On April 17, 2000, Applied filed a lawsuit against Plasma Physics Corp.
(PPC) and Solar Physics Corp. (SPC). The lawsuit seeks a judicial declaration
that Applied's CVD equipment does not infringe two patents owned by PPC and
exclusively licensed to SPC and/or that those patents are invalid or
unenforceable. On July 31, 2000, PPC and SPC answered the complaint and filed a
conditional counterclaim alleging that Applied had contributed to or induced
others to infringe the two patents. PPC and SPC seek an injunction prohibiting
infringement by Applied and an award of costs, expenses and attorneys' fees. The
counterclaim is conditional because PPC and SPC have stated that they will not
sue Applied for infringement of the two patents if the Court dismisses the
lawsuit initiated by Applied for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The Court
subsequently denied without prejudice PPC's and SPC's motion to dismiss the
lawsuit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, but stated that PPC and SPC
could renew the motion to dismiss, if appropriate, after further discovery. On
September 13, 2001, Applied filed an amended complaint adding two new causes of
action to the existing declaratory judgment claims. The new claims allege that
PPC and SPC have violated the Lanham Act and engaged in unfair competition by
willfully making false or misleading statements about Applied's equipment.
Discovery has commenced. The Court has ordered the parties to be ready for trial
by October 1, 2002 but has not yet set a trial date. Applied believes it has
meritorious claims and defenses and intends to pursue them vigorously.</P>

<B><P>U.S. Department of Justice, Antitrust Division</B><br>
In September 2000, Applied received notice from the Department of
Justice, Antitrust Division that it had begun an investigation into Applied's
licensing of technology. Although neither the extent nor the outcome of this
investigation can be determined at this time, Applied does not believe that the
outcome will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or
results of operations.</P>

<B><P>Axcelis Technologies</B><br>
On January 8, 2001, Axcelis Technologies, Inc. (Axcelis), formerly a
subsidiary of Eaton Corporation, filed a lawsuit in the United States District
Court for the District of Massachusetts, captioned Axcelis Technologies, Inc. v.
Applied Materials, Inc. (case no. 01-10029 DPW). The lawsuit alleges that
Applied infringes a patent concerning ion implantation owned by Axcelis. The
complaint also alleges various Massachusetts state and common law tortious
interference and unfair competition claims. Axcelis seeks a preliminary and
permanent injunction, damages, costs and attorneys' fees. On April 12, 2001,
Applied answered the complaint by denying all allegations and counterclaiming
for declaratory judgment of invalidity and non-infringement, and violations of
various unfair and deceptive trade practices laws. Applied seeks damages, a
permanent injunction, costs and attorneys' fees. Fact and expert discovery have
closed. Summary judgment motions have been filed and are pending before the
Court. No trial date has been set. Applied believes it has meritorious defenses
and counterclaims to the action and intends to pursue them vigorously.</P>

<B><P>Linear Technology Corp.</B><br>
On March 2, 2001, Linear Technology Corp. (LTC) filed a third party
complaint against Applied in the United States District Court for the Eastern
District of Texas, captioned Texas Instruments, Inc. v. Linear Technology Corp.
v. Applied Materials, Inc. (case no. 2-01-CV4 (DF)). The complaint against
Applied alleges that Applied is obligated to indemnify LTC and defend LTC for
certain claims in the underlying patent infringement lawsuit brought by Texas
Instruments, Inc. (TI) against LTC. The complaint also alleges claims for breach
of contract, breach of warranty and various unfair business practices. In the
complaint, LTC alleges that Applied failed to disclose to LTC, before LTC
purchased certain equipment from Applied, that TI previously had won a jury
verdict against Hyundai Electronics Industries Co., Ltd. (Hyundai) for patent
infringement based on Hyundai's use of certain semiconductor equipment including
some Applied tools. LTC's lawsuit against Applied seeks indemnification and
damages from Applied and an order requiring Applied to defend LTC in the
underlying lawsuit with TI. Applied has brought a motion to dismiss all claims.
The motion is pending before the court. Discovery is proceeding. No trial date
has been set. Applied believes it has meritorious defenses to the action and
intends to pursue them vigorously.</P>

<B><P>Semitool, Inc.</B><br>
On June 11, 2001, Semitool, Inc. (Semitool) filed a lawsuit against
Applied in the United States District Court for the Northern District of
California, captioned Semitool, Inc. v. Applied Materials, Inc. (case no.
CV-01-2277 CRB). The lawsuit alleges that Applied infringes a patent concerning seed
repair and electroplating owned by Semitool. Semitool seeks a preliminary and
permanent injunction, damages, costs and attorneys' fees. On July 12, 2001,
before Applied had answered the complaint, Semitool voluntarily dismissed its
action against Applied in the Northern District of California. On the same day,
Semitool filed a substantially identical action against Applied in the United
States District Court for the District of Oregon, captioned Semitool, Inc. v.
Applied Materials, Inc. (case no. CV'01-1066 AS). On July 13, 2001, Applied
filed a declaratory judgment action against Semitool in the Northern District of
California, captioned Applied Materials, Inc. v. Semitool, Inc. (case no.
CV-01-2673 BZ). In that action, Applied seeks a declaration that Applied has not
infringed the Semitool patent and that Semitool's patent is invalid and
unenforceable. Applied also seeks costs and attorneys' fees. The California
Court has ordered Applied's action against Semitool transferred to the District
of Oregon. The actions are proceeding together in Oregon. Discovery is ongoing.
No trial date has been set. Applied believes it has meritorious claims and
defenses and intends to pursue them vigorously.</P>

<B><P>David Scharf</B><br>
On July 31, 2001, an individual, David Scharf, filed a lawsuit against
Applied in the United States District Court for the Central District of
California, captioned David Scharf v. Applied Materials, Inc. (case no. 01-06580
AHM). The lawsuit alleges that Applied infringes, has induced others to infringe
and has contributed to others' infringement of a patent concerning color
synthesizing scanning electron microscope technology. Mr. Scharf seeks a
preliminary and permanent injunction, damages and costs. Applied has answered
the complaint and counterclaimed for declaratory judgment of non-infringement
and invalidity. Discovery is proceeding. No trial date has been set. Applied
believes it has meritorious defenses and counterclaims and intends to pursue
them vigorously.</P>

<P>Applied is subject to various other legal proceedings and claims, either
asserted or unasserted, that arise in the ordinary course of business. Although
the outcome of these claims cannot be predicted with certainty, Applied does not
believe that any of these other existing legal matters will have a material
adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations.</P>

<P>Item 7:  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations</P>
</B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>






<B><P>RESULTS OF OPERATIONS</P>

</B><P>Applied develops, manufactures, markets and services semiconductor wafer
fabrication equipment and related spare parts for the worldwide semiconductor
industry. Demand for Applied's products can change significantly from period to
period as a result of numerous factors, including, but not limited to, changes
in: 1) global economic conditions; 2) supply and demand for semiconductors; 3)
the profitability of semiconductor manufacturers; and 4) advanced technology
and/or capacity requirements of semiconductor manufacturers. For this and other
reasons, Applied's results of operations for fiscal 1999, 2000 and 2001 may not
necessarily be indicative of future operating results.</P>

<P>During the fourth fiscal quarter of 2001, Applied implemented the Securities
and Exchange Commission's Staff Accounting Bulletin No.&nbsp;101 (SAB 101),
&quot;Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements,&quot; retroactively effective
to the beginning of fiscal 2001. Accordingly, the first three fiscal quarters of
2001 have been restated (see Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements). Amounts prior to fiscal 2001 have not been restated.</P>



<B><P>Net Sales<br>
</B>Applied's business was subject to cyclical industry conditions in fiscal
1999, 2000 and 2001. As a result of these conditions, there were significant
fluctuations in Applied's quarterly new orders and net sales, both within and
across fiscal years. Demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment has
historically been volatile as a result of sudden changes in semiconductor supply
and demand and other factors, including rapid technological advances in both
semiconductor devices and wafer fabrication processes. Quarterly new orders and
net sales were as follows:</P>

<sup><p>*</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Primarily the United States.
</font size="2">


<P>In early fiscal 1999, the semiconductor and semiconductor manufacturing
equipment industries were beginning to emerge from a downturn and entered a
period of expansion. As a result of the industry expansion, new orders and net
sales increased sequentially each quarter during fiscal 1999 and fiscal 2000.
Strong demand for Applied's products was driven by semiconductor manufacturers'
needs for additional capacity and new technology to meet consumer demand for
Internet, computing, communications and digital devices. In addition, the
semiconductor industry was continuing the transition to smaller device feature
sizes, new materials, such as copper, and 300mm wafer processing, which required
new manufacturing equipment. For fiscal 2000, Applied was able to achieve record
levels of new orders, net sales and net income as a result of these factors.
During the first fiscal quarter of 2001, slowing worldwide demand for
semiconductors resulted in a rapid decline in demand for manufacturing
equipment. Inventory buildups in telecommunication products, slower than
expected personal computer sales and slower global economic growth caused
semiconductor companies to reevaluate their capital spending and reschedule or
cancel existing orders. This decline in demand deepened sequentially throughout
the remainder of fiscal 2001 into a severe industry downturn due to continued
weakness in the macro-economic climate and consumption of electronic goods,
which resulted in further capital spending cutbacks by Applied's customers.</P>




<B><P>Gross Margin<br>
</B>Gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased from 47.5 percent for
fiscal 1999 to 50.8 percent for fiscal 2000, and decreased to 44.3 percent for
fiscal 2001. The increase in gross margin as a percentage of net sales for
fiscal 2000 was due primarily to higher business volume, reduced manufacturing
cycle times and the favorable effects of operational programs emphasizing
productivity improvements and cost reduction. The decrease in gross margin as a
percentage of net sales for fiscal 2001 was caused primarily by decreased
business volume, which resulted in factory underabsorption, and changes in
product mix with start-up costs of new 300mm products.</P>




<B><P>Research, Development and Engineering<br>
</B>Applied's future operating results depend, to a considerable extent, on
its ability to maintain a competitive advantage in the products and services it
provides. Applied believes that it is critical to continue to make substantial
investments in RD&amp;E to ensure the availability of innovative technology that
meets the current and projected requirements of its customers' most advanced
chip designs. RD&amp;E expenses increased for each of the last three years, from
$740 million (14.5 percent of net sales) for fiscal 1999 to $1.1 billion (11.6
percent of net sales) for fiscal 2000 and to $1.2 billion (16.3 percent of net
sales) for fiscal 2001. </P>

<P>Applied increased its RD&amp;E spending for fiscal 1999 and 2000 to address
customers' requirements for shrinking device feature sizes, the use of new
materials, such as copper, and the transition from 200mm to 300mm wafer
processing. Applied's investment in research and development for copper-based
devices resulted in a broad line of copper-based products available for sale in
fiscal 1999 and 2000. Additionally, Applied developed and launched many new
products and enhanced versions of its existing products and technologies in
fiscal 2000, including 22 new systems for 300mm wafer processing. </P>

<P>During fiscal 2001, Applied continued its development of technologies for
copper and low <FONT FACE="Symbol">&#107;</FONT>
-based chips and 300mm wafers, as well as focusing efforts on the core
technologies that will be required for chipmakers to begin development of 0.10
micron generation devices. Areas of increased investment include maskmaking
technology, metrology and inspection, ion implantation, and products for
depositing and etching new materials. In addition, significant investments were
made to develop Applied's Process Module concept, the integration of multiple
individual systems with metrology and inspection capabilities and specialized
software for feedforward/feedback process control. These systems operate as a
single, highly automated unit to perform a particular wafer processing
application in a customer's manufacturing process to a specified level of
performance.</P>




<B><P>Marketing, Selling, General and Administrative<br>
</B>Marketing, selling, general and administrative (MSG&amp;A) expenses
increased from $695 million (13.6 percent of net sales) for fiscal 1999 to $961
million (10.0 percent of net sales) for fiscal 2000, and decreased to $902
million (12.3 percent of net sales) for fiscal 2001. The increase for fiscal
2000 was primarily caused by higher costs of incentive and benefit programs,
increased investments in various information technology programs, and increased
costs to support higher net sales. The decrease for fiscal 2001 was due
primarily to cost reduction actions and lower business volume. </P>


<B><P>Non-recurring Items<br>
</B>Non-recurring items for fiscal 1999 consisted of $5 million of merger
expenses related to the acquisition of Consilium, Inc., $43 million of acquired
in-process research and development expense incurred in connection with the
acquisitions of AKT and Obsidian, Inc. and $3 million of restructuring charges
associated with Etec's headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities
prior to its acquisition by Applied. </P>

<P>Non-recurring items for fiscal 2000 consisted of $40 million of merger
expenses related to the acquisition of Etec. </P>

<P>During fiscal 2001, Applied recorded pre-tax restructuring charges of $211
million, consisting of $105 million for headcount reductions, $45 million for
consolidation of facilities and $61 million for asset write-offs, primarily for
fixed assets. These restructuring actions occurred in Applied's second, third
and fourth fiscal quarters, and were taken to better align Applied's cost
structure with prevailing market conditions. During the second fiscal quarter of
2001, Applied completed a voluntary separation plan that resulted in a headcount
reduction of approximately 1,000 employees, or three percent of its global
workforce, for a cost of $47 million. During the third fiscal quarter of 2001,
Applied recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $4 million associated with
severance and benefit costs. During the fourth fiscal quarter of 2001, Applied
eliminated approximately 2,000 additional positions, or 10 percent of its global
workforce, for a cost of $54 million. The majority of the affected employees
were based in Santa Clara, California and Austin, Texas, and represented
multiple company activities and functions. Non-recurring items for fiscal 2001
also included $10 million of acquired in-process research and development
expense incurred in connection with the acquisition of Oramir Semiconductor
Equipment Ltd. (Oramir). </P>

<P>For further details, see Note&nbsp;6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements. </P>



<B><P>Non-recurring Income, Net<br>
</B>Net non-recurring income of $30 million for fiscal 1999 and $68 million
for fiscal 2000 were related to a 1998 litigation settlement with ASM
International, N.V. For further details, see Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.</P>



<B><P>Net Interest Income<BR>
</B>Net interest income was $60 million for fiscal 1999, $133 million for fiscal
2000 and $174 million for fiscal 2001. The increases from year to year can be
attributed primarily to increasing cash and investment balances over the
three-year period. </P>


<B><P>Provision for Income Taxes<br>
</B>Applied's effective income tax rate was 32.3 percent for fiscal 1999,
30.0 percent for fiscal 2000 and 29.8 percent for fiscal 2001. Applied's actual
effective income tax rate for fiscal 1999 of 32.3 percent differed from the
expected effective income tax rate of 31.0 percent due to the non-tax deductible
nature of $43 million of acquired in-process research and development expense.
The reduction to a 30.0 percent effective income tax rate for fiscal 2000
resulted primarily from a shift in the geographic composition of pre-tax income
to entities operating in countries with lower tax rates. Applied expected an
effective income tax rate of 29.5 percent for fiscal 2001, which decreased from
the fiscal 2000 effective rate due to a shift in the geographic composition of
Applied's pre-tax income. The actual effective income tax rate for fiscal 2001
of 29.8 percent differed from the expected rate of 29.5 percent due to the
non-tax deductible nature of $10 million of acquired in-process research and
development expense. Applied's future effective income tax rate depends on
various factors, such as tax legislation, the geographic composition of
Applied's pre-tax income, non-tax deductible expenses incurred in connection
with acquisitions and the effectiveness of its tax planning strategies. </P>

<B><P>Business Combinations<br>
</B>On June 27, 2001, Applied acquired Oramir, a supplier of advanced laser
cleaning technologies for semiconductor wafers, in a purchase business
combination for $21 million in cash. For further details, see Note 13 of Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements.</P>

<B><P>SUBSEQUENT EVENTS</P>

<P>Business Combinations</B><br>
During the first fiscal quarter of 2002, Applied acquired the assets of
Schlumberger's electron-beam wafer inspection business. In addition, Applied
acquired Global Knowledge Services, Inc., a provider of advanced data mining
services to improve semiconductor manufacturing yield and efficiency. These
transactions will be accounted for as purchase business combinations. These
acquisitions have not had, and are not expected to have, a material effect on
Applied's financial condition or results of operations. </P>

<B><P>Restructuring<br>
</B>On December 12, 2001, Applied announced a further headcount reduction of
approximately 1,700 positions, or 10 percent of its global workforce, in
response to the continuing downturn in the semiconductor industry. The majority
of the affected employees were based in Santa Clara, California and Austin,
Texas, and represented multiple company activities and functions. Applied will
record a restructuring charge for the first fiscal quarter of 2002.</P>

<B><P>CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING POLICY</P>

</B><P>Applied implemented SAB 101 for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2001,
retroactively effective to the beginning of fiscal 2001. Prior to the
implementation of SAB 101, Applied generally recognized revenue for established
products upon shipment. The implementation of SAB 101 resulted in the following
changes to Applied's revenue recognition practices: 1)&nbsp;for transactions
where legal title does not transfer at shipment, revenue will be recognized upon
title transfer, which is typically at customer technical acceptance; and 2) for
products that have been demonstrated to meet product specifications prior to
shipment, a portion of revenue associated with certain installation-related
tasks will be recognized when the tasks are completed. </P>

<P>Since the implementation was retroactively effective to the beginning of
fiscal 2001, the first three fiscal quarters of 2001 have been restated (see
Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Applied recorded a
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of $267 million (net of
income tax benefit of $112 million), or $0.31 per diluted share, for the
restated first fiscal quarter of 2001. This charge represents the after-tax
difference between the new and previous revenue recognition policies for years
prior to fiscal 2001 as of the implementation date at the beginning of fiscal
2001. Therefore, no restatement of years prior to fiscal 2001 is required. For
periods prior to fiscal 2001, data was not available to provide pro forma
information as if the change in accounting principle was applied retroactively.
The cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of $267 million included
$651 million of revenue recognized prior to fiscal 2001, of which $642 million
was recognized during fiscal 2001.</P>




<B><P>RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS</P>

</B><P>In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;141 (SFAS 141),
&quot;Business Combinations.&quot; SFAS 141 requires the purchase method of
accounting for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 and
eliminates the pooling-of-interests method. Applied does not expect the adoption
of SFAS 141 to have a material effect on its financial condition or results of
operations.</P>

<P>In July 2001, the FASB issued SFAS 142, &quot;Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets,&quot; which requires the discontinuance of goodwill amortization. SFAS
142 is required to be applied for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2001, with certain early adoption permitted. Applied expects to adopt SFAS 142
for its first fiscal quarter of 2002, and does not expect the adoption to have a
material effect on its financial condition or results of operations.</P>

<P>In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS 143,
&quot;Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations.&quot; SFAS 143 addresses
financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the
retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated retirement costs.
Applied is in the process of assessing the effect of adopting SFAS 143, which
will be effective for Applied's fiscal 2003.</P>

<P>In October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS 144, &quot;Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.&quot; SFAS&nbsp;144 supersedes SFAS
121, &quot;Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived
Assets to be Disposed Of,&quot; and addresses financial accounting and reporting
for the impairment of long-lived assets and for long-lived assets to be disposed
of. Applied is in the process of assessing the effect of adopting SFAS 144,
which will be effective for Applied's fiscal 2003.</P>

<B><P>FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES</P></B>

<P>Applied increased its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments from
$4.2 billion at October 29, 2000 to $4.8 billion at October 28, 2001. Applied's
financial condition remained strong, with a ratio of current assets to current
liabilities of 3.2:1 at October 29, 2000 and 5.1:1 at October 28, 2001. </P>

<P>Applied generated cash from continuing operations in each of the last three
fiscal years. The primary source of cash from continuing operations has been
income from continuing operations, as adjusted to exclude the effect of non-cash
items, such as depreciation and amortization and acquired in-process research
and development expense. Income from continuing operations, adjusted to exclude
the effect of non-cash items, was: $1.2 billion for fiscal 1999; $2.6 billion
for fiscal 2000 and $1.4 billion for fiscal 2001. The other source or use of
cash from continuing operations has been attributable to changes in assets and
liabilities other than those assets and liabilities resulting from investing and
financing activities. Net changes in assets and liabilities tend to represent a
use of cash during periods of revenue growth because Applied generally incurs
costs and expends cash in advance of receiving cash from its customers.
Likewise, during periods of declining revenue or slowed revenue growth, net
changes in assets and liabilities tend to represent a source of cash because
expenditures for inventory and other purchases decrease while receivables from
prior periods, which were higher revenue periods, are collected. The cash effect
of changes in assets and liabilities was: a $116 million use for fiscal 1999; a
$923 million use for fiscal 2000; and a $139 million source for fiscal 2001.
</P>

<P>In addition to being driven by revenue and profitability performance, the
cash effect of changes in assets and liabilities is subject to operational
efficiency and productivity. For example, earlier collection of accounts
receivable and increased inventory turnover both have a positive effect on cash
flow. Applied utilized programs to sell accounts receivable of $953 million for
fiscal 1999, $1.5 billion for fiscal 2000 and $1.2 billion for fiscal 2001.
These receivable sales had the effect of increasing cash and reducing accounts
receivable and days sales outstanding. Applied has not experienced any losses
under these programs, and receivables sold under these programs have terms and
credit risk characteristics similar to Applied's overall receivables portfolio.
For further details regarding accounts receivable sales, see Note 12 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements. </P>

<P>Applied used $982 million of cash for investing activities for fiscal 1999,
$1.0 billion for fiscal 2000 and $1.6 billion for fiscal 2001. Investing
activities typically consist of purchases and sales of short-term investments,
purchases of capital assets to support long-term growth and acquisitions of
technology or of other companies to allow Applied to access new market segments
or emerging technology. </P>

<P>Applied generated $127 million of cash from financing activities for fiscal
1999, generated $149 million for fiscal 2000 and used $261 million for fiscal
2001. Financing activities typically include sales and repurchases of Applied's
common stock, as well as borrowings and repayments of debt. Net debt activity
used $17 million of cash for fiscal 1999, generated $50 million of cash for
fiscal 2000 and used $92 million of cash for fiscal 2001. Net common stock
activity generated $144 million of cash for fiscal 1999 and $99 million for
fiscal 2000 as a result of a significant increase in stock sales to employees,
reflecting Applied's higher average stock price, partially offset by stock
repurchases. During fiscal 2001, net common stock activity used $169 million of
cash as stock repurchases increased and stock sales to employees decreased,
reflecting Applied's lower average stock price in fiscal 2001. Since March 1996,
Applied has systematically repurchased shares of its common stock in the open
market to partially fund its stock-based employee benefit and incentive
plans.</P>

<P>At October 28, 2001, Applied's principal sources of liquidity consisted of
$4.8 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, and
approximately $686 million of available credit facilities. For further details
regarding Applied's credit facilities, see Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements. In addition to cash and available credit facilities,
Applied may from time to time raise additional capital in the debt and equity
markets. Applied's liquidity is affected by many factors, some of which are
based on the normal ongoing operations of the business, and others of which
relate to the uncertainties of global economies and the semiconductor and
semiconductor manufacturing equipment industries. Although cash requirements
will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors, Applied's
management believes that cash generated from operations, together with the
liquidity provided by existing cash balances and borrowing capability, will be
sufficient to satisfy Applied's liquidity requirements for the next 12
months.</P>






<B><P>TRENDS, RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES</P>

<P>The highly cyclical semiconductor equipment industry is currently
experiencing a severe, prolonged downturn.<br>
</B>As suppliers to the semiconductor industry, the semiconductor equipment
industry is characterized by up and down business cycles, the timing, length and
volatility of which are difficult to predict. The semiconductor industry has
historically been cyclical because of sudden changes in demand for
semiconductors and capacity requirements, including capacity utilizing the
latest technology. These changes have affected the timing and amounts of
customers' capital equipment purchases and investments in new technology. These
industry cycles create pressure on Applied's net sales, gross margin and net
income. In addition to affecting Applied's suppliers, these cycles challenge key
management, engineering and other employees who are vital to Applied's
success.</P>

<P>Management believes that the current industry downturn may be the steepest
decline in history, and cannot predict when a recovery will begin. During
periods of declining demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment, customers
typically reduce purchases, delay delivery of products and/or cancel orders.
During this downturn, Applied must be able to quickly and effectively align its
cost structure with prevailing market conditions and motivate and retain key
employees. If Applied is unable to achieve its objectives in a timely manner
during the current downturn, there could be a material adverse effect on its
business, financial condition and results of operations. </P>


<B><P>Applied is exposed to the risks associated with industry overcapacity. <br>
</B>Inventory buildups in telecommunication products, slower than expected
personal computer sales and slower global economic growth have dramatically
decreased demand for semiconductors. This decreased demand has resulted in
excess production capacity for semiconductor manufacturers and has caused these
manufacturers to reevaluate their capital spending plans. Delays or
cancellations of orders by semiconductor manufacturers have caused, and may
continue to cause, fluctuations in the utilization of Applied's manufacturing
facilities. Continued decreased demand and overcapacity could materially and
adversely affect Applied's business, financial condition and results of
operations.</P>


<B><P>Applied is exposed to the risks of operating a global business.<br>
</B>Currently, a significant percentage of Applied's revenues result from
sales outside the U.S. Certain manufacturing facilities and suppliers are also
located abroad. Managing Applied's global operations presents challenges,
including periodic regional economic downturns, trade balance issues, varying
business conditions and demands, political instability, U.S. export
restrictions, shipping delays, fluctuations in interest and currency exchange
rates and cultural diversities, among other risks. For example, global
uncertainties with respect to: 1)&nbsp;decreased growth rates of gross domestic
product in various countries; 2)&nbsp;factory capacity utilization;
3)&nbsp;capital spending by semiconductor manufacturers; 4)&nbsp;memory chip
price weakness; and 5) political instability in regions where Applied has
operations, such as Israel and the Asian region, may affect Applied's business,
financial condition and results of operations. </P>

<B><P>Applied operates in a highly competitive industry characterized by
increasingly rapid technological changes.<br>
</B>Applied's competitive advantage and future success depend on its ability
to successfully: 1)&nbsp;develop new products and technologies; 2) develop new
markets in the semiconductor industry for its products and services; 3)
introduce new products to the marketplace in a timely manner; 4) qualify new
products with its customers; and 5) commence and adjust production to meet
customer demands. The introduction of an increasingly broader set of new
products and technologies, including those to support the transition to smaller
device feature sizes, new materials and 300mm wafers, grows increasingly complex
over time. Such new product introductions may involve higher costs and reduced
efficiencies compared to Applied's more established products, and could
adversely affect Applied's gross margins. If Applied does not develop and
introduce new products and technologies in a timely and cost-effective manner in
response to changing market conditions or customer requirements, its competitive
position, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and
adversely affected. </P>


<B><P>Applied is exposed to risks associated with acquisitions. <br>
</B>Applied has made, and may in the future make, acquisitions of, or
significant investments in, businesses with complementary products, services
and/or technologies. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including but not
limited to: 1) diversion of management's attention from other operational
matters; 2) lack of synergy, or the inability to realize expected synergies,
resulting from the acquisition; 3) failure to commercialize purchased
technology; and 4) acquired intangible assets becoming impaired as a result of
technological advancements or worse-than-expected performance of the acquired
company. Mergers and acquisitions are inherently risky and the inability to
effectively manage these risks could materially and adversely affect Applied's
business, financial condition and results of operations. </P>


<B><P>Applied is exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer
base.<br>
</B>Applied's customer base is highly concentrated. Orders from a relatively
limited number of semiconductor manufacturers have accounted for, and will
continue to account for, a substantial portion of Applied's net sales. Sales to
any single customer may vary significantly from quarter to quarter. If current
customers do not continue to place orders, Applied may not be able to replace
these orders with new orders from new customers. The resulting fluctuations
could have a material adverse effect on Applied's business, financial condition
and results of operations.</P>


<B><P>Applied is subject to risks of non-compliance with environmental and
safety regulations.<br>
</B>Applied is subject to environmental and safety regulations in connection
with its business operations, including but not limited to regulations related
to the development, manufacturing and use of its products. From time to time,
Applied receives notices alleging violations of these regulations. It is
Applied's policy to respond promptly to these notices and to take necessary
corrective action. Failure or inability to comply with existing or future
environmental and safety regulations could result in significant remediation
liabilities, the imposition of fines and/or the suspension or termination of
development, manufacturing or use of certain of its products, each of which
could have a material adverse effect on Applied's business, financial condition
and results of operations.</P>

<B><P>Manufacturing interruptions or delays could affect Applied's ability to
meet customer demand.<br>
</B>Applied's business depends on its ability to manufacture products that
meet the rapidly changing demands of its customers. Applied's ability to
manufacture depends in part on the timely delivery of parts, components, and
subassemblies (collectively &quot;parts&quot;) from suppliers. Some key parts
may be obtained only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers.
Significant interruptions of manufacturing operations as a result of the failure
or inability of suppliers to timely deliver quality parts, natural disasters
(such as earthquakes or tornadoes), or other causes (such as software issues or
infrastructure failures) could result in delayed product deliveries or
manufacturing inefficiencies. Any or all of these could materially and adversely
affect Applied's business, financial condition and results of operations. </P>


<B><P>Applied is exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or
claims.<BR>
</B>Applied currently is, and in the future may be, involved in legal
proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement, intellectual property
rights, antitrust, environmental regulations, contracts and other matters (see
Item 3: Legal Proceedings). These legal proceedings and claims, whether with or
without merit, could be time-consuming and expensive to prosecute or defend, and
could divert management's attention and resources. There can be no assurance
regarding the outcome of current or future legal proceedings or claims. In
addition, Applied's intellectual property rights may not provide significant
competitive advantages if they are circumvented, invalidated or obsoleted by the
rapid pace of technological change. Furthermore, the laws of other countries
permit the protection of Applied's proprietary rights to varying extents
compared to U.S. laws. Applied's success is dependent in part upon the
protection of its intellectual property rights. Infringement of Applied's rights
by a third party could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue
opportunities for Applied. If Applied is not able to resolve a claim, negotiate
a settlement of the matter, obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable
terms, and/or successfully prosecute or defend its position, Applied's business,
financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely
affected.</P>




<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Item 7a:  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market
Risk</P>

<P>Interest Rate Risk<br>
</B>At October 28, 2001, Applied's investment portfolio included fixed-income
securities with a fair value of approximately $4.0 billion. These securities are
subject to interest rate risk, and will decline in value if interest rates
increase. Due to the short duration of Applied's investment portfolio, an
immediate 10 percent change in interest rates is not expected to have a material
effect on Applied's near-term financial condition or results of operations.</P>

<P>Applied's long-term debt bears interest at fixed rates; therefore, Applied's
results of operations would only be affected by interest rate changes to the
extent that variable rate short-term notes payable are outstanding. Due to the
short-term nature and insignificant amount of Applied's short-term notes
payable, an immediate 10 percent change in interest rates is not expected to
have a material effect on Applied's near-term financial condition or results of
operations. </P>


<B><P>Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk<br>
</B>Significant operations of Applied are conducted in foreign currencies,
primarily Japanese yen. Applied enters into forward exchange and currency option
contracts to hedge a portion of, but not all, certain existing and anticipated
foreign currency denominated transactions expected to occur within 12 months.
Gains and losses on these contracts are generally recognized in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations at the time that the related transactions being hedged
are recognized. Because the effect of movements in currency exchange rates on
forward exchange and currency option contracts generally offsets the related
effect on the underlying items being hedged, these financial instruments are not
expected to subject Applied to risks that would otherwise result from changes in
currency exchange rates. Applied does not use derivative financial instruments
for trading or speculative purposes. Net foreign currency gains and losses did
not have a material effect on Applied's results of operations for fiscal 1999,
2000 or 2001.</P>

<P>Forward exchange contracts are denominated in the same currency as the
underlying transactions (primarily Japanese yen), and the terms of the forward
exchange contracts generally match the terms of the underlying transactions.
Applied's outstanding forward exchange contracts are marked to market (see Note
2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), as are the majority of the
related underlying transactions being hedged; therefore, the effect of exchange
rate changes on forward exchange contracts is expected to be substantially
offset by the effect of these changes on the underlying transactions. The effect
of an immediate 10 percent change in exchange rates on forward exchange
contracts and the underlying hedged transactions is not expected to be material
to Applied's near-term financial condition or results of operations. Applied's
downside risk with respect to currency option contracts is limited to the
premium paid for the right to exercise the option. Premiums paid for options
outstanding at October 28, 2001 were not material.</P>

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>NOTE 1&nbsp;&nbsp;SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES</P>

<P>Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation</B>&nbsp;  The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Applied Materials,
Inc. and its subsidiaries (Applied) after elimination of intercompany balances
and transactions. </P>

<P>Applied's fiscal year ends on the last Sunday in October of each year. Fiscal
2000 and 2001 contained 52 weeks, whereas fiscal 1999 contained 53 weeks. The
inclusion of an additional week in fiscal 1999 did not have a material effect on
Applied's financial condition or results of operations. </P>

<P>The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated
financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
materially from those estimates.</P>

<B><P>Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments</B>&nbsp;  All highly-liquid
investments with a remaining maturity of three months or less at the time of
purchase are considered to be cash equivalents. All of Applied's short-term
investments are classified as available-for-sale at the balance sheet dates.
Investments classified as available-for-sale are recorded at fair value based
upon quoted market prices, and any material temporary difference between the
cost and fair value of an investment is presented as a separate component of
accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss).</P>

<B><P>Inventories</B> &nbsp; Inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or
market, with cost determined on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis.</P>

<B><P>Property, Plant and Equipment</B> &nbsp; Property, plant and equipment is
stated at cost. Depreciation is provided over the estimated useful lives of the
assets using the straight-line method. Estimated useful lives for financial
reporting purposes are as follows: buildings and improvements, five to 33 years;
demonstration and manufacturing equipment, three to five years; and furniture,
fixtures and other equipment, three to 15 years. Land improvements are amortized
over the shorter of 15 years or the estimated useful life. Leasehold
improvements are amortized over the shorter of five years or the lease term.</P>

<B><P>Intangible Assets</B>&nbsp;  Purchased technology and goodwill are presented at
cost, net of accumulated amortization, and are amortized over their estimated
useful lives of three to 10 years using the straight-line method. </P>

<B><P>Long-Lived Assets</B>&nbsp;  Applied reviews long-lived assets and identifiable
intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable.
Applied assesses these assets for impairment based on estimated future cash
flows from these assets.</P>

<B><P>Advertising Costs  </B>&nbsp;Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.</P>


<B><P>Revenue Recognition</B>&nbsp;  For all transactions where legal title passes to the
customer upon shipment, Applied generally recognizes revenue upon shipment for
all products that have been demonstrated to meet product specifications prior to
shipment. However, a portion of revenue associated with certain installation-related
tasks is recognized when the tasks are completed. For products that have
not been demonstrated to meet product specifications prior to shipment, revenue
is recognized at customer technical acceptance. For transactions where legal
title does not transfer at shipment, revenue is recognized when legal title
passes to the customer, which is typically at customer technical acceptance. A
provision for the estimated cost of warranty is recorded when revenue is
recognized. Prior to fiscal 2001, Applied generally recognized revenue for
established products upon shipment. Spares revenue is generally recognized upon
shipment. Service revenue is generally recognized ratably over the period of the
related contract. </P>

<B><P>Change in Accounting Policy</B> &nbsp; Applied implemented the Securities and
Exchange Commission's Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 (SAB 101), &quot;Revenue
Recognition in Financial Statements,&quot; for the fourth fiscal quarter of
2001, retroactively effective to the beginning of fiscal 2001. Since the
implementation of SAB 101 was retroactively effective to the beginning of fiscal
2001, the first three fiscal quarters of 2001 have been restated (see Note 15).
Applied recorded a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of $267
million (net of income tax benefit of $112 million), or $0.31 per diluted share,
for the restated first fiscal quarter of 2001. This charge represents the after-
tax difference between the new and previous revenue recognition policies prior
to fiscal 2001 as of the implementation date at the beginning of fiscal 2001.
Therefore, no restatement of years prior to fiscal 2001 is required. For periods
prior to fiscal 2001, data was not available to provide pro forma information as
if the change in accounting principle was applied retroactively. SAB 101 had no
effect on Applied's revenue recognition policy for spares or services. The
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of $267 million included
$651 million of revenue recognized prior to fiscal 2001, of which $642 million
was recognized during fiscal 2001.</P>

<B><P>Derivative Financial Instruments</B> &nbsp; Applied uses financial instruments,
such as forward exchange and currency option contracts, to hedge a portion of,
but not all, certain existing and anticipated foreign currency denominated
transactions expected to occur within 12 months. The terms of currency
instruments used for hedging purposes are generally consistent with the timing
of the transactions being hedged. The purpose of Applied's foreign currency
management is to manage the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on certain
foreign currency denominated revenues, costs and eventual cash flows. Applied
adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 (SFAS 133),
&quot;Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,&quot; in the
first fiscal quarter of 2001. Accordingly, all of Applied's derivative financial
instruments are recorded at fair value based upon quoted market prices for
comparable instruments. For derivative instruments designated and qualifying as
cash flow hedges of anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions, the
effective portion of the gain or loss on these hedges is reported as a component
of accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) in stockholders' equity, and is
reclassified into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. If the
transaction being hedged fails to occur, or if a portion of any derivative is
ineffective, the gain or loss on the associated financial instrument is recorded
immediately in earnings. For derivative instruments used to hedge existing
foreign currency denominated assets or liabilities, the gain or loss on these
hedges is recorded immediately in earnings to offset the changes in the fair
value of the assets or liabilities being hedged. Applied does not use derivative
financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.</P>


<B><P>Foreign Currency Translation</B> &nbsp; Applied's subsidiaries located
in Japan and Europe operate primarily using local functional currencies.
Accordingly, all assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated
using exchange rates in effect at the end of the period, and revenues and costs
are translated using average exchange rates for the period. The resulting
translation adjustments are presented as a separate component of accumulated
other comprehensive income/(loss).</P>

<P>Applied's subsidiaries located in Ireland, Italy, Israel, Korea, Taiwan,
Southeast Asia and China primarily use the U.S. dollar as their functional
currency. Accordingly, assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are
translated using exchange rates in effect at the end of the period, except for
non-monetary assets, such as inventories and property, plant and equipment, that
are translated using historical exchange rates. Revenues and costs are
translated using average exchange rates for the period, except for costs related
to those balance sheet items that are translated using historical exchange
rates. The resulting translation gains and losses are included in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations as they are incurred.</P>

<B><P>Employee Stock Plans</B>&nbsp;  As permitted by SFAS 123, &quot;Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation,&quot; Applied elected to continue to apply the
provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 (APB 25),
&quot;Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,&quot; and related
interpretations in accounting for its employee stock option and stock purchase
plans. Applied is generally not required under APB 25 and related
interpretations to recognize compensation expense in connection with its
employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Applied is required by SFAS 123
to present, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, the pro forma
effects on reported net income and earnings per share as if compensation expense
had been recognized based on the fair value method of accounting prescribed by
SFAS 123.</P>

<B><P>Concentrations of Credit Risk</B> &nbsp; Financial instruments that potentially
subject Applied to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally
of cash equivalents, short-term investments, trade accounts receivable and
derivative financial instruments used in hedging activities. Applied invests in
a variety of financial instruments, such as certificates of deposit, corporate
and municipal bonds, and U.S. Treasury and agency securities, and, by policy,
limits the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution or
commercial issuer. Applied's customers consist of semiconductor manufacturers
located throughout the world. Applied performs ongoing credit evaluations of its
customers' financial condition and generally requires no collateral to secure
accounts receivable. Applied maintains a reserve for potentially uncollectible
accounts receivable based on its assessment of the collectibility of accounts
receivable. Applied is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of
nonperformance by counterparties to derivative financial instruments, but does
not expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations.</P>

<B><P>Earnings Per Share</B>&nbsp;  Basic earnings per share is determined using the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted
earnings per share is determined using the weighted average number of common
shares and equivalents (representing the dilutive effect of stock options)
outstanding during the period. Net income has not been adjusted for any period
presented for purposes of computing basic or diluted earnings per share.</P>

<P>For purposes of computing diluted earnings per share, weighted average common
share equivalents do not include stock options with an exercise price that
exceeded the average fair market value of Applied's common stock for the period.
Accordingly, for fiscal 1999, options to purchase approximately 21,590,000
shares of common stock at an average exercise price of $35.80 were excluded from
the computation. For fiscal 2000, options to purchase approximately 2,907,000
shares of common stock at an average exercise price of $84.33 were excluded from
the computation. For fiscal 2001, options to purchase approximately 10,681,000
shares of common stock at an average exercise price of $64.91 were excluded from
the computation. </P>

<B><P>Reclassifications</B> &nbsp; Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified
to conform to the fiscal 2001 presentation.</P>

<B><P>Recent Accounting Pronouncements</B>&nbsp;  In July 2001, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board
(FASB) issued SFAS 141, &quot;Business Combinations.&quot; SFAS 141 supersedes
APB 16, &quot;Business Combinations,&quot; and SFAS 38, &quot;Accounting for
Preacquisition Contingencies of Purchased Enterprises.&quot; SFAS 141 requires
the purchase method of accounting for all business combinations initiated after
June 30, 2001 and eliminates the pooling-of-interests method. Applied does not
expect the adoption of SFAS&nbsp;141 to have a material effect on its financial
condition or results of operations.</P>

<P>In July 2001, the FASB issued SFAS 142, &quot;Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets.&quot; SFAS 142 supersedes APB 17, &quot;Intangible Assets,&quot; and
requires the discontinuance of goodwill amortization. In addition, SFAS 142
includes provisions regarding the reclassification of certain existing
recognized intangibles as goodwill, reassessment of the useful lives of existing
recognized intangibles, reclassification of certain intangibles out of
previously reported goodwill and the testing for impairment of existing goodwill
and other intangibles. SFAS 142 is required to be applied for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2001, with certain early adoption permitted.
Applied expects to adopt SFAS 142 for its first fiscal quarter of 2002, and does
not expect the adoption to have a material effect on its financial condition or
results of operations.</P>

<P>In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS 143, &quot;Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations.&quot; SFAS 143 addresses financial accounting and
reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived
assets and the associated retirement costs. Applied is in the process of
assessing the effect of adopting SFAS 143, which will be effective for Applied's
fiscal 2003.</P>

<P>In October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS 144, &quot;Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,&quot; which supersedes SFAS 121,
&quot;Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived
Assets to be Disposed Of.&quot; SFAS 144 addresses financial accounting and
reporting for the impairment of long-lived assets and for long-lived assets to
be disposed of. However, SFAS 144 retains the fundamental provisions of SFAS 121
for: 1) recognition and measurement of the impairment of long-lived assets to be
held and used; and 2) measurement of long-lived assets to be disposed of by
sale. SFAS 144 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001.
Applied is in the process of assessing the
effect of adopting SFAS 144, which will be effective for
Applied's fiscal 2003.</P>

</pre>


<P>Gross realized gains and losses on sales of short-term investments were
not material for fiscal 1999, 2000 or 2001. Applied
manages its cash equivalents and short-term investments as a single portfolio of
highly marketable securities that is intended to be available to meet Applied's
current cash requirements.</P>


<B><P>Derivative Financial Instruments</B>&nbsp;  Applied adopted SFAS 133, as
amended by SFAS 137 and SFAS 138, in the first fiscal quarter of 2001. SFAS 133
establishes new standards of accounting and reporting for derivative instruments
and hedging activities, and requires that all derivatives, including foreign
currency exchange contracts, be recognized on the balance sheet at fair value.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge
treatment, as well as the ineffective portion of any hedges, must be recognized
currently in earnings. All of Applied's derivative financial instruments are
recorded at their fair value in other current assets or accounts payable and
accrued expenses. The transition adjustment upon adoption of SFAS&nbsp;133 was
not material.</P>

<P>Applied conducts business in a number of foreign countries, with certain
transactions denominated in local currencies, principally Japanese yen. The
purpose of Applied's foreign currency management is to manage the effect of
exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated revenues,
costs and eventual cash flows. The terms of currency instruments used for
hedging purposes are generally consistent with the timing of the transactions
being hedged. Applied does not use derivative financial instruments for trading
or speculative purposes.</P>

<P>Applied uses derivative financial instruments, such as forward exchange
contracts and currency option contracts, to hedge certain forecasted foreign
currency denominated transactions expected to occur within the next 12 months.
In accordance with SFAS 133, these hedges related to anticipated transactions
are designated and documented at the inception of the hedge as cash flow hedges,
and are evaluated for effectiveness quarterly. The effective portion of the gain
or loss on these hedges is reported as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income/(loss) in stockholders' equity, and is reclassified into
earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. All amounts included in
accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) at October 28, 2001 will be
reclassified to earnings within 12 months. Changes in the fair value of currency
option contracts due to changes in time value are excluded from the assessment
of effectiveness, and are recognized in cost of products sold. The change in
option time value was not material for fiscal 2001. If the transaction being
hedged fails to occur, or if a portion of any derivative is ineffective, Applied
immediately recognizes the gain or loss on the associated financial instrument
in general and administrative expenses. The amount recognized due to the
anticipated transaction failing to occur was immaterial for fiscal 2001.</P>

<P>Forward exchange contracts are used to hedge certain foreign currency
denominated assets or liabilities. These derivatives are not designated for SFAS
133 hedge accounting treatment. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of these
hedges are recorded immediately in earnings to offset the changes in the fair
value of the assets or liabilities being hedged.</P>

<P>Derivative-related activity in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss)
for fiscal 2001 consisted of unrealized gains on derivative instruments
designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges of $5 million, comprised of $78
million of net increase in fair value of derivatives, offset by $73 million of
net gains reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) to
earnings. There was no material transition adjustment associated with the
adoption of SFAS 133.</P>


<B><P>Fair Value of Financial Instruments</B> &nbsp; The carrying amounts of Applied's
financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable,
notes payable, and accounts payable and accrued expenses, approximate fair value
due to the short maturities of these financial instruments. At October 29, 2000,
the carrying amount of long-term debt, including current portion, was $585
million, and the estimated fair value was $569 million. At October 28, 2001, the
carrying amount was $570 million and the estimated fair value was $599 million.
The estimated fair value of long-term debt is based primarily on quoted market
prices for the same or similar issues.</P>

</B>

<P>Applied has credit facilities for unsecured borrowings in various currencies
up to approximately $686 million, of which $500 million is comprised of two
revolving credit agreements in the U.S. with a group of banks. One agreement is
a $250 million line of credit that expires in March 2002, and the other is a
$250 million line of credit that expires in March 2003. The agreements provide
for borrowings at various rates, including the lead bank's prime reference rate,
and include financial and other covenants with which Applied was in compliance
at October 28, 2001. No amounts were outstanding under these agreements at the
end of fiscal 2000 or 2001. The remaining credit facilities of approximately
$186 million are primarily with Japanese banks at rates indexed to their prime
reference rate. At October 29, 2000, $95 million was outstanding under Japanese
credit facilities at an average annual interest rate of 0.62 percent. No amounts
were outstanding under these credit facilities at October 28, 2001.</P>

--------------------------------------- ---------- ---------- ----------
</pre>



<B><P>Acquired In-Process Research and Development Expense</B>&nbsp;  During fiscal
1999, Applied recorded $35 million of acquired in-process research and
development expense in connection with its acquisition of Obsidian, Inc.
(Obsidian). Also during fiscal 1999, Applied recorded $8 million of acquired
in-process research and development expense in connection with its acquisition of
AKT, Inc. (AKT). During fiscal 2001, Applied recorded $10 million of acquired
in-process research and development expense in connection with its acquisition
of Oramir Semiconductor Equipment Ltd. (Oramir). For further details regarding
these acquisitions, see Note 13. </P>


<B><P>Restructuring Charges</B>&nbsp;  During fiscal 1999 and
prior to its acquisition by Applied, Etec Systems, Inc. (Etec) recorded pre-tax
restructuring charges of $3 million, consisting of $2 million for headcount
reductions and $1 million for consolidation of facilities. The restructuring
actions eliminated approximately 90 positions, primarily located in California
and Oregon, and consolidated Etec's facilities in Europe and Oregon.</P>

<P>During fiscal 2001, Applied recorded pre-tax restructuring charges of $211
million, consisting of $105 million for headcount reductions, $45 million for
consolidation of facilities and $61 million for asset write-offs, primarily for
fixed assets. These restructuring actions occurred in Applied's second, third
and fourth fiscal quarters, and were taken to better align Applied's cost
structure with prevailing market conditions. During the second fiscal quarter of
2001, Applied completed a voluntary separation plan that resulted in a headcount
reduction of approximately 1,000 employees, or three percent of its global
workforce, for a cost of $47 million. During the third fiscal quarter of 2001,
Applied recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $4 million associated with
severance and benefit costs. During the fourth fiscal quarter of 2001, Applied
eliminated approximately 2,000 additional positions, or 10 percent of its global
workforce, for a cost of $54 million. The majority of the affected employees
were based in Santa Clara, California and Austin, Texas, and represented
multiple company activities and functions.</P>

<P>Total cash outlays for fiscal 2001 restructuring activities will be $137
million. The remaining $74 million of restructuring costs consisted of non-cash
charges of $62 million for asset write-offs and $12 million of compensation
expense for accelerated vesting of certain stock options. The majority of the
remaining cash outlays of $81 million is expected to occur in fiscal 2002. At
October 28, 2001, the remaining restructuring reserve related to the
restructuring plan implemented in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2001.</P>

<B><P>Employee Stock Purchase Plan</B> &nbsp; Applied sponsors two employee stock
purchase plans (ESPP) for the benefit of U.S. and international employees. The
U.S. plan is qualified under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the
ESPP, substantially all employees may purchase Applied's common stock through
payroll deductions at a price equal to 85 percent of the lower of the fair
market value at the beginning or end of each six-month offering period. Stock
purchases under the ESPP are limited to 10 percent of an employee's eligible
compensation, up to a maximum of $12,750, in any plan year. Shares issued under
the ESPP were 2,992,000 for fiscal 1999, 1,584,000 for fiscal 2000 and 2,153,000
for fiscal 2001. At October 28, 2001, there were 17,631,000 shares reserved for
future issuance under the ESPP. </P>

<B><P>Stock-Based Compensation</B> &nbsp; Applied has adopted the disclosure-only
provisions of SFAS 123. Accordingly, no compensation expense has been recognized
for Applied's stock option and purchase plan activity. If compensation expense
had been determined based on the grant date fair value for awards in fiscal
1999, 2000 and 2001 in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123, Applied's net
income and earnings per share would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts
indicated below:</P>

------------------------- -------- -------- --------  -------- -------- --------
</pre>


<P>Based on the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, the weighted average
estimated fair value of employee stock option grants was $16.80 for fiscal 1999,
$26.10 for fiscal 2000 and $17.96 for fiscal 2001. The weighted average
estimated fair value of purchase rights granted under the ESPP was $5.27 for
fiscal 1999, $11.22 for fiscal 2000 and $12.52 for fiscal 2001.</P>

<B><P>Employee Bonus Plans</B>&nbsp;  Applied has various employee bonus plans. A
profit sharing plan provides for the distribution of a percentage of pre-tax
profits to substantially all Applied employees not eligible for other
performance-based incentive plans, up to a maximum percentage of compensation.
Other plans award annual bonuses to Applied's executives and key contributors
based on the achievement of profitability and other specific performance
criteria. Applied also has agreements with key technical employees that provide
for additional compensation related to the success of new product development
and achievement of specified profitability criteria. Charges to expense under
these plans were $209 million for fiscal 1999, $286 million for fiscal 2000 and
$56 million for fiscal 2001.</P>

<B><P>Employee Savings and Retirement Plan</B>&nbsp;  The Employee Savings and Retirement
Plan is qualified under Sections 401(a) and (k) of the Internal Revenue Code.
Applied contributes a percentage of each participating employee's salary
deferral contributions. Company matching contributions are invested in Applied's
common stock and become 20 percent vested at the end of an employee's third year
of service, and vest 20 percent per year of service thereafter until becoming
fully vested at the end of seven years of service. Applied's matching
contributions under this plan were $16 million for fiscal 1999, $21 million for
fiscal 2000 and $31 million for fiscal 2001.</P>

<B><P>Defined Benefit Plans of Foreign Subsidiaries</B>&nbsp;  Several of Applied's
foreign subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially
all of their eligible employees. Benefits under these plans are based on years
of service and final average compensation levels. Funding is limited by the
local statutory requirements of the countries in which the subsidiaries are
located. Expenses under these plans, consisting principally of service cost,
were $9 million for fiscal 1999, $10 million for fiscal 2000 and $12 million for
fiscal 2001. At October 28, 2001, the aggregate accumulated benefit obligation
was $58 million, the projected benefit obligation was $82 million, and the fair
value of plan assets was $26 million.</P>

<B><P>Post-Retirement Benefits  </B>&nbsp;On January 1, 1999, Applied adopted a plan
that provides medical and vision benefits to retirees who are at least age 55,
and whose age plus years of service is at least 65 at date of retirement. An
eligible retiree may elect coverage for a spouse or domestic partner under the
age of 65. Coverage under the plan generally ends for both the retiree and
spouse or domestic partner upon reaching age 65. This plan has not had, and is
not expected to have, a material effect on Applied's financial condition or
results of operations.</P>

<B><P>NOTE 11 &nbsp;&nbsp; INDUSTRY SEGMENT AND FOREIGN OPERATIONS</P></B>

<P>Applied operates in one segment for the manufacture,
marketing and servicing of semiconductor wafer fabrication equipment. In
accordance with SFAS 131, &quot;Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and
Related Information,&quot; Applied's chief operating decision maker has been
identified as the Office of the President, which reviews operating results to
make decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance for the
entire company. All material operating units qualify for aggregation under SFAS
131 due to their identical customer base and similarities in: economic
characteristics; nature of products and services; and procurement, manufacturing
and distribution processes. Since Applied operates in one segment, all financial
segment information required by SFAS 131 can be found in the consolidated
financial statements. </P>

<P>During fiscal 2000, no individual customer accounted for more than 10 percent
of Applied's net sales. During fiscal 1999 and 2001, one customer accounted for
more than 10 percent of net sales. </P>

<P>For geographical reporting, revenues are attributed to the geographic
location in which the customer is located. Long-lived assets consist primarily
of property, plant and equipment, and are attributed to the geographic location
in which they are located. Net sales and long-lived assets by geographic region

<B><P>NOTE 12 &nbsp;&nbsp; COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES</P></B>

<P>Applied leases some of its facilities and equipment under non-cancelable
operating leases and has options to renew most leases, with rentals to be
negotiated. Applied also leases some office and general operating facilities in
California and Oregon under agreements that provide for regular payments based
on LIBOR or the relevant commercial paper rate. In accordance with these
agreements, Applied must maintain compliance with covenants similar to those
contained in its credit facilities. At the end of these leases, Applied is
required to acquire the properties at their original cost or arrange for these
properties to be acquired by a third party. If the fair market value of the
leased properties declines below original cost, Applied will be contingently
liable under first-loss clauses for up to approximately $99 million. At October
28, 2001, Applied believed that the fair market value of the leased properties
exceeded original cost. Management believes that these contingent liabilities
will not have a material adverse affect on Applied's financial condition or
results of operations in the future.</P>

<P>Total rent expense was $73 million for fiscal 1999, $105 million for fiscal
2000 and $153 million for fiscal 2001. Future minimum lease payments at October
28, 2001 were: $147 million for fiscal 2002; $124 million for fiscal 2003; $101
million for fiscal 2004; $55 million for fiscal 2005; $46 million for fiscal
2006; and $163 million thereafter. </P>

<P>Applied has several agreements that allow it to sell accounts receivable from
selected customers at a discount to various financial institutions. Receivable
sales have the effect of increasing cash and reducing accounts receivable and
days sales outstanding. Discounting fees were recorded in interest expense and
were not material for fiscal 1999, 2000 or 2001. Accounts receivable sales under
these agreements were $953 million for fiscal 1999, $1.5 billion for fiscal 2000
and $1.2 billion for fiscal 2001. At October 28, 2001, $252 million of sold
receivables remained outstanding under these agreements. A portion of these sold
receivables is subject to certain recourse provisions. Applied has not
experienced any losses under these recourse provisions, and receivables sold
under these provisions have terms and credit risk characteristics similar to
Applied's overall receivables portfolio. </P>

<B><P>Legal Matters</P></B>

<P>After Varian Associates, Inc. (Varian) failed to respond to requests by
Applied to discuss patent issues, Applied filed a lawsuit on June 13, 1997
against Varian, alleging infringement of several of Applied's patents concerning
physical vapor deposition (PVD) technology. On July 7, 1997, Applied amended
that action against Varian to allege infringement of those same Applied PVD
patents against Novellus Systems, Inc. (Novellus) and to add Novellus as a
defendant as a result of Novellus' acquisition of Varian's thin film systems PVD
business. On June 23, 1997, Novellus filed a separate lawsuit against Applied,
alleging infringement by Applied of several PVD technology patents that were
formerly owned by Varian. Novellus seeks
damages for past infringement, a permanent injunction, treble damages for
willful infringement, pre-judgment interest and attorneys' fees. Fact discovery
has closed in these actions. Applied has settled its action with respect to
Varian, but the litigation with Novellus is ongoing. The court has canceled an
August&nbsp;2001 trial date and no new trial date has been set.
Applied believes it has meritorious claims and defenses and intends to
pursue them vigorously.</P>

<P>On April 17, 2000, Applied filed a lawsuit
against Plasma Physics Corp. (PPC) and Solar Physics Corp. (SPC). The lawsuit
seeks a judicial declaration that Applied's chemical vapor deposition equipment
does not infringe two patents owned by PPC and exclusively licensed to SPC
and/or that those patents are invalid or unenforceable. On July 31, 2000, PPC
and SPC answered the complaint and filed a conditional counterclaim alleging
that Applied had contributed to or induced others to infringe the two patents.
PPC and SPC seek an injunction prohibiting infringement by Applied and an award
of costs, expenses and attorneys' fees. The counterclaim is conditional because
PPC and SPC have stated that they will not sue Applied for infringement of the
two patents if the Court dismisses the lawsuit initiated by Applied for lack of
subject matter jurisdiction. The Court subsequently denied without prejudice
PPC's and SPC's motion to dismiss the lawsuit for lack of subject matter
jurisdiction, but stated that PPC and SPC could renew the motion to dismiss if
appropriate after further discovery. On September 13, 2001, Applied filed an
amended complaint adding two new causes of action to the existing declaratory
judgment claims. The new claims allege that PPC and SPC have violated the Lanham
Act and engaged in unfair competition by willfully making false or misleading
statements about Applied's equipment. Discovery has commenced. The Court has
ordered the parties to be ready for trial by October 1, 2002 but has not yet set
a trial date. Applied believes it has meritorious claims and
defenses and intends to pursue them vigorously.</P>

<P>In September 2000, Applied received notice from the Department of Justice,
Antitrust Division that it had begun an investigation into Applied's licensing
of technology. Although neither the extent nor the outcome of this investigation
can be determined at this time, Applied does not believe that the outcome will
have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of
operations.</P>

<P>On January 8, 2001, Axcelis Technologies, Inc. (Axcelis), formerly a
subsidiary of Eaton Corporation, filed a lawsuit against Applied, alleging that
Applied infringes a patent concerning ion implantation owned by Axcelis. The
complaint also alleges various Massachusetts state and common law tortious
interference and unfair competition claims. Axcelis seeks a preliminary and
permanent injunction, damages, costs and attorneys' fees. On April 12, 2001,
Applied answered the complaint by denying all allegations and counterclaimed for
declaratory judgment of invalidity and non-infringement and violations of
various unfair competition and deceptive practices laws. Applied seeks damages,
a permanent injunction, costs and attorneys' fees. Fact and expert discovery has
closed. Summary judgment motions have been filed and are pending before the
Court. No trial date has been set. Applied believes it has meritorious defenses
and counterclaims to the action and intends to pursue them vigorously.</P>

<P>On March 2, 2001, Linear Technology Corp. (LTC) filed a third party complaint
against Applied, alleging that Applied is obligated to indemnify and defend LTC
in the underlying patent infringement lawsuit brought by Texas Instruments, Inc.
(TI) against LTC. The complaint also alleges claims for breach of contract,
breach of warranty and various unfair business practices. In the complaint, LTC
alleges that Applied failed to disclose to LTC, before LTC purchased certain
equipment from Applied, that TI previously had won a jury verdict against
Hyundai Electronics Industries Co., Ltd. (Hyundai) for patent infringement based
on Hyundai's use of certain semiconductor equipment including some Applied
tools. LTC's lawsuit against Applied seeks indemnification and damages from
Applied and an order requiring Applied to defend LTC in the underlying lawsuit
with TI. Applied has brought a motion to dismiss all claims. The motion is
pending before the Court. Discovery is proceeding. No trial date has been set.
Applied believes it has meritorious defenses to the action and intends to pursue
them vigorously.</P>

<P>On June 11, 2001, Semitool, Inc. (Semitool) filed a lawsuit against Applied,
alleging that Applied infringes a patent concerning seed repair for
electroplating owned by Semitool. Semitool seeks a preliminary and permanent
injunction, damages, costs and attorneys' fees. On July 13, 2001, Applied filed
a declaratory judgment action against Semitool seeking a declaration that
Applied has not infringed the Semitool patent and that Semitool's patent is
invalid and unenforceable. Applied also seeks costs and attorneys' fees.
Discovery is ongoing. No trial date has been set. Applied believes it has
meritorious claims and defenses to the action and intends to pursue them
vigorously.</P>

<P>On July 31, 2001, an individual, David Scharf, filed a lawsuit against
Applied alleging that Applied infringes, has induced others to infringe and has
contributed to others' infringement of a patent concerning color synthesizing
scanning electron microscope technology. Mr. Scharf seeks a preliminary and
permanent injunction, damages and costs. Applied has answered the complaint and
has counterclaimed for a declaratory judgment of non-infringement and invalidity
of the patent. Discovery is proceeding. No trial date has been set. Applied
believes it has meritorious defenses and counterclaims and intends to pursue
them vigorously.</P>

<P>Applied is subject to various other legal proceedings and claims, either
asserted or unasserted, that arise in the ordinary course of business. Although
the outcome of these claims cannot be predicted with certainty, Applied does not
believe that any of these other existing legal matters will have a material
adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. </P>

<P>NOTE 13 &nbsp;&nbsp; BUSINESS COMBINATIONS</P>

</B><P>On December 11, 1998, Applied acquired Consilium, a supplier of
integrated semiconductor and electronics manufacturing execution systems and
services, in a stock-for-stock merger accounted for as a pooling-of-interests.
Due to the immateriality of Consilium's historical financial position and
results of operations in relation to those of Applied, Applied's prior period
financial statements have not been restated. Applied issued approximately three
million shares of its common stock to complete this transaction and recorded $5
million of transaction costs as a one-time operating expense. </P>

<P>On October 5, 1999, Applied acquired Obsidian, a developer of fixed-abrasive
chemical mechanical polishing solutions for the semiconductor industry,
in a stock-for-stock merger accounted for as a purchase business combination.
Applied issued shares of its common stock having a market value of $150 million
to complete this transaction, and recorded acquired in-process research and
development expense of $35 million as a one-time operating expense. The amount
of acquired in-process research and development expense was determined by
identifying research projects for which technological feasibility had not been
established and for which no alternative future uses existed. The value of the
projects identified to be in process was determined by estimating the future
cash flows from the projects once commercially feasible, discounting the net
cash flows back to their present value at a rate commensurate with the level of
risk and maturity of the projects, and then applying a percentage of completion
to the calculated value. In connection with this acquisition, Applied recorded
purchased technology of $36 million and goodwill of $117 million to be amortized
over seven years.</P>

<P>On October 29, 1999, Applied acquired the remaining 50 percent of AKT, a
company that develops, manufactures and markets systems used to produce flat
panel displays (FPDs), in a purchase business combination for $87 million in
cash. In connection with this acquisition, Applied recorded acquired in-process
research and development expense of $8 million, purchased technology of $75
million and goodwill of $35 million. The amount of acquired in-process research
and development expense was determined by identifying research projects for
which technological feasibility had not been established and for which no
alternative future uses existed. The value of the projects identified to be in
process was determined by estimating the future cash flows from the projects
once commercially feasible, discounting the net cash flows back to their present
value at a rate commensurate with the level of risk and maturity of the
projects, and then applying a percentage of completion to the calculated value.
Purchased technology will be amortized over five years and goodwill over 10
years. Previously, Applied and Komatsu Ltd. (Komatsu) each owned 50 percent of
AKT as a joint venture. Applied accounted for its interest in the joint venture
using the equity method. During the fourth fiscal quarter of 1998, Applied
decided to discontinue the operations of AKT over a 12-month period. As a result
of this decision, Applied recorded a provision for discontinued operations,
including $21 million for net expenses and other obligations expected to be
incurred during, or at completion of, the 12-month wind-down period. In late
fiscal 1999, due to an overall improvement in the FPD industry, AKT's financial
condition and business outlook improved. As a result, Applied reassessed its
decision to discontinue AKT's operations, and agreed to acquire Komatsu's 50
percent interest. Because of the decision to continue AKT's operations, Applied
reclassified AKT's prior period operating results from discontinued operations
to continuing operations, and reversed into income in fiscal 1999 the $21
million provision for discontinued operations recorded in fiscal 1998, which was
no longer required. The reclassifications did not change Applied's previously
reported net income or earnings per share amounts, and were recorded in
accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 90-16, &quot;Accounting for
Discontinued Operations Subsequently Retained.&quot; </P>

<P>On March 29, 2000, Applied acquired Etec, a supplier of mask pattern
generating equipment for the semiconductor and electronics industries, in a
stock-for-stock merger accounted for as a pooling-of-interests. Applied issued
approximately 29&nbsp;million shares of its common stock to complete this
transaction, and recorded $40 million of transaction costs as a one-time
operating expense. Additionally, Applied recorded a one-time, pre-tax operating
expense of $14 million ($6.5 million in cost of products sold and $7.5 million
in general and administrative expenses) to conform Etec's accounting policies to
those of Applied. Prior to the merger, Etec's fiscal year end (July 31) was
different than Applied's (last Sunday in October). Fiscal 1999 amounts included
herein for Etec have not been conformed to Applied's fiscal year. To conform
Etec's fiscal 2000 amounts to Applied's fiscal year, Etec's net loss for the
three months ended October&nbsp;31, 1999 was reflected as an adjustment to
retained earnings for the first fiscal quarter of 2000. Etec's net sales and net
loss for the three months ended October 31, 1999 were $43 million and $708,000,
respectively.</P>

<P>On June 27, 2001, Applied acquired Oramir, a supplier of advanced laser
cleaning technologies for semiconductor wafers, in a purchase business
combination for $21 million in cash. In connection with this acquisition,
Applied recorded acquired in-process research and development expense of $10
million and goodwill of $12 million. The amount of acquired in-process research
and development expense was determined by identifying research projects for
which technological feasibility had not been established and for which no
alternative future uses existed. The value of the projects identified to be in
process was determined by estimating the future cash flows from the projects
once commercially feasible, discounting the net cash flows back to their present
value at a rate commensurate with the level of risk and maturity of the
projects, and then applying a percentage of completion to the calculated value.
Management has assigned a useful life of seven years to the goodwill. </P>

<P>For all of the purchase business combinations discussed above, the results of
operations prior to the acquisition dates were not material in relation to those
of Applied for any of the periods presented herein.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>NOTE 14&nbsp;&nbsp;  SUBSEQUENT EVENTS</P>

<P>Business Combinations</B> <br>
During the first fiscal quarter of 2002, Applied acquired the assets of
Schlumberger's electron-beam wafer inspection business. In addition, Applied
acquired Global Knowledge Services, Inc., a provider of advanced data mining
services to improve semiconductor manufacturing yield and efficiency. These
transactions will be accounted for as purchase business combinations. These
acquisitions have not had, and are not expected to have, a material effect on
Applied's financial condition or results of operations. </P>

<B><P>Restructuring</B><br>
On December 12, 2001, Applied announced a further headcount reduction of
approximately 1,700 positions, or 10 percent of its global workforce, in
response to the continuing downturn in the semiconductor industry. The majority
of the affected employees were based in Santa Clara, California and Austin,
Texas, and represented multiple company activities and functions. Applied will
record a restructuring charge for the first fiscal quarter of 2002.</P>

information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is consistent with that in the
financial statements. </P>

<P>Management is responsible for maintaining a system of internal business
controls and procedures to provide reasonable assurance, at an appropriate
cost/benefit relationship, that assets are safeguarded and that transactions are
authorized, recorded and reported properly. The internal control system is
augmented by appropriate reviews by management, written policies and guidelines,
careful selection and training of qualified personnel and a written code of
business ethics applicable to all employees of Applied and its subsidiaries.
Management believes that Applied's internal controls provide reasonable
assurance that assets are safeguarded against material loss from unauthorized
use or disposition and that the financial records are reliable for preparing

<B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Applied Materials, Inc.</P>
</B>

<P>In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the
accompanying index appearing under Item 14(a)(1) on page 25 present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Applied Materials, Inc. and its
subsidiaries at October 29, 2000 and October 28, 2001, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
October 28, 2001, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial
statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 14(a)(2) on page 25
presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein
when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements.
These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the
responsibility of the Company's management; our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.</P>

<P>As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company
changed its method of revenue recognition in accordance with guidance in
Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101,
&quot;Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements,&quot; effective as of the
