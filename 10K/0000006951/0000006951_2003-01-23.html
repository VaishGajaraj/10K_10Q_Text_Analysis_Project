<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">PART I</P>

<P>Item 1:  Business</B></P>

<p>Organized in 1967, Applied, a Delaware corporation, develops,
manufactures, markets and services semiconductor wafer fabrication
equipment for the worldwide semiconductor industry. Customers for these
products include semiconductor wafer manufacturers and semiconductor
integrated circuit (or chip) manufacturers, who either use the chips
they manufacture in their own products or sell them to other companies
for use in advanced electronic components.

<p>Most chips are built on a silicon wafer base and include a variety of
circuit components, such as transistors and other devices, that are
connected by multiple layers of wiring (interconnects). As the density
of the circuit components is increased to enable greater computing power
in the same or smaller area, the complexity of building the chip also
increases, necessitating the formation of smaller structures and more
intricate wiring schemes. To build a chip, the transistors, capacitors
and other circuit components are first created on the surface of the
wafer by performing a series of processes to deposit and remove selected
film layers. Similar processes are then used to build the layers of
wiring structures on the wafer. A typical, simplified process sequence
for building the wiring portion of copper-based chips involves initially
depositing a dielectric film layer onto the base layer of circuit
components using a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) system. An etch
system is then used to create openings and patterns in the dielectric
layer. To form the metal wiring, these openings and patterns are
subsequently filled with conducting material using physical vapor
deposition (PVD) and/or electroplating technologies. A chemical
mechanical polishing (CMP) step then polishes the wafer to maintain a
flat surface. Additional deposition, etch and CMP steps are then
performed to build up the layers of wiring needed to complete the
interconnection of the circuit elements to form the chip. Advanced chip
designs require about 500 steps involving these and other processes to
complete the manufacturing of the wafer.

<p>Applied operates primarily in a single industry segment for the
manufacture, marketing and servicing of semiconductor wafer fabrication
equipment. Applied currently manufactures systems that perform most of
the primary steps in the chip fabrication process, including: atomic
layer deposition (ALD), CVD, PVD, electroplating, etch, ion
implantation, rapid thermal processing (RTP), CMP, wafer wet cleaning,
metrology and wafer inspection. Applied's subsidiary, AKT, Inc. (AKT),
manufactures CVD systems used to make flat panel displays (FPDs) that
are used in notebook computers, desktop monitors, televisions and other
applications. Applied's subsidiary, Etec Systems, Inc. (Etec), is a
leading manufacturer of systems used to generate, etch and inspect
circuit patterns on reticles used in the photolithography process.
Applied also provides manufacturing facility (fab) management software
to the semiconductor industry, as well as services to enhance
manufacturing yields.

<p>Most of Applied's products are single-wafer systems with multiple
process chambers attached to a base platform. The simultaneous
processing of several wafers enables high manufacturing productivity and
precise control of the process. Applied sells most of its single-wafer,
multi-chamber systems based on three main platforms: the Centura&#174;, the
Endura&#174; and the Producer&#174;. These platforms currently support ALD, CVD,
PVD, etch and RTP technologies.

<p>Throughout its history, the semiconductor industry has migrated to
increasingly larger wafers to build chips, from 25 millimeter (mm), or
one-inch, wafers to 300mm, or 12-inch, wafers. The predominant size for
capacity production today is 200mm, or eight-inch, wafers. To gain the
economic advantages of a larger surface area, however, the industry has
begun using 300mm wafers. Applied has developed and launched a
comprehensive line of systems for 300mm wafer processing for all of its
core technologies, supporting more than 90 process applications. These
new systems encompass almost 75 percent of the processes needed to
fabricate advanced 130 nanometer (nm) and below devices on the wafer,
including deposition, etch, RTP, CMP, wafer wet cleaning, ion
implantation and inspection technologies.

<B><P>Products </B></P>

The following summarizes Applied's portfolio of products and process
technologies, most of which are available for both 200mm and 300mm wafer
processing.

<B><I><P>Deposition </B></I><br>
Deposition is a fundamental step in fabricating a chip. During
deposition, a layer of either dielectric (material used as insulation
between conductors) or electrically conductive (material used to carry
current, typically metals) film is deposited or grown on a wafer.
Applied currently provides equipment to perform the four main types of
deposition: ALD, CVD, PVD and electroplating. Applied also offers
certain types of dielectric deposition processes using its RTP systems.

<p><u>Atomic Layer Deposition</u><br>
ALD is an emerging technology in which single layers of atoms are used
to build the chip. This technology enables chipmakers to deposit a very
thin layer of either conducting or insulating material with uniform
coverage on small, 65nm and below features. Applied offers ALD process
chambers for depositing tungsten, titanium nitride (TiN) and tantulum
nitride (TaN) films. In 2002, Applied introduced the Endura iCuB/S&#153;
product, the industry's first system to integrate ALD and PVD chambers
on a single platform for depositing the critical barrier and seed layers
in copper interconnects.


<U><P>Chemical Vapor Deposition</U><br>

CVD is used by chipmakers to deposit dielectric and metal films on a
wafer. During the CVD process, gases that contain atoms of the material
to be deposited react on the wafer surface, forming a thin film of solid
material. Films deposited by CVD may be silicon oxide, single-crystal
epitaxial silicon, silicon nitride, dielectric anti-reflective coatings,
low </FONT><FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=2>k</FONT><FONT SIZE=2>  dielectric
(highly efficient insulating materials), high </FONT><FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=2>k</FONT><FONT SIZE=2>
dielectric (electrical charge storing materials), aluminum, titanium
(Ti), TiN, polysilicon, tungsten, refractory metals or silicides.
Applied offers the following CVD products and technologies:


<I><P>Producer </I>- The Producer CVD platforms feature Twin-Chamber&#153; modules that
have two single-wafer process chambers per unit. Up to three Twin-Chamber
modules can be mounted on each Producer platform, giving it a
maximum processing capacity of six wafers at a time for high-throughput
manufacturing. Many of Applied's dielectric CVD processes can be
performed on this platform. In 2002, Applied introduced Advanced
Patterning Film&#153;, an innovative CVD hardmask film deposited with the
Producer system that enables chipmakers to fabricate sub-50nm transistor
gates and contact structures using standard lithography.


<I><P>Ultima HDP-CVD&#174; Centura</I> -

High-density plasma CVD (HDP-CVD) is used to
fill very small, deep spaces with dielectric film. One of the processes
offered on the system is fluorinated silicate glass (FSG), a film with
higher insulating value than traditionally-used silicon dioxide material
that enables faster chip performance. Applied's Ultima HDP-CVD Centura
product is used by a number of major chipmakers for gap-fill
applications, including the deposition of FSG in their advanced
interconnect structures.

<p><i>Low </FONT><FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=2>k</FONT><FONT SIZE=2>  Dielectric Films </i> -

Throughout fiscal 2002, Applied continued its
programs for developing dielectric films with low </FONT><FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=2>k
</FONT><FONT SIZE=2>  values to complement
the trend of using copper material for even faster chip speeds. Applied
offers several low </FONT><FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=2>k</FONT><FONT SIZE=2>
dielectric materials using its established CVD
technologies. Black Diamond&#153; , a silicon-based low </FONT><FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=2>k
</FONT><FONT SIZE=2>  dielectric film is
designed for copper-based interconnect structures. A second low </FONT><FONT FACE="Symbol"
SIZE=2>k</FONT><FONT SIZE=2>
dielectric, called BLO</FONT><FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=2>k</FONT><FONT SIZE=2> &#153; (Barrier
Low </FONT><FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=2>k</FONT><FONT SIZE=2> ), provides a low
</FONT><FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=2>k</FONT><FONT SIZE=2> solution for
critical barrier layers in semiconductor devices, enabling the complete,
multi-layer dielectric chip structure to benefit from low </FONT><FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=2>k
</FONT><FONT SIZE=2>  technology.


<I><P>Epitaxial Deposition</I> -

Epitaxial silicon (epitaxy or epi), used in some
semiconductor devices, is a layer of pure silicon grown in a uniform
crystalline structure on the wafer to form a high quality base for the
device circuitry. Applied has manufactured epitaxial deposition systems
for over 30 years. Applied's Epi Centura integrates pre- and post-epi
processes on the system to reduce total epi production costs. In
addition to silicon applications, Applied offers an Epi Centura system
for silicon-germanium (SiGe) epi process technology, which can reduce
power usage and increase speed in certain kinds of advanced chips.


<I><P>Polysilicon Deposition</I> -

Polysilicon is a type of silicon used to form
portions of the transistor structure within the semiconductor device.
Applied's PolyGen&#153; Centura is a single-wafer, multi-chamber product that
deposits thin polysilicon films at high temperatures with high
productivity and process control. A variant of the system, the Polycide
Centura, combines chambers for polysilicon and tungsten silicide
deposition on the Centura platform in an integrated process to create
transistor gate structures in memory chips. To address the challenging
requirements of 130nm and below devices, Applied offers its RTP
oxidation and polysilicon deposition technologies on one system called
the Gate Stack Centura, which provides superior film quality, material
properties and process control.

<I><P>Silicon Nitride Deposition</I> -

Applied offers a single-wafer, high-temperature
system to deposit silicon nitride films, called the SiNgen&#153; Centura. This
system minimizes the amount of time the wafer is exposed to high temperatures
and reduces particles while improving many areas of operating cost and
productivity in critical transistor nitride layers for sub-130nm devices.

<I><P>Tungsten Deposition</I> -

Tungsten is used to connect the multiple layers of
wiring on aluminum-based chips. Applied's Sprint&#153; Plus Centura was the
first system to provide integrated ALD and CVD technologies on the same
platform for fabricating advanced tungsten contact structures.


<U><P>Physical Vapor Deposition </U><br>

PVD, also called sputtering, is a physical process in which atoms of a
gas, such as argon, are accelerated at a metal target. The metal atoms
chip off, or sputter away, and are then deposited on the wafer. The
Endura PVD platform offers a broad range of advanced deposition
processes, including aluminum, cobalt, Ti/TiN, Ta/TaN and copper (Cu).
The Endura's highly flexible, multi-chamber architecture allows the
integration of multiple PVD processes or combinations of metal CVD and
PVD technologies on the same system. In addition to the integrated
iCuB/S (ALD TaN and PVD seed) system discussed in the Atomic Layer
Deposition section, the Endura's PVD Ti technology can be combined with
either CVD TiN, ALD TiN or PVD TiN processes to form the critical lining
layers of interconnect structures. These structures are subsequently
filled with tungsten, aluminum, copper or other film materials. Advanced
SIP&#153; (self-ionized plasma) technology for depositing critical
barrier/seed films in copper-based devices and liner/barrier films in
aluminum-based chips extends PVD to sub-100nm geometries.


<I><P>Systems for Copper-Based Devices</I> -
A majority of process steps used in
chipmaking are performed to build the interconnect, a complex matrix of
microscopic wires that carry electrical signals to connect the
transistor and capacitor components of a chip. Chipmakers are
transitioning from using aluminum as the main conducting material for
the interconnect to copper, which has lower resistance than aluminum and
can carry more current in a smaller area.

<p>Applied is a leading supplier of systems for copper-based chipmaking,
with products that perform deposition of the barrier and seed layers
(Endura Electra Cu&#174; Barrier & Seed), copper fill by electroplating
(Electra Cu ECP), and copper planarization by CMP (Mirra Mesa&#153; system).
In addition, Applied makes a full line of systems for depositing and
etching the dielectric layers used in the copper interconnect and for
inspection and metrology.

<p>The Endura Electra Cu Barrier & Seed system, launched in fiscal 1998, is
widely used by chipmakers for fabricating copper-based chips. Using PVD
technology, the system sequentially deposits the critical layers that
prevent copper material from entering other areas of the device and
prime the structure for subsequent deposition of bulk copper material by
electroplating.

<U><P>Electroplating</U><br>
Electroplating is a process by which metal atoms from a chemical fluid
(an electrolyte) are deposited on the surface of an object immersed in
the electrolyte. Its main application is to deposit copper in
interconnect wiring structures following the deposition of barrier and
seed layers.

<p>The Electra Cu ECP (electrochemical plating) system offers automated ECP
chemical management technology, and its high-throughput system
architecture allows the simultaneous processing of four wafers. The
Electra Cu ECP product combines copper deposition with critical heat
treatment and wafer edge clean processes on a single platform.

<B><I><P>Etch</B></I><br>
Etching is used many times throughout the semiconductor manufacturing
process to selectively remove material from the surface of a wafer.
Before etching begins, the wafer is coated with a light-sensitive film,
called photoresist, and is exposed to a circuit pattern during a
photolithography process step that projects the circuit pattern onto the
wafer. Etching removes material only from areas dictated by the
photoresist pattern.

<p>Applied offers systems for etching three basic types of materials:
metal, silicon and dielectric films. For etching dielectric films,
Applied introduced the Dielectric Etch eMax&#153; Entek&#153; Centura system in
fiscal 2002. This system, an extension of Applied's eMax technology,
etches low </FONT><FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=2>k</FONT><FONT SIZE=2>  dielectric
materials found in high-performance copper-based chips.

<p>For etching advanced conducting films, Applied's Metal Etch DPS&#153; II and
Silicon Etch DPS&#153; II Centura systems offer customers the technology,
productivity and reliability required for 100nm and below processing.
The Transforma&#153; etch patterning system combines silicon etch technology
with new integrated metrology capability to enable chipmakers to improve
process control, device yield and overall fab cycle time for building
transistor gate structures.

<B><I><P>Ion Implantation</B></I><br>
During ion implantation, silicon wafers are bombarded by a beam of ions,
called dopants, that penetrate (or implant) the film surface to a
desired depth. Implantation occurs in the transistor structure and
changes the properties of the material in which the dopants are
implanted to achieve a particular electrical performance.

<p>Low-energy implant technology enables the fabrication of smaller
structures and contributes to faster transistor performance. Applied's
Quantum&#153; LEAP (low-energy advanced processing) system enables chipmakers
to create thinner, more advanced transistor structures. An
enhanced-performance line of high-current implanters, the Quantum II, was
introduced in 2002 for sub-100nm applications.

<p>Applied's Swift&#174; system combines the functions of two traditional
implant technologies - high-energy and medium current - in one system.
This system introduces several advances in doping accuracy and wafer
positioning required for the 100nm device generation.

<B><I><P>Rapid Thermal Processing</B></I><br>

RTP subjects a wafer to a very brief burst of intense heat that can take
the wafer from room temperature to more than 1,000 degrees Celsius in
less than 10 seconds. RTP is used mainly for modifying the properties of
deposited films. Applied's RTP systems offer advances in temperature and
ramp rate control as well as other features aimed at providing
leading-edge capability for sub-130nm micron generations. These single-wafer
systems are also used for growing high quality oxide and oxynitride
films, deposition steps that have traditionally been assigned to
furnaces. This trend to single-wafer processing versus batch furnaces is
expected to continue as the industry transitions to larger 300mm wafers.
In 2002, Applied introduced the Radiance&#153;  Vantage&#153;  system, a new
streamlined platform designed for high-volume 300mm manufacturing.


<B><I><P>Chemical Mechanical Polishing</B></I><br>

CMP removes material from a wafer to create a flat (planarized) surface.
This allows subsequent photolithography patterning steps to take place
with greater accuracy and enables film layers to build up with minimal
height variations. CMP is performed primarily in the interconnect
structure of the chip, where it is used multiple times, and is crucial
to fabricating copper-based chips to define the circuit wires that
create the interconnect. Applied entered the CMP market in 1995 with its
Mirra&#174; system and has since added several important features to this
product, including integrated film measurement and inspection
capabilities. The Mirra Mesa system also provides customers with
integrated cleaning technology. In 2002, Applied introduced a unique
fixed abrasive technology on the Reflexion&#153;  platform, enabling a
slurry-free process that offers improved performance for certain polishing
applications.

<p><strong><i>Wafer Wet Cleaning</strong></i><br>

Applied entered the wafer wet cleaning market in fiscal 2002 with its
Oasis Clean&#153; system, which uses single-wafer technology to clean wafers
of contaminants. The Oasis Clean system utilizes proprietary megasonics
technology with unique cleaning chemistry and system architecture to
offer chipmakers improved cleaning performance and reduced operating
costs over batch-type systems.

<B><I><P>Metrology and Wafer/Reticle Inspection</B></I><br>

Applied produces several types of products that are used to inspect the
wafer during various stages of the fabrication process.

<U><P>Critical Dimension and Defect Review Scanning Electron Microscopes
(CD-SEMs and DR-SEMs)</U><BR>

Scanning electron microscopes (SEMs) use an electron beam to form images
of microscopic features of a semiconductor wafer at extremely high
magnification. Applied provides chipmakers with full automation, along
with the high accuracy and sensitivity needed for measuring
advanced-generation feature sizes. Introduced in fiscal 2002, the NanoSEM&#153; 3D
system extends CD-SEM technology beyond the measurement of critical
dimensions to enable the three-dimensional imaging of chip features to
more precisely control their lithography and etch processes.

<p>DR-SEMs review defects on the wafer (i.e., particles, scratches or
residues) that are first located by other detection systems and then
classify the defects to identify their source. Applied's high-throughput,
fully automatic SEMVision&#153; G2 DR-SEM enables customers to
use its technology as an integral part of their production lines to
analyze defects as small as 80nm.

<U><P>Wafer Inspection </U><br>

Using laser-based technology, defects can be detected on patterned
wafers (wafers with circuit images printed on them) as they move between
processing steps. Defects may include particles, open circuit lines,
shorts between lines or other problems. Applied introduced the Compass&#153;
Pro system in 2002 for detecting critical defects in devices with design
rules as small as 100nm and below. The system operates with the high
speed required for chipmakers' volume production lines, especially for
copper-based chip manufacturing.

<p><strong><i>Process Modules</strong></i><br>

Process modules are designed to link certain Applied equipment to
provide customers with a qualified, integrated and optimized production
process for building microstructures on advanced chips. Applied expects
these products to save customers critical process development and
facility start-up time, enabling them to bring new chip technologies to
market more quickly. During fiscal 2002, Applied opened a 166,000 square
foot facility in Sunnyvale, California, the Maydan Process Module
Technology Center, to develop its Process Module&#153; products.

<B><I><P>Flat Panel Displays </B></I><br>

The most advanced FPDs are manufactured using technologies similar to
those for making semiconductors. One difference is the vastly larger
area of the substrate (panel). Compared to today's largest wafers (300mm
diameter), the panels can be up to 15 times larger. Applied began
development of FPD process technology in 1990, beginning with a CVD
process. In fiscal 2002, AKT introduced its latest CVD system, the AKT
15K CVD, which addresses FPD fab requirements for substrates larger than
one square meter.

<p><strong><i>Maskmaking </strong></i><br>

Mask pattern generation systems use precision lasers or electron beams
to write (or pattern) each layer of a semiconductor chip's design onto a
piece of chrome-coated quartz glass. Introduced in 2001, the advanced
MEBES&#174; eXara&#153; is an electron-beam system for leading-edge maskmaking.
The latest ALTA&#174; 4000, a laser beam system launched in 2001, provides
mainstream, high-throughput production capability.

<p>A new system was introduced in fiscal 2001 for etching photomasks, the
Tetra&#153; Photomask Etch system. This product uses dry etch technology to
fabricate the most advanced photomasks for 100nm and below chipmaking.

<p>Applied also supplies an inspection system to photomask manufacturers
that is used to detect defects on quartz plates, called masks. These
masks are used by photolithography systems to transfer microscopic
circuit designs onto wafers. Since any imperfection will be replicated
on the wafer, the mask must be defect-free with perfect image fidelity.
The ARIS-100i&#153; system is an automated, ultraviolet wavelength-based
advanced inspection system for masks used in 130nm and below generation
devices. This system features enhanced image acquisition technology,
data handling capabilities and sensitivity for advanced mask designs.

<B><I><P>Factory Management Software</B></I><br>

Applied's WorkStream&#153; and FAB300&#153; products are designed for
semiconductor and FPD manufacturers to control and optimize facility
operations. FAB300 is a wafer fab management software package
specifically designed to meet the requirements of a 300mm wafer
production facility. It integrates a full complement of operating
modules, enabling chipmakers to manage 300mm wafer movement and
equipment operation in a single, fully automated, fab-wide solution.

<B><P>Customer Service and Support</B></P>

<p>Applied's customer service organization plays a critical role in
Applied's ability to continuously satisfy its customers' production
requirements. Approximately 3,700 trained customer engineers and process
support engineers are deployed in more than a dozen countries. These
engineers are usually located at or near the customers' fab sites and
service over 17,500 Applied systems.

<p>Applied's line of service products offers an innovative approach to
maintaining and servicing Applied equipment in customers' fabs. With the
Total Parts Management&#174; (TPM) program, Applied offers an inventory
management service for the spare parts used in its equipment at
customers' fab sites. Under TPM, chipmakers no longer need to own or
manage inventory for their Applied systems. A second product, called
Total Support Package&#174; (TSP), is a comprehensive equipment service
solution that includes parts inventory management and maintenance with
operating cost reduction and system performance improvement targets for
their Applied equipment. SparesSolutions&#153; is an on-line customer support
application that provides a simple, fast and cost-effective way for
customers to obtain spare parts for their Applied systems. Launched in
2002, the Total Kit Management&#153;  program provides customers with a
convenient, cost-effective way to manage their systems' process kit
service requirements. Applied also introduced in December 2002 its new
Process Excursion Control&#153;  service that combines automated data mining
software with highly evolved data collection and analysis capabilities
to locate and correct customers' critical yield production issues. In
addition, Applied's customer service organization refurbishes, markets
and sells previously used Applied systems.


<B><P>Backlog</B></P>

<p>Applied's backlog increased from $2.7 billion at October 28, 2001 to
$3.2 billion at October 27, 2002. Applied schedules production of its
systems based on order backlog and customer commitments. Backlog
includes only orders for which written authorizations have been
accepted, shipment dates within 12 months have been assigned and revenue
has not been recognized. In addition, backlog includes service revenue
and maintenance fees to be earned within the next 12 months. However,
customers may delay delivery of products or cancel orders suddenly and
without notice, subject to possible cancellation penalties. Backlog
adjustments for fiscal 2002 included cancellations of $473 million and
currency and other adjustments of $149 million. Due to possible customer
changes in delivery schedules and cancellations of orders, Applied's
backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual
sales for any succeeding period. Delays in delivery schedules and/or a
reduction of backlog during any particular period could have a material
adverse effect on Applied's business and results of operations.


<B><P>Manufacturing, Raw Materials and Supplies</B></P>

<p>Applied's manufacturing activities consist primarily of assembling
various commercial and proprietary components into finished systems in
Austin, Texas. Applied also has manufacturing operations in Santa Clara,
California; Hayward, California; Hillsboro, Oregon; Horsham, England;
and Rehovot, Israel. Production requires some raw materials and a wide
variety of mechanical and electrical components to be manufactured to
Applied's specifications. Applied uses numerous vendors to supply parts,
components and subassemblies (collectively, "parts") for the
manufacture and support of its products. Although Applied makes
reasonable efforts to assure that parts are available from multiple
qualified suppliers, this is not always possible; accordingly, some key
parts may be obtained only from a single supplier or a limited group of
suppliers. Applied has sought, and will continue to seek, to minimize
the risk of production and service interruptions and/or shortages of key
parts by: 1) selecting and qualifying alternative suppliers for key
parts; 2) monitoring the financial stability of key suppliers; and 3)
maintaining appropriate inventories of key parts.


<B><P>Research, Development and Engineering </B></P>

<p>Applied's long-term growth strategy requires continued development of
new manufacturing products. Applied's significant investment in
research, development and engineering (RD&E) has generally enabled it to
deliver new products and technologies before the emergence of strong
demand, thus allowing customers to incorporate these products into their
manufacturing plans at an early stage in the technology selection cycle.
Applied works closely with its global customers to design systems and
processes that meet their planned technical and production requirements.
Engineering organizations are located in the United States, the United
Kingdom, Israel and Japan, with process support and customer
demonstration laboratories in the United States, the United Kingdom,
Israel, Japan and Taiwan.

<p>Applied invested $1.1 billion (11.6 percent of net sales) for fiscal
2000, $1.2 billion (16.3 percent of net sales) for fiscal 2001 and $1.1
billion (20.8 percent of net sales) for fiscal 2002 in RD&E for product
development and engineering programs to create new product lines and
improve existing technologies. Applied has spent an average of 15.3
percent of net sales on RD&E over the last five years. In addition to
RD&E for specific product technologies, Applied maintains ongoing
programs in software, automation control systems, materials research and
environmental control that have applications to its products. Key
activities during fiscal 2002 included development of wafer fabrication
equipment for smaller chip feature sizes, copper-based devices and 300mm
wafers.


<B><P>Marketing and Sales</B></P>

<p>Because of the highly technical nature of its products, Applied markets
and sells its products worldwide through a direct sales force. For
fiscal 2002, net sales to customers in each region as a percentage of
Applied's total net sales were: North America (primarily the United
States) 26 percent, Taiwan 24 percent, Japan 15 percent, Europe 13
percent, Asia-Pacific (including China) 13 percent and Korea nine
percent. Applied's business is usually not seasonal in nature, but it is
cyclical based on the capital equipment investment patterns of major
semiconductor manufacturers. These expenditure patterns are based on
many factors, including anticipated market demand for integrated
circuits, the development of new technologies and global and regional
economic conditions.

<p>Information on net sales to unaffiliated customers and long-lived assets
attributable to Applied's geographic regions is included in Note 11 of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. No individual customer
accounted for more than 10 percent of Applied's net sales for fiscal 2000.
Intel Corporation accounted for 12.2 percent of Applied's net sales for
fiscal 2001 and 10.1 percent of Applied's net sales for fiscal 2002.


<B><P>Competition</B></P>

<p>The global semiconductor equipment industry is highly competitive and is
characterized by increasingly rapid technological advancements and
demanding worldwide service requirements. Applied's ability to compete
depends on its ability to commercialize its technology and continually
improve its products, processes and services, as well as its ability to
develop new products that meet constantly evolving customer
requirements. Significant competitive factors for succeeding in the
semiconductor manufacturing equipment market include the equipment's
technical capability, productivity and cost-effectiveness, overall
reliability, ease of use and maintenance, contamination and defect
control, and the level of technical service and support provided by the
vendor. The importance of each of these factors varies depending on the
specific customer's needs and criteria, including considerations such as
the customer's process application, product requirements, timing of the
purchase and particular circumstances of the purchasing decision. The
pace of technological change is rapid, with customers continually moving
to smaller critical dimensions and larger wafer sizes and adopting new
materials for use in semiconductor manufacturing. Sometimes, existing
technology can be adapted to the new requirements; however, these
requirements sometimes create the need for an entirely new technical
approach. The rapid pace of technological change continually creates
opportunities for existing competitors and start-ups, and can quickly
diminish the value of existing technologies.

<p>Substantial competition exists for each of Applied's products.
Competitors range from small companies that compete with a single
innovative product to companies with a large and diverse line of
semiconductor processing products. Competitors in a given technology
tend to have different degrees of market presence in the various
regional markets. Management believes that Applied is a strong
competitor and that its competitive position is based on the ability of
its products and services to continue to address customer requirements.
Success for Applied will require a continued high level of investment in
RD&E and in sales, marketing and customer support activities.


<B><P>Patents and Licenses</B></P>

<p>Management believes that Applied's competitive position is significantly
dependent upon skills in engineering, manufacturing and marketing, and
not just on its patent position. However, protection of Applied's
technology assets by obtaining and enforcing patents is important.
Therefore, Applied has a program to file patent applications in the U.S.
and other countries for inventions that Applied considers significant.
Applied has a number of patents in the U.S. and other countries, and
additional applications are pending for new developments in its
equipment and processes. Applied does not consider its business
materially dependent upon any one patent, although taken as a whole, the
rights of Applied and the products made and sold under patents are a
significant element of Applied's business. In addition to patents,
Applied also possesses other proprietary intellectual property,
including trademarks, know-how, trade secrets and copyrights.

<p>Applied enters into patent and technology licensing agreements with
other companies when management determines that it is in its best
interest to do so. Applied pays royalties under existing patent license
agreements for the use, in several of its products, of certain patented
technologies that are licensed to Applied for the life of the patents.
Applied also receives royalties from licenses granted to third parties.
Royalties received from third parties are not expected to be material.

<p>In the normal course of business, Applied from time to time receives and
makes inquiries regarding possible patent infringement. In dealing with
such inquiries, it may become necessary or useful for Applied to obtain
or grant licenses or other rights. However, there can be no assurance
that such licenses or rights will be available to Applied on
commercially reasonable terms. If Applied is not able to resolve a
claim, negotiate a settlement of the matter, obtain necessary licenses
on commercially reasonable terms and/or successfully prosecute or defend
its position, Applied's business, financial condition and results of
operations could be materially and adversely affected.


<B><P>Environmental Matters</B></P>

<p>Two of Applied's locations have been designated as environmental cleanup
sites. In 1987, the United States Environmental Protection Agency
designated one of the locations, in Santa Clara, California, as a
Superfund site and named Applied as a "Responsible Party." Cleanup
activities have been underway since 1984. The California Regional Water
Quality Control Board has designated Applied as a "Discharger" with
respect to the other site in Sunnyvale, California. Applied was named a
Discharger at the Sunnyvale site because it currently owns the site in
question, although prior owners and operators are being required to
perform cleanup and monitoring activities. Neither compliance with
federal, state and local provisions regulating discharge of materials
into the environment, nor remedial agreements or other actions relating
to the environment, has had, or is expected to have, a material effect
on Applied's capital expenditures, competitive position, financial
condition or results of operations.


<B><P>Employees</B></P>

<p>None of Applied's employees are represented by a trade union, and
management considers its relations with employees to be good. In the
high-technology industry, competition for highly-skilled employees is
intense. Applied believes that its future success is highly dependent
upon on its continued ability to attract and retain qualified employees.
There can be no assurance that Applied will be able to attract, hire,
assimilate and retain a sufficient number of qualified people. At
October 27, 2002, Applied employed 16,077 regular employees. On November
4, 2002, Applied announced a headcount reduction of approximately 1,750
positions, or 11 percent of its global workforce, in response to the
continuing downturn in the semiconductor industry.

<A NAME="item3"></A>
<B><P>Item 3:  Legal Proceedings</P>

<P>Novellus</B><br>

After Varian Associates, Inc. (Varian) failed to respond to requests by
Applied to discuss certain patent issues, on June 13, 1997, Applied
filed a lawsuit against Varian captioned Applied Materials, Inc. v.
Varian Associates, Inc. (case no. C-97-20523-RMW) in the United States
District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging
infringement of several of Applied's patents concerning PVD technology.
On July 7, 1997, Applied amended that action to allege infringement of
those same Applied PVD patents against Novellus Systems, Inc. (Novellus)
and to add Novellus as a defendant, as a result of Novellus' acquisition
of Varian's thin film systems PVD business. On June 23, 1997, Novellus
filed a separate lawsuit against Applied captioned Novellus Systems,
Inc. v. Applied Materials, Inc. (case no. C-97-20551-EAI) in the United
States District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging
infringement by Applied of several PVD technology patents that were
formerly owned by Varian. Novellus seeks damages for past infringement,
a permanent injunction, treble damages for willful infringement,
pre-judgment interest and attorneys' fees. In September 2000, Applied and
Varian settled their disputes, and on October 3, 2000, Applied's claims
against Varian and Varian's claims and counterclaims against Applied
were dismissed with prejudice with respect to the Inova system as it was
made and sold as of May 7, 1997. The litigation with Novellus continues.
Fact discovery has closed in the actions. The court has set a trial date
of May 27, 2003. Applied believes it has meritorious claims and defenses
and intends to pursue them vigorously.


<B><P>Plasma Physics</B><br>

On April 17, 2000, Applied filed a lawsuit against Plasma Physics Corp.
(PPC) and Solar Physics Corp. (SPC) in the United States District Court
for the Eastern District of New York, captioned Applied Materials, Inc.
v. Plasma Physics Corp., Solar Physics Corp. and John Coleman (case no.
00-2199(LDW)). The lawsuit sought a judicial declaration that Applied's
CVD equipment does not infringe two patents owned by PPC and exclusively
licensed to SPC and/or that those patents are invalid or unenforceable.
On July 31, 2000, PPC and SPC answered the complaint and filed a
conditional counterclaim alleging that Applied had contributed to or
induced others to infringe the two patents. PPC and SPC sought an
injunction prohibiting infringement by Applied and an award of costs,
expenses and attorneys' fees. The counterclaim was conditional because
PPC and SPC stated that they would not sue Applied for infringement of
the two patents if the Court dismisses the lawsuit initiated by Applied
for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The Court subsequently denied
without prejudice PPC's and SPC's motion to dismiss the lawsuit for lack
of subject matter jurisdiction, but stated that PPC and SPC could renew
the motion to dismiss, if appropriate, after further discovery. On
September 13, 2001, Applied filed an amended complaint adding two new
causes of action to the existing declaratory judgment claims. The new
claims alleged that PPC and SPC violated the Lanham Act and engaged in
unfair competition by willfully making false or misleading statements
about Applied's equipment. On April 30, 2002, the parties settled the
case and the Court dismissed with prejudice the claims that were brought
in the litigation and any claim or counterclaim that could have been
brought in the litigation.

<p><b>U.S. Department of Justice, Antitrust Division</b><br>

In September 2000, Applied received notice from the Department of
Justice, Antitrust Division, that it had begun an investigation into
Applied's licensing of technology. On February 25, 2002, the Department
of Justice notified Applied that the investigation has been closed.


<B><P>Axcelis Technologies</B><br>

On January 8, 2001, Axcelis Technologies, Inc. (Axcelis), formerly a
subsidiary of Eaton Corporation, filed a lawsuit in the United States
District Court for the District of Massachusetts, captioned Axcelis
Technologies, Inc. v. Applied Materials, Inc. (case no. 01-10029 DPW).
The lawsuit alleges that Applied infringes a patent concerning ion
implantation owned by Axcelis. The complaint also alleges various
Massachusetts state and common law tortious interference and unfair
competition claims. Axcelis seeks a preliminary and permanent
injunction, damages, costs and attorneys' fees. On April 12, 2001,
Applied answered the complaint by denying all allegations and
counterclaimed for declaratory judgment of invalidity and non-
infringement, and violations of various unfair and deceptive trade
practices laws. Applied seeks damages, a permanent injunction, costs and
attorneys' fees. Fact and expert discovery have closed. On December 10,
2002, the Court issued a ruling interpreting the claims of the patent.
Summary judgment motions have been filed and are pending before the
Court. No trial date has been set. Applied believes it has meritorious
defenses and counterclaims to the action and intends to pursue them
vigorously.


<B><P>Linear Technology</B><br>

On March 2, 2001, Linear Technology Corp. (LTC) filed a third party
complaint against Applied in the United States District Court for the
Eastern District of Texas, captioned Texas Instruments, Inc. v. Linear
Technology Corp. v. Applied Materials, Inc. (case no. 2-01-CV4 (DF)).
The complaint against Applied alleged that Applied is obligated to
indemnify LTC and defend LTC for certain claims in the underlying patent
infringement lawsuit brought by Texas Instruments, Inc. (TI) against
LTC. The complaint also alleged claims for breach of contract, breach of
warranty, and various unfair business practices. In the complaint, LTC
alleged that, before LTC purchased certain equipment from Applied,
Applied failed to disclose to LTC that TI previously had won a jury
verdict against Hyundai Electronics Industries Co., Ltd. (Hyundai) for
patent infringement based on Hyundai's use of certain semiconductor
equipment including some Applied tools. LTC's Texas lawsuit against
Applied sought indemnification and damages from Applied and an order
requiring Applied to defend LTC in the underlying lawsuit with TI. On
January 15, 2002, the Court granted TI's motion to sever Applied and the
other third party defendants from the action and dismissed LTC's action
against Applied and the other third party defendants without prejudice.
On March 12, 2002, LTC filed a complaint against Applied in the Superior
Court for the County of Santa Clara, captioned Linear Technology Corp.
v. Applied Materials, Inc., Novellus Systems, Inc. and Tokyo Electron
Ltd., (case no. CV806004) alleging claims for breach of contract, fraud
and deceit, negligent misrepresentation, suppression of fact, unfair
competition, breach of warranty, express contractual indemnity, implied
equitable indemnity and declaratory relief. On November 12, 2002, LTC
filed an amended complaint in the Santa Clara action asserting
essentially the same claims as in the original complaint but adding an
additional assertion that LTC and TI have settled their litigation. In
the amended compliant, LTC seeks damages, punitive damages, injunctive
relief and restitution. LTC also seeks costs and attorneys' fees
including costs and attorneys' fees for the TI litigation. LTC has also
asserted similar claims against certain other semiconductor equipment
manufacturers. Applied has answered the complaint by denying all
allegations. No trial date has been set. Applied believes that it has
meritorious defenses and intends to pursue them vigorously.


<B><P>Semitool</B><br>

On June 11, 2001, Semitool, Inc. (Semitool) filed a lawsuit against
Applied in the United States District Court for the Northern District of
California, captioned Semitool, Inc. v. Applied Materials, Inc. (case
no. CV-01-2277 CRB). The lawsuit alleged that Applied infringed a patent
concerning seed repair and electroplating owned by Semitool. Semitool
sought a preliminary and permanent injunction, damages, costs and
attorneys' fees. On July 12, 2001, before Applied had answered the
complaint, Semitool voluntarily dismissed its action against Applied in
the Northern District of California. On the same day, Semitool filed a
substantially identical action against Applied in the United States
District Court for the District of Oregon captioned Semitool, Inc. v.
Applied Materials, Inc. (case no. CV'01-1066 AS). On July 13, 2001,
Applied filed a declaratory judgment action against Semitool in the
Northern District of California captioned Applied Materials, Inc. v.
Semitool, Inc. (case no. CV-01-2673 BZ). In that action, Applied seeks a
declaration that Applied has not infringed the Semitool patent and that
Semitool's patent is invalid and unenforceable. Applied also seeks costs
and attorneys' fees. The California Court has ordered Applied's action
against Semitool transferred to the District of Oregon. The actions are
proceeding together in Oregon. Semitool has also asserted similar claims
against certain other semiconductor equipment manufacturers. Discovery
is ongoing. The Oregon Court has issued an order interpreting the patent
claims and has rescheduled the trial date from June 30, 2003 to
February 3, 2004. Applied believes it has meritorious claims and
defenses and intends to pursue them vigorously.


<B><P>David Scharf</B><br>

On July 31, 2001, David Scharf, an individual, filed a lawsuit against
Applied in the United States District Court for the Central District of
California, captioned David Scharf v. Applied Materials, Inc. (case no.
01-06580 AHM). The lawsuit alleges that Applied has infringed, has
induced others to infringe and has contributed to others' infringement
of a patent concerning color synthesizing scanning electron microscope
technology. Mr. Scharf seeks a preliminary and permanent injunction,
damages and costs. Applied has answered the complaint and counterclaimed
for declaratory judgment of non-infringement and invalidity. On May 10,
2002, Mr. Scharf filed a request for re-examination of his own patent.
On June 26, 2002, the case was removed from the Court's active docket
after the parties stipulated to stay the case pending the results of
that re-examination. On July 11, 2002, Applied filed its own request for
re-examination of Mr. Scharf's patent with the Patent and Trademark
Office, which was granted on September 19, 2002. Applied believes it has
meritorious defenses and counterclaims and intends to pursue them
vigorously.


<p><b>ASMI</b><br>

On August 27, 2002, ASM America, Inc. and ASM International, N.V.
(collectively "ASMI") filed a lawsuit against Applied in the United
States District Court for the District of Arizona, captioned ASM
America, Inc. and ASM International, N.V. v. Applied Materials, Inc.
(case no. Civ'02 1660 PHX SMM). The lawsuit seeks a judicial declaration
that ASMI does not infringe six patents belonging to Applied that relate
to remote cleaning of CVD chambers and to deposition of silicon nitride.
The suit also seeks a judicial declaration that two of those six patents
are invalid. On December 16, 2002, Applied responded to the complaint by
denying the allegations and counterclaimed by seeking a declaratory
judgment of infringement and validity of two of the patents related to
remote cleaning of CVD chambers. Applied seeks damages, a preliminary
and permanent injunction, costs and attorneys' fees. Applied also moved
to dismiss the complaint with respect to four of the patents and moved
for a more definitive statement with respect to two of ASMI's causes of
action. No trial date has been set. Applied believes it has meritorious
defenses and counterclaims and intends to pursue them vigorously.


<p><b>Robert Bosch GmbH</b><br>

On October 10, 2002, Robert Bosch GmbH (Bosch), a German company, filed
a lawsuit against Applied in the United States District Court for the
District of Delaware, captioned Robert Bosch GmbH v. Applied Materials,
Inc. (civil action no. 02-1523). The lawsuit alleges that Applied
infringes two patents owned by Bosch related to anisotrophic etching.
Bosch seeks a preliminary and permanent injunction, damages, costs and
attorneys' fees. Applied has not been served with the complaint and has
therefore not answered. No trial date has been set. Applied believes it
has meritorious defenses and intends to pursue them vigorously.


<p>From time to time, Applied receives notification from customers claiming
that such customers are entitled to indemnification or other obligations
from Applied related to infringement claims made against the customers
by third parties. In addition, Applied is subject to various other legal
proceedings and claims, either asserted or unasserted, that arise in the
ordinary course of business. Although the outcome of these claims cannot
be predicted with certainty, Applied does not believe that any of these
other existing legal matters will have a material adverse effect on its
financial condition or results of operations.

<B><P>RESULTS OF OPERATIONS</B></P>

<p>Applied develops, manufactures, markets and services semiconductor wafer
fabrication equipment for the worldwide semiconductor industry. Demand
for Applied's products can change significantly from period to period as
a result of numerous factors, including, but not limited to, changes in:
1) global economic conditions; 2) supply and demand for semiconductors;
3) the profitability of semiconductor manufacturers; 4) advanced
technology and/or capacity requirements of semiconductor manufacturers;
and 5) relative competitiveness of Applied's products and services. For
this and other reasons, Applied's results of operations for fiscal 2000,
2001 and 2002 may not necessarily be indicative of future operating
results.

<p>Effective the first fiscal quarter of 2001, Applied implemented the
Securities and Exchange Commission's Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101,
"Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements." For periods prior to
fiscal 2001, data was not available to provide pro forma information as
if the change in accounting principle were applied retroactively. For
further details, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.




<B><P>Net Sales</B><br>
Applied's business was subject to cyclical industry conditions in fiscal
2000, 2001 and 2002. As a result of these conditions, there were
significant fluctuations in Applied's quarterly new orders and net
sales, both within and across fiscal years. Demand for semiconductor
manufacturing equipment has historically been volatile as a result of
sudden changes in semiconductor supply and demand and other factors,
including rapid technological advances in both semiconductor devices and
wafer fabrication processes.

<p>In fiscal 2000, the semiconductor and semiconductor manufacturing
equipment industries were in a period of expansion, and Applied achieved
record levels of new orders, net sales and net income for this period.
However, during the first fiscal quarter of 2001, slowing worldwide
demand for semiconductors resulted in a rapid decline in demand for
manufacturing equipment. Inventory buildups in telecommunication
products, slower than expected personal computer sales and slower global
economic growth caused semiconductor companies to reevaluate their
capital spending and reschedule or cancel existing orders. This decline
in demand deepened sequentially throughout fiscal 2001 and the first
fiscal quarter of 2002 into a severe industry downturn due to continued
weakness in the macro-economic climate and consumption of electronic
goods, which resulted in further capital spending cutbacks by Applied's
customers. As a result of these factors, net sales declined 23 percent
from $9.6 billion for fiscal 2000 to $7.3 billion for fiscal 2001. Also
included in fiscal 2001 net sales was $642 million of revenue that was
recognized as part of the cumulative effect of implementing the
Securities and Exchange Commission's Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101
(SAB 101), "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements."

<p>Net sales declined 31 percent from $7.3 billion for fiscal 2001 to $5.1
billion for fiscal 2002. The decline in demand for Applied's products
continued into the first fiscal quarter of 2002. In the second fiscal
quarter of 2002, customers began to order equipment for 200mm advanced
capacity to satisfy demand driven by consumer-related and wireless
devices. Customers ordered 200mm capacity for this increase in demand as
their transition to 300mm equipment was not yet complete. Customers also
continued to place technology orders to invest in 300mm wafer
processing, copper and smaller line-width technologies. However, second
quarter demand levels proved to be unsustainable as the global economic
environment weakened through the middle of the year, and customers
reduced their level of capacity spending accordingly while maintaining
advanced technology spending. Net sales peaked in the third fiscal
quarter of 2002 and flattened in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2002.
Included in fiscal 2002 net sales was the remaining $9 million of
revenue that was recognized as part of the cumulative effect of
implementing SAB 101.


<B><P>Gross Margin</B><br>

Gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased from 50.8 percent
for fiscal 2000 to 44.3 percent for fiscal 2001, and to 40.6 percent for
fiscal 2002. During fiscal 1999 and 2000, Applied experienced
unprecedented new order and revenue growth. Accordingly, Applied
expanded its manufacturing facilities during these periods to
accommodate current and anticipated growth. The decreased business
volume for fiscal 2001 and 2002 due to the industry downturn was
insufficient to fully absorb the overhead costs of these facilities,
resulting in lower gross margins for fiscal 2001 and 2002. The decrease
in fiscal 2002 gross margin was also attributable to customer service
and support activities, primarily startup costs associated with a new
spare parts distribution system and excess overhead resulting from the
decline in system installations.



<B><P>Research, Development and Engineering</B><br>

Applied's future operating results depend, to a considerable extent, on
its ability to maintain a competitive advantage in the products and
services it provides. Applied believes that it is critical to continue
to make substantial investments in RD&E to assure the availability of
innovative technology that meets the current and projected requirements
of its customers' most advanced chip designs. Applied has historically
maintained its commitment to investing in RD&E, especially during
industry downturns, in order to continue to offer new products and
technologies. As a result, RD&E expenses remained relatively flat at
$1.1 billion (11.6 percent of net sales) for fiscal 2000, $1.2 billion
(16.3 percent of net sales) for fiscal 2001, and $1.1 billion (20.8
percent of net sales) for fiscal 2002. Product development cycles range
from 12 to 36 months depending on whether the tool development is an
enhancement of existing technology or a new product area. Most of
Applied's existing product lines are the result of internal product
development activities. In certain instances, Applied acquires
technologies in either existing areas of development or new product
opportunities to complement its existing technology capabilities and to
reduce time to market for market entry and penetration. Throughout the
periods covered by this report, Applied has been investing in its new
Process Module products to provide customers with a qualified,
integrated and optimized production process flow for building
microstructures on advanced chips. Process modules are designed to link
certain Applied equipment to deliver an integrated process application
to the customer for wafer processing.

<p>During fiscal 2001, Applied continued its development of technologies
for copper and low </FONT><FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=2>k</FONT><FONT SIZE=2>-based
chips and 300mm wafers, as well as focused
efforts on the core technologies that will be required for chipmakers to
begin development of 100nm generation devices. Areas of increased
investment included maskmaking technology, metrology and inspection, ion
implantation, and products for depositing and etching new materials.

<p>In fiscal 2002, Applied invested in critical development activities to
meet customers' rapid move to sub-100nm dimensions in their most
advanced designs, which are expected to begin entering production in
fiscal 2003. This difficult and challenging dimensional shift is matched
by the need to provide much of the technology for both 200mm and 300mm
wafers, requiring additional process and hardware development. For the
sub-100nm chip generations, inspection and metrology tools have become
more important to assure enhanced device performance as well as adequate
manufacturing yields. Accordingly, Applied focused its RD&E resources on
these technologies. In addition, development of new technologies such as
advanced wafer wet cleaning and atomic layer deposition, which deposits
materials in increasingly smaller structures, addresses new market
opportunities for Applied in coming years. Within virtually all of the
technology areas, including fab and yield management, Applied invested
in more advanced software capabilities.


<B><P>Marketing, Selling, General and Administrative</B><br>

Marketing, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased from
$961 million (10.0 percent of net sales) for fiscal 2000 to $902 million
(12.3 percent of net sales) for fiscal 2001, and to $709 million (14.0
percent of net sales) for fiscal 2002. The decreases for fiscal 2001 and
2002 were due primarily to cost reduction activities limiting
discretionary expenditures and to lower business volume.

<B><P>Non-recurring Items</B><br>

Non-recurring items for fiscal 2000 totaled $40 million, or $0.02 per
diluted share after tax, related to merger expenses for the acquisition
of Etec.

<p>Non-recurring items for fiscal 2001 totaled $221 million, or $0.09 per
diluted share after tax, consisting of a pre-tax charge of $10 million
for acquired in-process research and development and pre-tax
restructuring charges of $211 million. During fiscal 2001, Applied
recorded pre-tax restructuring charges of $211 million, consisting of
$105 million for headcount reductions, $45 million for consolidation of
facilities and $61 million for other costs, primarily fixed asset
write-offs. These restructuring actions occurred in Applied's second, third
and fourth fiscal quarters, and were taken to better align Applied's
cost structure with prevailing market conditions. During the second
fiscal quarter of 2001, Applied completed a voluntary separation plan
that resulted in a headcount reduction of approximately 1,000 employees,
or three percent of its global workforce, for a cost of $47 million.
During the third fiscal quarter of 2001, Applied recorded a pre-tax
restructuring charge of $4 million associated with severance and benefit
costs. During the fourth fiscal quarter of 2001, Applied eliminated
approximately 2,000 additional positions, or 10 percent of its global
workforce, for a cost of $54 million. The majority of the affected
employees were based in Santa Clara, California and Austin, Texas, and
represented multiple company activities and functions.

<p>Non-recurring items for fiscal 2002 totaled $85 million, or $0.04 per
diluted share after tax, consisting of a pre-tax charge of $8 million
for acquired in-process research and development and a pre-tax
restructuring charge of $77 million. The pre-tax restructuring charge,
which was recorded in the first fiscal quarter of 2002, consisted of $39
million for headcount reductions, $16 million for consolidation of
facilities and $22 million for other costs, primarily fixed asset
write-offs. This restructuring action was taken to better align Applied's cost
structure with prevailing market conditions due to the prolonged
industry downturn, and it reduced Applied's global workforce by
approximately 1,100 employees, or six percent. The majority of the
affected employees were based in Santa Clara, California and Austin,
Texas, and represented multiple company activities and functions.

<p>For further details, see Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.




<B><P>Non-recurring Income</B><br>
Non-recurring income of $68 million for fiscal 2000 was related to a
1998 litigation settlement with ASM International, N.V. For further
details, see Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.




<B><P>Net Interest Income</B><BR>
Net interest income was $133 million for fiscal 2000, $174 million
for fiscal 2001 and $131 million for fiscal 2002. The increase for
fiscal 2001 was due primarily to higher average cash and investment
balances. The decrease for fiscal 2002 was due primarily to lower
average interest rates.

<B><P>Provision for Income Taxes</B><br>
Applied's effective income tax rate was 30.0 percent for fiscal 2000,
29.8 percent for fiscal 2001 and 21.0 percent for fiscal 2002. Applied
expected an effective rate of 29.5 percent for fiscal 2001, which
decreased from the fiscal 2000 effective rate due to a shift in the
geographic composition of Applied's pre-tax income. The actual effective
rate for fiscal 2001 of 29.8 percent differed from the expected rate of
29.5 percent due to the non-tax deductible nature of $10 million of
acquired in-process research and development expense. Applied's actual
effective rate of 21.0 percent for fiscal 2002 differed from the
anticipated effective rate of 29.5 percent primarily due to significant
Foreign Sales Corporation and extraterritorial income tax benefits.
Absent these additional benefits, earnings per diluted share would have
been reduced by $0.02 for fiscal 2002. Applied's future effective income
tax rate depends on various factors, such as tax legislation, the
geographic composition of Applied's pre-tax income, non-tax deductible
expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions and the effectiveness
of its tax planning strategies.


<B><P>Business Combinations</B><br>

On November 20, 2001, Applied acquired the assets of Schlumberger's
electron-beam wafer inspection business for $66 million in cash. On
December 3, 2001, Applied acquired Global Knowledge Services, Inc., a
provider of advanced data mining services to improve semiconductor
manufacturing yield and efficiency, for $16 million in cash. On April 8,
2002, Applied acquired Electron Vision Corporation, a designer,
manufacturer and seller of e-beam stabilization and curing tools for the
semiconductor, thin film head and micro-fabrication industries, for $26
million in cash.

<p>Applied also made acquisitions in fiscal 2000 and fiscal 2001. For
further details, see Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

<B><P>SUBSEQUENT EVENT</B></P>

<p>On November 4, 2002, Applied announced a headcount reduction of
approximately 1,750 positions, or 11 percent of its global workforce,
in response to the continuing downturn in the semiconductor industry.
The majority of the affected employees were based in Santa Clara,
California and Austin, Texas, and represented multiple company
activities and functions. As a result of these activities, Applied
will record a restructuring charge for the first fiscal quarter of
2003.


<p><b>RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS</b></p>

<p>In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 143, "Accounting
for Asset Retirement Obligations." SFAS No. 143 addresses financial
accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement
of tangible long-lived assets and the associated retirement costs.
Applied does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 143, which will be
effective for Applied's fiscal 2003, to have a material effect on its
financial condition or results of operations.

<p>In October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets." SFAS No. 144 supersedes
SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and
for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of," and Accounting Principles
Board (APB) Opinion No. 30, "Reporting the Results of Operations -
Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of Business, and
Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and
Transactions." Applied does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 144,
which will be effective for Applied's fiscal 2003, to have a material
effect on its financial condition or results of operations.

<p>In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, "Rescission of FASB
Statements No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and
Technical Corrections." Applied does not expect the adoption of SFAS
No. 145, which will become effective at varying dates from May 2002 to
Applied's fiscal 2003, to have a material effect on its financial
condition or results of operations.

<p>In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs
Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities." SFAS No. 146 addresses
financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or
disposal activities and supersedes Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No.
94-3, "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits
and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in
a Restructuring)." SFAS No. 146 is effective for exit or disposal
activities initiated after December 31, 2002. Applied does not expect
the adoption of SFAS No. 146 to have a material effect on its financial
condition or results of operations.

<p>For further details regarding the above recent accounting
pronouncements, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.



<B><P>FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES</P></B>

<p>Applied increased its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments
from $4.8 billion at October 28, 2001 to $4.9 billion at October 27,
2002. Applied has generated $3.7 billion of cash from operating
activities during the past three years, primarily from net income and
working capital management. Applied has not undertaken any significant
external financing activities for several years.

<p>Applied generated cash from operating activities of $1.7 billion for
fiscal 2000, $1.6 billion for fiscal 2001 and $492 million for fiscal
2002. The primary sources of cash from operating activities have been
net income, as adjusted to exclude the effect of non-cash charges, and
changes in working capital requirements, including accounts receivable
and inventories. Applied utilized programs to sell accounts receivable
of $1.5 billion for fiscal 2000, $1.2 billion for fiscal 2001 and $689
million for fiscal 2002. These receivable sales had the effect of
increasing cash and reducing accounts receivable and days sales
outstanding. Days sales outstanding was 66 days at the end of fiscal
2002, compared to 56 days at the end of fiscal 2001 and 73 days at the
end of fiscal 2000. Applied has not experienced any losses under these
programs, and receivables sold under these programs have terms and
credit risk characteristics similar to Applied's overall receivables
portfolio. For further details regarding accounts receivable sales, see
Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Inventories were
reduced by $139 million in fiscal 2002 due to lower systems inventories,
partially offset by an increase in customer service spares inventories
to support new 300mm products shipped to customers.

<p>Applied used $1.0 billion of cash for investing activities for fiscal
2000, $1.6 billion for fiscal 2001 and $693 million for fiscal 2002.
Capital expenditures, net of retirements, were $383 million for fiscal
2000, $711 million for fiscal 2001 and $417 million for fiscal year
2002, totaling $1.5 billion for the past three years. Application
laboratories, equipment and related facilities comprised most of the
capital spending. The largest capital expenditure for the last three
years was the construction and fit-up of the Maydan Process Module
Technology Center where Applied's demonstration laboratories for new
technology applications are located. Fiscal 2002 capital expenditures
also included $65 million for the purchase of properties in Santa Clara,
California that were previously held under a synthetic lease. Investing
activities also included purchases and sales of short-term investments
and acquisitions of technology or of other companies to allow Applied to
access new market segments or emerging technology.

<p>Applied generated $149 million of cash from financing activities for
fiscal 2000, used $261 million for fiscal 2001 and generated $131
million for fiscal 2002. Net common stock activities (issuances of
common stock under employee stock plans, offset by share repurchases)
generated $99 million for fiscal 2000 as a result of a significant
increase in option exercises by employees, reflecting Applied's higher
average stock price, partially offset by stock repurchases. During
fiscal 2001, net common stock activity used $169 million of cash as
stock repurchases increased and stock sales to employees decreased,
reflecting Applied's lower average stock price in fiscal 2001. During
fiscal 2002, net common stock activity generated $75 million of cash due
to stock sales to employees and lower stock repurchases. Since March
1996, Applied has systematically repurchased shares of its common stock
in the open market to partially fund its stock-based employee benefit
and incentive plans. Financing activities also included borrowings and
repayments of debt. Changes in debt generated $50 million of cash for
fiscal 2000, used $92 million of cash for fiscal 2001 and generated $56
million of cash for fiscal 2002.

<p>To date, Applied has not declared or paid cash dividends to its
stockholders due to a number of factors, including the volatile nature
of the semiconductor industry and the potential requirements to finance
working capital in the event of a significant upturn in business.
Applied reevaluates this practice from time to time but is not
contemplating the payment of a cash dividend. On March 21, 2002,
Applied's Board of Directors approved a two-for-one stock split of
Applied's common stock, which was distributed in the form of a 100
percent stock dividend on or about April 16, 2002 to stockholders of
record as of April 1, 2002.

<p>Although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent
of these factors, Applied's management believes that cash generated from
operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing cash
balances and borrowing capability, will be sufficient to satisfy
Applied's liquidity requirements for the next 12 months. For further
details regarding Applied's operating, investing and financing
activities for each of the three years in the period ended October 27,
2002, see the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K.

<p>The following table summarizes the effect on Applied's liquidity and
cash flows from contractual obligations of debt arrangements and

<p><b>CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES</b></p>

<p>The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates
that affect the amounts reported. Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies used
in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Certain of
these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical
accounting policies, as defined below.

<p>A critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to
the presentation of Applied's financial statements and requires
management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments that could
have a material effect on Applied's financial condition and results of
operations. Specifically, critical accounting estimates have the
following attributes: 1) Applied is required to make assumptions about
matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate; and
2) different estimates Applied could reasonably have used, or changes in
the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur, would have a material
effect on Applied's financial condition or results of operations.

<p>Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot
be determined with certainty. Applied bases its estimates on historical
experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable
and reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates may change as
new events occur, as additional information is obtained and as Applied's
operating environment changes. These changes have historically been
minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as
soon as they became known. In addition, management is periodically faced
with uncertainties, the outcomes of which are not within its control and
will not be known for prolonged periods of time. These uncertainties are
discussed in the section below entitled "Trends, Risks and
Uncertainties." Based on a critical assessment of its accounting
policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the
application of those policies, management believes that Applied's
consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and
present a meaningful presentation of Applied's financial condition and
results of operations.

<p>Management believes that the following are critical accounting policies:

<p><b>Warranty Costs</b><br>

Applied provides for the estimated cost of warranty when revenue is
recognized. Estimated warranty costs are determined by analyzing
specific product and configuration experience statistics and regional
warranty support costs. Applied's warranty obligation is affected by
product failure rates, material usage, and labor costs incurred in
correcting product failures during the warranty period. As Applied's
customer engineers and process support engineers are highly trained and
deployed globally, labor availability is a significant factor in
determining labor costs. The quantity and availability of critical
replacement parts is another significant factor in estimating warranty
costs. Unforeseen component failures or exceptional component
performance can also result in changes to warranty costs. If actual
warranty costs differ substantially from Applied's estimates, revisions
to the estimated warranty liability would be required, which could have
a material adverse effect on Applied's business, financial condition and
results of operations.

<p><b>Inventories</b><br>

Inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or market, with
cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis. The carrying value of
inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence by the difference
between its cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions
about future demand. Applied evaluates the inventory carrying value for
potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing
historical and anticipated demand. In addition, known and anticipated
engineering change orders are evaluated for potential obsolescence. If
actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated, additional
inventory adjustments for excess or obsolete inventory may be required,
which could have a material adverse effect on Applied's business,
financial condition and results of operations.

<p><b>Goodwill and Intangible Assets</b><br>

Applied reviews goodwill and intangible assets for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
these assets may not be recoverable, and also reviews goodwill annually
in accordance with SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets." Intangible assets, such as purchased technology, are generally
recorded in connection with a business acquisition. The value assigned
to intangible assets is determined by an independent valuation firm
based on estimates and judgment regarding expectations for the success
and life cycle of products and technology acquired. If actual product
acceptance differs significantly from the estimates, Applied may be
required to record an impairment charge to write down the asset to its
realizable value. In addition, SFAS No. 142 requires that goodwill be
tested annually using a two-step process. The first step is to identify
any potential impairment by comparing the carrying value of the
reporting unit to its fair value. If a potential impairment is
identified, the second step is to compare the implied fair value of
goodwill with its carrying amount to measure the impairment loss. The
fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using the market multiples
approach, and is dependent on market values for companies in a similar
industry. A severe decline in market value could result in an unexpected
impairment charge to goodwill, which could have a material adverse
effect on Applied's business, financial condition and results of
operations.

<p><b>Income Taxes</b><br>

Applied accounts for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109,
"Accounting for Income Taxes," which requires that deferred tax assets
and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of
temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets
and liabilities. SFAS No. 109 also requires that deferred tax assets be
reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a
portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Management has
determined that it is more likely than not that its future taxable
income will be sufficient to realize its deferred tax assets.

<p>Applied provides for income taxes based upon an annual estimated
effective income tax rate. The effective tax rate is highly dependent
upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings, tax regulations
governing each region, non-tax deductible expenses incurred in
connection with acquisitions, availability of tax credits and the
effectiveness of Applied's tax planning strategies. Management carefully
monitors the changes in many factors and adjusts the effective income
tax rate on a timely basis. If actual results differ from these
estimates, Applied could be required to record a valuation allowance on
deferred tax assets or adjust its effective income tax rate, which could
have a material effect on Applied's financial condition and results of
operations.


<B><P>TRENDS, RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES</B></P>

<p><b>The industry that Applied serves is highly volatile and unpredictable.</b><br>

As a supplier to the semiconductor industry, Applied is subject to the
business cycles that characterize the industry-the timing, length and
volatility of these cycles are difficult to predict. The semiconductor
industry has historically been cyclical because of sudden changes in
demand for semiconductors and capacity requirements, including capacity
utilizing the latest technology. The rate of changes in demand,
including end demand, is accelerating, and the effect of these changes
upon Applied is occurring sooner, exacerbating the volatility of these
cycles. These changes have affected the timing and amounts of customers'
capital equipment purchases and investments in new technology. These
industry cycles create pressure on Applied's net sales, gross margin and
net income. In addition to affecting Applied's customers and suppliers,
these cycles challenge key management, engineering and other employees
of Applied who are vital to Applied's success.

<p>During periods of declining demand for semiconductor manufacturing
equipment, customers typically reduce purchases, delay delivery of
products and/or cancel orders. During downturns, Applied must be able to
timely and effectively align its cost structure with prevailing market
conditions, to manage its inventory levels to reduce the possibility of
future inventory write-downs resulting from obsolescence and liability
to suppliers for order cancellations, and to motivate and retain key
employees. During periods of rapid growth, Applied must be able to
acquire and/or develop sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory
to meet customer demand, and to attract, hire, assimilate and retain a
sufficient number of qualified people. If Applied is unable to achieve
its objectives in a timely manner during changes in business conditions,
there could be a material adverse effect on its business, financial
condition and results of operations.

<p>The semiconductor equipment industry is currently experiencing a
continued and prolonged downturn. Management believes that this current
downturn may be the most severe decline in history and cannot predict
when a recovery will begin or what the industry's rate of growth will be
in such a recovery.

<p><b>Applied is exposed to the risks of operating a global business.</b><br>

Currently, 74 percent of Applied's revenues result from sales outside
the U.S., with an increasing percentage of sales to customers
headquartered in Asia. Certain manufacturing facilities and suppliers
are also located outside the U.S. Managing Applied's global operations
presents challenges, including periodic regional economic downturns,
trade balance issues, varying business conditions and demands, political
instability, variations in enforcement of intellectual property and
contract rights in different jurisdictions, differences in the ability
to develop relationships with suppliers and other local businesses,
changes in U.S. and international laws and regulations including U.S.
export restrictions, fluctuations in interest and currency exchange
rates, the ability to provide sufficient levels of technical support in
different locations, cultural differences, shipping delays and terrorist
acts or acts of war, among other risks. Many of these challenges are
present in China, which represents a large potential market for
semiconductor equipment and where Applied anticipates significant
opportunity for growth. Global uncertainties with respect to:
1) economic growth rates in various countries; 2) sustainability of
demand for electronics products; 3) capital spending by semiconductor
manufacturers; 4) price weakness for certain semiconductor devices; and
5) political instability in regions where Applied has operations, such
as Israel and Asia, may also affect Applied's business, financial
condition and results of operations.

<p><b>Applied operates in a highly competitive industry characterized by
increasingly rapid technological changes.</b><br>

Applied's future success depends on performing better than its
competitors in a number of ways, including its ability to timely and
cost-effectively: 1) develop new products, services and technologies,
including those utilizing new materials, such as copper; 2) develop
improvements to existing products, services and technologies; 3) develop
new markets in the semiconductor industry for its products and services;
4) introduce new products and services to the marketplace; 5) achieve
market acceptance; 6) qualify new or improved products for volume
manufacturing with its customers; 7) commence and adjust production to
meet customer demands; and 8) price products and services appropriately.
The development, introduction of and the ability to support an
increasingly broader set of new or improved products and technologies,
including those enabling the transition to smaller device feature sizes,
new materials and 300mm wafers, grows increasingly complex and expensive
over time. Such new or improved products may involve higher costs and
reduced efficiencies compared to Applied's more established products and
could adversely affect Applied's gross margins. If Applied does not
develop and introduce new or improved products, services and
technologies in a timely and cost-effective manner in response to
changing market conditions or customer requirements, its competitive
position, financial condition and results of operations could be
materially and adversely affected.

<p><b>Applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes in the
semiconductor industry.<br></b>

Ongoing changes in the semiconductor industry, including more complex
technology requirements, the growth in Asia, increasing pressure on
semiconductor manufacturers to allocate resources to activities that
enhance their competitive advantage, the increasing significance of
consumer electronics as a driver for demand for semiconductors and the
related focus on lower costs, have in turn resulted in the increasing
importance of spares and service as a growing percentage of
semiconductor equipment suppliers' business. These changes are also
requiring semiconductor manufacturing equipment suppliers to provide
increasing levels of process integration support. If Applied does not
successfully manage the risks resulting from these changes in the
semiconductor industry, its business, financial condition and results of
operations could be materially and adversely affected.

<p><b>Applied is exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer
base.</b><br>

Applied's customer base is highly concentrated. Orders from a relatively
limited number of semiconductor manufacturers have accounted for, and
likely will continue to account for, a substantial portion of Applied's
net sales, which may lead customers to demand pricing and other terms
less favorable to Applied. In addition, sales to any single customer may
vary significantly from quarter to quarter. If current customers delay,
cancel or do not place orders, Applied may not be able to replace these
orders with new orders. As Applied's products are configured to customer
specifications, changing, rescheduling or canceling orders may result in
significant and often non-recoverable costs. The resulting fluctuations
in the amount of or terms for orders could have a material adverse
effect on Applied's business, financial condition and results of
operations.

<p><b>Manufacturing interruptions or delays could affect Applied's ability to
meet customer demand.</b><br>

Applied's business depends on its ability to manufacture products that
meet the rapidly changing demands of its customers. Applied's ability to
manufacture depends in part on the timely delivery of parts, components,
and subassemblies (collectively "parts") from suppliers. Some key
parts may be obtained only from a single supplier or a limited group of
suppliers. Significant interruptions of manufacturing operations as a
result of the failure or inability of suppliers to timely deliver
quality parts, natural disasters (such as earthquakes or tornadoes), or
other causes (such as information technology or infrastructure failures,
regional economic downturns, political instability or terrorist acts or
acts of war) could result in delayed product deliveries or manufacturing
inefficiencies. Any or all of these factors could materially and
adversely affect Applied's business, financial condition and results of
operations.

<p><b>Applied is subject to risks of non-compliance with environmental and safety
regulations.</b><br>

Applied is subject to environmental and safety regulations in connection
with its business operations, including but not limited to regulations
related to the development, manufacturing and use of its products.
Failure or inability to comply with existing or future environmental and
safety regulations could result in significant remediation liabilities,
the imposition of fines and/or the suspension or termination of
development, manufacturing or use of certain of its products, each of
which could have a material adverse effect on Applied's business,
financial condition and results of operations.

<p><b>Applied is exposed to risks associated with acquisitions. </b><br>

Applied has made, and may in the future make, acquisitions of, or
significant investments in, businesses with complementary products,
services and/or technologies. Acquisitions involve numerous risks,
including but not limited to: 1) diversion of management's attention
from other operational matters; 2) the inability to realize expected
synergies resulting from the acquisition; 3) failure to commercialize
purchased technology; and 4) impairment of acquired intangible assets as
a result of technological advancements or worse-than-expected
performance of the acquired company. Mergers and acquisitions are
inherently subject to multiple significant risks, and the inability to
effectively manage these risks could materially and adversely affect
Applied's business, financial condition and results of operations.

<p><b>Applied is exposed to various risks related to the regulatory
environment. </b><br>

Applied is subject to various risks related to: 1) new, different,
inconsistent or even conflicting laws, rules and regulations that may be
enacted by legislative bodies and/or regulatory agencies in the
countries in which Applied operates and with which Applied must comply;
and 2) disagreements or disputes between national or regional regulatory
agencies related to international trade.

<p>For example, the World Trade Organization (WTO) has determined that the
U.S. Foreign Sales Corporation (FSC) and Extraterritorial Income (ETI)
exclusion constitute a prohibited export subsidy warranting the possible
imposition of trade sanctions on certain goods, including semiconductor
manufacturing equipment. Applied has benefited from FSC and ETI tax
provisions. The elimination of these tax benefits or imposition of
sanctions could materially and adversely affect Applied's business,
financial condition and results of operations.

<p>During fiscal 2002, Applied filed an application with the SEC for an
exemptive order confirming that it is not subject to the Investment
Company Act of 1940 (the Act), which requires companies primarily
engaged in the business of investing in securities to comply with
additional rules and regulations. Largely due to the industry downturn,
Applied's ratios of investments to total assets and of interest income
to net income have increased, resulting in the risk that Applied could
be deemed to be covered by the Act. If the SEC does not grant the
exemption, Applied may have to take other actions that could adversely
affect its results of operations in order not to be subject to the Act.

<p><b>Applied is exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or
claims. </b><br>

Applied currently is, and in the future may be, involved in legal
proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement, intellectual
property rights, antitrust, environmental regulations, securities,
contracts and other matters (see Item 3: Legal Proceedings). In
addition, from time to time, Applied receives notification from
customers who believe that Applied owes them indemnification or other
obligations related to infringement claims made against the customers by
third parties. These legal proceedings and claims, whether with or
without merit, are time-consuming and expensive to prosecute or defend
and divert management's attention and resources. There can be no
assurance regarding the outcome of current or future legal proceedings
or claims. In addition, Applied's intellectual property rights may not
provide significant competitive advantages if they are circumvented,
invalidated or obsoleted by the rapid pace of technological change.
Furthermore, the laws of other countries permit the protection of
Applied's proprietary rights to varying extents, compared to U.S. laws.
Applied's success is dependent in part upon the protection of its
intellectual property rights. Infringement of Applied's rights by a
third party could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue
opportunities for Applied. If Applied is not able to resolve a claim,
negotiate a settlement of the matter, obtain necessary licenses on
commercially reasonable terms, and/or successfully prosecute or defend
its position, Applied's business, financial condition and results of
operations could be materially and adversely affected.

<A NAME="item7a"></A>
<B><P>Item 7a:  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market
Risk</P>

<P>Interest Rate Risk</B><br>

At October 27, 2002, Applied's investment portfolio included fixed-income
securities with a fair value of approximately $4.2 billion. These
securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value
if interest rates increase. Due to the short duration of Applied's
investment portfolio, an immediate 10 percent change in interest rates
is not expected to have a material effect on Applied's near-term
financial condition or results of operations.

<p>Applied's long-term debt bears interest primarily at fixed rates;
therefore, Applied's results of operations would be affected by interest
rate changes only to the extent that variable rate short-term notes
payable are outstanding. Due to the short-term nature and relatively
insignificant amount of Applied's short-term notes payable, an immediate
10 percent change in interest rates is not expected to have a material
effect on Applied's near-term financial condition or results of
operations.

<B><P>Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk</B><br>

Certain operations of Applied are conducted in foreign currencies, such
as Japanese yen, euro and British pounds. Applied enters into forward
exchange and currency option contracts to hedge a portion of, but not
all, existing and anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions
expected to occur within 12 months. Gains and losses on these contracts
are generally recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations at
the time that the related transactions being hedged are recognized.
Because the effect of movements in currency exchange rates on forward
exchange and currency option contracts generally offsets the related
effect on the underlying items being hedged, these financial instruments
are not expected to subject Applied to risks that would otherwise result
from changes in currency exchange rates. Applied does not use derivative
financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Net foreign
currency gains and losses did not have a material effect on Applied's
results of operations for fiscal 2000, 2001 or 2002.

<p>Forward exchange contracts are denominated in the same currency as the
underlying transactions (primarily Japanese yen, euro and British
pounds), and the terms of the forward exchange contracts generally match
the terms of the underlying transactions. Applied's outstanding forward
exchange contracts are marked to market (see Note 2 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements), as are the majority of the related
underlying transactions being hedged; therefore, the effect of exchange
rate changes on forward exchange contracts is expected to be
substantially offset by the effect of these changes on the underlying
transactions. The effect of an immediate 10 percent change in exchange
rates on forward exchange contracts and the underlying hedged
transactions is not expected to be material to Applied's near-term
financial condition or results of operations. Applied's downside risk
with respect to currency option contracts is limited to the premium paid
for the right to exercise the option. Premiums paid for options
outstanding at October 27, 2002 were not material.

<p><b>Item 14:  Controls and Procedures</b>

<p>Based on their evaluation as of a date within 90 days of the filing date
of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Applied's principal executive
officer and principal financial officer have concluded that Applied's
disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-14(c) and
15d-14(c) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act)
are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by
Applied in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms.

<p>There were no significant changes in Applied's internal controls or in
other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent
to the date of their evaluation and up to the filing date of this Annual
Report on Form 10-K. There were no significant deficiencies or material
weaknesses, and therefore there were no corrective actions taken.

<p>It should be noted that any system of controls, however well designed
and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance
that the objectives of the system are met. In addition, the design of
any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the
likelihood of future events. Because of these and other inherent
limitations of control systems, there can be no assurance that any
design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential
future conditions, regardless of how remote.

<A NAME="notes"></A>
<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">APPLIED MATERIALS, INC.<br>
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>NOTE 1&nbsp;&nbsp;SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES</P>

<P>Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation</B>&nbsp;

The consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of Applied Materials, Inc. and
its subsidiaries (Applied) after elimination of intercompany balances
and transactions.

<p>The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in
the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual
results could differ materially from those estimates.


<B><P>Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments</B>&nbsp;

All highly-liquid
investments with a remaining maturity of three months or less at the
time of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents. All of Applied's
short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale at the
respective balance sheet dates. Investments classified as available-for-sale
are recorded at fair value based upon quoted market prices, and any
material temporary difference between the cost and fair value of an
investment is presented as a separate component of accumulated other
comprehensive income. The specific identification method is used to
determine the realized gains and losses on investments.


<B><P>Inventories</B> &nbsp;

Inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or
market, with cost determined on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis.

<B><P>Property, Plant and Equipment</B> &nbsp;

Property, plant and equipment is stated
at cost. Depreciation is provided over the estimated useful lives of the
assets using the straight-line method. Estimated useful lives for
financial reporting purposes are as follows: buildings and improvements,
five to 33 years; demonstration and manufacturing equipment, three to
five years; and furniture, fixtures and other equipment, three to 15
years. Land improvements are amortized over the shorter of 15 years or
the estimated useful life. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the
shorter of five years or the lease term.

<B><P>Intangible Assets</B>&nbsp;

Applied adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," in
the first fiscal quarter of 2002. SFAS No. 142 supersedes Accounting
Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 17, "Intangible Assets," and
discontinues the amortization of goodwill. In accordance with SFAS No.
142, beginning October 29, 2001, goodwill is no longer amortized, but is
reviewed at least annually for impairment. Purchased technology and
other intangible assets are presented at cost, net of accumulated
amortization, and are amortized over their estimated useful lives of
three to 10 years using the straight-line method.

<B><P>Long-Lived Assets</B>&nbsp;

Applied reviews long-lived assets for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of these assets may not be recoverable. Applied assesses these
assets for impairment based on estimated future cash flows from these
assets.

<B><P>Advertising Costs  </B>&nbsp;Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.


<B><P>Revenue Recognition</B>&nbsp;

Applied recognizes revenue when all four revenue
recognition criteria have been met:  persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been
rendered; seller's price to buyer is fixed or determinable; and
collectibility is reasonably assured. At Applied, this policy generally
results in revenue recognition at the following points:  1) For all
transactions where legal title passes to the customer upon shipment,
Applied recognizes revenue upon shipment for all products that have been
demonstrated to meet product specifications prior to shipment. However,
a portion of revenue associated with certain installation-related tasks,
based on the estimated fair value of the tasks, is recognized when the
tasks are completed. 2) For products that have not been demonstrated to
meet product specifications prior to shipment, revenue is recognized at
customer technical acceptance. 3) For transactions where legal title
does not transfer at shipment, revenue is recognized when legal title
passes to the customer, which is typically at customer technical
acceptance. A provision for the estimated cost of warranty is recorded
when revenue is recognized. Applied's shipping terms are customarily FOB
Applied shipping point or equivalent terms. Spares revenue is generally
recognized upon shipment. License fees on software marketed as
standalone products are recognized upon shipment when all four revenue
recognition criteria have been met. Service revenue and software
maintenance fees are generally recognized ratably over the period of the
related contract. Prior to the implementation of the Securities and
Exchange Commission's Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 (SAB 101),
"Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements," in fiscal 2001, Applied
generally recognized revenue for established equipment upon shipment.


<B><P>Change in Accounting Policy</B> &nbsp;

Applied implemented SAB 101 for the fourth
fiscal quarter of 2001, retroactively effective to the beginning of
fiscal 2001. Since the implementation of SAB 101 was retroactively
effective to the beginning of fiscal 2001, the first three fiscal
quarters of 2001 were restated in the fiscal 2001 Annual Report on Form
10-K. Applied recorded a cumulative effect of change in accounting
principle of $267 million (net of income tax benefit of $112 million),
or $0.16 per diluted share, for the restated first fiscal quarter of
2001. This charge represents the after-tax difference between the new
and previous revenue recognition policies prior to fiscal 2001 as of the
implementation date at the beginning of fiscal 2001. Therefore, no
restatement of years prior to fiscal 2001 was required. For periods
prior to fiscal 2001, data was not available to provide pro forma
information as if the change in accounting principle were applied
retroactively. SAB 101 had no effect on Applied's revenue recognition
policy for spares, service, license fees on software marketed as
standalone products or software maintenance fees. The cumulative effect
of change in accounting principle of $267 million included $651 million
of revenue recognized prior to fiscal 2001, of which $642 million was
recognized during fiscal 2001. The remaining $9 million of revenue was
recognized during the first fiscal quarter of 2002.



<B><P>Derivative Financial Instruments</B> &nbsp;

Applied uses financial instruments,
such as forward exchange and currency option contracts, to hedge a
portion of, but not all, existing and anticipated foreign currency
denominated transactions expected to occur within 12 months. The terms
of currency instruments used for hedging purposes are generally
consistent with the timing of the transactions being hedged. The purpose
of Applied's foreign currency management is to manage the effect of
exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated
revenues, costs and eventual cash flows. Applied adopted SFAS No. 133,
"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as
amended, in the first fiscal quarter of 2001. Accordingly, all of
Applied's derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value
based upon quoted market prices for comparable instruments. For
derivative instruments designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges of
anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions, the effective
portion of the gain or loss on these hedges is reported as a component
of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders' equity, and
is reclassified into earnings when the hedged transaction affects
earnings. If the transaction being hedged fails to occur, or if a
portion of any derivative is ineffective, the gain or loss on the
associated financial instrument is recorded immediately in earnings. For
derivative instruments used to hedge existing foreign currency
denominated assets or liabilities, the gain or loss on these hedges is
recorded immediately in earnings to offset the changes in the fair value
of the assets or liabilities being hedged. Applied does not use
derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.


<B><P>Foreign Currency Translation</B> &nbsp;

Applied's subsidiaries located in Japan
and Europe operate primarily using local functional currencies.
Accordingly, all assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are
translated using exchange rates in effect at the end of the period, and
revenues and costs are translated using average exchange rates for the
period. The resulting translation adjustments are presented as a
separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income.

<p>Applied's subsidiaries located in Ireland, Italy, Israel, Korea, Taiwan,
Southeast Asia and China primarily use the U.S. dollar as their
functional currency. Accordingly, assets and liabilities of these
subsidiaries are translated using exchange rates in effect at the end of
the period, except for non-monetary assets, such as inventories and
property, plant and equipment, that are translated using historical
exchange rates. Revenues and costs are translated using average exchange
rates for the period, except for costs related to those balance sheet
items that are translated using historical exchange rates. The resulting
translation gains and losses are included in the Consolidated Statements
of Operations as incurred.

<B><P>Employee Stock Plans</B>&nbsp;

As permitted by SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation," Applied elected to continue to apply the
provisions of APB Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees," and related interpretations in accounting for its employee
stock option and stock purchase plans. Applied is generally not required
under APB Opinion No. 25 and related interpretations to recognize
compensation expense in connection with its employee stock option and
stock purchase plans. Applied is required by SFAS No. 123 to present, in
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the pro forma effects on
reported net income and earnings per share as if compensation expense
had been recognized based on the fair value method of accounting
prescribed by SFAS No. 123.


<B><P>Concentrations of Credit Risk</B> &nbsp;

Financial instruments that potentially
subject Applied to significant concentrations of credit risk consist
principally of cash equivalents, short-term investments, trade accounts
receivable and derivative financial instruments used in hedging
activities. Applied invests in a variety of financial instruments, such
as, but not limited to, certificates of deposit, corporate and municipal
bonds, and U.S. Treasury and agency securities, and, by policy, limits
the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution or
commercial issuer. Applied's customers consist of semiconductor
manufacturers located throughout the world. Applied performs ongoing
credit evaluations of its customers' financial condition and generally
requires no collateral to secure accounts receivable. Applied maintains
a reserve for potentially uncollectible accounts receivable based on its
assessment of the collectibility of accounts receivable. In addition,
Applied may utilize letters of credit to mitigate credit risk when
considered appropriate. Applied is exposed to credit-related losses in
the event of nonperformance by counterparties to derivative financial
instruments, but does not expect any counterparties to fail to meet
their obligations.


<B><P>Earnings Per Share</B>&nbsp;

Basic earnings per share is determined using the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted earnings per share is determined using the weighted average
number of common shares and equivalents (representing the dilutive
effect of stock options) outstanding during the period.

<p>For purposes of computing diluted earnings per share, weighted average
common share equivalents do not include stock options with an exercise
price that exceeded the average fair market value of Applied's common
stock for the period as the effect would be anti-dilutive. Options to
purchase shares of common stock that were excluded from the computation

<B><P>Recent Accounting Pronouncements</B>&nbsp;

In August 2001, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for
Asset Retirement Obligations." SFAS No. 143 addresses financial
accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement
of tangible long-lived assets and the associated retirement costs.
Applied does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 143, which will be
effective for Applied's fiscal 2003, to have a material effect on its
financial condition or results of operations.

<p>In October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets." SFAS No. 144 supersedes
SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and
for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of," and APB Opinion No. 30,
"Reporting the Results of Operations - Reporting the Effects of
Disposal of a Segment of Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and
Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions." SFAS No. 144 retains
the fundamental provisions of SFAS No. 121 for: 1) recognition and
measurement of the impairment of long-lived assets to be held and used;
and 2) measurement of long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale.
Applied does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 144, which will be
effective for Applied's fiscal 2003, to have a material effect on its
financial condition or results of operations.

<p>In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, "Rescission of FASB
Statements No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and
Technical Corrections." SFAS No. 145 eliminates SFAS No. 4, "Reporting
Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt," which required all gains
and losses from extinguishment of debt to be aggregated and, if
material, classified as an extraordinary item. Under SFAS No.145, such
gains and losses should be classified as extraordinary only if they meet
the criteria of APB Opinion No. 30. In addition, SFAS No. 145 amends
SFAS No. 13, "Accounting for Leases," to eliminate an inconsistency
between the required accounting for sale-leaseback transactions and the
required accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic
effects that are similar to sale-leaseback transactions. Applied does
not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 145, which will become effective at
varying dates from May 2002 to Applied's fiscal 2003, to have a material
effect on its financial condition or results of operations.

<p>In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs
Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities." SFAS No. 146 addresses
financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or
disposal activities and supersedes Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No.
94-3, "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits
and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in
a Restructuring)." SFAS No. 146 is effective for exit or disposal
activities initiated after December 31, 2002. Applied does not expect
the adoption of SFAS No. 146 to have a material effect on its financial
condition or results of operations.

<p>Gross realized gains and losses on sales of short-term investments were
not material for fiscal 2000 or 2001. For fiscal 2002, gross realized
gains on sales of short-term investments were $27 million, and gross
realized losses were not material. Applied manages its cash equivalents
and short-term investments as a single portfolio of highly marketable
securities that is intended to be available to meet Applied's current
cash requirements.

<B><P>Derivative Financial Instruments</B>&nbsp;

Applied adopted SFAS No. 133, as
amended, in the first fiscal quarter of 2001. SFAS No. 133 established
new standards of accounting and reporting for derivative instruments and
hedging activities, and requires that all derivatives, including foreign
currency exchange contracts, be recognized on the balance sheet at fair
value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for
hedge treatment, as well as the ineffective portion of any hedges, must
be recognized currently in earnings. All of Applied's derivative
financial instruments are recorded at their fair value in other current
assets or accounts payable and accrued expenses. The transition
adjustment upon adoption of SFAS No. 133 was not material.

<p>Applied conducts business in a number of foreign countries, with certain
transactions denominated in local currencies, such as Japanese yen, euro
and British pounds. The purpose of Applied's foreign currency management
is to manage the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign
currency denominated revenues, costs and eventual cash flows. The terms
of currency instruments used for hedging purposes are generally
consistent with the timing of the transactions being hedged.

<p>Applied uses derivative financial instruments, such as forward exchange
contracts and currency option contracts, to hedge certain forecasted
foreign currency denominated transactions expected to occur within the
next 12 months. In accordance with SFAS No. 133, these hedges related to
anticipated transactions are designated and documented at the inception
of the hedge as cash flow hedges, and are evaluated for effectiveness
quarterly. The effective portion of the gain or loss on these hedges is
reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in
stockholders' equity, and is reclassified into earnings when the hedged
transaction affects earnings. All amounts included in accumulated other
comprehensive income at October 27, 2002 will be reclassified to
earnings within 12 months. Changes in the fair value of currency option
contracts due to changes in time value are excluded from the assessment
of effectiveness, and are recognized in cost of products sold. The
change in option time value was not material for fiscal 2001 or 2002. If
the transaction being hedged fails to occur, or if a portion of any
derivative is ineffective, Applied immediately recognizes the gain or
loss on the associated financial instrument in general and
administrative expenses. The amount recognized due to anticipated
transactions failing to occur was not material for fiscal 2001 or 2002.

<p>Forward exchange contracts are used to hedge certain foreign currency
denominated assets or liabilities. These derivatives are not designated
for SFAS No. 133 hedge accounting treatment. Accordingly, changes in the
fair value of these hedges are recorded immediately in earnings to
offset the changes in the fair value of the assets or liabilities being
hedged.

<p>Derivative-related activity in accumulated other comprehensive income
was as follows:

</pre>


<B><P>Fair Value of Financial Instruments</B> &nbsp;

The carrying amounts of Applied's
financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts
receivable, notes payable, and accounts payable and accrued expenses,
approximate fair value due to the short maturities of these financial
instruments. At October 28, 2001, the carrying amount of long-term debt,
including current portion, was $570 million, and the estimated fair
value was $599 million. At October 27, 2002, the carrying amount was
$583 million and the estimated fair value was $633 million. The
estimated fair value of long-term debt is based primarily on quoted
market prices for the same or similar issues.

<p>Applied adopted SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,"
in the first fiscal quarter of 2002. SFAS No. 142 supersedes APB Opinion
No. 17, "Intangible Assets," and discontinues the amortization of
goodwill. In addition, SFAS No. 142 includes provisions regarding: 1)
the reclassification between goodwill and identifiable intangible assets
in accordance with the new definition of intangible assets set forth in
SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations;" 2) the reassessment of the
useful lives of existing recognized intangibles; and 3) the testing for
impairment of goodwill and other intangibles.

<p>In accordance with SFAS No. 142, beginning October 29, 2001, goodwill is
no longer amortized, but is reviewed periodically for impairment.
Applied completed the first step of the transitional goodwill impairment
test at the beginning of fiscal 2002, and completed the annual goodwill
impairment test at the end of fiscal 2002, which did not indicate
impairment. Under the new definition of intangible assets, Applied
identified $9 million of net intangibles that were reclassified from
previously reported goodwill to other intangible assets. Net goodwill
increased by $91 million during fiscal 2002 due to $100 million of
goodwill acquired, net of adjustments, offset by the $9 million of
intangible assets reclassified out of goodwill in the first fiscal
quarter of 2002. Purchased technology and other intangible assets are
being amortized over their estimated useful lives of three to 10 years
using the straight-line method. No changes were made to the useful lives
of amortizable intangibles in connection with the adoption of SFAS No.
142.

<p>Components of intangible assets were as follows:

<p>Aggregate amortization expense was $65 million for fiscal 2000, $70
million for fiscal 2001 and $52 million for fiscal 2002. In connection
with the adoption of SFAS No. 142, as of the beginning of fiscal 2002,
goodwill is no longer amortized. To facilitate comparison with prior
periods, if goodwill had not been amortized, net income would have
increased by $15 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, for fiscal 2000,
and $14 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, for fiscal 2001. As of
October 27, 2002, future estimated amortization expense is expected to
be: $48 million for fiscal 2003, $47 million for fiscal 2004, $18
million for fiscal 2005, $12 million for fiscal 2006 and $3 million for
fiscal 2007.

<p>During fiscal 2001, Applied established a venture capital fund, Applied
Materials Ventures I, L.P. (Ventures I), to invest in privately-held,
early-stage companies engaged in developing communications components,
systems and sub-systems. Ventures I is a limited partnership, with
Applied as the sole limited partner and an independent party as the
general partner. As provided for in the partnership agreement, the
general partner has control over the investment decisions and operations
of Ventures I. Accordingly, Applied accounts for its investment in
Ventures I using the equity method. Applied has committed to fund $50
million in capital contributions, but has reserved the option to
discontinue capital contributions at $25 million. At October 27, 2002,
Applied's contributions to Ventures I totaled approximately $9 million,
$6 million of which was recorded in Other Assets, net of Applied's pro
rata share of Venture I's results of operations. Applied does not expect
its investment in Ventures I to have a material effect on its financial
condition or results of operations.


<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>NOTE 4  &nbsp;&nbsp;NOTES PAYABLE</B>

<p>Applied has credit facilities for unsecured borrowings in various
currencies up to approximately $666 million, of which $500 million is
comprised of two revolving credit agreements in the U.S. with a group of
banks. Both agreements expire in March 2003. The agreements provide for
borrowings at various rates, including the lead bank's prime reference
rate, and include financial and other covenants with which Applied was
in compliance at October 27, 2002. No amounts were outstanding under
these agreements at the end of fiscal 2001 or 2002. The remaining credit
facilities of approximately $166 million are primarily with Japanese
banks at rates indexed to their prime reference rate. No amounts were
outstanding under these credit facilities at October 28, 2001. At
October 27, 2002, $40 million was outstanding under Japanese credit
facilities at an average annual interest rate of 0.30 percent.

Semiconductor Equipment Ltd. (Oramir). During fiscal 2002, Applied
recorded acquired in-process research and development expense of $6
million in connection with its acquisition of the assets of
Schlumberger's electron-beam wafer inspection business and $2 million in
connection with its acquisition of Global Knowledge Services, Inc.
(GKS). For further details regarding these acquisitions, see Note 13.

<B><P>Restructuring Charges</B>&nbsp;

During fiscal 2001, Applied recorded pre-tax
restructuring charges of $211 million, consisting of $105 million for
headcount reductions, $45 million for consolidation of facilities and
$61 million for other costs, primarily fixed asset write-offs. These
restructuring actions occurred in Applied's second, third and fourth
fiscal quarters, and were taken to align Applied's cost structure with
prevailing market conditions. During the second fiscal quarter of 2001,
Applied completed a voluntary separation plan that resulted in a
headcount reduction of approximately 1,000 employees, or three percent
of its global workforce, for a cost of $47 million. During the third
fiscal quarter of 2001, Applied recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge
of $4 million associated with severance and benefit costs. During the
fourth fiscal quarter of 2001, Applied eliminated approximately 2,000
additional positions, or 10 percent of its global workforce, for a cost
of $54 million. The majority of the affected employees were based in
Santa Clara, California and Austin, Texas, and represented multiple
company activities and functions.

<p>Total cash outlays for fiscal 2001 restructuring activities were $137
million, and occurred during fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2002. The remaining
$74 million of restructuring costs consisted of non-cash charges of $62
million for asset write-offs and other costs and $12 million of
compensation expense for accelerated vesting of certain stock options.

<p>During the first fiscal quarter of 2002, Applied recorded a pre-tax
restructuring charge of $77 million, consisting of $39 million for
headcount reductions, $16 million for consolidation of facilities and
$22 million for other costs, primarily fixed asset write-offs. This
restructuring action was taken to align Applied's cost structure with
prevailing market conditions due to the prolonged industry downturn, and
reduced Applied's global workforce by approximately 1,100 employees, or
six percent. The majority of the affected employees were based in Santa
Clara, California and Austin, Texas, and represented multiple company
activities and functions. The restructuring charge of $77 million
consisted of $49 million of cash outlays, the majority of which occurred
in fiscal 2002, and $28 million of non-cash charges, primarily for fixed
asset write-offs.

<p>At October 27, 2002, the remaining restructuring reserve consisted of
$29 million related to the restructuring implemented in the fourth
fiscal quarter of 2001 and $8 million related to the restructuring
implemented in the first fiscal quarter of 2002.

<p>Restructuring activity for fiscal 2001 and 2002 was as follows:

as non-recurring income. During the fourth fiscal quarter of 1999,
Applied received another payment from ASMI of $10 million and also
recorded the amount as non-recurring income.

<p>During the second fiscal quarter of 2000, Applied recorded an additional
$68 million of pre-tax, non-operating income related to the ASMI
litigation settlement. This amount consisted of: 1) the final cash
payment of $35 million related to the outstanding note receivable; and
2) a net gain of $33 million on the exercise of ASMI warrants and
subsequent sale of the resulting shares.

<B><P>Stock Repurchase Program</B>&nbsp;

Since March 1996, Applied has systematically
repurchased shares of its common stock in the open market to partially
fund its stock-based employee benefit and incentive plans. Upon the
expiration of the previous authorization on March 22, 2001, the Board of
Directors extended the share repurchase program and authorized the
repurchase of up to $2.0 billion of Applied's common stock in the open
market over the succeeding three years. In fiscal 2000, there were
6,390,000 shares repurchased at an average price of $27.72 per share. In

<B><P>Employee Stock Purchase Plan</B> &nbsp;

Applied sponsors two employee stock
purchase plans (ESPP) for the benefit of U.S. and international
employees. The U.S. plan is qualified under Section 423 of the Internal
Revenue Code. Under the ESPP, substantially all employees may purchase
Applied's common stock through payroll deductions at a price equal to 85
percent of the lower of the fair market value at the beginning or end of
each six-month offering period. Stock purchases under the ESPP are
limited to 10 percent of an employee's eligible compensation, up to a
maximum of $12,750, in any plan year. Shares issued under the ESPP were
3,168,000 for fiscal 2000, 4,306,000 for fiscal 2001 and 4,127,000 for
fiscal 2002. At October 27, 2002, there were 31,135,000 shares reserved
for future issuance under the ESPP.



<B><P>Stock-Based Compensation</B> &nbsp;

Applied has adopted the disclosure-only
provisions of SFAS No. 123. Accordingly, no compensation expense has
been recognized for Applied's stock option and purchase plan activity.
The Black-Scholes option pricing model was developed for use in
estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions
and are fully transferable. Applied's employee stock options have
characteristics significantly different from those of traded options;
therefore, the Black-Scholes option pricing model may not provide a
reliable measure of the fair value of Applied's options. If compensation
expense had been determined based on the grant date fair value as
computed under the Black-Scholes option pricing model for awards in
fiscal 2000, 2001 and 2002 in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No.
123, Applied's net income and earnings per share would have been reduced
to the pro forma amounts indicated below:


<pre>

Earnings per share as reported:
    Basic..................................      $1.28       $0.31       $0.16

    Diluted................................      $1.11       $0.17      ($0.03)
------------------------------------------- ----------- ----------- -----------
</pre>

<p>Based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model, the weighted average
estimated fair value of employee stock option grants was $13.05 for
fiscal 2000, $8.98 for fiscal 2001 and $10.87 for fiscal 2002. The
weighted average estimated fair value of purchase rights granted under
the ESPP was $5.61 for fiscal 2000, $6.26 for fiscal 2001 and $6.29 for
fiscal 2002. In calculating pro forma compensation, the fair value of
each stock option grant and stock purchase right is estimated on the
date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the
following weighted average assumptions:

<B><P>Employee Bonus Plans</B>&nbsp;

Applied has various employee bonus plans. A profit
sharing plan provides for the distribution of a percentage of pre-tax
profits to substantially all Applied employees not eligible for other
performance-based incentive plans, up to a maximum percentage of
compensation. Other plans award annual bonuses to Applied's executives
and key contributors based on the achievement of profitability and other
specific performance criteria. Applied also has agreements with key
technical employees that provide for additional compensation related to
the success of new product development and achievement of specified
profitability criteria. Charges to expense under these plans were $286
million for fiscal 2000, $56 million for fiscal 2001 and $99 million for
fiscal 2002.



<B><P>Employee Savings and Retirement Plan</B>&nbsp;

The Employee Savings and
Retirement Plan is qualified under Sections 401(a) and (k) of the
Internal Revenue Code. Applied contributes a percentage of each
participating employee's salary deferral contributions. Company matching
contributions are invested in Applied's common stock and become 20
percent vested at the end of an employee's second year of service, and
vest 20 percent per year of service thereafter until becoming fully
vested at the end of six years of service. Prior to January 1, 2002,
company matching contributions began vesting at the end of an employee's
third year of service and became fully vested at the end of seven years
of service. Applied's matching contributions under this plan were $21
million for fiscal 2000, $31 million for fiscal 2001 and $27 million for
fiscal 2002.


<B><P>Defined Benefit Plans of Foreign Subsidiaries</B>&nbsp;

Several of Applied's
foreign subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans covering
substantially all of their eligible employees. Benefits under these
plans are based on years of service and final average compensation
levels. Applied has funded its plans in accordance with local statutory
requirements, which differ for each of the countries in which the
subsidiaries are located. Expenses under these plans, consisting
principally of service cost, were $10 million for fiscal 2000, $12
million for fiscal 2001 and $16 million for fiscal 2002. At October 27,
2002, the aggregate accumulated benefit obligation was $84 million, the
projected benefit obligation was $111 million, and the fair value of
plan assets was $29 million.



<B><P>Post-Retirement Benefits  </B>&nbsp;

On January 1, 1999, Applied adopted a plan
that provides medical and vision benefits to retirees who are at least
age 55 and whose age plus years of service is at least 65 at date of
retirement. An eligible retiree may elect coverage for a spouse or
domestic partner under the age of 65. Coverage under the plan generally
ends for both the retiree and spouse or domestic partner upon reaching
age 65. This plan has not had, and is not expected to have, a material
effect on Applied's financial condition or results of operations.

<p>Applied's effective income tax rate decreased significantly from fiscal
2001 to fiscal 2002 due primarily to significant Foreign Sales
Corporation and extraterritorial income tax benefits.

<p>Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for
financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax
purposes.

<p>The components of net deferred income tax assets were as follows:

<P>U.S. income taxes have not been provided for approximately $252 million of
cumulative undistributed earnings of several non-U.S. subsidiaries. Applied
intends to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in operations outside of the
U.S.



<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>NOTE 11 &nbsp;&nbsp; INDUSTRY SEGMENT AND FOREIGN OPERATIONS</P></B>

<p>Applied operates in one segment for the manufacture, marketing and
servicing of semiconductor wafer fabrication equipment. In accordance
with SFAS No. 131, "Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and
Related Information," Applied's chief operating decision-maker has been
identified as the Global Executive Committee, which reviews operating
results to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing
performance for the entire company. All material operating units qualify
for aggregation under SFAS No. 131 due to their identical customer base
and similarities in: economic characteristics; nature of products and
services; and procurement, manufacturing and distribution processes.
Since Applied operates in one segment and in one group of similar
products and services, all financial segment and product line
information required by SFAS No. 131 can be found in the consolidated
financial statements.

<p>No individual customer accounted for more than 10 percent of Applied's
net sales for fiscal 2000. Intel Corporation accounted for 12.2 percent
of Applied's net sales for fiscal 2001 and 10.1 percent of Applied's net
sales for fiscal 2002.

<p>For geographical reporting, revenues are attributed to the geographic
location in which the customer is located. Long-lived assets consist
primarily of property, plant and equipment, and are attributed to the
geographic location in which they are located.


<p>Net sales and long-lived assets by geographic region were as follows:

<B><P>NOTE 12 &nbsp;&nbsp; COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES</P></B>

<p>Applied leases some of its facilities and equipment under non-cancelable
operating leases and has options to renew most leases, with rentals to
be negotiated. At October 28, 2001, Applied had two synthetic leases for
properties in California and Oregon. Upon its expiration in May 2002,
Applied terminated the synthetic lease in California and purchased the
property for $65 million. At October 27, 2002, Applied leased office and
general operating facilities in Oregon under a synthetic lease agreement
that provides for regular payments based on LIBOR. In accordance with
this agreement, Applied must maintain compliance with covenants similar
to those contained in its credit facilities. At the end of this lease,
Applied is required to acquire the property at its original cost or
arrange for this property to be acquired by a third party. If the fair
market value of the leased property declines below original cost,
Applied will be contingently liable under first-loss clauses
guaranteeing a residual value for up to approximately $43 million. At
October 27, 2002, Applied believed that the fair market value of the
leased property was below original cost. Accordingly, Applied had
accrued $5 million for such expenses at October 27, 2002. Management
intends to purchase the property in fiscal 2003, and believes that this
contingent liability will not have a material adverse affect on
Applied's financial condition or results of operations in the future.

<p>Total rent expense was $105 million for fiscal 2000, $153 million for
fiscal 2001 and $140 million for fiscal 2002. Future minimum lease
payments at October 27, 2002 were: $133 million for fiscal 2003; $110
million for fiscal 2004; $81 million for fiscal 2005; $38 million for
fiscal 2006; $32 million for fiscal 2007; and $115 million thereafter.

<p>Applied has several agreements that allow it to sell accounts receivable
from selected customers at a discount to various financial institutions.
Receivable sales have the effect of increasing cash and reducing
accounts receivable and days sales outstanding. Discounting fees were
recorded in interest expense and were not material for fiscal 2000, 2001
or 2002. Accounts receivable sales under these agreements were $1.5
billion for fiscal 2000, $1.2 billion for fiscal 2001 and $689 million
for fiscal 2002. At October 27, 2002, $139 million of sold receivables
remained outstanding under these agreements. A portion of these sold
receivables is subject to certain recourse provisions. Applied has not
experienced any losses under these recourse provisions, and receivables
sold under these provisions have terms and credit risk characteristics
similar to Applied's overall receivables portfolio.


<B><P>Legal Matters</P></B>

<p>After Varian Associates, Inc. (Varian) failed to respond to requests by
Applied to discuss certain patent issues, Applied filed a lawsuit
against Varian alleging infringement of several of Applied's patents
concerning physical vapor deposition (PVD) technology. On July 7, 1997,
Applied amended a previous action against Varian to allege infringement
of these patents against Novellus Systems, Inc. (Novellus) and to add
Novellus as a defendant as a result of Novellus' acquisition of Varian's
thin film systems PVD business. Applied has settled its action with
respect to Varian, but the litigation with Novellus is ongoing. On
June 23, 1997, Novellus filed a separate lawsuit against Applied,
alleging infringement by Applied of several PVD technology patents that
were formerly owned by Varian. Novellus seeks damages for past
infringement, a permanent injunction, treble damages for willful
infringement, pre-judgment interest and attorneys' fees. Fact discovery
has closed in these actions. The court has set a trial date of May 27,
2003. Applied believes it has meritorious claims and defenses and
intends to pursue them vigorously.

<p>On January 8, 2001, Axcelis Technologies, Inc. (Axcelis), formerly a
subsidiary of Eaton Corporation, filed a lawsuit against Applied,
alleging that Applied infringes a patent concerning ion implantation
owned by Axcelis. The complaint also alleges various Massachusetts state
and common law tortious interference and unfair competition claims.
Axcelis seeks a preliminary and permanent injunction, damages, costs and
attorneys' fees. On April 12, 2001, Applied answered the complaint by
denying all allegations and counterclaimed for declaratory judgment of
invalidity and non-infringement and violations of various unfair
competition and deceptive practices laws. Applied seeks damages, a
permanent injunction, costs and attorneys' fees. Fact and expert
discovery has closed. No trial date has been set. Applied believes it
has meritorious defenses and counterclaims to the action and intends to
pursue them vigorously.

<p>On June 11, 2001, Semitool, Inc. (Semitool) filed a lawsuit against
Applied, alleging that Applied infringes a patent concerning seed repair
and electroplating owned by Semitool. Semitool sought a preliminary and
permanent injunction, damages, costs and attorneys' fees. On July 13,
2001, Applied filed a declaratory judgment action against Semitool
seeking a declaration that Applied has not infringed the Semitool patent
and that Semitool's patent is invalid and unenforceable. The actions are
now proceeding together in Oregon. Discovery is ongoing. The Court has
issued an order interpreting the patent claims. Applied believes it has
meritorious claims and defenses and intends to pursue them vigorously.

<p>On July 31, 2001, an individual, David Scharf, filed a lawsuit against
Applied alleging that Applied has infringed, has induced others to
infringe and has contributed to others infringement of a patent
concerning color synthesizing scanning electron microscope technology.
Mr. Scharf seeks a preliminary and permanent injunction, damages and
costs. Applied answered the complaint by denying all allegations and
counterclaiming for declaratory judgment of invalidity and non-
infringement. Applied filed a request for re-examination of Mr. Scharf's
patent with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office which was granted on
September 19, 2002. The Court has removed the suit from its active
docket pending the result of the re-examination. Applied believes it has
meritorious claims and defenses and intends to pursue them vigorously.

<p>On March 12, 2002, Linear Technology Corporation (LTC) filed a lawsuit
against Applied in California state court alleging claims for breach of
contract, fraud and deceit, negligent misrepresentation, suppression of
fact, unfair competition, breach of warranty, express contractual
indemnity and implied equitable indemnity. LTC filed the California
action after a substantially identical lawsuit it filed in federal court
in Texas was dismissed by the Texas court. In the California action, LTC
seeks damages, punitive damages, injunctive relief and restitution. LTC
also seeks costs and attorneys' fees incurred in connection with its
suit against Applied and with a separate (now settled) litigation
between LTC and Texas Instruments. Applied has answered the complaint by
denying all allegations. No trial date has been set. Applied believes
that it has meritorious defenses and intends to pursue them vigorously.

<p>On August 27, 2002, ASM America, Inc. and ASM International, N.V.
(collectively "ASMI") filed a lawsuit against Applied seeking a
judicial declaration that ASMI does not infringe six patents belonging
to Applied that relate to remote cleaning of chemical vapor deposition
(CVD) chambers and to deposition of silicon nitride. The suit also seeks
a judicial declaration that two of those six patents are invalid. No
trial date has been set. Applied believes it has meritorious defenses
and counterclaims and intends to pursue them vigorously.

<p>On October 10, 2002, Robert Bosch GmbH (Bosch), a German company, filed
a lawsuit against Applied alleging that Applied infringes two patents
owned by Bosch related to anisotrophic etching. Bosch seeks a
preliminary and permanent injunction, damages, costs and attorneys'
fees. Applied has not been served with, and has therefore not responded
to, the complaint. No trial date has been set. Applied believes it has
meritorious defenses and intends to pursue them vigorously.

<p>From time to time, Applied receives notification from customers claiming
that such customers are entitled to indemnification or other obligations
from Applied related to infringement claims made against the customers
by third parties. In addition, Applied is subject to various other legal
proceedings and claims, either asserted or unasserted, that arise in the
ordinary course of business. Although the outcome of these claims cannot
be predicted with certainty, Applied does not believe that any of these
other existing legal matters will have a material adverse effect on its
financial condition or results of operations.

<P>NOTE 13 &nbsp;&nbsp; BUSINESS COMBINATIONS</B></P>

<p>On March 29, 2000, Applied acquired Etec, a supplier of mask pattern
generating equipment for the semiconductor and electronics industries,
in a stock-for-stock merger accounted for as a pooling-of-interests.
Applied issued approximately 29 million shares of its common stock to
complete this transaction, and recorded $40 million of transaction costs
as a one-time operating expense. Additionally, Applied recorded a
one-time, pre-tax operating expense of $14 million ($6.5 million in cost of
products sold and $7.5 million in general and administrative expenses)
to conform Etec's accounting policies to those of Applied. Prior to the
merger, Etec's fiscal year end (July 31) was different from Applied's
(last Sunday in October). To conform Etec's fiscal 2000 amounts to
Applied's fiscal year, Etec's net loss for the three months ended
October 31, 1999 was reflected as an adjustment to retained earnings for
the first fiscal quarter of 2000. Etec's net sales and net loss for the
three months ended October 31, 1999 were $43 million and $708,000,
respectively.

<p>On June 27, 2001, Applied acquired Oramir, a supplier of advanced laser
cleaning technologies for semiconductor wafers, in a purchase business
combination for $21 million in cash. In connection with this
acquisition, Applied recorded acquired in-process research and
development expense of $10 million and goodwill of $12 million. The
amount of acquired in-process research and development expense was
determined by identifying research projects for which technological
feasibility had not been established and for which no alternative future
uses existed. The value of the projects identified to be in process was
determined by estimating the future cash flows from the projects once
commercially feasible, discounting the net cash flows back to their
present value at a rate commensurate with the level of risk and maturity
of the projects, and then applying a percentage of completion to the
calculated value. Management has assigned a useful life of seven years
to the goodwill.

<p>On November 20, 2001, Applied acquired the assets of Schlumberger's
electron-beam wafer inspection business for $66 million in cash. In
connection with this acquisition, Applied recorded acquired in-process
research and development expense of $6 million and goodwill of $81
million, net of adjustments to the initial purchase price allocation,
partially offset by net liabilities acquired of $21 million. The amount
of acquired in-process research and development expense was determined
by identifying research projects for which technological feasibility had
not been established and for which no alternative future use existed.
The value of the projects identified as in process was determined by
calculating the total development costs incurred, estimating the portion
of development costs related to the aspect of the project that Applied
expects to utilize, and then calculating the current value of these
historical development costs using a Consumer Price Index adjustment.

<p>On December 3, 2001, Applied acquired GKS, a provider of advanced data
mining services to improve semiconductor manufacturing yield and
efficiency, for $16 million in cash. In connection with this
acquisition, Applied recorded acquired in-process research and
development expense of $2 million, goodwill of $6 million, purchased
technology of $4 million and other items of $4 million. The amount of
acquired in-process research and development expense was determined by
identifying research projects for which technological feasibility had
not been established and for which no alternative future use existed.
The value of the projects identified as in process was determined by
estimating the future cash flows from the projects once commercially
feasible, discounting the net cash flows back to their present value at
a rate commensurate with the level of risk and maturity of the projects,
and then applying a percentage of completion to the calculated value.

<p>On April 8, 2002, Applied acquired Electron Vision Corporation, a
designer, manufacturer and seller of e-beam stabilization and curing
tools for the semiconductor, thin film head and micro-fabrication
industries, for $26 million in cash. In connection with this
acquisition, Applied recorded goodwill of $13 million, net of
adjustments to the initial purchase price allocation, and purchased
technology of $16 million, partially offset by other items of $3
million, primarily for deferred tax liabilities.

<p>For all of the purchase business combinations discussed above, the
results of operations prior to the acquisition dates were not material
in relation to those of Applied for any of the periods presented herein.
Goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed periodically for impairment,
in accordance with SFAS No. 142, and purchased technology is amortized
over its useful life of five years. These acquisitions have not had, and
are not expected to have, a material effect on Applied's financial
condition or results of operations.


<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>NOTE 14&nbsp;&nbsp;  UNAUDITED SUBSEQUENT EVENT</b></P>

<p>On November 4, 2002, Applied announced a headcount reduction of
approximately 1,750 positions, or 11 percent of its global workforce,
in response to the continuing downturn in the semiconductor industry.
The majority of the affected employees were based Santa Clara,
California and Austin, Texas, and represented multiple company
activities and functions. As a result of these activities, Applied
will record a restructuring charge for the first fiscal quarter of
2003.

<p>Management is responsible for the preparation and integrity of the
consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K. The financial statements were prepared in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
appropriate in the circumstances and, accordingly, include some amounts
based on management's best judgments and estimates. Financial
information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is consistent with that
in the financial statements.

<p>Management is responsible for maintaining a system of internal business
controls and procedures to provide reasonable assurance, at an
appropriate cost/benefit relationship, that assets are safeguarded and
that transactions are authorized, recorded and reported properly. The
internal control system is augmented by appropriate reviews by
management, written policies and guidelines, careful selection and
training of qualified personnel and a written code of business ethics
applicable to all employees of Applied and its subsidiaries. Management
believes that Applied's internal controls provide reasonable assurance
that assets are safeguarded against material loss from unauthorized use
or disposition and that the financial records are reliable for preparing
financial statements and other data and maintaining accountability for
assets.

<p>The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, composed solely of
Directors who are not employees or officers of Applied, meets on a
regular periodic basis with the independent accountants, internal
auditors and management to discuss internal business controls, auditing
and financial reporting matters. The Committee reviews with the
independent accountants the scope and results of the audit effort. The
Committee also meets with the independent accountants without management
present to ensure that the independent accountants have free access to
the Committee.

<p>The independent accountants, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, are engaged to
audit the consolidated financial statements of Applied and to conduct
such tests and related procedures as they deem necessary in accordance
with generally accepted auditing standards. The opinion of the
independent accountants, based upon their audits of the consolidated
financial statements, is contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

<p>I, James C. Morgan, certify that:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>1.      I have reviewed this annual report on Form 10-K of Applied

<p>2.      Based on my knowledge, this annual report does not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the
circumstances under which such statements were made, not
misleading with respect to the period covered by this annual
report;

<p>3.      Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other
financial information included in this annual report, fairly
present in all material respects the financial condition, results
of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for,
the periods presented in this annual report;

<p>4.      The registrant's other certifying officer and I are responsible
for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-14 and 15d-14)
for the registrant and we have:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>a)      designed such disclosure controls and procedures to ensure
that material information relating to the registrant,
including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us
by others within those entities, particularly during the
period in which this annual report is being prepared;
<p>b)      evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure
controls and procedures as of a date within 90 days prior to
the filing date of this annual report (the "Evaluation
Date"); and
<p>c)      presented in this annual report our conclusions about the
effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures based
on our evaluation as of the Evaluation Date;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>5.      The registrant's other certifying officer and I have disclosed,
based on our most recent evaluation, to the registrant's auditors
and the audit committee of registrants board of directors (or
persons performing the equivalent functions):
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>a)      all significant deficiencies in the design or operation of
internal controls which could adversely affect the
registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial data and have identified for the registrant's
auditors any material weaknesses in internal controls; and
<p>b)      any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management
or other employees who have a significant role in the
registrant's internal controls; and
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>6.      The registrant's other certifying officer and I have indicated in
this annual report whether or not there were significant changes
in internal controls or in other factors that could significantly
affect internal controls subsequent to the date of our most
recent evaluation, including any corrective actions with regard
to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses.
