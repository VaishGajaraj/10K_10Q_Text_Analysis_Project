<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">PART I</P>

<P>Item 1:  Business</P>

</B><P>Organized in 1967, Applied develops, manufactures, markets and
services semiconductor wafer fabrication equipment and related spare
parts for the worldwide semiconductor industry. Customers for these
products include semiconductor wafer manufacturers and semiconductor
integrated circuit (or chip) manufacturers, who either use the chips
they manufacture in their own products or sell them to other companies.
These chips are key components in most advanced electronic products for
the Internet, communications, computers and digital devices. </P>

<P>Most chips are built on a base of silicon, called a wafer, and
include multiple layers of wiring that connect a variety of circuit
components, such as transistors and other structures. As the density of
the circuit components is increased to enable smaller chips and greater
computing power, the complexity of building the chip also increases,
necessitating more advanced technology to form smaller structures and
additional layers of interconnect wiring. </P>

<P>To build a chip, the transistors, capacitors and other circuit
components are first created on the surface of the wafer by performing
a series of processes to deposit and remove selected film layers.
Similar processes are then used to build the layers of wiring
structures on the wafer. A typical, simplified process sequence for
building the wiring portion of new copper-based chips involves
initially depositing a dielectric film layer onto the base layer of
circuit components using a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) system. An
etch system is then used to create openings and patterns in the
dielectric layer. To form the metal wiring, these openings and patterns
are subsequently filled with copper material using physical vapor
deposition (PVD) and electroplating technologies. Additional deposition
and etch steps are then performed to build up the layers of wiring
needed to complete the interconnection of the circuit elements to form
the chip. Advanced chip designs require well over 300 individual
process steps to complete the manufacturing of the wafer, and many of
these processes are performed multiple times. Applied currently
manufactures equipment that performs most of the primary steps in the
chip fabrication process, including: CVD, PVD, electroplating, etch,
ion implantation, rapid thermal processing (RTP), chemical mechanical
polishing (CMP), metrology and wafer/reticle inspection.&#9;</P>

<P>The architecture of most semiconductor manufacturing equipment is
either batch type, which processes many wafers at once, or single-wafer
type, which processes each wafer individually. Many of Applied's
products are single-wafer systems designed with two or more process
chambers attached to a base platform. The platform feeds a wafer to
each chamber, allowing the simultaneous processing of several wafers to
enable high manufacturing productivity and precise control of the
process. Applied now has five major single-wafer, multi-chamber
platforms: the Precision 5000&reg;, the Centura&reg;, the Endura&reg;,
the Endura SL&#153; and the Producer&reg;. These platforms currently
support CVD, PVD, etch and RTP technologies. </P>

<P>Applied's subsidiary, AKT, Inc. (AKT), manufactures CVD systems used
to make flat panel displays (FPDs) that are used in notebook computers,
desktop monitors, televisions and other applications. Applied's
subsidiary, Consilium, Inc. (Consilium), provides manufacturing
facility (fab) management software to the semiconductor and FPD
industries. During fiscal 2000, Applied acquired Etec, a leading
manufacturer of systems used to generate circuit patterns on reticles
used in the photolithography process. </P>

<B><P>Products </P>

<I><P>Deposition<br>
</B></I>Deposition is a fundamental step in fabricating a chip.
During deposition, a layer of either dielectric (material used as
insulation between conductors) or electrically conductive (material
used to carry current) film is deposited or grown on a wafer. Applied
currently provides equipment to perform the three main types of
deposition: CVD, PVD and electroplating. Applied also offers certain
types of dielectric deposition processes using its RTP systems. </P>

<U><P>Chemical Vapor Deposition<br>
</U>CVD is used by chipmakers to deposit dielectric films
(insulators) and metal films (conductors) on a wafer. During the CVD
process, gases that contain atoms of the material to be deposited react
on the wafer surface, forming a thin film of solid material. Films
deposited by CVD may be silicon oxide, single-crystal epitaxial
silicon, silicon nitride, dielectric anti-reflective coatings, low
<i>k</i> (highly
efficient insulating materials), high
<i>k</i> (electrical charge storing materials),
aluminum, titanium, titanium nitride, tantalum pentoxide, polysilicon,
tungsten, refractory metals or silicides. Applied offers the following
CVD products and technologies: </P>

<I><P>Producer </I>- The Producer<B> </B>CVD platform features
Twin-Chamber&#153; modules that have two single-wafer process chambers per
unit. Up to three Twin-Chamber modules can be mounted on each Producer
platform, giving it a maximum processing capacity of six wafers at a
time for high-throughput manufacturing. Many of Applied's dielectric
CVD film processes can be performed on this platform. In July 2000,
Applied introduced the Producer S system, which reduces the system's
original footprint by up to 29 percent, saving customers valuable fab
floor space. The Producer platform also features integrated metrology
technology that automatically measures the thickness and uniformity of
the deposited film. </P>

</FONT><I><FONT SIZE=2><P>Ultima HDP-CVD&#153; Centura </I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>-
High-density plasma CVD (HDP-CVD) is used to fill very small, deep spaces
with dielectric film. One of the processes offered on the system is
fluorinated silicate glass (FSG), a material that has better insulating
capability than conventional oxide materials. These types of films are
referred to as low dielectric constant (low
<i>k</i>) materials. These low
<i>k </i>films enables faster chip
performance. A number of major customers have been using FSG deposition
for manufacturing, making it the first low
<i>k </i>dielectric film to be used for
production chipmaking. </P>

<I><P>Other Low k
Dielectric Films</I> - Throughout fiscal 2000, Applied accelerated its
programs for developing dielectric films with lower
<I>k</I> values to complement the
trend of using copper material for even faster chip speeds. Applied has
introduced several low <I>k</I>
dielectric materials using its established CVD technologies.
Black Diamond&#153;, a silicon-based low
<I>k</I> dielectric film launched in fiscal 1999,
is designed for copper-based interconnect structures. A second low
<I>k</I> dielectric,
called BLO<I>k</I>&#153; (Barrier Low
<I>k</I>), provides a low
<I>k</I> solution for critical
barrier layers in semiconductor devices, enabling the complete,
multilayer dielectric chip structure to benefit from low
<I>k</I> technology. </P>

<I><P>High k
Dielectric Films</I> - In fiscal 2000, Applied introduced the
Giga-Cap&#153; TanOx Centura for the deposition of high
<I>k</I> tantalum pentoxide films.
The system, which integrates CVD and RTP technologies, is used to
fabricate capacitor structures in advanced memory chips.</P>

<I><P>Epitaxial Deposition</I> - Epitaxial silicon (epitaxy or epi),
used in some semiconductor devices, is a layer of pure silicon grown in
a uniform crystalline structure on the wafer to form a high quality
base for the device circuitry. Applied has manufactured epitaxial
deposition systems for over 30 years. In November 1999, Applied
introduced its latest model, the Epi xP Centura, that integrates
pre- and post-epi processes on the system to reduce total epi production
costs.</FONT><FONT SIZE=2 COLOR="#0000ff"> </FONT><FONT SIZE=2>In
addition to silicon applications, Applied offers an Epi Centura<B>
</B>system for silicon-germanium (SiGe) epi process technology, which
can reduce power usage and increase speed in certain kinds of advanced
chips. </P>

<I><P>Polysilicon Deposition</I> - Polysilicon is a type of silicon
used to form portions of the transistor structure within the
semiconductor device. Applied's latest system, introduced in fiscal
2000, is the PolyGen&#153; Centura, a single-wafer, multi-chamber
product that deposits thin polysilicon films at high temperatures with
improved productivity and process control. A variant of the system, the
Polycide Centura, combines chambers for polysilicon and tungsten
silicide deposition on the Centura platform in an integrated process to
create the polycide structures found in advanced semiconductors. To
address the challenging requirements of 0.15 micron and below devices,
Applied has combined its RTP and polysilicon technologies on one system
called the Gate Stack Centura. This single-system integration of
polysilicon with advanced RTP oxidation and nitridation technology
provides superior film quality and material properties, as well as
improved process control. Integrating these technologies on one
high-productivity system lets customers use fewer process steps and reduce
cycle time for their gate fabrication sequence. The process control
provided by the single-wafer approach is superior to batch processing,
and is expected to become increasingly important as transistor
structures shrink to smaller dimensions and as chipmakers move to
larger wafer diameters. </P>

<I><P>Silicon Nitride Deposition</I> - Applied offers a single-wafer,
high-temperature system to deposit silicon nitride films, called the
SiNgen&#153; Centura. This system operates at a lower deposition
temperature than conventional methods to minimize the amount of time
the wafer is exposed to high temperatures and to reduce particles while
improving many areas of operating cost and productivity in critical
transistor nitride layers for sub-0.18 micron devices.</P>

<I><P>Tungsten Deposition</I> - Tungsten is the basic material used to
connect the multiple layers of metal wiring on a chip. For many years,
Applied has been a leading provider of systems to deposit tungsten and
in fiscal 2000, Applied launched a new system, the Sprint&#153;
Tungsten Centura, to fill the tight geometries required in sub-0.18
micron chip designs.</P>

<U><P>Physical Vapor Deposition<br>
</U>PVD, also called sputtering, is a physical process in which
atoms of a gas such as argon are accelerated at a metal target. The
metal atoms chip off, or sputter away, and are then deposited on the wafer.
The Endura PVD platform offers a broad range of advanced deposition
processes, including aluminum, titanium/titanium nitride (Ti/TiN),
tantalum/tantalum nitride and copper (Cu). The Endura's highly
flexible, multi-chamber architecture allows the integration of multiple
PVD processes or combinations of metal CVD and PVD technologies on the
same system. The Endura's PVD Ti technology can be coupled with either
CVD TiN or PVD TiN processes to form the critical lining layers of
interconnect structures. These structures are subsequently bulk-filled
with tungsten, aluminum or other film materials. A new, high-throughput
version of the Endura platform, called Endura SL, was introduced in
fiscal 2000 for applications benefiting from its efficient wafer
handling and greater operational flexibility. </P>

<I><P>Systems for Copper-Based Devices</I> - A
majority of process steps used in chipmaking are performed to build the
interconnect, a complex matrix of microscopic wires that carry
electrical signals to connect the transistor and capacitor components
of the chip. Chipmakers have traditionally used aluminum as the main
conducting material for the interconnect circuitry. However, the trend
of fabricating smaller and denser chips requires a new material that
can carry more current in a smaller area. After years of development,
copper is beginning to be used as a new circuit material in
semiconductors. Copper has lower resistance than aluminum and carries
more current in a smaller area, therefore allowing chipmakers to
continue making faster and more powerful chips. </P>

<P>Applied is a leading supplier of systems for copper-based
chipmaking, with systems that perform deposition of the barrier and
seed layers (Endura Electra Cu&#153; Barrier &amp; Seed), copper
bulk-fill by electroplating (Electra Cu ECP), and copper planarization by
CMP (Mirra Mesa&#153;). In addition, Applied makes a full line of
systems for depositing and etching the dielectric layers used in the
copper interconnect, and for inspection and metrology.</P>

<P>The Endura Electra Cu Barrier &amp; Seed<B> </B>system, launched in
December 1997, continues to be extensively used by chipmakers for
fabricating copper-based chips. Using PVD technology, the system
sequentially deposits the critical layers that prevent copper material
from entering other areas of the device and prime the structure for
subsequent deposition of bulk copper material by electroplating. </P>

<U><P>Electroplating<br>
</U>Electroplating is a process by which metal atoms are removed
from a chemical fluid (an electrolyte) and deposited on the surface of
an object immersed in the electrolyte. Its main application is to
deposit copper in circuit wiring structures following the deposition of
barrier and seed layers.</P>

<P>Launched in April 1999, the Electra Cu ECP (ElectroChemical Plating)
was Applied's first system to use electroplating technology. The
Electra Cu ECP system offers the first completely automated ECP
chemical management technology to the industry and provides process
control and productivity not available in manually controlled systems.
The Electra Cu ECP's high-throughput system architecture features two
twin-cell modules that allow the simultaneous processing of four
wafers. In fiscal 2000, Applied introduced the industry's first
integrated ECP system, combining copper deposition with critical heat
treatment and wafer edge clean processes on a single platform. </P>

<B><I><P>Etch<br>
</B></I>Etching is used many times throughout the semiconductor
manufacturing process to selectively remove material from the surface
of a wafer. Before etching begins, the wafer is coated with a
light-sensitive film called photoresist<B> </B>and exposed to a circuit
pattern during a photolithography process step, which projects the
circuit pattern onto the wafer. Etching removes material only from
areas dictated by the photoresist pattern. </P>

<P>Applied offers systems for etching three basic types of materials:
metal, silicon and dielectric films. For etching dielectric films,
Applied's Dielectric Etch IPS&#153; Centura is used to fabricate
critical chip structures, especially in the formation of copper
interconnects. Applied extended an established etch technology, called
magnetically enhanced reactive ion etch, into the 0.18 to 0.13 micron
generation where it operates with high productivity and low cost of
ownership in high-volume production environments. The Dielectric Etch
eMax&#153; Centura was introduced in June 2000 as an extension of
Applied's MxP+ and Super <I>e</I>&#153; dielectric process chamber
designs. For etching advanced conducting films, Applied's Metal Etch
DPS Plus&#153; and Silicon Etch DPS Plus&#153; Centura systems offer
customers the technology, productivity and reliability required for
sub-0.18 micron processing and are production tools of record at a
number of fabs.</P>

<B><I><P>Ion Implantation<br>
</B></I>During ion implantation, silicon wafers are bombarded by a
high-velocity beam of ions, called dopants, that penetrate (or implant)
the film surface to a desired depth. Implantation, which occurs in the
transistor structure, changes the properties of the material in which
the dopants are implanted to achieve a particular electrical
performance. </P>

<P>Fiscal 2000 saw the continuation of an industry trend toward a type
of implant technology called low-energy implantation, which enables the
fabrication of smaller structures and thus contributes to faster
transistor performance. Applied's industry-leading low-energy
implantation technology, featuring the Quantum&#153; LEAP (low-energy
advanced processing) system, has found major acceptance<B> </B>by many
chipmakers to create thinner, more advanced transistor structures. </P>

<B><I><P>Rapid Thermal Processing<br>
</B></I>RTP subjects a wafer to a very brief burst of intense heat
that can take the wafer from room temperature to more than 1,000
degrees Celsius in less than 10 seconds. RTP is used mainly for
modifying the properties of deposited films, which activates dopant
atoms in the device after implantation by using processes such as
annealing. Applied's RTP systems,
which include the RTP Xe<I>plus&#153;</I> and Radiance&#153; Centura
products, offer advances in temperature and ramp rate control as well
as other features aimed at providing leading-edge capability for
sub-0.15 micron generations. Recently, these single-wafer systems have also
gained increasing acceptance for growing high quality oxide and
oxynitride films, deposition steps that have traditionally been
assigned to furnaces. This trend to single-wafer processing versus
batch furnaces is expected to continue as the industry transitions to
larger 300mm wafers. </P>

<B><I><P>Chemical Mechanical Polishing<br>
</B></I>CMP removes material from uneven topography on a wafer
surface until a flat (planarized) surface is created. This allows
subsequent photolithography patterning steps to take place with greater
accuracy and enables film layers to build up with minimal height
variations. CMP is performed primarily in the interconnect structure of
the chip, where it is used multiple times, and is especially crucial to
fabricating copper-based chips to define the circuit wires that create
the interconnect. Applied entered the CMP market in 1995 with its
Mirra&reg; system and has since added several important features to
this product, including integrated film measurement and inspection
capabilities. In 1999, the Mirra Mesa was introduced to provide
customers with integrated cleaning technology. </P>

<B><I><P>Metrology and Wafer/Reticle Inspection<br>
</B></I>Applied produces several types of products that are used to
inspect the wafer during various stages of the fabrication process.
Applied also supplies a system to photomask manufacturers that is used
to detect defects on quartz plates, called reticles or masks. These
reticles are used by photolithography systems to transfer microscopic
circuit designs onto wafers. The reticle must be defect-free with
perfect image fidelity because any imperfection will be replicated on
the wafer.</P>

<U><P>Critical Dimension and Defect Review Scanning Electron
Microscopes (CD-SEMs and DR-SEMs)<BR>
</U>Scanning electron microscopes (SEMs) use an electron beam to form
images of microscopic features of a semiconductor wafer at extremely
high magnification. Applied provides chipmakers with operator-free
automation, along with the high accuracy and sensitivity needed for
measuring advanced-generation feature sizes. Introduced in February
1999, the VeraSEM&#153; extends CD-SEM technology beyond critical
dimension measurement to also enable the monitoring of multiple process
parameters. In fiscal 2000, Applied introduced the VeraSEM 3D, which
enables users to perform three-dimensional imaging of chip features
down to 0.1 micron and achieves greater efficiency. </P>

<P>DR-SEMs review defects on the wafer (i.e., particles, scratches or
residues) that are first located by other detection systems and then
classify the defects to identify their source. The high-throughput,
fully automatic technology of Applied's SEMVision&#153; DR-SEM marked
a major advance over conventional, manually operated systems. With the
SEMVision, customers are using DR-SEM technology as an integral part of
their production lines, rather than using it off-line to occasionally
sample wafers. The enhanced SEMVision cX model introduced in fiscal
1999 added higher throughput, automatic material classification and
color imaging to its list of features. </P>

<U><P>Patterned Wafer Inspection<br>
</U>Using laser-based technology, defects can be detected on
patterned wafers (wafers with circuit images printed on them) as they
move between processing steps. Defects may include particles, open
circuit lines, shorts between lines or other problems. In July 2000,
Applied introduced Compass&#153;, the industry's first system to
detect critical defects in devices with design rules as small as 0.1
micron and below at the high speeds required for chipmakers' volume
production lines. A second system, called Excite&#153;, was also
introduced for monitoring the condition of process tools. The system
identifies particle excursions right after processing, reducing the
need for costly monitoring of wafers and increasing overall fab
efficiency.</P>

<U><P>Reticle Inspection<br>
</U>Introduced in early fiscal 1999, the ARIS-i&#153; system is an
automated, ultraviolet wavelength-based advanced inspection system for
reticles used in 0.18 micron<B> </B>and below generation devices. The
system features enhanced image acquisition technology, data handling
capabilities and sensitivity for the most advanced mask designs.</P>

<B><I><P>Flat Panel Displays <br>
</B></I>The most advanced FPDs are manufactured using technologies
similar to those for making semiconductors. One difference is the
vastly larger area of the substrate (panel). Compared to today's
largest wafers (300mm diameter), the panels can be up to seven times
larger. Applied began development of FPD process technology in 1990,
beginning with a CVD process. In fiscal 2000, AKT introduced several
new systems and technology capabilities. The AKT 5500 CVD system and
AKT 10K CVD systems expanded its product line to include systems for
larger substrate sizes, including the one square meter Generation 5
size represented by the 10K system. In addition, a new CVD process was
introduced to enable the manufacture of polysilicon-based screens used
in next-generation communications applications. </P>

<B><I><P>Factory Management Software<br>
</B></I>In December 1998, Applied acquired Consilium, a provider of
manufacturing execution systems software and services to the global
semiconductor industry. Consilium's software products,
WorkStream&#153; and FAB300&#153;, are designed for semiconductor and
FPD manufacturers to control and optimize their facility operations. In
July 2000, Consilium announced FAB300 version 2.0, a wafer fab
management software package specifically designed to meet the
requirements of 300mm wafer production. The FAB300 2.0 product
integrates a full complement of operating modules, enabling chipmakers
to easily manage 300mm wafer movement and equipment operation in a
single, fully automated, fab-wide solution. </P>

<B><I><P>Mask Pattern Generation Systems<br>
</B></I>Mask pattern generation systems use precision lasers or
electron beams to write (or pattern) each layer of a semiconductor
chip's design onto a piece of chrome-coated quartz glass. Etec,
acquired by Applied in fiscal 2000, is the leading supplier of these
systems to the industry. The most advanced MEBES&reg; 5500 is an
electron-beam system for leading-edge maskmaking. The ALTA&reg; 3700, a
laser beam system, provides mainstream, high-throughput production
capability. </P>

<B><P>Transition to 300mm Wafers<BR>
<BR>
</B>Throughout its history, the semiconductor industry has migrated to
increasingly larger wafer sizes, from one-inch wafers to the 200mm
(eight inches) standard predominant today. To gain the economic
advantages of a larger surface area, the industry has begun using 300mm
(12 inches) wafers as the next wafer size. The surface area of a 300mm
wafer is more than two times that of a 200mm wafer. Entirely new
hardware is needed to process 300mm wafers, although some recently
introduced systems, called bridge tools, have dual 200mm-300mm
capabilities. </P>

<P>Applied has developed and launched a comprehensive line of 22
systems for 300mm manufacturing in its core process technologies
supporting more than 85 applications. These new systems encompass
almost 75 percent of the processes needed to produce the most advanced
0.13 micron and beyond chip designs, including deposition, etch, RTP,
CMP, ion implantation and wafer inspection technologies. Applied's
300mm systems also feature new, automated factory efficiency
technologies that perform defect identification and corrective action
recommendation, tool health monitoring and maintenance scheduling to
optimize equipment uptime and availability. </P>

<B><P>Customer Service and Support</P>

</B><P>Applied's customer service organization plays a unique and
critical role in Applied's ability to continuously satisfy its
customers' production requirements. Over 3,500 highly trained customer
engineers and process support engineers are deployed in more than a
dozen countries. These engineers are usually located at or near the
customers' fab sites and service more than 13,000 Applied systems. </P>

<P>In fiscal 1999, Applied introduced a new line of service products,
called Total Service Solutions&#153; (TSS), which offers a novel
approach to maintaining and servicing Applied's equipment in the fab.
In one part of the TSS program, called Total Parts Management&#153;
(TPM), Applied is responsible for the spare parts used in its equipment
at a customer's fab site. Under TPM, chipmakers no longer need to own
or manage inventory for their Applied systems. A second product, called
Total Support Package&#153; (TSP), is a comprehensive equipment
service solution that includes parts inventory management and
maintenance, with operating cost reduction and system performance
improvement guarantees for their Applied equipment. </P>

<B><P>Backlog</P>

</B><P>Applied's backlog increased from $1.7 billion at October 31,
1999 to $4.4 billion at October 29, 2000. Applied schedules production
of its systems based on order backlog and customer commitments. Backlog
includes only orders for which written authorizations have been
accepted and shipment dates within 12 months have been assigned.
However, customers may delay delivery of products or cancel orders
suddenly and without sufficient notice, subject to cancellation
penalties. Due to possible customer changes in delivery schedules and
cancellations of orders, Applied's backlog at any particular date is
not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period.
Delays in delivery schedules and/or a reduction of backlog during any
particular period could have a material adverse effect on Applied's
business and results of operations.</P>

<B><P>Manufacturing, Raw Materials and Supplies</P>

</B><P>Applied's manufacturing activities consist primarily of
assembling various commercial and proprietary components into finished
systems, with preproduction principally located in Santa Clara,
California and volume manufacturing in Austin, Texas. Applied also has
manufacturing operations in Hayward, California, Hillsboro, Oregon,
Horsham, England and Rehovot, Israel. Production requires some raw
materials and a wide variety of mechanical and electrical components to
be manufactured to Applied's specifications. Applied uses numerous
domestic and international vendors to supply parts, components and
subassemblies (collectively, &quot;parts&quot;) for the manufacture and
support of its products. Applied has embarked on a strategy of
increasing the value-add of subassembly suppliers in the manufacture of
many of its new products. Although Applied makes reasonable efforts to
ensure that parts are available from multiple suppliers, this is not
always possible; accordingly, some key parts may be obtained only from
a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers. Applied has sought,
and will continue to seek, to minimize the risk of production and
service interruptions and/or shortages of key parts by: 1) selecting
and qualifying alternative suppliers for key parts; 2) monitoring the
financial stability of key suppliers; and 3) maintaining appropriate
inventories of key parts. If Applied does not receive a sufficient
quantity of parts in a timely and cost-effective manner to meet its
production requirements, Applied's results of operations may be
materially and adversely affected.</P>
<B>

<P>Research, Development and Engineering </P>

</B><P>Applied's long-term growth strategy requires continued
development of new semiconductor and FPD manufacturing products.
Applied's significant investment in research, development and
engineering (RD&amp;E) has generally enabled it to deliver new products
and technologies before the emergence of strong demand, thus allowing
customers to incorporate these products into their manufacturing plans
at an early stage in the technology selection cycle. Applied works
closely with its global customers to design systems that meet their
planned technical and production requirements. Engineering
organizations are located in the United States, the United Kingdom,
Israel and Japan, with process support and customer demonstration
laboratories in the United States, the United Kingdom, Israel, Japan,
Korea and Taiwan.</P>

<P>Applied invested $697 million (16.1 percent of net sales) for fiscal
1998, $740 million (14.5 percent of net sales) for fiscal 1999 and $1.1
billion (11.6 percent of net sales) for fiscal 2000 in RD&amp;E for
product development and engineering programs to improve or sustain
existing product lines. Applied has spent an average of 13.2 percent of
net sales on RD&amp;E over the last five years. In addition to RD&amp;E
for specific product technologies, Applied maintains ongoing programs
in software, automation control systems, materials research,
microcontamination and environmental control that have applications to
its products. Key activities during fiscal 2000 included development of
wafer fabrication equipment for smaller feature sizes, copper-based
devices and 300mm wafers. Applied also continued the development of its
Process Module&#153; concept in which two or more process systems are
optimized to work together as a coordinated unit. Applied expects this
concept to save customers critical process development and facility
start-up time, enabling them to bring new chip technologies to market
more quickly.</P>

<B><P>Marketing and Sales</P>

</B><P>Because of the highly technical nature of its products, Applied
markets and sells its products worldwide through a direct sales force.
For fiscal 2000, net sales as a percent of Applied's total net sales to
customers in each region were: North America (primarily the United
States) 27 percent, Taiwan 24 percent, Japan 16 percent, Europe 15
percent, Korea 9 percent and Asia-Pacific 9 percent. Applied's business
is usually not seasonal in nature, but it is cyclical based on the
capital equipment investment patterns of major semiconductor
manufacturers. These expenditure patterns are based on many factors,
including anticipated market demand for integrated circuits, the
development of new technologies and global and regional economic
conditions.</P>

</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P>Information on net sales to unaffiliated
customers and long-lived assets attributable to Applied's geographic
regions is included in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements. For fiscal 1998 and 2000, no individual customer accounted
for more than 10 percent of Applied's net sales. For fiscal 1999, Intel
Corporation accounted for more than 10 percent of Applied's net
sales.</P>

<B><P>Competition</P>

</B><P>The global semiconductor equipment industry is highly
competitive and is characterized by increasingly rapid technological
advancements and demanding worldwide service requirements. Applied's
ability to compete depends on its ability to commercialize its
technology and continually improve its products, processes and
services, as well as its ability to develop new products that meet
constantly evolving customer requirements. Significant competitive
factors for succeeding in the semiconductor manufacturing equipment
market include the equipment's technical capability, productivity and
cost-effectiveness, overall reliability, ease of use and maintenance,
contamination and defect control, and the level of technical service
and support provided by the vendor. The importance of each of these
factors varies depending on the specific customer's needs and criteria,
including considerations such as the customer's process application,
product requirements, timing of the purchase and particular
circumstances of the purchasing decision. The pace of technological
change is rapid, with customers continually moving to smaller critical
dimensions and larger wafer sizes and adopting new materials for use in
semiconductor manufacturing. Sometimes, existing technology can be
adapted to the new requirements; however, the new requirements
sometimes create the need for an entirely new technical approach. The
rapid pace of technological change continually creates new
opportunities for existing competitors and start-ups, and can quickly
diminish the value of existing technologies.</P>

<P>Substantial competition exists for each of Applied's products.
Competitors range from small companies that compete with a single
innovative product, to companies with a large and diverse line of
semiconductor processing products, and to large multinationals. Many of
Applied's competitors compete with Applied for sales of more than one
product. Competitors in a given technology tend to have different
degrees of market presence in the various regional markets. Management
believes that Applied's competitive position is based on the ability of
its products and services to continue to address customer requirements.
Success for Applied will require a continued high level of investment
in RD&amp;E and in sales and marketing. Management believes that
Applied is a strong competitor with respect to its products and
services. However, new products, rapid changes in technology and other
competitive actions from both new and existing competitors could
materially and adversely affect Applied's market position.</P>

<B><P>Business Combinations</P>
</B>
<P>On March 29, 2000, Applied acquired Etec, a supplier of mask pattern
generating equipment for the semiconductor and electronics industries,
in a stock-for-stock merger accounted for as a pooling-of-interests.
Applied issued approximately 29 million shares of its common stock to
complete this transaction. </P>

<P>For further details of Applied's business combinations, see Note
2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.</P>

<B><P>Patents and Licenses</P>

</B><P>Management believes that Applied's competitive position is
significantly dependent upon skills in engineering, production and
marketing, rather than just on its patent position. However, protection
of Applied's technology assets by obtaining and enforcing patents is
important. Therefore, Applied has a program to file patent applications
in the United States and other countries for inventions that Applied
considers significant. Applied has a number of patents in the United
States and other countries and additional applications are pending for
new developments in its equipment and processes. In addition to
patents, Applied also possesses other proprietary intellectual
property, including trademarks, know-how, trade secrets and
copyrights.</P>

<P>Applied enters into patent and technology licensing agreements with
other companies when management determines that it is in Applied's best
interest to do so. Applied pays royalties under existing patent license
agreements for the use, in several of its products, of certain patented
technologies that are licensed to Applied for the life of the patents.
Applied also receives royalties from licenses granted to third parties.
Royalties received from third parties have not been, and are not
expected to be, material.</P>

<P>In the normal course of business, Applied from time to time receives
and makes inquiries regarding possible patent infringement. In dealing
with such inquiries, it may become necessary or useful for Applied to
obtain or grant licenses or other rights. However, there can be no
assurance that such licenses or rights will be available to Applied on
commercially reasonable terms. Although there can be no assurance about
the outcome of existing patent infringement inquiries, Applied believes
it is unlikely that their resolution will have a material adverse
effect on its financial condition or results of operations.</P>

<B><P>Environmental Matters</P>

</B><P>Two of Applied's locations have been designated as Superfund
sites since 1987. The United States Environmental Protection Agency has
designated Applied as a &quot;Responsible Party&quot; with respect to
one site, and the California Regional Water Quality Control Board has
designated Applied as a &quot;Discharger&quot; with respect to the
other site. Applied was named a Discharger because it currently owns
the site in question, and prior owners and operators are being required
to perform cleanup and monitoring activities. Applied has also been
cited by local authorities for instances of noncompliance with local
and/or state environmental laws. Those allegations have been settled,
with the exception of one pending matter. However, neither compliance
with federal, state and local provisions regulating discharge of
materials into the environment, nor remedial agreements or other
actions relating to the environment, has had, or is expected to have, a
material effect on Applied's capital expenditures, financial condition,
results of operations or competitive position.</P>


<B><P>Employees</P>

</B><P>At October 29, 2000, Applied employed 19,220 regular employees.
In the high-technology industry, competition for highly-skilled
employees is intense. Applied believes that its future success is
highly dependent upon on its continued ability to attract and retain
qualified employees. There can be no assurance that Applied will be
able to attract, hire, assimilate and retain a sufficient number of
qualified people. None of Applied's employees are represented by a
trade union, and management considers its relations with employees to
be good.</P>

<B><P>Item 3:  Legal Proceedings</P>

<P>KLA<br>
</B>As a result of Applied's acquisition of Orbot Instruments, Ltd.
(Orbot) in 1997, Applied was involved in a lawsuit captioned KLA
Instruments Corporation (KLA) v. Orbot Instruments, Ltd. (case no. C-
93-20886-JW) in the United States District Court for the Northern
District of California. KLA alleged that Orbot infringed a patent
regarding equipment for the inspection of masks and reticles, and
sought an injunction, damages and other relief. In February 2000, the
parties reached an agreement pursuant to which the case was dismissed
without prejudice.</P>

<B>
<P>Varian <br>
</B>On June 13, 1997, Applied filed a lawsuit against Varian
Associates, Inc. (Varian) captioned Applied Materials, Inc. v. Varian
Associates, Inc. (case no. C-97-20523-RMW) in the United States
District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging
infringement of several of Applied's patents concerning PVD technology.
Varian answered the complaint by denying all allegations,
counterclaiming for declaratory judgment of invalidity and
unenforceability and alleging conduct by Applied in violation of
antitrust laws. On July 8, 1997, Varian filed a separate lawsuit
against Applied captioned Varian Associates, Inc. v. Applied Materials,
Inc. (case no. C-97-20597-PVT) in the United States District Court for
the Northern District of California, alleging a broad range of conduct
in violation of federal antitrust laws and state unfair competition and
business practice laws. In September 2000, Applied and Varian settled
their disputes, and on October 3, 2000, Applied's claims against Varian
and Varian's claims and counterclaims against Applied were dismissed
with prejudice.</P>

<B><P>Novellus<br>
</B>On July 7, 1997, Applied amended the patent infringement suit
filed on June 13, 1997 against Varian, captioned Applied Materials,
Inc. v. Varian Associates, Inc. (case no. C-97-20523-RMW) in the United
States District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging
infringement of several of Applied's patents concerning PVD technology,
to include Novellus Systems, Inc. (Novellus) as a defendant, as a
result of Novellus' acquisition of Varian's thin film systems PVD
business. Applied seeks damages for past infringement, a permanent
injunction, treble damages for willful infringement, pre-judgment
interest and attorneys' fees. On June 23, 1997, Novellus filed a
separate lawsuit against Applied captioned Novellus Systems, Inc. v.
Applied Materials, Inc. (case no. C-97-20551-EAI) in the United States
District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging
infringement by Applied of three PVD technology patents that were
formerly owned by Varian. Discovery has commenced in these actions. The
Court has scheduled trial of both cases for August 2001. Applied
believes it has meritorious claims and defenses and intends to pursue
them vigorously.</P>

<B>
<P>OKI<br>
</B>In November 1997, OKI Electric Industry, Co., Ltd. (OKI) filed
suit against Applied's subsidiary, Applied Materials Japan (AMJ), in
Tokyo District Court in Japan, alleging that AMJ is obligated to pay
OKI relating to license payments OKI made to a third party. In February
2000, the dispute was resolved on mutually acceptable terms and
conditions, and the case was dismissed on March 17, 2000.</P>

<B>
<P>Plasma Physics<br>
</B>On April 17, 2000, Applied filed a lawsuit against Plasma
Physics Corp. (PPC) and Solar Physics Corp. (SPC). The lawsuit seeks a
judicial declaration that Applied's CVD equipment does not infringe two
patents owned by PPC and exclusively licensed to SPC and/or that those
patents are invalid or unenforceable. On July 31, 2000, PPC and SPC
answered the complaint and filed a conditional counterclaim alleging
that Applied had contributed to or induced others to infringe the two
patents. PPC and SBC seek an injunction prohibiting infringement by
Applied and an award of costs, expenses and attorneys' fees. The
counterclaim is conditional because PPC and SPC have stated that they
will not sue Applied for infringement of the two patents if the Court
dismisses the lawsuit initiated by Applied for lack of subject matter
jurisdiction. The Court subsequently denied without prejudice PPC and
SPC's motion to dismiss the lawsuit for lack of subject matter
jurisdiction, but stated that PPC and SPC could renew the motion to
dismiss if appropriate after further discovery. Discovery has
commenced. No trial date has been set. </P>

<B>
<P>U.S. Department of Justice, Antitrust Division<br>
</B>In September 2000, Applied received notice from the Department
of Justice, Antitrust Division that it had begun an investigation into
Applied's licensing of technology. Although neither the extent nor the
outcome of this investigation can be determined at this time, Applied
does not believe that the outcome will have a material adverse effect
on its financial position or results of operations.</P>

<B><P>Axcelis Technologies<br>
</B>On January 8, 2001, Axcelis Technologies, Inc. (Axcelis),
formerly a subsidiary of Eaton Corporation, filed a lawsuit in the
United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts
captioned Axcelis Technologies, Inc. v. Applied Materials, Inc. (case
no. 01-10029 DPW). The lawsuit alleges that Applied infringes a patent
concerning ion implantation owned by Axcelis. The complaint also
alleges various Massachusetts state and common law tortious
interference and unfair competition claims. Axcelis seeks a preliminary
and permanent injunction, damages, costs and attorneys' fees. Applied
has not yet responded to the complaint and no trial date has been set.
Applied believes it has meritorious defenses to the action and intends
to pursue them vigorously.</P>

<P>Applied is subject to various other legal proceedings and claims,
either asserted or unasserted, that arise in the ordinary course of
business. Although the outcome of these claims cannot be predicted with
certainty, Applied does not believe that any of these other existing
legal matters will have a material adverse effect on its financial
condition or results of operations.</P>

<B><P>RESULTS OF OPERATIONS</P>

</B><P>Applied develops, manufactures, markets and services
semiconductor wafer fabrication equipment and related spares parts for
the worldwide semiconductor industry. Demand for Applied's products can
change significantly from period to period as a result of numerous
factors, including, but not limited to, changes in: 1) global economic
conditions; 2) supply and demand for semiconductors; 3) the
profitability of semiconductor manufacturers; and 4) advanced
technology and/or capacity requirements of semiconductor manufacturers.
For this and other reasons, Applied's results of operations for fiscal
1998, 1999 and 2000 may not necessarily be indicative of future
operating results.</P>

<B><P>Net Sales<br>
</B>Applied's business was subject to cyclical industry conditions
in fiscal 1998, 1999 and 2000. As a result of these conditions, there
were significant fluctuations in Applied's quarterly new orders and net
sales, both within and across fiscal years. Demand for semiconductor
manufacturing equipment has historically been volatile as a result of
sudden changes in semiconductor supply and demand and other factors,
including rapid technological advances in both semiconductor devices
and wafer fabrication processes. Quarterly new orders and net sales
were as follows:</P>

</FONT><FONT SIZE=2>


<P>During the fourth fiscal quarter of 1998 and first fiscal quarter of
1999, the semiconductor and semiconductor manufacturing equipment
industries began to emerge from a severe downturn and entered a period
of expansion. As a result of the industry expansion, new orders and net
sales have increased sequentially each quarter during fiscal 1999 and
fiscal 2000. Strong demand for Applied's products has been driven by
semiconductor manufacturers' needs for additional capacity and new
technology to meet consumer demand for Internet, computing,
communications and digital devices. In addition, the semiconductor
industry is continuing the transition to smaller device sizes, new
materials, such as copper, and 300mm wafer processing, all of which
require new manufacturing equipment. For fiscal 2000, Applied was able
to achieve record levels of new orders, net sales and net income as a
result of these factors.</P>

<B><P>Gross Margin<br>
</B>Gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased from 46.6
percent for fiscal 1998 to 47.5 percent for fiscal 1999, and to 50.8
percent for fiscal 2000. The increases in gross margin as a percentage
of net sales were due primarily to higher business volume, reduced
manufacturing cycle times and the favorable effects of operational
programs emphasizing productivity improvements and cost reduction.</P>

<B><P>Research, Development and Engineering<br>
</B>Applied's future operating results depend, to a considerable
extent, on its ability to maintain a competitive advantage in the
products and services it provides. Applied believes that it is critical
to continue to make substantial investments in RD&amp;E to ensure the
availability of innovative technology that meets the current and
projected requirements of its customers' most advanced chip designs.
RD&amp;E expenses increased for each of the last three years, from $697
million for fiscal 1998 to $740 million for fiscal 1999 and to $1.1
billion for fiscal 2000. As a percentage of net sales, RD&amp;E
expenses decreased from 16.1 percent for fiscal 1998 to 14.5 percent
for fiscal 1999, and to 11.6 percent for fiscal 2000. The decreases as
a percentage of net sales were due to higher net sales for fiscal 1999
and 2000. </P>

<P>Applied increased its absolute spending for fiscal 1999 and 2000 to
address customers' requirements for shrinking device feature sizes, the
use of new materials, such as copper, and the transition from 200mm to
300mm wafer processing. As Applied has continued its extensive
development of wafer fabrication equipment for smaller feature sizes,
orders for systems capable of fabricating devices with design feature
sizes at or below 0.18 micron have also continued to increase as a
percentage of total systems orders. Applied's investment in research
and development for copper-based devices resulted in a broad line of
copper-based products available for sale in fiscal 1999 and 2000.
Additionally, Applied developed and launched many new products and
enhanced versions of its existing products and technologies in fiscal
2000, including 22 new systems for 300mm manufacturing. </P>

<B><P>Marketing, Selling, General and Administrative<br>
</B>Marketing, selling, general and administrative (MSG&amp;A)
expenses increased from $626 million for fiscal 1998 to $695 million
for fiscal 1999, and to $961 million for fiscal 2000. The increases for
fiscal 1999 and 2000 were primarily caused by higher costs of incentive
and benefit programs, increased investments in various information
technology programs, and increased costs to support higher net sales.
As a percentage of net sales, MSG&amp;A expenses decreased from 14.5
percent for fiscal 1998 to 13.6 percent for fiscal 1999, and to 10.0
percent for fiscal 2000, primarily due to higher net sales.</P>

<B><P>Non-recurring Items<br>
</B>Non-recurring operating expense items for fiscal 1998 consisted
of $32 million of acquired in-process research and development expense
for the acquisition of licensed technology, an expense of $70 million
for impairment in the value of purchased technology from a prior period
acquisition, and restructuring charges of $135 million for costs
associated with headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities.
Non-recurring items for fiscal 1999 consisted of $5 million of merger
expenses, $43 million of acquired in-process research and development
expense incurred in connection with the acquisitions of AKT and
Obsidian, Inc. and $3 million of restructuring charges associated with
Etec's headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities in fiscal
1999 prior to its acquisition by Applied. Non-recurring items for
fiscal 2000 consisted of $40 million of merger expenses. For further
details, see Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. </P>

<B>
<P>Non-recurring Income, Net<br>
</B>Net non-recurring income of $15 million for fiscal 1998, $30
million for fiscal 1999 and $68 million for fiscal 2000 were related to
a 1998 litigation settlement with ASM International, N.V. (ASMI). For
further details, see Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.</P>
<B>

<P>Net Interest Income<BR>
</B>Net interest income was $38 million for fiscal 1998, $60 million
for fiscal 1999 and $133 million for fiscal 2000. The increases from
year to year can be attributed primarily to increasing cash and
investment balances over the three-year period. </P>

<B>
<P>Provision for Income Taxes<br>
</B>Applied's effective income tax rate was 34.0 percent for fiscal
1998, 32.3 percent for fiscal 1999 and 30.0 percent for fiscal 2000.
Applied expected an effective income tax rate of 31.0 percent for
fiscal 1999, which decreased from the fiscal 1998 effective rate due
primarily to the reinstatement of the U.S. federal research and
development (R&amp;D) tax credit and favorable California income tax
legislation with respect to R&amp;D and manufacturers investment tax
credits. However, Applied's actual effective income tax rate for fiscal
1999 was 32.3 percent due to the non-tax deductible nature of $43
million of acquired in-process R&amp;D expense. The further reduction
to a 30.0 percent effective income tax rate for fiscal 2000 resulted
primarily from a shift in the geographic composition of pre-tax income
to entities operating in countries with lower tax rates. Applied's
future effective income tax rate depends on various factors, such as
tax legislation, the geographic composition of Applied's pre-tax
income, non-tax deductible expenses incurred in connection with
acquisitions and the effectiveness of its tax planning strategies. </P>

<B><P>Business Combinations<br>
</B>On March 29, 2000, Applied acquired Etec, a supplier of mask
pattern generating equipment for the semiconductor and electronics
industries, in a stock-for-stock merger. This transaction was accounted
for as a pooling-of-interests; therefore, all prior period amounts have
been restated. Applied issued approximately 29 million shares of its
common stock to complete this transaction. For further details about
Applied's business combinations, see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.</P>

<B><P>RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS</P>
</B>
<P>In June 1999, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;137 (SFAS 137),
&quot;Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
- Deferral of
the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133.&quot; In June 2000, the
FASB issued SFAS 138, &quot;Accounting for Certain Derivative
Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities -
an Amendment of FASB Statement No.
133.&quot; SFAS 133 establishes new standards of accounting and
reporting for derivative instruments and hedging activities, and
requires that all derivatives, including foreign
currency exchange contracts, be recognized on the balance sheet at fair
value. Applied will adopt SFAS 133,
as amended by SFAS 137 and SFAS 138, in the first fiscal quarter of
2001, and does not expect the adoption to have a material effect on its
financial condition or results of operations. </P>

<P>In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued
Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 (SAB 101), &quot;Revenue Recognition
in Financial Statements,&quot; providing guidance on the recognition,
presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements. Applied
is required to adopt SAB 101 in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2001,
retroactively effective to the beginning of fiscal 2001. Management is
currently evaluating the potential effect of the implementation of SAB
101 on Applied's financial condition and results of operations. Because
Applied has complied with generally accepted accounting principles for
historical revenue recognition, any change in revenue recognition
resulting from SAB 101 will be reported as a change in accounting
principle in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2001. While SAB 101 would not
affect the fundamental aspects of Applied's operations as measured by
shipments and cash flows, the implementation of SAB 101 could result in
changes to the timing of Applied's revenue recognition practices, and
therefore could have a material and adverse effect on Applied's
financial condition and results of operations in the period of
implementation. </P>

</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>
<P>FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES</P></B>


<P>Applied increased its cash, cash equivalents and short-term
investments from $2.8 billion at October 31, 1999 to $4.2 billion at
October 29, 2000. Applied's financial condition remained strong, with a
ratio of current assets to current liabilities of 3.1:1 at October 31,
1999 and 3.2:1 at October 29, 2000. </P>

<P>Applied generated cash from continuing operations in each of the
last three fiscal years. The primary source of cash from continuing
operations has been income from continuing operations, as adjusted to
exclude the effect of non-cash items such as depreciation and
amortization, intangible asset write-downs, and acquired in-process
research and development expense. Income from continuing operations,
adjusted to exclude the effect of non-cash items, was: $715 million for
fiscal 1998; $1.2 billion for fiscal 1999; and $2.6 billion for fiscal
2000. The other source or use of cash from continuing operations has
been attributable to changes in assets and liabilities other than those
assets and liabilities resulting from investing and financing
activities. Net changes in assets and liabilities tend to represent a
use of cash during periods of revenue growth because Applied generally
incurs costs and expends cash in advance of receiving cash from its
customers. For example, Applied's inventory increased for fiscal 2000
primarily due to deferred revenue recognition of 300mm systems until
customer acceptance and build requirements and related spares inventory
anticipated for the first fiscal quarter of 2001. Likewise, during
periods of declining revenue or slowed revenue growth, net changes in
assets and liabilities tend to represent a source of cash because
expenditures for inventory and other purchases decrease while
receivables from prior periods, which were higher revenue periods, are
collected. The cash effect of changes in assets and liabilities was: a
$153 million source for fiscal 1998; a $116 million use for fiscal
1999; and a $923 million use for fiscal 2000. </P>

<P>In addition to being driven by revenue and profitability
performance, the cash effect of changes in assets and liabilities is
subject to operational efficiency and productivity. For example,
earlier collection of accounts receivable and increased inventory
turnover both have a positive effect on cash flow. Applied utilized
programs to sell accounts receivable of $499 million for fiscal 1998,
$953 million for fiscal 1999 and $1.5 billion for fiscal 2000. These
receivable sales had the effect of increasing cash and reducing
accounts receivable and days sales outstanding. For further details
regarding accounts receivable sales, see Note 13 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements. </P>

<P>Applied used $592 million of cash for investing activities for
fiscal 1998, $982 million for fiscal 1999 and $1.0 billion for fiscal
2000. Investing activities typically consist of purchases of short-term
investments, purchases of capital assets to support long-term growth
and acquisitions of technology or other companies to allow access to
new market segments or emerging technology. </P>

<P>Applied used $149 million of cash from financing activities for
fiscal 1998, generated $127 million for fiscal 1999 and generated $149
million for fiscal 2000. Financing activities typically include sales
and repurchases of Applied's common stock, as well as borrowings and
repayments of debt. Net debt activity used $64 million of cash for
fiscal 1998 and $17 million of cash for fiscal 1999, and generated $50
million of cash for fiscal 2000. During fiscal 1998, net common stock
activity required $84 million of cash as stock repurchases increased
and stock sales to employees decreased significantly, reflecting
Applied's lower average stock price in fiscal 1998. Net common stock
activity generated $144 million of cash for fiscal 1999 and $99 million
for fiscal 2000 as a result of a significant increase in stock sales to
employees, reflecting Applied's higher average stock price, partially
offset by stock repurchases. Since March 1996, Applied has
systematically repurchased shares of its common stock in the open
market to partially fund its stock-based employee benefit and incentive
plans.</P>

<P>At October 29, 2000, Applied's principal sources of liquidity
consisted of $4.2 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term
investments, and approximately $540 million of available credit
facilities. For further details regarding Applied's credit facilities,
see Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition
to cash and available credit facilities, Applied may from time to time
raise additional capital in the debt and equity markets. Applied's
liquidity is affected by many factors, some of which are based on the
normal ongoing operations of the business, and others of which relate
to the uncertainties of global economies and the semiconductor and
semiconductor manufacturing equipment industries. Although cash
requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these
factors, Applied's management believes that cash generated from
operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing cash
balances and borrowing capability, will be sufficient to satisfy
Applied's liquidity requirements for the next 12 months.</P>

<B>
<P>TRENDS, RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES</P>

<P>The industry that Applied serves is highly volatile and
unpredictable.<br>
</B>The semiconductor industry has historically been cyclical
because of sudden changes in customer capacity requirements and demand
for semiconductors, which has affected the timing and amounts of
capital equipment purchases by customers. The health of the
semiconductor manufacturing equipment industry is affected by these
semiconductor industry cycles, the timing, length and severity of which
are difficult to predict. Although semiconductors are used in many
different products, the markets for those products are interrelated to
various degrees. During periods of declining demand for semiconductor
manufacturing equipment, customers may reduce purchases, delay delivery
of products and/or cancel orders. Therefore, Applied must be able to
quickly and effectively align its cost structure with prevailing market
conditions, to manage its inventory levels in order to reduce the
possibility of future inventory write-downs resulting from
obsolescence, and to motivate and retain key employees. During periods
of rapid growth, Applied must be able to acquire and/or develop
sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory to meet customer
demand, and to attract, hire, assimilate and retain a sufficient number
of qualified people. If Applied is unable to achieve its objectives in
a timely manner during these industry cycles, there could be a material
adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.
</P>

<B>
<P>Applied is exposed to the risks of operating a global business.<br>
</B>Managing Applied's global operations presents challenges that
could materially and adversely affect demand for Applied's systems and
related services. These challenges include cultural diversities,
periodic economic downturns, trade balance issues, political
instability and fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates,
among other risks. For example, global uncertainties with respect to:
1) the slowdown in the rate of gross domestic product growth forecasted
for next year; 2) foundry capacity utilization; 3) capital spending in
the telecommunications industry; and 4) memory price weakness may
affect Applied's business, financial condition and results of
operations.</P>

<B><P>Applied operates in a highly competitive industry characterized
by increasingly rapid technological changes.<br>
</B>Applied's competitive advantage and future success depend on its
ability to successfully: 1) develop new products and technologies; 2)
develop new markets in the semiconductor industry for its products and
services; 3) introduce new products to the marketplace in a timely
manner; 4) qualify new products with its customers; and 5) commence and
adjust production to meet customer demands. The introduction of new
products and technologies, including those to support the transition to
new materials and to 300mm systems, grows increasingly complex over
time. If Applied does not develop and introduce new products and
technologies in a timely manner in response to changing market
conditions or customer requirements, its financial condition and
results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. </P>
<B>
<P>Applied is exposed to risks associated with acquisitions. <br>
</B>Applied has made, and may in the future make, acquisitions of,
or significant investments in, businesses with complementary products,
services and/or technologies. Acquisitions involve numerous risks,
including, but not limited to: 1) difficulties and increased costs in
connection with integration of the personnel, operations, technologies
and products of acquired companies; 2) diversion of management's
attention from other operational matters; 3) the potential loss of key
employees of acquired companies; 4) lack of synergy, or the inability
to realize expected synergies, resulting from the acquisition; 5)
failure to commercialize purchased technology; and 6) acquired
intangible assets becoming impaired as a result of technological
advancements or worse-than-expected performance of the acquired
company. Mergers and acquisitions are inherently risky and the
inability to effectively manage these risks could materially and
adversely affect Applied's business, financial condition and results of
operations. </P>

<B>
<P>Applied is subject to risks of non-compliance with environmental
regulations.<br>
</B>Applied is subject to environmental regulations in connection
with its business operations, including but not limited to regulations
related to the development, manufacturing and use of its products. From
time to time, Applied receives notices alleging violations of these
regulations. It is Applied's policy to respond promptly to these
notices and to take necessary corrective action. Failure or inability
to comply with existing or future environmental regulations could
result in significant remediation liabilities, the imposition of fines
and/or the suspension or termination of development, manufacturing or
use of certain of its products, each of which could have a material
adverse effect on Applied's financial condition and results of
operations.</P>

<B>
<P>Applied is exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or
claims.<BR>
</B>Applied currently is, and in the future may be, involved in legal
proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement, intellectual
property rights, antitrust, environmental regulations, contracts and
other matters (see Item 3: Legal Proceedings). These legal proceedings
and claims, whether with or without merit, could be time-consuming and
expensive to defend, and  divert management's attention and resources.
There can be no assurance regarding the outcome of current or future
legal proceedings or claims. If Applied is not able to resolve a claim,
negotiate a settlement of the matter, obtain necessary licenses on
commercially reasonable terms, and/or successfully prosecute or defend
its position, Applied's financial condition and results of operations
could be materially and adversely affected. Applied's success is
dependent in part upon the protection of its propriety rights.
Infringement upon Applied's proprietary rights by a third party could
result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for
Applied.</P>

<B>
<P>Failure of critical suppliers to deliver sufficient quantities of
parts in a timely and cost-effective manner could negatively affect
Applied's business.<BR>
</B>Applied uses numerous suppliers to supply parts, components and
subassemblies (collectively &quot;parts&quot;) for the manufacture and
support of its products. In addition, some key parts may be obtained
only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers. If Applied
does not receive a sufficient quantity of parts in a timely and cost-
effective manner to meet its production requirements, Applied's results
of operations may be materially and adversely affected.</P>

<B><P>Manufacturing interruptions or delays could affect Applied's
ability to meet customer demand.<br>
</B>Applied's business depends on its ability to manufacture
products that meet the rapidly changing demands of its customers.
Significant interruptions of manufacturing operations as a result of
natural disasters, software issues, infrastructure failure, or other
cause could result in delayed product deliveries or manufacturing
inefficiencies, any or all of which could materially and adversely
affect Applied's financial condition and results of operations. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Item 7a:  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market
Risk</P>

<P>Interest Rate Risk<br>
</B>At October 29, 2000, Applied's investment portfolio included
fixed-income securities with a fair value of approximately $2.9
billion. These securities are subject to interest rate risk, and will
decline in value if interest rates increase. Due to the short duration
of Applied's investment portfolio, an immediate 10 percent increase in
interest rates is not expected to have a material effect on Applied's
near-term financial condition or results of operations.</P>

<P>Applied's long-term debt bears interest at fixed rates; therefore,
Applied's results of operations would only be affected by interest rate
changes to the extent that variable rate short-term notes payable are
outstanding. Due to the short-term nature and insignificant amount of
Applied's short-term notes payable, an immediate 10 percent change in
interest rates is not expected to have a material effect on Applied's
near-term results of operations. </P>
<B>
<P>Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk<br>
</B>Significant operations of Applied are conducted in foreign
currencies, primarily Japanese yen. Forward exchange and currency
option contracts are purchased to hedge a portion of, but not all,
existing firm commitments and foreign currency denominated transactions
expected to occur within 12 months. Gains and losses on these contracts
are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations at the time
that the related transactions being hedged are recognized. Because the
effect of movements in currency exchange rates on forward exchange and
currency option contracts generally offsets the related effect on the
underlying items being hedged, these financial instruments are not
expected to subject Applied to risks that would otherwise result from
changes in currency exchange rates. Applied does not use derivative
financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Net foreign
currency gains and losses did not have a material effect on Applied's
results of operations for fiscal 1998, 1999 or 2000.</P>

<P>Forward exchange contracts are denominated in the same currency as
the underlying transactions (primarily Japanese yen), and the terms of
the forward foreign exchange contracts generally match the terms of the
underlying transactions. At October 29, 2000, the majority of Applied's
outstanding forward exchange contracts are marked to market (see Note 3
of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), as are the related
underlying transactions being hedged; therefore, the effect of exchange
rate changes on forward contracts is expected to be substantially
offset by the effect of these changes on the underlying transactions.
The effect of an immediate 10 percent change in exchange rates on
forward exchange contracts and the underlying hedged transactions
denominated in Japanese yen and British pounds is not expected to be
material to Applied's near-term financial condition or results of
operations. Applied's downside risk with respect to currency option
contracts is limited to the premium paid for the right to exercise the
option. Premiums paid for options outstanding at October 29, 2000 were
not material.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NOTE 1&nbsp;&nbsp;SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES&#9;</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>

<B><P>Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation</B>  &nbsp;&nbsp;The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Applied
Materials, Inc. and its subsidiaries (Applied) after elimination of
intercompany balances and transactions. </P>

<P>Applied's fiscal year ends on the last Sunday in October of each
year. Fiscal 1998 and 2000 contained 52 weeks, whereas fiscal 1999
contained 53 weeks. The inclusion of an additional week in fiscal 1999
did not have a material effect on Applied's financial condition or
results of operations.</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="TIMES" SIZE=2>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P>The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying
notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.</P>

<B><P>Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments</B>  &nbsp;&nbsp;All
highly-liquid investments with a remaining maturity of three months or less at
the time of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents. All of
Applied's short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale
at the balance sheet dates. Investments classified as available-for-sale
are recorded at fair value and any material temporary difference
between the cost and fair value of an investment is presented as a
separate component of accumulated other comprehensive
income/(loss).</P>

<B><P>Inventories</B> &nbsp;&nbsp; Inventories are generally stated at the lower of
cost or market, with cost determined on a first-in, first-out (FIFO)
basis.</P>

<B><P>Property, Plant and Equipment</B>  &nbsp;&nbsp;Property, plant and equipment
is stated at cost. Depreciation is provided over the estimated useful
lives of the assets using the straight-line method. Estimated useful
lives for financial reporting purposes are as follows: buildings and
improvements, five to 33 years; demonstration and manufacturing
equipment, three to five years; and furniture, fixtures and other
equipment, three to 15 years. Land improvements are amortized over the
shorter of 15 years or the estimated useful life. Leasehold
improvements are amortized over the shorter of five years or the lease
term.</P>

<B><P>Intangible Assets</B> &nbsp;&nbsp; Purchased technology and goodwill are
presented at cost, net of accumulated amortization, and are amortized
over their estimated useful lives of three to 10 years using the
straight-line method. </P>

<B><P>Long-Lived Assets</B>  &nbsp;&nbsp;Applied reviews long-lived assets and
identifiable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these
assets may not be recoverable. Applied assesses these assets for
impairment based on estimated future cash flows from these assets.</P>

<B><P>Revenue Recognition</B>  &nbsp;&nbsp;Systems and spares revenue is generally
recognized upon shipment. A provision for the estimated cost of system
installation and warranty is recorded when revenue is recognized.
Service revenue is generally recognized ratably over the period of the
related contract. </P>

<B><P>Derivative Financial Instruments</B>  &nbsp;&nbsp;Applied uses financial
instruments such as forward exchange contracts to hedge a portion, but
not all, of its firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies, and
uses currency option contracts to hedge a portion, but not all, of its
anticipated and uncommitted transactions expected to be denominated in
foreign currencies. The terms of currency instruments used for hedging
purposes are generally consistent with the timing of the committed or
anticipated transactions being hedged. The purpose of Applied's foreign
currency management is to minimize the effect of exchange rate changes
on actual cash flows from foreign currency denominated transactions.
Gains and losses on forward exchange and currency option contracts are
deferred and recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations
when the related transactions being hedged are recognized. If the
underlying transaction being hedged fails to occur, or occurs prior to
the maturity of the financial instrument, Applied immediately
recognizes the gain or loss on the associated financial instrument.
Those forward exchange contracts that have been marked to market are
included in accounts payable and accrued expenses on Applied's
Consolidated Balance Sheets. To date, premiums paid for currency option
contracts have not been material. Applied does not use derivative
financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.</P>

<B><P>Foreign Currency Translation</B> &nbsp;&nbsp;Applied's subsidiaries
located in Japan and Europe operate primarily using local functional
currencies. Accordingly, all assets and liabilities of these
subsidiaries are translated using exchange rates in effect at the end
of the period, and revenues and costs are translated using average
exchange rates for the period. The resulting translation adjustments
are presented as a separate component of accumulated other
comprehensive income/(loss).</P>

<P>Applied's subsidiaries located in Ireland, Italy, Israel, Korea,
Taiwan, Southeast Asia and China primarily use the U.S. dollar as their
functional currency. Accordingly, assets and liabilities of these
subsidiaries are translated using exchange rates in effect at the end
of the period, except for non-monetary assets, such as inventories and
property, plant and equipment, that are translated using historical
exchange rates. Revenues and costs are translated using average
exchange rates for the period, except for costs related to those
balance sheet items that are translated using historical exchange
rates. The resulting translation gains and losses are included in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations as they are incurred.</P>

<B><P>Employee Stock Plans</B>  &nbsp; &nbsp;As permitted by Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123 (SFAS 123), &quot;Accounting for Stock-
Based Compensation,&quot; Applied elected to continue to apply the
provisions of Accounting Principles Board's Opinion No. 25 (APB 25),
&quot;Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,&quot; and related
interpretations in accounting for its employee stock option and stock
purchase plans. Applied is generally not required under APB 25 and
related interpretations to recognize compensation expense in connection
with its employee stock option and stock purchase plans. Applied is
required by SFAS 123 to present, in the notes to the consolidated
financial statements, the pro forma effects on reported net income and
earnings per share as if compensation expense had been recognized based
on the fair value method of accounting prescribed by SFAS 123.</P>

<B><P>Concentrations of Credit Risk</B>  &nbsp;&nbsp;Financial instruments that
potentially subject Applied to significant concentrations of credit
risk consist principally of cash equivalents, short-term investments,
trade accounts receivable and derivative financial instruments used in
hedging activities. </P>

<P>Applied invests in a variety of financial instruments such as
certificates of deposit, corporate and municipal bonds, and U.S.
Treasury and agency securities, and, by policy, limits the amount of
credit exposure with any one financial institution or commercial
issuer.</P>

<P>Applied's customers consist of semiconductor manufacturers located
throughout the world. Applied performs ongoing credit evaluations of
its customers' financial condition and generally requires no collateral
to secure accounts receivable. Applied maintains a reserve for
potentially uncollectible accounts receivable based on its assessment
of the collectibility of accounts receivable.</P>
<P>Applied is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of
nonperformance by counterparties to derivative financial instruments,
but does not expect any counterparties to fail to meet their
obligations.</P>

<B><P>Earnings Per Share</B>  &nbsp;&nbsp;Basic earnings per share is determined
using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during
the period. Diluted earnings per share is determined using the weighted
average number of common shares and equivalents (representing the
dilutive effect of stock options) outstanding during the period. Net
income has not been adjusted for any period presented for purposes of
computing basic or diluted earnings per share.</P>

<P>For purposes of computing diluted earnings per share, weighted
average common share equivalents do not include stock options with an
exercise price that exceeds the average fair market value of Applied's
common stock for the period. For fiscal 2000, options to purchase
approximately 2,906,760 shares of common stock at an average exercise
price of $84.33 were excluded from the computation, since this average
exercise price exceeded the average fair market value of Applied's
common stock during fiscal 2000. </P>

<B><P>Reclassifications</B> &nbsp;&nbsp; Certain prior year amounts have been
reclassified to conform to the fiscal 2000 presentation or in
accordance with applicable accounting requirements.</P>

<B><P>Recent Accounting Pronouncements</B>  &nbsp;&nbsp;
In June 1999, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;137 (SFAS
137), &quot;Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities -
Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133.&quot;
In June 2000, the FASB issued SFAS 138, &quot;Accounting for Certain
Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities
- an Amendment of FASB
Statement No. 133.&quot; SFAS 133 establishes new standards of
accounting and reporting for derivative instruments and hedging
activities, and requires that all derivatives,
including foreign currency exchange contracts, be recognized on the
balance sheet at fair value. Applied
will adopt SFAS 133, as amended by SFAS 137 and SFAS 138, in the first
fiscal quarter of 2001, and does not expect the adoption to have a
material effect on its financial condition or results of
operations.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued
Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 (SAB 101), &quot;Revenue Recognition
in Financial Statements,&quot; providing guidance on the recognition,
presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements. Applied
is required to adopt SAB 101 in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2001,
retroactively effective to the beginning of fiscal 2001. Management is
currently evaluating the potential effect of the implementation of SAB
101 on Applied's financial condition and results of operations. Because
Applied has complied with generally accepted accounting principles for
historical revenue recognition, any change in revenue recognition
resulting from SAB 101 will be reported as a change in accounting
principle in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2001. While SAB 101 would not
affect the fundamental aspects of Applied's operations as measured by
shipments and cash flows, the implementation of SAB 101 could result in
changes to the timing of Applied's revenue recognition practices, and
therefore have a material and adverse effect on Applied's financial
condition and results of operations in the period of implementation.

<P>NOTE 2  &nbsp;&nbsp;BUSINESS COMBINATIONS</P>

</B><P>On December 11, 1998, Applied acquired Consilium, Inc.
(Consilium), a supplier of integrated semiconductor and electronics
manufacturing execution systems and services, in a stock-for-stock
merger accounted for as a pooling-of-interests. Due to the
immateriality of Consilium's historical financial position and results
of operations in relation to those of Applied, Applied's prior period
financial statements have not been restated. Applied issued
approximately 3 million shares of its common stock to complete this
transaction, and recorded $5 million of transaction costs as a one-time
operating expense. </P>

<P>On October 5, 1999, Applied acquired Obsidian, Inc. (Obsidian), a
developer of fixed-abrasive chemical mechanical polishing solutions for
the semiconductor industry, in a stock-for-stock merger accounted for
as a purchase business combination. Applied issued shares of its common
stock having a market value of $150 million to complete this
transaction, and recorded acquired in-process research and development
expense of $35 million as a one-time operating expense. In connection
with this acquisition, Applied recorded purchased technology of $36
million and goodwill of $117 million to be amortized over seven
years.</P>
<B>
</B><P>On October 29, 1999, Applied acquired the remaining 50 percent
of AKT, Inc. (AKT), a company that develops, manufactures and markets
systems used to produce flat panel displays (FPDs), in a purchase
business combination for $87 million in cash. In connection with this
acquisition, Applied recorded acquired in-process research and
development expense of $8 million, purchased technology of $75 million
and goodwill of $35 million. Purchased technology will be amortized
over five years and goodwill over 10 years. Previously, Applied and
Komatsu Ltd. (Komatsu) each owned 50 percent of AKT as a joint venture.
Applied accounted for its interest in the joint venture using the
equity method. During the fourth fiscal quarter of 1998, Applied
decided to discontinue the operations of AKT over a 12-month period. As
a result of this decision, Applied recorded a $40 million provision for
discontinued operations, consisting of $19 million primarily for
immediate headcount reductions and lease terminations, and $21 million
for net expenses and other obligations expected to be incurred during,
or at completion of, the 12-month wind-down period. In addition,
Applied also recorded its $18 million share of AKT's operating losses
as a component of discontinued operations. In late fiscal 1999, due to
an overall improvement in the FPD industry, AKT's financial condition
and business outlook improved. As a result, Applied reassessed its
decision to discontinue AKT's operations, and agreed to acquire
Komatsu's 50 percent interest. Because of the decision to continue
AKT's operations, Applied reclassified AKT's prior period operating
results from discontinued operations to continuing operations, and
reversed into income in fiscal 1999 the $21 million provision for
discontinued operations recorded in fiscal 1998, which was no longer
required. The reclassifications did not change Applied's previously
reported net income or earnings per share amounts, and were recorded in
accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 90-16,
&quot;Accounting for Discontinued Operations Subsequently
Retained.&quot; </P>
<B>
</B><P>On March 29, 2000, Applied acquired Etec Systems, Inc. (Etec), a
supplier of mask pattern generating equipment for the semiconductor and
electronics industries, in a stock-for-stock merger. This transaction
was accounted for as a pooling-of-interests; therefore, all prior
period amounts have been restated. Applied issued approximately 29
million shares of its common stock to complete this transaction, and
recorded $40 million of transaction costs as a one-time operating
expense. Additionally, Applied recorded a one-time, pre-tax operating
expense of $14 million ($6.5 million in cost of products sold and $7.5
million in general and administrative expenses) to conform Etec's
accounting policies to those of Applied.</P>

<P>Prior to the merger, Etec's fiscal year end (July 31) was different
than Applied's (last Sunday in October). Fiscal 1999 amounts included
herein for Etec have not been conformed to Applied's fiscal year. To
conform Etec's fiscal 2000 amounts to Applied's fiscal year, Etec's net
loss for the three months ended October&nbsp;31, 1999 was reflected as
an adjustment to retained earnings for the first fiscal quarter of
2000. Etec's net sales and net loss for the three months ended October
31, 1999 were $43 million and $708,000, respectively.</P>

<P>Net sales and net income for each company from the beginning of the
periods presented to the date of consummation of the merger (March 29,
2000) were as follows:</P>

<B><P>NOTE 5  &nbsp;&nbsp;NOTES PAYABLE</P>
</B>
<P>Applied has credit facilities for unsecured borrowings in various
currencies up to approximately $635 million, of which $500 million is
comprised of two revolving credit agreements in the United States with
a group of banks. One agreement is a $250 million line of credit that
expires in March 2001, and the other is a $250 million line of credit
that expires in March 2003. The agreements provide for borrowings at
various rates, including the lead bank's prime reference rate, and
include financial and other covenants with which Applied was in
compliance at October 29, 2000. No amounts were outstanding under these
agreements at the end of fiscal 1999 or 2000. The remaining credit
facilities of approximately $135 million are primarily with Japanese
banks at rates indexed to their prime reference rate. Amounts
outstanding under these credit facilities at October 31, 1999 were not
material. At October 29, 2000, $95 million was outstanding under
Japanese credit facilities at an average annual interest rate of 0.62
percent.</P>

<B><P>Acquired In-Process Research and Development Expense</B>  &nbsp;&nbsp;During
fiscal 1998, Applied entered into an agreement with Trikon
Technologies, Inc. for a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual license of
MORI&#153; plasma source and Forcefill&#153; deposition technology.
Because the development of this technology had not yet reached
technological feasibility at the time of its acquisition and had no
alternative future use for Applied, Applied recognized $32 million,
including transaction costs, of acquired in-process research and
development expense at the time of its acquisition. </P>

<P>During fiscal 1999, Applied recorded $35 million of acquired
in-process research and development expense in connection with its
acquisition of Obsidian. Also during fiscal 1999, Applied recorded $8
million of acquired in-process research and development expense in
connection with its acquisition of AKT. For further details regarding
these acquisitions, see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements. </P>

<B><P>Write-Down of Impaired Asset</B>  &nbsp;&nbsp;During fiscal 1998, Applied
determined that the carrying value of a certain purchased technology
asset exceeded its net realizable value. This occurred because of rapid
changes in technology and significant changes in business conditions,
both of which resulted in a reduced demand outlook for products
incorporating the purchased technology. Applied's determination was
supported by the results of an independent analysis prepared by a
nationally-recognized valuation firm. In accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, &quot;Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be
Disposed Of,&quot; Applied recorded a pre-tax charge of $70 million for
this impairment in asset value. </P>

<B><P>Restructuring Charges</B>  &nbsp;&nbsp;During fiscal 1998, Applied recorded
pre-tax restructuring charges of $135 million, consisting of $75
million for headcount reductions and $60 million for consolidation of
facilities and related fixed assets. These restructuring actions
occurred in Applied's third and fourth fiscal quarters, and were taken
to align Applied's cost structure with prevailing market conditions and
to create a more flexible and efficient organization that would be
better positioned for an industry recovery. Headcount reductions
consisted of a voluntary separation plan during the third fiscal
quarter of 1998 and a reduction in force during the fourth fiscal
quarter of 1998. The voluntary separation plan resulted in a headcount
reduction of approximately 800 employees, or approximately six percent
of Applied's global workforce, for a cost of $25 million. The reduction
in force eliminated approximately 2,000 additional positions, or
approximately 15 percent of Applied's global workforce, for a cost of
$50 million. The majority of these positions were eliminated in
California and Texas, with the remainder being eliminated from other
locations worldwide. </P>

<P>During fiscal 1999, Etec recorded pre-tax restructuring charges of
$3 million, consisting of $2 million for headcount reductions and $1
million for consolidation of facilities. The restructuring actions
eliminated approximately 90 positions, primarily located in California
and Oregon, and consolidated Etec's facilities in Europe and
Oregon.</P>

<P>During fiscal 1998, 1999 and 2000, $42 million, $48 million and $17
million, respectively, of cash was used for restructuring costs. At
October 29, 2000, the remaining restructuring accrual balance was not
material.</P>

<B>
<P>Acquisition Expenses</B>  &nbsp;&nbsp;During fiscal 1999, Applied recorded $5
million of pre-tax, operating expenses for costs incurred in connection
with its acquisition of Consilium. During fiscal 2000, Applied recorded
$40&nbsp;million of pre-tax, operating expenses in connection with its
acquisition of Etec. For further details regarding these acquisitions,
see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.</P>

</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NOTE 8  &nbsp;&nbsp;NON-RECURRING INCOME,
NET</P></B>

<P>During the first fiscal quarter of 1998, Applied
settled all outstanding litigation with ASM International N.V. (ASMI).
As a result of this settlement, Applied received a convertible note for
$80 million and recorded the amount as pre-tax, non-recurring income.
Applied collected $15 million against the note in November 1997. During
the fourth fiscal quarter of 1998, Applied determined, based on facts
and circumstances known at that time, that collection of the remaining
note balance was doubtful, and recorded a $65 million pre-tax,
non-recurring charge to fully reserve the outstanding note balance. As a
result, Applied recognized subsequent payments related to the remaining
balance of the note receivable as non-recurring income upon receipt of
cash. The net effect of the ASMI settlement for fiscal 1998 was $15
million of pre-tax, non-operating income. </P>

<P>During the first fiscal quarter of 1999, subsequent to the original
maturity date of the ASMI note and in accordance with a restructured
agreement, Applied received a $20 million payment from ASMI and
recorded the amount as non-recurring income. During the fourth fiscal
quarter of 1999, Applied received another payment from ASMI of $10
million and also recorded the amount as non-recurring income. </P>

<P>During the second fiscal quarter of 2000, Applied recorded an
additional $68 million of pre-tax, non-operating income related to the
ASMI litigation settlement. This amount consisted of: 1) the final cash
payment of $35 million related to the outstanding note receivable; and
2) a net gain of $33 million on the exercise of ASMI warrants and
subsequent sale of the resulting shares. Royalties received from ASMI
pursuant to the settlement agreement have not been, and are not
expected to be, material. </P>

<B><P>NOTE 9  &nbsp;&nbsp;STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY</P>

<P>Stock Split </B>&nbsp;&nbsp;On February 15, 2000, Applied's Board of
Directors approved a two-for-one stock split of Applied's common stock,
which was distributed in the form of a 100 percent stock dividend on
March 15, 2000 to stockholders of record as of February 25, 2000. All

<B>
<P>Stock Repurchase Program</B>  &nbsp;&nbsp;Since March 1996, Applied has
systematically repurchased shares of its common stock in the open
market to partially fund its stock-based employee benefit and incentive
plans. In fiscal 1998, 9,940,000 shares were repurchased at an average
price of $15.99 per share. In fiscal 1999, 2,190,000 shares were
repurchased at an average price of $28.27 per share. In fiscal 2000,

<B><P>Employee Stock Purchase Plan</B>  &nbsp;&nbsp;Applied sponsors two employee
stock purchase plans (ESPP) for the benefit of U.S. and international
employees. The U.S. plan is qualified under Section 423 of the Internal
Revenue Code. Under the ESPP, substantially all employees may purchase
Applied's common stock through payroll deductions at a price equal to
85 percent of the lower of the fair market value at the beginning or
end of each six-month offering period. Stock purchases under the ESPP
are limited to 10 percent of an employee's eligible compensation, up to
a maximum of $12,750, in any plan year. Shares issued under the ESPP
were 3,002,000 for fiscal 1998, 2,992,000 for fiscal 1999 and 1,584,000
for fiscal 2000. At October 29, 2000, 19,784,000 shares were reserved
for future issuance under the ESPP. </P>

<B><P>Stock-Based Compensation</B> &nbsp;&nbsp; Applied has adopted the
disclosure-only provisions of SFAS 123. Accordingly, no compensation expense has
been recognized for Applied's stock option and purchase plan activity.
If compensation expense had been determined based on the grant date
fair value for awards in fiscal 1998, 1999 and 2000 in accordance with
the provisions of SFAS 123, Applied's net income and earnings per share
would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below:</P>

<P>Based on the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, the weighted
average estimated fair value of employee stock option grants was $6.99
for fiscal 1998, $16.80 for fiscal 1999 and $26.10 for fiscal 2000. The
weighted average estimated fair value of purchase rights granted under
the ESPP was $4.95 for fiscal 1998, $5.27 for fiscal 1999 and $11.22
for fiscal 2000.</P>

<B><P>Employee Bonus Plans</B> &nbsp;&nbsp; Applied has various employee bonus
plans. A profit sharing plan provides for the distribution of a
percentage of pre-tax profits to substantially all Applied employees
not eligible for other performance-based incentive plans, up to a
maximum percentage of compensation. Other plans award annual bonuses to
Applied's executives and key contributors based on the achievement of
profitability and other specific performance criteria. Applied also has
agreements with key technical employees that provide for additional
compensation related to the success of new product development and
achievement of specified profitability criteria. Charges to expense
under these plans were $115 million for fiscal 1998, $209 million for
fiscal 1999 and $286 million for fiscal 2000.</P>

<B><P>Employee Savings and Retirement Plan</B>  &nbsp;&nbsp;The Employee Savings
and Retirement Plan is qualified under Sections 401(a) and (k) of the
Internal Revenue Code. Applied contributes a percentage of each
participating employee's salary deferral contributions. Company
matching contributions are invested in Applied's common stock and
become 20 percent vested at the end of an employee's third year of
service, and vest 20 percent per year of service thereafter until
becoming fully vested at the end of seven years of service. Applied's
matching contributions under this plan were $19 million for fiscal
1998, $16 million for fiscal 1999 and $21 million for fiscal 2000.</P>

<B><P>Defined Benefit Plans of Foreign Subsidiaries</B>  &nbsp;&nbsp;Several of
Applied's foreign subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans
covering substantially all of their eligible employees. Benefits under
these plans are based on years of service and final average
compensation levels. Funding is limited by the local statutory
requirements of the countries in which the subsidiaries are located.
Expenses under these plans, consisting principally of service cost,
were $7 million for fiscal 1998, $9 million for fiscal 1999 and $10
million for fiscal 2000. At October 29, 2000, the aggregate accumulated
benefit obligation was $47 million, the projected benefit obligation
was $72 million, and the fair value of plan assets was $26 million.</P>

<B><P>Post-Retirement Benefits  </B>&nbsp;&nbsp;On January 1, 1999, Applied adopted
a plan that provides medical and vision benefits to retirees who are at
least age 55, and whose age plus years of service is at least 65 at
date of retirement. An eligible retiree may elect coverage for a spouse
or domestic partner under the age of 65. Coverage under the plan
generally ends for both the retiree and spouse or domestic partner upon
reaching age 65. This plan has not had, and is not expected to have, a
material effect on Applied's financial condition or results of
operations.</P>

<P>U.S. income taxes have not been provided for approximately $193
million of cumulative undistributed earnings of several non-U.S.
subsidiaries. Applied intends to reinvest these earnings indefinitely
in operations outside of the United States.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>NOTE 12 &nbsp;&nbsp; INDUSTRY SEGMENT AND FOREIGN OPERATIONS</P></B>

<P>In fiscal 1999, Applied adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 131 (SFAS 131), &quot;Disclosures
About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information,&quot; which
changes the way public companies report information about operating
segments. SFAS 131, which is based on a management approach to segment
reporting, establishes requirements to report selected segment
information quarterly and to report annually entity-wide disclosures
about products and services, major customers, and the countries in
which the entity holds material assets and reports revenue. An
operating segment is defined as a component that engages in business
activities, whose operating results are reviewed by the chief operating
decision maker, and for which discrete financial information is
available. Applied's chief operating decision maker has been identified
as the Office of the President, which reviews operating results to make
decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance for the
entire company. Applied operates in one segment for the manufacture,
marketing and servicing of semiconductor wafer fabrication equipment.
All material operating units qualify for aggregation under SFAS 131 due
to their identical customer base and similar: economic characteristics;
nature of products and services; and procurement, manufacturing and
distribution processes. Since Applied operates in one segment, all
financial segment information required by SFAS 131 can be found in the
consolidated financial statements. </P>

<P>During fiscal 1998 and 2000, no individual customer accounted for
more than 10 percent of Applied's net sales. During fiscal 1999, one
customer accounted for more than 10 percent of net sales. </P>

<P>For geographical reporting, revenues are attributed to the
geographic location in which the customer is located. Long-lived assets
consist primarily of property, plant and equipment, and are attributed
to the geographic location in which they are located. Net sales and
long-lived assets by geographic region were as follows:</P>

<P>NOTE 13 &nbsp;&nbsp; COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES</P></B>

<P>Applied leases some of its facilities and equipment under
non-cancelable operating leases and has options to renew most leases, with
rentals to be negotiated. Applied also leases some office and general
operating facilities in California and Oregon under agreements that
provide for regular payments based on LIBOR or the relevant commercial
paper rate. In accordance with these agreements, Applied must maintain
compliance with covenants similar to those contained in its credit
facilities. At the end of these leases, Applied is required to acquire
the properties at their original cost or arrange for these properties
to be acquired by a third party. If the fair market value of the leased
properties declines below original cost, Applied will be contingently
liable under first-loss clauses for up to approximately $97 million. </P>

<P>Total rent expense was $80 million for fiscal 1998, $73 million for
fiscal 1999 and $105 million for fiscal 2000. Future minimum lease
payments at October 29, 2000 were: $102 million for fiscal 2001; $86
million for fiscal 2002; $71 million for fiscal 2003; $54 million for
fiscal 2004; $39 million for fiscal 2005; and $116 million thereafter.
</P>

<P>Applied has several agreements that allow it to sell accounts
receivable from selected customers at a discount to various financial
institutions. Receivable sales have the effect of increasing cash and
reducing accounts receivable and days sales outstanding. Discounting
fees were recorded in interest expense and were not material for fiscal
1998, 1999 or 2000. Accounts receivable sales under these agreements
were $499 million for fiscal 1998, $953 million for fiscal 1999 and
$1.5 billion for fiscal 2000. At October 29, 2000, $462 million of
these receivables remained outstanding and subject to limited recourse
provisions. Applied does not expect these recourse provisions to have a
material effect on its financial condition or results of operations. </P>

<B><P>Legal Matters</P>
</B>
<P>On June 13, 1997, Applied filed a lawsuit against Varian Associates,
Inc. (Varian), alleging infringement of several of Applied's patents
concerning physical vapor deposition (PVD) technology. Varian answered
the complaint by denying all allegations, counterclaiming for
declaratory judgment of invalidity and unenforceability and alleging
conduct by Applied in violation of antitrust laws. On July 8, 1997,
Varian filed a separate lawsuit against Applied alleging a broad range
of conduct in violation of federal antitrust laws and state unfair
competition and business practice laws. In September 2000, Applied and
Varian settled their disputes, and on October 3, 2000 Applied's claims
against Varian and Varian's claims and counterclaims against Applied
were dismissed with prejudice.</P>

<P>On July 7, 1997, Applied amended the patent infringement suit
against Varian described above to include Novellus Systems, Inc.
(Novellus) as a defendant as a result of Novellus' acquisition of
Varian's thin film systems PVD business. Applied seeks damages for past
infringement, a permanent injunction, treble damages for willful
infringement, pre-judgment interest and attorneys' fees. On June 23,
1997, Novellus filed a separate lawsuit against Applied, alleging
infringement by Applied of three PVD technology patents that were
formerly owned by Varian. Discovery has commenced in these actions. The
Court has scheduled trial of both cases for August 2001. Applied
believes it has meritorious claims and defenses and intends to pursue
them vigorously.</P>

<P>On April 17, 2000, Applied filed a lawsuit against Plasma Physics
Corp. (PPC) and Solar Physics Corp. (SPC). The lawsuit seeks a judicial
declaration that Applied's chemical vapor deposition equipment does not
infringe two patents owned by PPC and exclusively licensed to SPC
and/or that those patents are invalid or unenforceable. On July 31,
2000, PPC and SPC answered the complaint and filed a conditional
counterclaim alleging that Applied had contributed to or induced others
to infringe the two patents. PPC and SBC seek an injunction prohibiting
infringement by Applied and an award of costs, expenses and attorneys'
fees. The counterclaim is conditional because PPC and SPC have stated
that they will not sue Applied for infringement of the two patents if
the Court dismisses the lawsuit initiated by Applied for lack of
subject matter jurisdiction. The Court subsequently denied without
prejudice PPC and SPC's motion to dismiss the lawsuit for lack of
subject matter jurisdiction, but stated that PPC and SPC could renew
the motion to dismiss if appropriate after further discovery. No trial
date has been set. </P>

<P>In September 2000, Applied received notice from the Department of
Justice, Antitrust Division that it had begun an investigation into
Applied's licensing of technology. Although neither the extent nor the
outcome of this investigation can be determined at this time, Applied
does not believe that the outcome will have a material adverse effect
on its financial position or results of operations.</P>

<P>Applied is subject to various other legal proceedings and claims,
either asserted or unasserted, that arise in the ordinary course of
business. Although the outcome of these claims cannot be predicted with
certainty, Applied does not believe that any of these other existing

<P>*&#9;Income from continuing operations for fiscal 1999 included
one-time items, on an after-tax basis, of: $10,350 of income for the first
fiscal quarter, $8,054 of expense for the third fiscal quarter and
$32,544 of expense for the fourth fiscal quarter. Income from
continuing operations for fiscal 2000 included one-time items, on an
after-tax basis, of: $9,911 of income for the second fiscal
quarter.</P>

<P>**&#9;As discussed in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements, in fiscal 1999, Applied reversed its fiscal 1998 decision
to discontinue the operations of AKT. As a result, Applied reclassified
the prior period operating results of AKT to continuing operations and
reversed its charge for discontinuing AKT's operations. The
reclassifications had no effect on Applied's net income or total
earnings per share amounts as previously reported.</P>

<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">REPORT OF MANAGEMENT</P>
</B>
<P>Management is responsible for the preparation and integrity of the
consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K. The financial statements were prepared in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles appropriate in the
circumstances and, accordingly, include some amounts based on
management's best judgments and estimates. Financial information in
this Annual Report on Form 10-K is consistent with that in the
financial statements. </P>

<P>Management is responsible for maintaining a system of internal
business controls and procedures to provide reasonable assurance, at an
appropriate cost/benefit relationship, that assets are safeguarded and
that transactions are authorized, recorded and reported properly. The
internal control system is augmented by appropriate reviews by
management, written policies and guidelines, careful selection and
training of qualified personnel and a written code of business ethics
applicable to all employees of Applied and its subsidiaries. Management
believes that Applied's internal controls provide reasonable assurance
that assets are safeguarded against material loss from unauthorized use
or disposition and that the financial records are reliable for
preparing financial statements and other data and maintaining
accountability for assets.</P>

<P>The Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors, composed
solely of Directors who are not employees or officers of Applied, meets
periodically with the independent accountants, internal auditors and
management to discuss internal business controls, auditing and
financial reporting matters. The Committee reviews with the independent
accountants the scope and results of the audit effort. The Committee
also meets with the independent accountants without management present
to ensure that the independent accountants have free access to the
Committee.</P>

<P>The independent accountants, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, are engaged
to audit the consolidated financial statements of Applied and to
conduct such tests and related procedures as they deem necessary in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. The opinion of
the independent accountants, based upon their audits of the
consolidated financial statements, is contained in this Annual Report
on Form 10-K.</P>

<B><P>To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Applied Materials,
Inc.</P></B>

<P>In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the
accompanying index appearing under Item 14(a)(1) on page 22 present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Applied
Materials, Inc. and its subsidiaries at October 31, 1999 and October
29, 2000, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended October 29, 2000, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement
schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 14(a)(2) on page 22
presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth
therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated
financial statements. These financial statements and financial
statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management;
our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We
conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing
standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made
by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.</P>
