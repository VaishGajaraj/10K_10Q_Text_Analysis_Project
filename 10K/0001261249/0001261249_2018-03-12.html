Overview  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a forward-thinking women's healthcare company dedicated to fulfilling the unmet health needs of today's women. Twirla and our other
current potential product candidates are designed to provide women with contraceptive options that offer greater convenience and facilitate compliance. Our lead product candidate, Twirla&reg;,
also known as AG200-15, is a
once-weekly prescription combination hormonal contraceptive patch that is at the end of Phase&nbsp;3 clinical development. We completed the third of three Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trials for Twirla
in December 2016 and resubmitted our new drug application, or NDA, which was received by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, on June&nbsp;26, 2017 and acknowledged as a complete response
for FDA review on July&nbsp;27, 2017. In connection with the NDA resubmission, we were assigned Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, goal date of December&nbsp;26, 2017 by the FDA. On
December&nbsp;21, 2017, the FDA issued a complete response letter, or CRL, in response to the NDA resubmission for Twirla, which stated that the FDA could not approve our NDA in its present form due
to deficiencies related to the manufacturing process and facility for Twirla, and due to questions it had on the in vivo adhesion properties of Twirla and their potential relationship to our
phase&nbsp;3 clinical trial results. Under the FDA's regulations, we are entitled to request a Type&nbsp;A meeting with the FDA within 90&nbsp;days of receiving a CRL, and the FDA has a goal to
grant us a meeting date within 30&nbsp;days of the meeting request. We have submitted a request for a Type&nbsp;A meeting to the FDA to discuss the deficiencies in the Twirla NDA and the
regulatory path for approval of Twirla. We plan to provide an update on the outcome of the Type&nbsp;A meeting after we receive the official meeting minutes from the FDA and we will then be better
able to determine when we will resubmit our Twirla NDA. Our short-term goal is to establish a market-leading franchise in the U.S. hormonal contraceptive market, which had total market sales of
approximately $5.7&nbsp;billion in 2017. Over half of those sales were generated by branded products. Currently, there is only one other contraceptive patch available in the United States and we
believe it has limitations due to its dose and physical characteristics. Twirla is designed to address these limitations. We have developed a proprietary transdermal patch technology, called
Skinfusion&reg;, which is designed to provide advantages over the currently available patch and is intended to optimize patch adhesion and patient wearability. We believe there is an unmet
market need for a low-dose contraceptive patch that is designed to address the limitations of the existing patch, while increasing patient convenience and compliance in a non-invasive fashion. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twirla
is a combined hormonal contraceptive, or CHC, patch that contains the active ingredients ethinyl estradiol, or EE, which is a synthetic estrogen, and levonorgestrel, or LNG, which
is a type of progestin, a synthetic steroid hormone, both of which have an established history of efficacy and safety in currently marketed combination low-dose, oral contraceptives. Twirla is
designed using our proprietary Skinfusion technology to deliver both hormones over a seven-day period at levels comparable to currently marketed low-dose oral contraceptives. By delivering these
active ingredients over seven days, in a comfortable, convenient and easy-to-use weekly patch, Twirla is designed to promote ease of use and enhanced patient compliance. The patch is applied once
weekly for three weeks, followed by a week without a patch. If approved, Twirla will be packaged with three individually-wrapped patches per carton to provide for one 28-day cycle of therapy. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
have conducted a comprehensive clinical program, with completed Phase&nbsp;1, Phase&nbsp;2, and Phase&nbsp;3 trials enrolling over 4,100 women, over 3,500 of whom received
Twirla. Most recently, in December 2016, we completed a Phase&nbsp;3 trial, the SECURE clinical trial, in which we enrolled over 2,000 women for up to one year of treatment. In the Phase&nbsp;1
and Phase&nbsp;2 clinical trials, we demonstrated that Twirla delivers levels of both EE and LNG to the blood stream that are consistent with those delivered by current low-dose oral contraceptives.
Prior to the SECURE clinical trial, we completed two Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trials that enrolled over 1,900 women in the aggregate for up to 12&nbsp;months, and we demonstrated that Twirla
generally had comparable efficacy and tolerability to an </FONT></P>

low-dose oral contraceptive. In the SECURE clinical trial, we observed positive evidence of efficacy for Twirla based on use for up to one year. In our completed Phase&nbsp;3 trials to
date, over 1,000 women have received Twirla for 12&nbsp;months. Across all completed clinical trials, Twirla was generally well tolerated and had a favorable safety profile. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
April 2012, we filed a Section&nbsp;505(b)(2) NDA, for approval of Twirla by the FDA, which is required before marketing a new drug in the United States. Our 505(b)(2) NDA relies in
part on clinical trials that we conducted and in part on the FDA's findings of safety and efficacy from investigations for approved products containing the active ingredients and published scientific
literature for which we have not obtained a right of reference. In connection with this original submission of our NDA, the FDA indicated in a CRL, issued in February 2013, or the 2013 CRL, that our
NDA was not sufficient for approval as originally submitted. After multiple communications with the FDA, we received significant guidance as to what additional clinical development and other
activities needed to be completed prior to approval. In accordance with the FDA's advice and comments, we conducted an additional Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trial, the SECURE clinical trial, which was
initiated in 2014 and completed in December 2016. We announced the top-line results for the SECURE trial in January 2017. Based on the guidance that we received from the FDA in connection with our
discussions on clinical trial design, we believed that the results from the SECURE clinical trial would address all of the clinical issues raised in the 2013 CRL. In June 2017, we resubmitted our
Twirla NDA, which was accepted for review and assigned a PDUFA goal date of December&nbsp;26, 2017. On December&nbsp;21, 2017, the FDA issued a second CRL, or the 2017 CRL, indicating that our
resubmitted NDA could not be approved in its present form. The 2017 CRL identifies deficiencies relating to quality control adhesion test methods which are part of the manufacturing process for
Twirla. The 2017 CRL also noted that observations identified during a pre-approval inspection, or PAI, of a facility of our third-party manufacturer, Corium International&nbsp;Inc., or Corium, for
the Twirla NDA must be resolved. Lastly, the 2017 CRL questions the </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>in vivo</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> adhesion properties of Twirla and their potential relationship to the SECURE
phase&nbsp;3 clinical trial results. The 2017 CRL contains recommendations for developing manufacturing in-process tests for ensuring the quality and </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>in
vivo</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> adhesion of the commercial scale product as well as the finished drug specifications and release test method for adhesion. The 2017 CRL also recommends that we assess the </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>in vivo</I></FONT><FONT
SIZE=2> adhesion properties demonstrated in the SECURE clinical trial. Finally, the 2017 CRL recommends that we address the implications of clinical
trial subject patch compliance and the withdrawal and dropout rates. The 2017 CRL does not identify any specific issues relating to the safety of Twirla. Prior to receiving the 2017 CRL, we submitted
an amendment to our NDA on December&nbsp;1, 2017 in response to an information request from the FDA on the issues related to the quality control adhesion test methods cited in the 2017 CRL. In the
2017 CRL, the FDA acknowledged receipt of the amendment and stated that the amendment was not reviewed prior to the FDA's action. In addition, on November&nbsp;20, 2017 and December&nbsp;1, 2017,
Corium provided the FDA with responses to each of the observations made during the FDA's facility inspection, which included a PAI for Twirla. We believe that the Corium submissions along with our
December&nbsp;1, 2017 NDA amendment and the information we intend to provide to the FDA in advance of our Type&nbsp;A meeting will provide a basis for addressing the 2017 CRL. Under the FDA's
regulations, we are entitled to request a Type&nbsp;A meeting with the FDA within 90&nbsp;days of receiving a CRL, and the FDA has a goal to grant us a meeting date within 30&nbsp;days of the
meeting request. We have submitted a request for a Type&nbsp;A meeting to the FDA to discuss the deficiencies in the Twirla NDA and the regulatory path for approval of Twirla. We plan to provide an
update on the outcome of the Type&nbsp;A meeting after we receive the official meeting minutes from the FDA and we will then be better able to determine when we will resubmit our Twirla NDA. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consistent
with our previous NDA resubmission in 2017, we currently expect that our resubmission of the NDA responding to the 2017 CRL will be categorized as a Type&nbsp;2 resubmission
and receive a review period of six months from the date of resubmission of the NDA. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
January 2018, following our receipt of the 2017 CRL, we significantly scaled back our preparations for commercialization of Twirla, including commercial pre-launch and manufacturing
validation activities, pending our ability to address the 2017 CRL and receive approval of Twirla. However, if Twirla is approved, we intend to commercialize Twirla in the United States through a
direct sales force. Obstetricians and gynecologists, or ObGyns, contribute 51% of the U.S. CHC prescription volume, and Nurse Practitioners and Physician Assistants, or NP/PAs, who are often
affiliated with an ObGyn practice, contribute an additional 27% of the U.S. prescriptions. We anticipate that a targeted sales force focused initially on ObGyns, NPs, PAs and primary care providers
who comprise the top prescribers of contraceptives will be highly effective. We believe that we can address this market with a specialty sales force of approximately 70 to 100 representatives. We also
intend to augment our sales force through digital marketing and other techniques to market directly to patients. We will require additional capital to fully implement our commercialization plan for
Twirla, if approved. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
Skinfusion technology makes Twirla the first patch capable of delivering a contraceptive dose of LNG across the skin, allowing weekly application using a patch that is soft and
flexible and is designed to adhere well with low levels of skin irritation. We, along with Corium, our manufacturing partner, have made a significant investment in a proprietary process to manufacture
Twirla. We believe we have developed a robust process to reliably manufacture Twirla on a commercial scale. The materials produced for our clinical trials were manufactured using the same process that
we expect will be used for our commercial-scale manufacturing, and we have made a significant investment in equipment for commercial-scale manufacturing if Twirla is approved. Along with Corium, we
are enhancing our quality-control test methods in a way that we believe will address the issues identified by the FDA in both the 2017 CRL and the Corium facility inspection and that will allow us to
continue to use our current commercial manufacturing process for Twirla. We believe that the technical challenges and know-how involved in manufacturing, including proprietary chemistry, production to
scale and use of custom equipment and reproducibility, present significant barriers to entry for other pharmaceutical companies who might potentially want to replicate our Skinfusion technology. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
intellectual property represents an additional barrier to potential competitors. We have thirteen issued U.S. patents, eight of which cover Twirla and that we intend to list in the
Orange Book, the first of which expires in 2021 and the last of which expires in 2028, and five that provide additional coverage for other potential product candidates in our pipeline. The Orange Book
lists drug products, including related patent and exclusivity information, approved by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. If a patent is listed in the Orange Book, potential
competitors seeking approval of drug products under an Abbreviated New Drug Application, which provides for the marketing of a generic drug product that has the same active ingredients, dosage form,
strength, route of administration,
labeling, performance characteristics and intended use, among other things, of a previously approved product, or a 505(b)(2) application, for which the listed drug is a reference product, must provide
a patent certification in their application stating either that (1)&nbsp;no patent information on the drug product has been submitted to the FDA; (2)&nbsp;such patent has expired; (3)&nbsp;the
date on which such patent expires; or (4)&nbsp;such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. In
addition, we continue to prosecute additional patent applications relating to Twirla, as well as our other potential product candidates, both in the United States and internationally. The intellectual
property behind all of our potential product candidates in the pipeline and our Skinfusion technology consists of patent families developed and wholly-owned by us. There are no royalties or payments
owed to third parties on our Skinfusion technology or any of our product candidates. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition to Twirla, we plan to develop a pipeline of other new transdermal contraceptive products, including AG200-ER, which is a regimen designed to allow a woman to extend the
length of her cycle, AG200-SP, which is a regimen designed to provide shorter lighter periods, AG200-ER (SmP), which is a regimen designed to allow a woman to extend the length of her cycle and

menopause, at the average age of 51.3&nbsp;years. This is nearly half of a typical woman's lifespan and, for the typical woman, the majority of this time frame is spent trying to avoid pregnancy or
is characterized by no desire to become pregnant. Nearly half of the
pregnancies that occur each year in the United States are unplanned. The United States was the first country to approve a hormonal contraceptive, with the approval of the first contraceptive pill in
1960. The latest data from 2011 to 2013 from the Centers for Disease Control, or CDC, indicate that approximately 28% of women aged 15 to 44 use some form of hormonal contraception, which amounts to
approximately 17&nbsp;million U.S. women. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hormonal
contraceptives can be composed of synthetic estrogens and progestins. Contraceptives containing both estrogen and a progestin are referred to as CHCs, and contraceptives
containing only progestin are referred to as P-only. There are three synthetic estrogens approved in the United States for use in contraceptive products: EE, mestranol, and estradiol valerate. EE has
been available for over 40&nbsp;years and is the estrogen component in nearly all CHCs today. There are 10 different progestins that have been used in contraceptives sold in the United States. The
progestin component provides most of the contraceptive effect, while the estrogen component primarily provides cycle control, for example, minimizing bleeding or spotting between cycles. The progestin
exerts its contraceptive effect by inhibiting ovulation, or release of an egg from the ovary, and by thickening cervical mucus. Thickening cervical mucus helps to prevent sperm entry into the upper
genital tract. The estrogen component, in addition to providing cycle control, makes a small contribution to contraception by decreasing the maturation of the egg in the ovary. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hormonal
contraceptives are generally well-tolerated and are generally safer than pregnancy. A risk associated with hormonal contraceptives is a rare but serious adverse event called
venous thromboembolism, or VTE, which involves the formation of a blood clot in a vein. VTEs can be life-threatening, and typically present as either deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.
Evidence supports that the increased risk of VTE in CHC users is related to the estrogen dose and duration of use, with higher doses of estrogen being associated with a potentially increased risk of
VTE. Estrogen increases formation of clotting factors in the liver and decreases production of elements that promote breakdown of blood clots. Most experts believe that progestins on their own have
minimal to no impact on the clotting system, but some progestins, when combined with estrogen, can increase estrogen's effect on the clotting system. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
likelihood of a woman spontaneously developing a VTE is extremely low and the use of combination oral contraceptives, or COCs, increases the incidence only slightly, and less than </FONT></P>

Effectiveness of Hormonal Contraceptives  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purpose of FDA approval, contraceptive effectiveness is measured by a calculation called the Pearl Index, or PI, and its associated 95%
confidence interval, or CI. The PI is a measure of the rate of pregnancies over a specific period of time in a clinical trial and is expressed as the number of pregnancies per 100 woman years, or WY,
of use. Each cycle lasts 28&nbsp;days, so there are approximately 13 cycles in one year. The PI calculation typically includes all pregnancies for which conception is estimated to have occurred
while the subject was using the drug (i.e.,&nbsp;on-treatment pregnancies), but only includes cycles where the woman did not use backup contraception, such as a condom. The PI values from clinical
trials are affected by several factors, including differences in study design, increased sensitivity of early pregnancy tests, weight and body mass index, or BMI, of the study population, user
experience and inconsistent or incorrect use of the contraceptive method. In addition, there has been an observable trend in PIs for approved CHCs demonstrating an increase in the PIs over time,
believed to be related to changes in study design and study populations. The FDA has not established any regulatory guidance on specific parameters for an acceptable&nbsp;PI or CI to support
approval. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
contraceptive failure rates observed in clinical trials are generally lower than those seen once a CHC is approved and in use by a broad population, referred to as typical use,
without the close monitoring of a clinical trial setting. There is a large difference in pregnancy rates under conditions of perfect use, where the method is used following the directions exactly, and
typical use. For example, for CHCs, including oral contraceptives, the vaginal ring and the transdermal patch, the percent of women experiencing an unintended pregnancy during the first year of use is
0.3% for perfect use and 9.0% for typical use. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
U.S. hormonal contraceptive market recorded annual sales in 2017 of approximately $5.7&nbsp;billion, according to IMS Health. The CHC portion of the market, consisting of pills, a
transdermal patch and a vaginal ring, generates significantly greater prescription volume and sales compared to the P-only portion of the market, consisting of IUDs, injectables, implants, and P-only
pills. In 2017, IMS Health
reported total U.S. sales of $3.9&nbsp;billion for the CHC market and $1.8&nbsp;billion for the P-only market. Twirla is a CHC and, if approved, we believe it will compete primarily with products
in the CHC market. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
U.S. hormonal contraceptive market is a mature market, with many branded and generic products available. In the past 10&nbsp;years, the market growth was flat to declining as
measured by prescription volume, with the exception of a 4.8% increase in 2013 compared to 2012. Compared to 2016, prescriptions for hormonal contraceptives decreased by 3.7% in 2017. The average
annual growth rate in dollar sales for the five years ended December&nbsp;31, 2017 was 1.4% for the total hormonal contraceptive market and &#150;0.6% for the CHC market. Market growth in
gross sales is primarily due to price increases amongst branded products. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
believe there are two possible factors primarily affecting prescription volume in the contraceptive market. First, according to U.S. Census Bureau data and projections, the population
of women aged 15 to 44&nbsp;years has been growing at a rate of approximately 0.4% to 0.5% per year since 2011, increasing this population by 250,000 to 300,000 women per year. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second,
in 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the ACA, was signed into law, which,
among other things, requires all health plans, with limited exceptions, to cover certain preventive services for women with no cost-sharing, which means no deductible, no co-insurance and no
co-payments by the patient, effective August&nbsp;1, 2012. These services include those set forth in the Guidelines for Women's Preventive Services, or HRSA Guidelines, and adopted by the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services Health Resources and Services Administration. Contraceptive methods and counseling, including all FDA approved contraceptive methods as prescribed, are included
in the HRSA Guidelines. Since these new ACA provisions went into effect in August 2012, quarterly prescription volume growth for the CHC market rose from negative growth year-on-year to positive
growth between 4.0% and 5.0% for each of the six quarters following implementation. However, this appears to be a one-time phenomenon, as the market volume has declined on average 0.4% annually from
2014 to 2017. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During
the period following enactment of the ACA, generic oral contraceptives have shown the greatest growth, primarily at the expense of branded oral contraceptives. This is likely due
to the policies that were implemented by many managed care plans, which generally only provided generic oral contraceptives with no cost-sharing to the patient. The effect on non-oral products is less
clear, but prescription volume for the vaginal ring showed a 10.0% decline from 2013 to 2017, while the prescription volume for the patch increased by 30.0% over the same time period. In May 2015,
several government agencies, such as the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, the Department of Labor, or DOL, and the U.S. Department of Treasury, or Treasury, issued a clarification
in the form of an FAQ which clarified the requirements for coverage of contraceptives under the ACA. The FAQ states that plans and issuers must cover without cost-sharing at least one form of
contraception in each of the 18 current methods that the FDA has identified for women in its current </FONT></P>

Control Guide. The patch is identified as a specific method in the FDA Birth Control Guide, and therefore insurers must cover at least one patch product with no cost-sharing to the patient.
Because this clarifying guidance is applied for plan years (or in the individual market, policy years) beginning on or after 60&nbsp;days from the date of publication of the FAQs, patients did not
have the benefit of this clarification until their new plan year, which generally started in January 2016. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
January&nbsp;20, 2017, the administration signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions
from, or delay the
implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical
devices, among others. Congress also could consider subsequent legislation to repeal and replace elements of the ACA that are repealed. Additionally, in October 2017, the Department of Health and
Human Services, jointly with the Department of Labor and the Treasury, issued two interim rules outlining exemption processes for employers not wanting to offer contraceptive coverage based on their
religious beliefs or sincerely held moral convictions. While there is an injunction against the administration prohibiting it from implementing these rules, the ultimate outcome of that litigation
cannot be predicted. Therefore, it is difficult to determine the full effect of the ACA or any other healthcare reform efforts on our business. We will continue to monitor the healthcare reform
efforts and agency implementation. We believe the CHC market will maintain a long-term neutral annual growth rate. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
spite of the availability of generic contraceptives for over 25&nbsp;years, branded products have maintained a significant, though declining, share of the CHC market, with 50% of
dollar sales and 15% of prescriptions for 2017. Branded contraceptives in the CHC market have driven significant increases in the value of branded total prescriptions, or TRx. In the five years ended
December 2017, the average annual price increase among the top branded products was 11.8%. The average price per cycle, referred to as the wholesale acquisition cost, or WAC, for a single 28-day cycle
of the top branded products was $41.53 in 2006 and rose to $141.17 by December 2017. As of October 2014, the branded CHC transdermal patch (Ortho Evra) has been discontinued, and the generic CHC
transdermal patch (Xulane) is currently priced at $115.45 per cycle. The other non-oral form of CHC, the vaginal ring, is currently priced at $140.93 per cycle. We cannot predict whether the
manufacturers of branded products will continue to increase prices going forward, but we believe we will be able to set a WAC price for Twirla, if approved, that is comparable to other branded CHC
products at the time of launch. Based on IMS Health data, we estimate that each percentage point of market share of CHC total prescriptions in the United States currently represents approximately
$169&nbsp;million of annual gross sales potential for Twirla, if approved. </FONT></P>

approximately two to four pills per month, which increases the potential for unintended pregnancies. We believe that a patch can offer greater convenience than a pill, as it does not require daily
administration and, for certain women, could lead to greater compliance and ease of use. </FONT></P>

initial approved labeling for Evra indicated that it delivered a daily EE dose of 20 micrograms. Evra had rapid uptake in the contraceptive market and achieved a 10% share of the CHC market by
September 2003. Following FDA approval of Evra, users of Evra began to report thrombotic and thromboembolic events to the FDA. Johnson&nbsp;&amp; Johnson, the manufacturer of Evra, revised the Evra
labeling in November 2005 to
include information that EE&nbsp;exposure with Evra is 60% higher than that of an oral contraceptive containing EE of 35&nbsp;micrograms, based on area under the curve, a commonly-used metric for
measuring EE exposure in contraceptives. This information was ultimately included in a boxed warning and bolded warnings unique to the Evra label. The Evra market share declined rapidly following the
labeling changes, from a peak share of 11% in 2005, to 4% by the end of 2006, to 1.4% by the end of 2013, where it stabilized, with a 1.5% share of the market based on combined prescriptions for Evra
and its generic equivalent in 2014. In the past two years, the patch share of the CHC market grew slightly, with a 1.7%&nbsp;TRx share in 2016 and 1.8% TRx share in 2017. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
April 2014, Mylan&nbsp;Inc. announced the launch of Xulane&reg;, a generic version of Evra. Generic pharmaceutical products are the chemical and pharmaceutical equivalents
of the brand or a reference listed drug, or RLD. Generic drugs are bioequivalent to their reference brand name counterparts. Bioequivalence studies compare the bioavailability of the proposed drug
product with that of the RLD product containing the same active ingredients. Bioavailability is a measure of the rate and extent to which the active ingredient is absorbed from a drug product and
becomes available at the site of action. Under pharmacy dispensing rules governed by state law, depending on the state, if an automatic generic substitute is introduced, the pharmacist may dispense
either the prescribed product, or they may replace it with an equivalent generic without being required to inform the patient or healthcare professional. In addition, the FDA offers a 180-day
exclusivity period for generic products in specific cases. The first generic applicants to submit a substantially complete Abbreviated New Drug Application containing a paragraph&nbsp;IV
certification to a listed patent are protected from competition from other generic versions of the same drug for the 180&nbsp;days. As of December 2017, no other generic equivalents to Evra have
been introduced. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
FDA has maintained, in spite of the wording in the labeling for Evra and its approved generic, that none of the epidemiologic studies to date provides a definitive answer regarding
the relative risk of VTE with Evra compared to combined oral contraceptive use or whether the increased risk that some studies demonstrated is directly attributable to Evra. An advisory committee for
the FDA stated that the benefits of Evra outweigh the risks. In its denial of a Citizen's Petition calling for the withdrawal of Evra, the FDA followed the committee's recommendations stating that the
increased VTE risk does not warrant removal from the market, and that the labeling revisions to the Evra label provide a sufficient update and guidance on the interpretation of the epidemiologic data
about the risk of VTE with Evra. In spite of the labeling changes, and Johnson&nbsp;&amp; Johnson ceasing promotion of Evra in 2007, Evra and its generic equivalent generated $234&nbsp;million in
gross sales in 2017. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
believe that the rapid uptake and acceptance of Evra upon its introduction and its continued sales over the past several years demonstrate that there is an unmet market need for a
transdermal patch as a contraceptive option. Also, the epidemiologic data on VTE risk suggest that there is a need for a contraceptive patch that delivers both a low dose of EE similar to oral
contraceptives and a first or second generation progestin. </FONT></P>

Our Product Candidates  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twirla and each of our other potential product candidates utilizes our proprietary Skinfusion technology, which is designed to provide
advantages over the currently available patch. Skinfusion is designed to deliver contraceptive levels of hormones to the blood stream through the skin over a seven-day period. It is also designed to
optimize patch adhesion and patient wearability. Our lead product candidate is Twirla, a prescription CHC patch which contains both EE and LNG and is designed to deliver a low dose of EE and LNG
comparable to the total dose delivered with low-dose oral contraceptives. In addition to Twirla, we plan to develop a pipeline of other new transdermal contraceptive products, including AG200-SP,
which is a regimen designed to provide shorter, lighter periods; AG200-ER, which is a regimen designed to allow a woman to extend the length of her cycle; AG200-ER (SmP), which is a regimen designed
to allow a woman to extend the length of her cycle and experience shorter, lighter periods; and AG890, which is a progestin-only contraceptive patch intended for use by women who are unable or
unwilling to take estrogen. AG200-SP, AG200-ER, and AG200-ER&nbsp;(SmP) are intended to be Twirla line extensions that would expand the use of Twirla beyond its initial, approved use. In July 2016,
we began preparations for an initial Phase&nbsp;2 clinical trial examining the use of AG200-SP along with a smaller lower-dose combination ethinyl estradiol/levonorgestrel patch (SmP) in the fourth
week of the woman's cycle. The Phase&nbsp;2 clinical trial is aimed at identifying the optimal dose of the SmP, and will evaluate bleeding profiles, pharmacokinetic parameters, ovulation inhibition
and safety over three cycles of treatment with AG200-SP (SmP). We have decided to postpone the trial and will continue to evaluate the timing for initiating dosing of subjects for this Phase&nbsp;2
clinical trial, which is dependent on financial and other capital resources. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
National Institutes of Health, through a clinical trial agreement with us, conducted a Phase&nbsp;1/2 trial with AG890. The Phase 1/2 study was a multicenter study to evaluate the
pharmacokinetics, safety and mechanisms of potential contraceptive efficacy of AG890. The trial is complete and we continue to evaluate the findings. After we complete our evaluation, we may need to
perform additional patch development work to determine the optimal formulation and dose to advance to Phase&nbsp;3. Based upon a number of factors, including, but not limited to, our available
capital resources and feedback from the FDA, we continue to review the clinical path and budgetary requirements for each of AG200-SP, AG200-ER and AG890. </FONT></P>

Twirla Product Overview  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twirla is a CHC patch which contains both EE and LNG. Twirla is designed to address an unmet medical need for increased compliance and improved
ease of use as compared to oral contraceptives. A single Twirla patch delivers the active ingredients LNG and EE over a seven-day dosing interval, and thereby eliminates the need to take a daily pill
as is necessary with an oral contraceptive. Twirla uses a traditional 28-day contraceptive regimen, where one patch is applied weekly for three consecutive weeks and then there is a fourth, patch-free
week in each 28-day time period. Twirla may be applied to the buttock, abdomen or upper torso, but not the breast. In clinical trials reported to date, women most frequently chose the buttock and
abdomen for patch placement. The exact patch location needs to be rotated with each patch change. Twirla has demonstrated a therapeutically equivalent pharmacokinetic profile when worn on the buttock,
abdomen or upper torso. A drug's pharmacokinetic profile refers to the specific way in which a given drug is handled by the body over time, reflecting the particular patterns of absorption,
distribution and elimination of the drug in the body. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twirla
is designed to be highly appealing to patients as a method of contraception. The patch is round and made of a soft, flexible fabric, designed to flex with the movement of a
woman's body. Twirla is a matrix patch consisting of several layers of material that contain the active ingredients EE&nbsp;and LNG, as well as the inactive ingredients Dimethylsulfoxide, Ethyl
Lactate, Capric Acid and Lauryl Lactate, which are ingredients to assist in the transport of EE and LNG across the skin, and adhesives that enable adherence to the skin. The final top layer is the one
seen on the skin, and consists of a thin, cloth-like material consisting of only adhesive. There is a barrier formed between the inner portion of the patch, which contains the active ingredients, and
the outer portion of the patch, which only contains the adhesive. This barrier is intended to prevent the active and inactive ingredients from migrating to the peripheral portion of the patch, and
from breaking down the adhesive in that portion of the patch. Twirla is also designed to help prevent seepage of the adhesives from around the edge of the patch where it could collect dirt and leave a
sticky black ring on the skin. The six layers of the patch are integrated to create a patch which has a slim profile and is unobtrusive when applied. The results of multiple clinical trials suggest
that Twirla delivers the active ingredients needed for contraception over a seven-day period and that it remains adhered to the skin of most subjects for the full seven-day period, even under
conditions of heat, humidity, showering, exposure to water and vigorous exercise. </FONT></P>

employs our Skinfusion patch technology, resulting in a unique appearance and feel of the patch. Evra/Xulane does not utilize our Skinfusion technology; its active ingredients and
adhesives are dispersed to its edges. One frequent complaint about patches that do not utilize Skinfusion is that they collect dirt and lint and may leave a sticky black ring of residue on the skin
which can be difficult to remove. We do not have any direct comparison of the appearance of the patch on the skin at the end of seven days between Twirla and Evra/Xulane, but we believe, based on
anecdotal feedback from our clinical trial investigators, as well as on the differences in the design of the patches, that Twirla may have an advantage in this regard. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
have not performed a head-to-head comparison of Twirla to Evra/Xulane, however, a pharmacokinetic study that we conducted with Twirla was similar in design to the pharmacokinetic
study conducted with Evra that provided the information regarding the daily amount of EE delivered that is currently in the Evra/Xulane package insert. The figure below combines the results for
average EE concentrations from these two studies and suggests a comparison of the observed blood concentration of EE for Twirla versus Evra versus observed and estimated data for the pill. The lower
amount of EE delivered from Twirla as compared to Evra can be observed. If Twirla is approved by the FDA, we will not be able to make direct comparative claims regarding the safety, efficacy or
pharmacokinetics of Twirla and Evra/Xulane, since none of our completed clinical trials studied Twirla in a head-to-head comparison with Evra/Xulane. </FONT></P>

prodrug of norgestimate, a second generation progestin that has not demonstrated an increased risk of VTE independent of EE. We do not expect any meaningful clinical differences between Twirla and
Evra/Xulane based on the progestin component, but our market research with ObGyns has demonstrated that they perceive LNG to be one of the safest progestins available. </FONT></P>

Clinical Trials Completed prior to SECURE  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our clinical program includes three Phase&nbsp;1 studies, one Phase&nbsp;2 study, and three Phase&nbsp;3 studies, as well as other
supporting studies. In December 2016, we completed our third Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trial, SECURE, in response to FDA comments and guidance. In Phase&nbsp;1 and Phase&nbsp;2 clinical trials, we
demonstrated that Twirla delivers levels of both EE and LNG to the blood stream that are consistent with currently marketed low-dose oral contraceptives. In our Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trials
completed prior to SECURE, we demonstrated that Twirla was comparable to an approved low-dose oral contraceptive in two randomized studies, one that enrolled over 1,500 women over 12&nbsp;months and
the other that enrolled over 400 women over six months. Across all completed clinical trials, Twirla was generally well-tolerated and had a favorable safety profile. Because we relied, in part, on the
FDA's findings of safety and efficacy from investigations for approved products containing EE and LNG and published scientific literature for which we have not obtained a right of reference, we were
not required to conduct preclinical studies. In the pharmacokinetic study comparing Twirla to an approved low-dose oral contraceptive, results demonstrated that Twirla delivers a daily dose of EE that
results in estrogen exposure similar to low-dose oral contraceptives containing approximately 30 micrograms. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
two Phase&nbsp;3 trials completed prior to SECURE enrolled over 1,900 subjects to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Twirla. Each of these studies included an active comparator
arm with an approved low-dose oral contraceptive. The results of these studies demonstrated that Twirla was generally well-tolerated, with levels of adverse events generally comparable to those of
low-dose oral contraceptives. In these studies, subjects had a higher rate of self-reported compliance when using the patch as compared with the group using oral contraceptives. However, as discussed
further below, the FDA issued a CRL in response to our original marketing application for Twirla and requested an additional Phase&nbsp;3 study and additional chemistry manufacturing and control, or
CMC, information. The results of our prior clinical trials demonstrated that approximately only 3% of patches became completely detached from the skin of subjects during the seven-day period, and that
the patch generally
remained adhered to the skin even when exposed to normal daily activities and conditions such as showering, swimming and other forms of exercise, heat and humidity. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More
specifically, our safety population included subjects who received at least one dose of Twirla or COC. In this combined safety population of our two Phase&nbsp;3 trials completed
prior to SECURE, there were a total of 22 serious adverse events, or SAEs, of which 16 were from the Twirla cohort, which had approximately 2.3 times as many subjects as the oral contraceptive
comparator cohort. Three of these SAEs (0.2% of the overall Twirla safety population) were considered to be possibly related to the study drug and included one drug overdose with
Benadryl&reg;, one case of uncontrollable nausea and vomiting and one instance of upper extremity deep vein thrombosis. In addition to the SAEs described above, some subjects taking Twirla
experienced non-serious adverse events, such as nausea, headache, application site irritation and breast tenderness. Subjects receiving the oral contraceptive comparator also generally experienced
similar non-serious adverse events such as nausea, headache, and breast tenderness, though at different rates. We believe that Twirla will have a label consistent with all marketed low-dose CHC
products, which include class labeling that warns of risks of certain serious conditions, including venous and arterial blood clots, such as heart attacks, thromboembolism and </FONT></P>

as well as liver tumors, gallbladder disease and hypertension, and a boxed warning regarding risks of smoking and CHC use, particularly in women over 35&nbsp;years old who smoke. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
our Phase&nbsp;3 trials, the primary measure of efficacy is the Pearl Index, or PI, which is calculated based on the number of observed on-treatment pregnancies and total number of
on-treatment cycles during the study. Specifically, the PI is expressed as the number of pregnancies per 100 WY of use. The pooled PI value in the previously completed Phase&nbsp;3 trials for the
Twirla patch was 5.76 and for the combined oral contraceptive control arms was 6.72, which were higher than the range of 1.34 to 3.19 in pivotal studies conducted on products approved by the FDA in
the previous ten years. In addition, the upper bound of the associated confidence intervals were higher than those seen in clinical trials used for registration of other approved hormonal
contraceptives. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
believe that the results for both the patch and oral contraceptive control arms in the two Phase&nbsp;3 trials completed prior to SECURE were affected primarily by issues with study
conduct at several study sites, including rapid enrollment, which led to the inability to manage the study population, poor subject compliance, and high rates of loss to follow-up. In the larger of
our Phase&nbsp;3 trials completed prior to SECURE, 96 sites enrolled subjects, 60 of which had no on-treatment pregnancies. Nineteen percent of the on-treatment pregnancies reported during this
trial came from one site. This site represented approximately 8% of the randomized subject population. Thirty six percent of on-treatment pregnancies were reported at four of the 96 sites. These four
sites represented approximately 15% of the randomized subject population. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Experts
agree that the characteristic most likely to impact contraceptive failure and pregnancy rates is the subject's likelihood of using a method inconsistently or incorrectly.
Consistent with expert opinions, our analyses have suggested that the results for both the patch and oral contraceptive control arms in the two Phase&nbsp;3 trials completed prior to SECURE were
also affected in part by the study population, which comprised a disproportionately higher number of new users and minority subjects, known to be at higher risk of noncompliance and pregnancy, as
compared to the majority of other recent CHC clinical trials for products that have gained approval in the United States. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Individuals
who immediately switch from one hormonal contraception method to another, referred to as current users, or who have recently used another method of hormonal contraception,
are less likely to experience contraceptive failure than a new user because they are less likely to have inconsistent or incorrect use. These experienced subjects are often selected for trial
participation because their inclusion will lower failure rates. Indeed, many contraceptive trials have enrolled a high proportion of these subjects. Direct comparisons across multiple trials are
limited by differences in study design and population, as well as differences in definitions of user status; however, as shown in the table below, some comparisons are possible. For example, when
compared against trials that captured current hormonal contraceptive use, in the larger of our two Phase&nbsp;3 trials completed prior to SECURE, we had a lower proportion of subjects randomized to
receive Twirla that were current users, only 17.8%, reflecting a population with less experience using hormonal contraception, compared to Phase&nbsp;3 studies of two approved hormonal
contraceptives. When compared against trials that categorized subject experience more broadly by their use of hormonal contraception within the 6&nbsp;months prior to enrollment, our trial also had
a lower proportion of experienced subjects, only 44%. In both the COC and Twirla groups, new users had approximately three times the rate of noncompliance compared to experienced users, as verified
through blood tests, which did not detect levels of EE and LNG in the subjects' blood. Similarly, the pooled PI values from our two Phase&nbsp;3 trials completed prior to SECURE were more than twice
as high among new users compared to experienced users, and in the primary efficacy analysis population there were no pregnancies observed in current users of other hormonal contraception who
immediately switched to the patch upon entry into the trial. If Twirla is approved, we will not be able to make these comparisons between Twirla and the data for other contraceptives in the
marketplace. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, our two Phase&nbsp;3 trials completed prior to SECURE also included a higher proportion of black and Hispanic subjects than historical hormonal
contraceptive trials. Although the underlying reasons are not well-understood, several articles in medical journals, such as </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Contraception</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> and the </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>American Journal of
Obstetrics&nbsp;&amp; Gynecology</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, and in at least one report by HHS, state that contraceptive failure rates are highest in black and
Hispanic subjects. In our two Phase&nbsp;3 trials completed prior to SECURE, rates of laboratory-verified noncompliance were substantially higher in blacks and Hispanics compared to non-Hispanic
white subjects in the larger of our Phase&nbsp;3 trials, and as shown in the table below, there were substantially higher PI values in the black and Hispanic subpopulations than in non-Hispanic
white subjects. Additionally, as shown in the table the observed PI&nbsp;values were more dramatically increased for new users who were also black or Hispanic. </FONT></P>

2013 CRL and FDA Interactions  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February 2013, we received a CRL, or the 2013 CRL, from the FDA indicating that the results from our two completed Phase&nbsp;3 trials
would not be sufficient for approval, and the FDA proposed that we conduct an additional Phase&nbsp;3 trial. Among the comments expressed in the letter
were some regarding the PI values seen in the studies. Specifically, the FDA indicated that the PI values and the upper bound of the associated confidence intervals in the studies, in both the
subjects using the Twirla patch and the control arm using oral contraceptives, were higher than seen in clinical trials used for registration of other approved hormonal contraceptives. The confidence
interval is a range around a measurement that conveys how precise a measurement is. The FDA recommended that we conduct an additional Phase&nbsp;3 trial with a simplified clinical trial design and
improved study conduct, including enhanced site monitoring and data collection procedures. The FDA also requested that we study Twirla in a representative sample of U.S. women who are seeking hormonal
contraception, without enrollment restrictions based on demographic characteristics such as contraceptive user status, age, race, ethnicity, and body mass index, or BMI. The FDA also required
additional information relating to the laser etching of label information on each patch and required that the patch used in the new trial utilize the same etching as will be used for the commercial
product, in order to demonstrate that it does not adversely affect the performance of the patch. Furthermore, the FDA also requested in the CRL additional information on controls and release
specifications related to the patch, and manufacturing and control information related to the Drug Master File of one of the raw materials in Twirla. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
October 2013, we met with the FDA and received further guidance on requirements for our planned Phase&nbsp;3 trial. In addition, we had a follow-up written interaction with the FDA
in February 2014 and have received substantial written comments from the FDA in subsequent interactions. We enrolled the first subject in the SECURE clinical trial in the third quarter of 2014 and
completed the clinical trial in December 2016. The patches studied in the SECURE trial were laser etched using the same process as we anticipate for commercialization of Twirla, if approved. We also

The SECURE trial, our third Phase&nbsp;3 Clinical Trial  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECURE, our third Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trial, was a multicenter, single-arm, open-label, 13-cycle trial that evaluated the safety, efficacy
and tolerability of Twirla in 2032 healthy women, aged 18 and over, at 102 experienced investigative sites across the United States. The design and execution of SECURE was intended to address a number
of issues identified in the 2013 CRL, including but not limited to, improved clinical trial conduct and demonstration of efficacy as measured by an acceptable Pearl Index and related 95% confidence
interval in a representative sample of U.S. women who are seeking hormonal contraception, without enrollment restrictions based on demographic characteristics, such as contraceptive user status, age,
race, ethnicity, and BMI. The trial was designed
in consultation with the FDA, and comprised a number of stringent trial design elements, including exclusion of treatment cycles not only for use of back-up contraception but also for lack of sexual
activity. SECURE had broad entry criteria, placed no limitations on BMI or other demographic factors during enrollment, and enrolled a large and diverse population from the United States in order to
allow for efficacy to be assessed across different groups, as requested by the FDA. These entry criteria resulted in the inclusion of a substantial number of women with high BMI, who have frequently
been under-represented in past contraceptive studies. The efficacy measure for SECURE was the Pearl Index in an intent-to-treat population of subjects 35&nbsp;years of age and under. The FDA also
requested inclusion of pre-specified efficacy analyses related to BMI and body weight. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
began enrollment for the SECURE clinical trial in the fourth quarter of 2014, completed the clinical trial in December 2016, and announced top-line results in January 2017. A summary

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
believe that the efficacy results observed in SECURE were a reflection of the study population and the clinical trial design. As recommended by the FDA, we had broad entry criteria
for the trial and placed no limitations on BMI or other demographic factors during our enrollment. These entry criteria resulted in the inclusion of a substantial number of women with overweight and
obese BMI, who have frequently been under-represented in past contraceptive studies. As noted above, we observed that BMI had an effect on the efficacy results for Twirla. We believe these
observations require further analysis of whether there are other important factors at work here, such as race/ethnicity, user profile and compliance rates, which we believe may have impacted the
results of our prior Phase&nbsp;3 studies. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
2015, a meta-analysis entitled </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>"Effect of Obesity on the Effectiveness of Hormonal Contraceptives: an Individual Participant Data
Meta-Analysis,"</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> was published by several FDA authors and focused on the issue of obesity and effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives, or HC, by showing that obesity may
increase the risk of unintended pregnancy in women using HC. The FDA's Individual Participant Data meta-analysis of pivotal Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trials of CHCs suggested a 44% higher pregnancy rate
during use of combined oral contraceptives for obese women after adjusting for age and race. The authors of the paper highlighted the limitations of currently available prospective data due to
historical exclusion of obese women from contraceptive studies, calling for more data and additional analyses on obese women from Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trials to allow further assessment of the
effect of weight on the probability
of unintended pregnancy in women using HC. We believe our results from the SECURE clinical trial are consistent with the conclusions from the paper by the FDA scientists. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally,
the observed PI values were not only impacted by the number of pregnancies that occurred in the study, but also by the number of cycles included in the analysis, which
affects the denominator of the PI calculation. Cycles in which a subject was not sexually active, or in which a subject used a back-up method of contraception were not counted toward the number of
cycles included in the calculation of the PI. Many contraceptive clinical trials have not historically included these stringent requirements, in particular the exclusion of cycles for lack of sexual
activity, in the clinical trial design. As a result, we believe that the SECURE results reflect evidence of efficacy in a real-world population. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
highest PI for a hormonal contraceptive product approved by the FDA is 3.19 and the highest upper-bound of the 95% confidence interval of 5.03. As with all products, ultimate
approvability of a hormonal contraceptive is based on a risk/benefit assessment of the overall safety and efficacy profile of a product, not only a specific PI. For hormonal contraceptive trials, the
FDA generally evaluates safety and efficacy results of each individual study in the unique context of the study population and trial </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>design.
PIs for approved hormonal contraceptives have steadily risen over time as study design and populations have changed. Numerous factors have likely contributed to these increases, including more
frequent pregnancy testing with more sensitive tests, and decreases in study-drug adherence among study populations. As experts have noted, with the growing enrollment of more diverse, real-world
populations that appear to be increasingly representative of the likely actual users once the product is marketed, contraceptive trials are yielding efficacy results that are ever closer to actual use
contraceptive failure rates for methods requiring adherence. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
SECURE, we employed several measures to improve study conduct and, in particular, improve upon the loss to follow up rate. These measures included selecting a highly experienced
contract resource organization, or CRO, selecting experienced sites, increasing and improving monitoring and training, and the use of electronic diaries for subjects. We engaged Parexel International
Corporation, or Parexel, a CRO with substantial experience in contraception studies and excellent site monitoring capabilities, as the CRO for the SECURE trial. We actively participated in site
selection and in monitoring subject recruitment, and actively participated in site monitoring and oversight of Parexel's activities throughout the length of the trial. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding
site selection, the SECURE trial was conducted at 102 experienced sites in the United States. Sites were evaluated extensively through a data-driven approach assessing
performance on previous clinical trials, staffing with experienced study coordinators, demographics of potential study
subjects, and audit history. We also focused on ongoing training of study coordinators at the investigator meeting and study initiation visits, at coordinator's meetings, and through ongoing
communication. In addition, study sites that showed early trends toward higher rates of loss to follow-up or overall poor study management were re-trained. We also focused closely on subject
recruitment in order to achieve our goal of a population intended to provide reliable and generalizable data in the SECURE trial. We trained our sites to provide individualized attention to
recruitment of subjects who were most likely to adhere to the study protocol with respect to compliance, including correct patch application, timing of patch removal and replacement, electronic diary,
or e-diary, completion and study visits. Subjects were also advised through the informed consent process that noncompliance with study procedures may lead to discontinuation from the trial. Enrollment
of the SECURE trial was completed in October 2015. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
number of measures were also put in place in order to facilitate compliance with study procedures. To ensure subjects were adequately educated regarding their responsibilities during
the trial, a detailed subject teaching plan, along with materials, was developed and implemented, and subject education regarding the importance of compliance, including videos, brochures and
one-to-one education with study coordinators, was provided at repeated intervals throughout the study. A number of measures were put in place to support and monitor compliance through the study. One
key measure was the use of text message technology, which provided reminders to subjects for patch application, diary completion, and study visits. Phone contact with subjects between visits was also
part of the study protocol, which increased the frequency of contact with subjects throughout the study. Subjects with consistent poor compliance despite re-education by site personnel were
discontinued from the trial. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An
independent Pregnancy Review Committee composed of experts in early ultrasound was selected to review all pregnancies and determine on or off-treatment status, which affects the
numerator of the PI calculation. Accurate and timely pregnancy adjudication is critically important in order to reduce the likelihood that pregnancies which occur off treatment will be included by the
FDA during the review process. In order to avoid pre- or post-treatment pregnancies being included, every pregnancy was assessed via ultrasound as soon as possible and full data was collected
regarding the relationship of the pregnancy to the subject's use of Twirla. We did not have an independent Pregnancy Review Committee for our previous clinical trials. </FONT></P>

December 2016, we completed the SECURE clinical trial, in which we enrolled over 2,000 women for up to one year of treatment. We announced top-line data in early January 2017. In
March 2017, at our request, we met with the FDA to share preliminary data from the SECURE clinical trial, including key safety data and BMI-related efficacy findings, and to seek FDA input as to
whether the SECURE clinical trial results constituted a basis for addressing the clinical deficiencies cited in the 2013 CRL. We also requested feedback on whether the proposed Twirla NDA content
would meet the FDA's requirements for submission. While the FDA did provide us with feedback on our proposed submission, the Agency did not provide any feedback on whether the results of the SECURE
clinical trial and the contents of the planned, resubmitted NDA would be sufficient to obtain regulatory approval of Twirla.
In June 2017, we resubmitted our NDA for Twirla, which was assigned a target PDUFA goal date of December&nbsp;26, 2017. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December&nbsp;21, 2017, after completion of its review of our Twirla NDA, the FDA issued the 2017 CRL and informed us that our resubmitted
NDA could not be approved in its present form. The FDA's reasons for issuing the 2017 CRL related to cited deficiencies in the manufacturing process for Twirla and questions about our clinical in vivo
adhesion properties. More specifically, the 2017 CRL identifies deficiencies relating to:</FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
2017 CRL does not identify any specific issues relating to the safety of Twirla. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior
to receiving the 2017 CRL, we submitted an amendment to our NDA on December&nbsp;1, 2017 in response to an information request from the FDA on the issues related to the quality
control adhesion test methods cited in the 2017 CRL. In the 2017 CRL, the FDA acknowledged receipt of the amendment and stated that the amendment was not reviewed prior to the FDA's action. In
addition, on November&nbsp;20, 2017 and December&nbsp;1, 2017, Corium provided the FDA with responses to each of the observations made during the FDA's facility inspection. We believe that the
Corium submissions along with our December&nbsp;1, 2017 NDA amendment and information we intend to provide to the FDA prior to our Type&nbsp;A meeting will provide a basis for addressing the 2017
CRL. Under the FDA's regulations, we are entitled to request a Type&nbsp;A meeting with the FDA within 90&nbsp;days of receiving a CRL, and the FDA has a goal to grant us a meeting date within
30&nbsp;days of the meeting request. We have submitted a request for a Type&nbsp;A meeting to the FDA to discuss the deficiencies in the Twirla NDA and the regulatory path for approval of Twirla.
We plan to provide an update on the outcome of the Type&nbsp;A meeting after we receive the official meeting minutes from the FDA and we will then be better able to determine when we will resubmit
our Twirla NDA. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to Twirla, our potential product pipeline consists of two classes of product candidates: Twirla line extensions and other
transdermal contraceptive product candidates. These potential product candidates are designed to address market needs and offer additional non-daily contraceptive options. Based on the results of our
market research on line extension regimen concepts conducted in December 2016, we believe that our potential line extension product candidates are commercially viable and could garner a share of the
contraceptive market. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
hormonal contraceptive market has a long history of manufacturers successfully using line extensions to extend the lifecycle of a brand, often by gaining additional exclusivity
periods for the product extension under the provisions of the Hatch-Waxman Act and/or with additional patents. Our lifecycle strategy with Twirla is to introduce line extensions that will have
exclusivity for some time period, either due to our intellectual property estate, or due to Hatch-Waxman exclusivity. The line extensions in our pipeline include using our Skinfusion technology to
allow a 28-day regimen where women will experience shorter, lighter withdrawal bleeding, as well as extending the cycle beyond the typical 28-day regimen to allow women to experience fewer withdrawal
bleeds each year. In addition, the potential line extension product candidates in our pipeline will utilize a unique aspect in the regimen, where a smaller patch, or SmP, that delivers a lower dose of
both EE and LNG will be worn during the final seven days of each cycle, rather than having a patch-free week, to allow for withdrawal bleed while minimizing hormonal fluctuations and potentially the
side effects that accompany changes in hormone levels. These regimens are protected by patents issued to us in 2015. A study to examine the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the SmP will be
required prior to advancing the potential line extension product candidates through clinical development. In July 2016, we began preparations for an initial Phase&nbsp;2 clinical trial examining the
use of AG200-SP along with a smaller lower-dose combination ethinyl estradiol/levonorgestrel patch (SmP) in the fourth week of the woman's cycle. We have decided to postpone the trial and will
continue to evaluate the timing for initiating dosing of subjects for this Phase&nbsp;2 clinical trial, which is dependent on additional financial and other capital resources. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
Twirla line extensions include the following:</FONT></P>

withdrawal bleeding and thus have fewer periods per year. There are several currently approved oral contraceptives that provide an 84- or 91-day extended cycle regimen. However, there is no approved
contraceptive patch product offering an extended cycle regimen. AG200-ER is a contraceptive patch which is designed to address the limitations of the currently approved extended regimen oral
contraceptives by providing a more convenient, weekly dosing schedule. AG200-ER utilizes the same drug product as Twirla during the active phase of the cycle. We are currently evaluating the optimal
cycle length to advance into Phase&nbsp;3 clinical development. </FONT><FONT SIZE=2>

AG200-SP may also provide benefit in patients with sensitivity to abrupt changes in hormone levels. Oral contraceptives that use a shortened hormone-free interval, or SHFI, by delivering hormones
beyond 21&nbsp;days currently comprise 42% of U.S. branded TRx volume, demonstrating high acceptability among patients and providers. AG200-SP is designed to provide a simplified 28-day regimen
through use of the same drug product as Twirla for the first three weeks of the cycle, and a smaller lower-dose patch, or SmP, </FONT></DD></DL>

breastfeeding or who are at greater risk of VTE, such as women who smoke, are over 35&nbsp;years of age, or who are obese. Currently, the P-only market consists of pills and several non-oral
options, including IUDs, implants, and injections. AG890 is intended to fulfill an unmet medical need for a non-daily, easily reversible form of contraception in the P-only market. We have conducted a
Phase&nbsp;1 clinical trial with AG890. In addition, the National Institutes of Health, through a clinical trial agreement with us, conducted a Phase <SUP>1</SUP>/<SMALL>2</SMALL> trial with AG890. The Phase
<SUP>1</SUP>/<SMALL>2</SMALL> study was a multicenter study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, and mechanisms of potential contraceptive efficacy of AG890. The trial is complete and continue to evaluate
the findings. Once we have completed our analysis of the data, it is possible that additional patch development work for dose selection may be required, including additional Phase&nbsp;1 and
Phase&nbsp;2 studies to determine the optimal formulation and dose to advance to Phase&nbsp;3. </FONT></DD></DL>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We

capital resources and feedback from the FDA, we continue to review the clinical path and the budgetary requirements for each of these three potential product candidates. Substantially all of our
resources are currently dedicated to developing and seeking regulatory approval for Twirla. We will require additional capital to advance the development of our other potential product candidates. </FONT></P>

Twirla Commercialization Strategy  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January 2018, following our receipt of the 2017 CRL, we significantly scaled back our preparations for commercialization of Twirla, including
commercial pre-launch and manufacturing validation activities, pending our ability to address the 2017 CRL and receive approval of Twirla. However, if Twirla is approved, we expect to build a sales
and marketing infrastructure in the United States to support the launch of Twirla for contraception. We anticipate that a targeted sales force focused initially on ObGyns, NPs, PAs and primary care
providers who comprise the top prescribers of contraceptives will be highly effective. Outside the United States, in the future we may decide to commercialize Twirla, if approved, by entering into
third-party collaboration agreements with pharmaceutical partners. We will require additional capital to fully implement our commercialization plan for Twirla, if approved. </FONT></P>

Twirla Promotion Strategy  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have employed several key strategies during the development of Twirla to prepare us for the launch of Twirla. These
include:</FONT></P>

</UL>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prescribing
in the CHC category is primarily driven by ObGyns, who write 51% of CHC prescriptions. In addition, NPs and PAs, who are often affiliated with an ObGyn practice but can also
be in a primary care setting, write 27% of all CHC prescriptions. The ObGyns, NPs and PAs combine to write 72% of total CHC prescriptions. In addition, 34% of all prescriptions written by ObGyns are
for contraceptives. We plan to focus the promotion of Twirla on these key prescribers and other key customer groups, including consumers and commercial managed care plans. We believe that we can
deploy a focused sales force effort targeting the approximately 22,000 prescribers responsible for 80% of branded CHC prescriptions. We believe that this universe of branded prescribers can be covered
adequately by a specialty sales force of between 70 and 100 total representatives. In areas of the country where it is not efficient to deploy a sales representative, remote promotion can be used to
reach these prescribers. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
plan to deploy patient promotion at the launch of Twirla, both in the physician's office, and through targeted media campaigns. We plan to use both branded and unbranded campaigns to
create awareness of Twirla among consumers. We believe there are cost-effective means to reach our target demographic of females aged 18 to 34&nbsp;years, the so-called Millennials, who engage in
online activities to a high degree and are more likely to seek health information online and through social networks.
Traditional mass-market direct-to-consumer advertising on television may not be required to reach these consumers. Marketing tactics aimed at today's female consumer need to be optimized for mobile
technology, because smartphones and text messaging are the preferred means of communication. We believe that a focused consumer promotion plan that uses digital media and other mass-market advertising
vehicles will generate consumer awareness and demand for Twirla if approved. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Managed
care plans have traditionally used differential co-pays to attempt to drive patients to use either generic products or products for which they have a contract with the
manufacturer. Many plans encourage patients to obtain their branded contraceptives through mail-order, incentivizing them with a 90-day co-pay that is often less on a per-month basis than that for a
30-day supply. Most manufacturers of contraceptive brands offer a coupon to patients covered by non-governmental payors to offset the difference in co-pay between a generic and Tier&nbsp;2 or
Tier&nbsp;3 for their promoted brands. These co-pay coupons are a useful tactic to overcome barriers to initiating therapy in such patients. When used in conjunction with product samples given out
by the physician, a co-pay coupon often allows the patient to then fill their first prescription for free or at a steep discount and limits the out of pocket expenditure for the patient for several
months. This co-pay assistance creates brand loyalty, particularly for a brand where there is no generic alternative. We believe that we will be able to use free product </FONT></P>

and co-pay coupons or vouchers at the time of Twirla's launch to drive use of the product by patients covered by non-governmental payors while we are negotiating contracts with select
commercial health plans and awaiting formulary review. In addition, we believe the enactment of the ACA, and specifically the requirements for contraceptive coverage required by the ACA, provides a
favorable managed care environment for Twirla. The ACA requires all insurers to provide at least one product in each of the 18 methods referenced in the FDA Birth Control Guide with no cost-sharing to
the patient, including no co-pays, coinsurance, or deductibles. The FDA Birth Control Guide lists "Patch" as a unique method, therefore insurers must provide access to at least one contraceptive patch
product with no cost-sharing to the patient. Currently, there is only one other patch product available on the market, Xulane (the generic version of Ortho Evra), and we believe the safety and
tolerability profile of Twirla, if approved, will be superior to that of Xulane. Therefore, we believe Twirla will be well-positioned to be the no-cost patch option on formulary, either based on its
clinical profile, or based upon negotiated rebates and discounts. In addition, we expect to be able to provide co-pay assistance in the form of a coupon for patients on plans where Twirla requires a
co-pay. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
January&nbsp;20, 2017, the administration signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions
from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of
pharmaceuticals or medical devices, among others. Congress also could consider subsequent legislation to repeal and replace elements of the ACA that are repealed. Additionally, in October 2017, the
Department of Health and Human Services, jointly with the Department of Labor and the Treasury, issued two interim rules outlining exemption processes for employers not wanting to offer contraceptive
coverage based on their religious beliefs or sincerely held moral convictions. While there is an injunction against the
administration prohibiting it from implementing these rules, the ultimate outcome of that litigation cannot be predicted. Therefore, it is difficult to determine the full effect of the ACA or any
other healthcare reform efforts on our business. We will continue to monitor the healthcare reform efforts and agency implementation. While there is uncertainty about the specific effects of
healthcare reform, we expect to be able to compete in either a managed care environment that maintains elements of the ACA that require contraceptive coverage or an environment that requires
negotiated rebates and discounts. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two
of our market research studies have included an allocation exercise to estimate the potential uptake of Twirla and peak market share. In both of these studies, ObGyns and NPs
indicated their allocation of contraceptive prescriptions before and after reviewing a product profile like Twirla that reflects the safety and efficacy results from our SECURE clinical trial. In the
2010 study, which was conducted prior to the implementation of the ACA, ObGyns estimated use of a product like Twirla in 17% of their CHC patients. A proprietary calibration model developed by the
research firm was applied to the peak share estimate, to adjust for physician overstatement, resulting in an estimated peak market share of 9% of the CHC market. In the most recent study completed in
December 2016,
ObGyns and NP/PAs estimated use of Twirla in 22% of their CHC patients, which was also calibrated to adjust for overstatement, resulting in an estimated peak market share of 14% of the CHC market. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even
with the evolving healthcare landscape, we continue to believe a peak CHC market share of 9% can be achieved with Twirla within seven years of launch, allowing us time to establish
a presence in the CHC market and to overcome any perceptions or barriers among prescribers due to the past history of Evra and to account for potential changes in the ACA and overall healthcare
landscape. </FONT></P>

Competition  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The industry for contraceptive products is characterized by intense competition and strong promotion of proprietary products. While we believe
that our Skinfusion technology provides us with a competitive advantage, we face potential competition from many different sources, including large pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical
and generic drug companies, and medical device companies. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing products and new products that may become
available in the future. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
face competition from a variety of non-permanent birth control products. There are non-hormonal barrier methods, such as the contraceptive sponge, diaphragm, cervical cap or shield
and condoms. Then, there are hormonal methods, which is the category for our potential product candidates, such as oral contraceptives, injections, implants, hormonal IUDs and vaginal ring and
transdermal contraceptive products. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although
there are over 200 CHC products, including brands and generics, available on the market today, 52.2% of the total market sales, or $2.0&nbsp;billion in 2017, consisted of
sales of just eight branded products. Our potential competitors include large, well-established pharmaceutical companies, and specialty pharmaceutical sales and marketing companies. The product with
the highest dollar sales in the CHC market for the 12&nbsp;months ending December 2017 was Nuvaring&reg;, marketed by Merck, the only contraceptive vaginal ring available on the market, with
over $822&nbsp;million in sales for 2017. The Loestrin&reg; franchise, marketed by Allergan (formerly known as Actavis), consisting of three oral contraceptives, Minastrin&reg; 24,
LoLoestrin&reg; and Taytulla&reg;, totaled approximately $853&nbsp;million in sales in 2017. Beyaz&reg;, Yaz&reg;, Yasmin&reg; and Natazia&reg;
marketed by Bayer totaled over $145&nbsp;million in sales in 2017. Although not a branded product, Xulane, the generic to Ortho Evra and the only patch currently available on the market, generated
$233&nbsp;million in sales in 2017 for Mylan. Additionally, several generics manufacturers currently market and continue to introduce new generic contraceptives, including Sandoz, Glenmark, Lupin,
Amneal and Mylan. Based on the market experience of other non-oral CHC dosage forms, including Evra and Nuvaring, we believe there is a continuing demand for an innovative transdermal contraceptive
patch that can provide convenience in a low-dose transdermal format. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There
are other contraceptive products, recently approved or in development that may compete with Twirla and our other potential product candidates. Balcoltra&#153; from Avion
Pharmaceuticals, an oral contraceptive, was approved on January&nbsp;9, 2018. Other companies that have new contraceptive products in various stages of development include Bayer, with a
contraceptive patch
and a P-only vaginal ring, both in Phase&nbsp;3 development. Allergan has a P-only ring for which they received a CRL from the FDA, and an additional vaginal ring. This ring has been submitted for
FDA review and is a 12-month vaginal ring that was developed by the Population Council for use in the developing world. In the past few years, some of the large pharmaceutical companies such as
Johnson&nbsp;&amp; Johnson, Pfizer, and Teva have dissolved their women's health specialty marketing and sales teams, and Bayer has shifted their focus away from their CHC products to their IUD
franchise. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
are aware of only one other CHC transdermal patch in development. This patch is being developed by Bayer, and contains the active ingredients EE and gestodene, a third-generation
progestin. Bayer has stated that their gestodene patch is small, round, and transparent, and delivers a daily EE dose comparable to a 20 microgram EE oral contraceptive. Phase&nbsp;3 studies of the
Bayer gestodene patch began in 2004, and they completed a Phase&nbsp;3 efficacy trial in the United States in December 2010. Bayer also completed Phase&nbsp;3 efficacy trials in the European
Union, or E.U., and Latin America in September 2011, submitted a marketing application to the E.U. in September 2012, and received approval to market the gestodene patch in the E.U. in February 2014.
At the time of the E.U. submission, Bayer reported that they were in talks with the FDA regarding a U.S. submission, but there has been no further public information regarding a U.S. submission or
approval, and the most recent Bayer pipeline information does not list the gestodene patch. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
date, there are no contraceptives containing gestodene available in the United States. We are aware that Wyeth was developing oral contraceptives containing gestodene in the late
1980s, with an NDA filed for an oral contraceptive containing gestodene and EE in 1988, and Wyeth planned filing an NDA for a second oral contraceptive containing gestodene in 1991. These products
were never approved, and in a Wyeth pipeline report from 1996, there was no mention of any gestodene-containing product candidates among its contraceptives in development. Although not available in
the United States, gestodene has been widely used outside the United States for a number of years. As with other third generation progestins, epidemiologic studies have reported a two-fold increase in
risk of VTE with contraceptives containing gestodene compared to those containing LNG. We believe that if Bayer were to obtain FDA approval for the gestodene patch, the approved labeling may contain
the same language that products containing third generation progestins have, which states that these </FONT></P>

Manufacturing  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not own any manufacturing facilities. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on a third party for the manufacture of our
product candidates for clinical trials, as well as for commercial manufacture if any of our potential product candidates receive marketing approval. In 2006, we entered into an exclusive agreement
with Corium to develop Twirla using our Skinfusion technology, and also for AG890, which is a P-only contraceptive patch in Phase&nbsp;1/2 of clinical development. Our Corium agreement is an
exclusive arrangement until Corium has commercially produced a significant, agreed-upon quantity of patches, currently projected to occur no earlier than five years following commercial launch of
Twirla. Pursuant to the terms of our agreement, Corium is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain sufficient manufacturing capabilities to supply the quantities of Twirla required
for its initial commercial launch and commercial sales thereafter. Corium needs to complete the validation of the commercial manufacturing process for Twirla, if approved, and potentially further
expand its manufacturing capabilities, in order to be capable of supplying projected commercial quantities of Twirla, if approved. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
discussed in more detail above, the 2017 CRL identified deficiencies relating to quality control adhesion test methods which are part of the manufacturing process for Twirla. The 2017
CRL also noted that observations identified during a pre-approval inspection, or PAI, of Corium's facility for the Twirla NDA must be resolved. On November&nbsp;20, 2017 and December&nbsp;1, 2017,
Corium provided the FDA with responses to each of the observations made during the FDA's facility inspection, which included a PAI for Twirla. We believe that the Corium submissions along with our
December&nbsp;1, 2017 NDA amendment will provide a basis for addressing the 2017 CRL. Along with Corium, we are continuing to enhance our quality control test methods that were submitted in December
2017 in a way that we believe will address the issues identified by the FDA in both the 2017 CRL and the Corium facility inspection and that will allow us to continue to use our current commercial
manufacturing process for Twirla. We expect the validation and expansion of the commercial-scale manufacturing process to be completed in coordination with our other planned commercialization
activities. Corium is responsible for all aspects of Twirla manufacturing. </FONT></P>

Agreement with Corium  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to our manufacturing agreement, Corium's exclusive right to manufacture Twirla and AG890 extends until Corium has commercially produced
a significant, agreed-upon quantity of patches, currently projected to occur no earlier than five years following commercial launch of Twirla, at which point the agreement will expire. Under the terms
of our agreement, we will pay Corium a defined price per finished patch, whether used for samples or commercial sale. We will owe no royalties to Corium in connection with the production of finished
patches. The contract may be terminated by either party for the other party's uncured material breach. Following the end of the exclusivity period, if we were to seek a second source of supply, we
would be required to obtain FDA approval through an NDA supplement for an additional manufacturing sites. The process of acquiring a second source of supply and obtaining FDA approval generally takes
two years or more and would require us to make substantial investments in new facilities and equipment. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under
our agreement, Corium has performed process development and manufacturing of Twirla for each of our clinical trials. For the development work performed, we paid Corium for time and
materials related to the achievement of certain development goals. To date, we have made approximately $1.7&nbsp;million of milestone payments to Corium, all of which were paid between the years
2006 and 2009. Corium is not eligible for any milestone payments in the future. During 2012, we paid Corium an aggregate of $3.5&nbsp;million towards leasehold improvements incurred by Corium to its
facilities to provide for adequate manufacturing space for our product candidates. </FONT></P>

Reimbursement  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Managed care plans have traditionally used differential co-pays to attempt to drive patients to use either generic products or products for
which they have a contract with the manufacturer. Typically, a managed care plan's formulary is organized into between three and six tiers. Each tier is then associated with a set range of co-pay
amounts, with products in the lower tiers having a lower co-pay. Many plans encourage patients to obtain their branded contraceptives through mail-order, incentivizing them with a 90-day co-pay that
may be less on a per-month basis than that for
a 30-day supply. Contraceptive brands are generally placed on Tier&nbsp;2 only if there is a contract with the plan, although there are a few plans that place several branded products on
Tier&nbsp;2. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior
to May 2015, managed care plans have individually interpreted the requirement for coverage of contraceptives under the ACA. Some plans have designated that all contraceptives
containing the same progestin are equivalent, and therefore only cover a select few products containing each progestin, usually the least expensive generics, with no co-pay. Other plans have defined
contraceptive methods into categories such as "hormonal", "emergency contraception", and "barrier methods", and they cover just one product for each method with no co-pay. In May 2015, a clarification
in the form of an FAQ was issued by the applicable government agencies (HHS, DOL, and Treasury) which clarified the requirements for coverage of contraceptives under the ACA. The FAQ states that plans
and issuers must cover without cost-sharing at least one form of contraception in each of the 18 methods the FDA has identified for women in its current Birth Control Guide. The patch is identified as
a specific method in the FDA Birth Control Guide, and therefore insurers must cover at least one patch product with no cost-sharing to the patient. Because this clarifying guidance is applied for plan
years (or in the individual market, policy years) beginning on or after 60&nbsp;days from the date of publication of the FAQs, patients did not have the benefit of this clarification until their new
plan year, which generally started in January 2016. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
January&nbsp;20, 2017, the administration signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions
from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of
pharmaceuticals or medical devices, among others. Congress also could consider subsequent legislation to repeal and replace elements of the ACA that are repealed. Additionally, in October 2017, the
Department of Health and Human Services, jointly with the Department of Labor and the Treasury, issued two interim rules outlining exemption processes for employers not wanting to offer contraceptive
coverage based on their religious beliefs or sincerely held moral convictions. While there is an injunction against the administration prohibiting it from implementing these rules, the ultimate
outcome of that litigation cannot be predicted. Therefore, it is difficult to determine the full effect of the ACA or any other healthcare reform efforts on our business. We will continue to monitor
the healthcare reform efforts and agency implementation. </FONT></P>

FDA Regulation  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. The
process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and
financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a
variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA's refusal to approve pending NDAs, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold or termination, issuance of Warning,
Untitled, or Cyber Letters, requests for product recalls, product seizures or detention, total or partial suspension or restriction of production, marketing or distribution, injunctions, fines,
debarment, refusal to allow the import or export of product, adverse publicity, modification of promotional materials or labeling, refusals of government contracts, exclusion from participation in
federal and state healthcare programs, restitution, disgorgement, imprisonment, consent decrees and corporate integrity agreements, or civil or criminal penalties. </FONT></P>

Clinical Trials  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clinical trials involve the administration of an investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in
accordance with cGCP requirements, which includes the requirements that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial, and the review
and approval of the study by an IRB. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the trial procedures, the parameters to be used in
monitoring safety and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated and a statistical analysis plan. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as
part of the IND. In addition, an IRB for each clinical trial site participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences, and the IRB must
continue to oversee the clinical trial while it is being conducted, including any changes. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Human
clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined. In Phase&nbsp;1, the drug is initially introduced into healthy human
subjects or subjects with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an initial indication of
its effectiveness. In Phase&nbsp;2, the drug typically is administered through controlled studies to a limited subject population with the target disease or condition to identify possible adverse
effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the drug for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. In
Phase&nbsp;3, the drug is administered to an expanded subject population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in two adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to generate
enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product candidate for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product candidate and to provide adequate
information for the labeling of the product candidate. In the case of a 505(b)(2) NDA, which is a marketing application in which sponsors may rely on investigations that were not conducted by or for
the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted, some of the above-described studies and
preclinical studies may not be required or may be abbreviated. Bridging studies may be needed, however, to demonstrate the applicability of the studies that were previously conducted by other sponsors
to the drug that is the subject of the marketing application. In addition to the above traditional kinds of data required for the approval of an NDA, the 21st&nbsp;Century Cures Act, provides for
FDA acceptance of new kinds of data such as such as patient experience data, real world evidence for already approved products, and, for appropriate indications sought through supplemental marketing
applications, data summaries. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
manufacture of investigational drugs for the conduct of human clinical trials is subject to FDA product manufacturing requirements. Investigational drugs and active pharmaceutical
ingredients imported into the United States are also subject to regulation by the FDA relating to their labeling and distribution. Further, the export of investigational drug products outside of the
United States is subject to regulatory requirements of the receiving country as well as U.S. export requirements under the FDCA. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Progress
reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and the IRB and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Information

suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or
terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB's requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected
serious harm to subjects. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board
or committee. This group regularly reviews accumulated data and advises the study sponsor regarding the continuing safety of trial subjects, potential trial subjects, and the
continuing validity and scientific merit of the clinical trial. We may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives or competitive climate. </FONT></P>

U.S. Marketing Approval  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical and clinical studies, including negative or
ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product's chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted
to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee. These user
fees must be filed at the time of the first submission of the application, even if the application is being submitted on a rolling basis. A user fee for the Twirla contraceptive patch was submitted
with the original NDA. Application resubmissions by the same applicant do not require a new application fee. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in
effect, the FDA has agreed to certain performance goals regarding the timing of its review of an application. FDA also aims to review Class&nbsp;1 resubmissions within two months of receipt or
Class&nbsp;2 resubmissions within six months of receipt. Class&nbsp;1 resubmissions are resubmissions of an NDA following a complete response letter, which include minor updates or data
reanalysis. Class&nbsp;2 resubmissions include more complex or extensive updates to the NDA. These time periods may be extended by the FDA should an applicant submit new information to the agency
during the course of FDA's review of the marketing application. The time period is also only a goal and may not be met by the FDA. We expect that our products, if and when approved, will be subject to
a standard review goal. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, an NDA or supplement to an NDA for a new active ingredient, indication, dosage form, dosage regimen or route of
administration must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and
administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of
some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. We believe that we may be able to obtain a waiver
from the conduct of a PREA study as, historically, waivers have been granted for other contraceptive applicants. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60&nbsp;days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete
to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The
resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
FDA may refer a marketing application to an external advisory committee for questions pertaining to issues such as clinical trial design, safety and efficacy, and public health
questions. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the
application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it typically follows such recommendations and considers such
recommendations carefully when making decisions. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before
approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured, referred to as a Pre-Approval Inspection. The FDA will not approve an
application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with FDA's requirements for product manufacturing requirements and adequate to assure consistent
production of the product within required specifications by the manufacturer and all of its subcontractors and contract manufacturers. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically
inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with cGCP. Also, as part of its regulatory review, the FDA verifies the data contained in the NDA. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
testing and approval process for an NDA requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and may take several years to complete. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical
testing are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval of an NDA on a timely
basis, or at all. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After
evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical
trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a CRL. A CRL indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application is not ready for approval. A CRL
generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing, or other information in
order for the FDA to reconsider the application. As discussed in more detail above, in February 2013 we received the 2013 CRL, conducted the additional required clinical trial and other analyses, and
resubmitted the NDA for Twirla to the FDA with this updated information in June 2017. The Twirla resubmission received a PDUFA goal date of December&nbsp;26, 2017. On December&nbsp;21, 2017, the
FDA issued the 2017 CRL, indicating that our resubmitted NDA could not be approved in its present form. Under the FDA's regulations, we are entitled to request a Type&nbsp;A meeting with the FDA
within 90&nbsp;days of receiving a CRL, and the FDA has a goal to grant us a meeting date within 30&nbsp;days of the meeting request. We have submitted a request for a Type&nbsp;A meeting to the
FDA to discuss the deficiencies in the Twirla
NDA and the regulatory path for approval of Twirla. We plan to provide an update on the outcome of the Type&nbsp;A meeting after we receive the official meeting minutes from the FDA and we will then
be better able to determine when we will resubmit our Twirla NDA. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even
if we have a clear path forward with Twirla and we resubmit with the required additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the
regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA's satisfaction, the FDA may issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the
drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even
if the FDA approves a product candidate, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product candidate and require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be
included in the product labeling, including a black box warning. The FDA also may not approve the inclusion of labeling claims necessary for successful marketing. Moreover, the FDA may require that
post-approval studies, including Phase&nbsp;4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess certain aspects of a drug's safety </FONT></P>

management mechanisms. For example, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, as a condition of approval or following approval to mitigate any identified or suspected
serious risks and ensure safe use of the drug. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted
distribution methods, patient registries or other risk minimization tools. A REMS could materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further
marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications,
manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements, submission of a supplemental application, and FDA review and approval. Further, should new safety
information arise, additional testing, product labeling or FDA notification may be required. </FONT></P>

Hatch-Waxman Act  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;505 of the FDCA describes three types of marketing applications that may be submitted to the FDA to request marketing
authorization for a new drug. A Section&nbsp;505(b)(1) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and efficacy. A 505(b)(2) NDA is
an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and efficacy but where at least some of the information required for approval comes from investigations that were not conducted by
or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. This regulatory pathway enables the
applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA's prior findings of safety and efficacy for an existing product, or published literature, in support of its application. Section&nbsp;505(j) establishes an
abbreviated approval process for a generic version of approved drug products through the submission of an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a generic drug
product that has the same active ingredients, dosage form, strength, route of administration, labeling, performance characteristics and intended use, among other things, to a previously approved
product. ANDAs are termed "abbreviated" because they are generally not required to include preclinical (animal) and clinical (human) data to establish safety and efficacy. Instead, generic applicants
must scientifically demonstrate that their product is bioequivalent to, or performs in the same manner as, the innovator drug through </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>in vitro</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>in vivo</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, or
other testing. The generic version must deliver the same amount of active ingredients into a subject's bloodstream in the same amount of
time as the innovator drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the reference listed drug. In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required
to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant's drug or a method of using the drug. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then
published in the FDA's Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential
competitors in support of approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon
submission of an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA, an applicant must certify to the FDA that (1)&nbsp;no patent information on the drug product that is the subject of the application has
been submitted to the FDA; (2)&nbsp;such patent has expired; (3)&nbsp;the date on which such patent expires; or (4)&nbsp;such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture,
use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. Generally, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA cannot be approved until all listed patents have expired, except where the ANDA or
505(b)(2) NDA applicant challenges a listed patent through the last type of certification, also known as a paragraph&nbsp;IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or
indicate that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA application will not be approved until all of the listed patents claiming the referenced product have
expired. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant has provided a Paragraph&nbsp;IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must send notice of the Paragraph&nbsp;IV certification to the NDA and
patent holders once the application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the
paragraph&nbsp;IV certification. If the paragraph&nbsp;IV certification is challenged by an NDA holder or the patent owner(s) asserts a patent challenge to the paragraph&nbsp;IV certification,
the FDA may not make an approval effective until the earlier of 30&nbsp;months from the receipt of the notice of the paragraph&nbsp;IV certification, the expiration of the patent, when the
infringement case concerning each such patent was favorably decided in the applicant's favor or settled, or such shorter or longer period as may be ordered by a court. This
prohibition is generally referred to as the 30-month stay. In instances where an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant files&nbsp;a paragraph&nbsp;IV certification, the NDA holder or patent owner(s)
regularly take action to trigger the 30-month stay, recognizing that the related patent litigation may take many months or years to resolve. Thus, approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA could be delayed
for a significant period of time depending on the patent certification the applicant makes and the reference drug sponsor's decision to initiate patent litigation. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Hatch-Waxman Act establishes periods of regulatory exclusivity for certain approved drug products, during which the FDA cannot approve (or in some cases accept) an ANDA or 505(b)(2)
application that relies on the branded reference drug. For example, the holder of an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, may obtain five years of exclusivity upon approval of a new drug containing new
chemical entities, or NCEs, that have not been previously approved by the FDA. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active
moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the therapeutic activity of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA
submitted by another company that contains the previously approved active moiety. However, an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent
invalidity or non-infringement. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Hatch-Waxman Act also provides three years of marketing exclusivity to the holder of an NDA (including a 505(b)(2) NDA) for a particular condition of approval, or change to a
marketed product, such as a new formulation for a previously approved product, if one or more new clinical studies (other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies) was essential to the approval
of the application and was conducted/sponsored by the applicant. This three-year exclusivity period protects against FDA making an ANDA and 505(b)(2) NDA approval effective for the condition of the
new drug's approval. As a general matter, the three-year exclusivity does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for generic versions of the original, unmodified drug product.
Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to
all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and efficacy. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
NDA for Twirla was submitted under Section&nbsp;505(b)(2), and we expect that some of our other drug candidates will utilize the Section&nbsp;505(b)(2) regulatory pathway. Even
though several of our drug products utilize active drug ingredients that are commercially marketed in the United States in other dosage forms, we need to establish safety and efficacy of those active
ingredients in the formulation and dosage forms that we are developing. All approved products, both innovator and generic, are listed in the FDA's Orange Book. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
FDA is also providing additional incentives and taking additional steps to increase generic competition. For example, under the Food and Drug Reauthorization Act of 2017, products
designated as competitive generics receive a 180-day period of exclusivity if they have not otherwise received a period of exclusivity, increased development guidance, and increased review attention.

U.S. Post-Approval Requirements  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among
other things, requirements relating to manufacturing recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion, reporting of adverse experiences with the product
and drug shortages, and compliance with any post-approval requirements imposed as a condition of approval, such as Phase&nbsp;4 clinical trials, REMS and surveillance to assess safety and efficacy
after commercialization. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There are also
continuing, annual prescription drug program user fee requirements for any approved products. In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of
approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, list drugs manufactured at their facilities with the FDA, and are subject to periodic announced and
unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with FDA and state requirements for product manufacturing and other requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are
strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented, or FDA notification. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from FDA requirements
for product manufacturing and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must

FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Although physicians, in the practice of medicine, may prescribe
approved drugs for unapproved indications, pharmaceutical companies are prohibited from marketing or promoting their drug products for uses outside the approved label, a practice known as off-label
promotion. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may
be subject to significant liability, including criminal and civil penalties under the FDCA and False Claims Act, exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, mandatory compliance
programs under corporate integrity agreements, debarment and refusal of government contracts. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products, including samples, is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of
drugs and drug samples at the federal level. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in
distribution. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover,
the Drug Quality and Security Act imposes obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products related to product tracking and tracing. Among the requirements of this
legislation, manufacturers are required to provide certain information regarding the drug product to individuals and entities to which product ownership is transferred, will be required to label drug
product with a product identifier and are required to keep certain records regarding the drug product. The transfer of information to subsequent product owners by manufacturers is also required to be
done electronically. Manufacturers must also verify that purchasers of the manufacturers' products are appropriately licensed. Further, under this legislation, manufactures have drug product
investigation, quarantine, disposition, and FDA and trading partner notification responsibilities related to counterfeit, diverted, stolen and intentionally adulterated products, as well as products
that are the subject of fraudulent transactions or which are otherwise unfit for distribution such that they would be reasonably likely to result in serious health consequences or death. </FONT></P>

U.S. Fraud and Abuse, Data Privacy and Security and Transparency Laws and Regulations  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, federal and state fraud and abuse laws restrict business practices in
the biopharmaceutical industry. These laws include, among other things, anti-kickback, physician payment transparency and false claims laws and regulations as well as data privacy and security laws
and regulations. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly
or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, or order of any item or service

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>interpreted
broadly to include anything of value. Additionally, the intent standard under the Anti-Kickback Statute and criminal healthcare fraud statutes was also amended by the ACA to a stricter
standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA provided
that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the
federal civil False Claims Act. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary
managers on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. Practices that involve remuneration that may be
alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements
of a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a
case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to,
or approval by, the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim
includes "any request or demand" for money or property presented to the U.S. government. The civil False Claims Act has been used to assert liability on the basis of kickbacks and other improper
referrals, improperly
reported government pricing metrics such as Best Price or Average Manufacturer Price, improper promotion of off-label uses not expressly approved by the FDA in a drug's label, and allegations as to
misrepresentations with respect to the services rendered. Additionally, the civil monetary penalties statute, which, among other things, imposes fines against any person who is determined to have
presented, or caused to be presented, claims to a federal healthcare program that the person knows, or should know, is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or
fraudulent. The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, also created federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to
execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any
healthcare benefit program, including private third party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device a material fact or making any materially
false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters. Also, many states have similar fraud
and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, that apply regardless of the payor. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health
Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, including the final omnibus rule published on January&nbsp;25, 2013, imposes
specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes security standards and certain privacy
standards directly applicable to business associates. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business
associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys' fees and costs
associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws may govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in
significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. </FONT></P>

federal physician payment transparency laws, including the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act created under Section&nbsp;6002 of the ACA and its implementing
regulations, require that manufacturers of drugs for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program, with certain exceptions, report annually to the
government information related to payments or other "transfers of value" made or distributed to physicians, which is defined to include doctors of medicine, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and
chiropractors, generally, with some exceptions, and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, physicians and teaching hospitals. Additionally,
applicable manufacturers and group purchasing organizations are required to report annually to the government certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family
members. Manufacturers must submit reports by the 90th&nbsp;day of each calendar year. Disclosure of such information is made on a publicly available website. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There
are also an increasing number of analogous state laws that regulate price increases, require manufacturers to file reports with states on pricing and marketing information, and to
track and report gifts, compensation, other remuneration and items of value provided to healthcare professionals and healthcare entities. Many of these laws contain ambiguities as to what is required
in order to comply with such laws. For example, several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to, among other things, establish and implement commercial compliance
programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, or register their sales representatives. Certain
state laws also regulate manufacturers' use of prescriber-identifiable data. These laws may affect our future sales, marketing and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and
compliance burdens. In addition, given the lack of clarity with respect to these laws and their implementation, our reporting actions once we commercialize could be subject to the penalty provisions
of the pertinent state and federal authorities. </FONT></P>

healthcare programs, corporate integrity agreements, refusal of government contracts, contract debarment and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our
ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which

Coverage and Reimbursement Generally  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commercial success of Twirla and our other potential product candidates and our ability to commercialize any approved product candidates
successfully will depend in part on the extent to which governmental payor programs at the federal and state levels, including Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers and other third-party
payors provide coverage for and establish adequate coverage of and reimbursement levels for our product candidates. Government authorities, private health insurers and other organizations generally
decide which drugs they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels for healthcare. In particular, in the United States, private health insurers and other third-party payors often provide
reimbursement for products and services based on the level at which the government provides reimbursement through the Medicare or Medicaid programs for such products and services. In the United
States, the European Union and other potentially significant markets for our product candidates, government authorities and third-party payors are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the
price of medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative </FONT></P>

and therapies, which often has resulted in average selling prices lower than they would otherwise be. Further, the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States and on country
and regional pricing and reimbursement controls in the European Union will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and utilization, which may adversely affect our future product
sales and results of operations. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and
healthcare reform, pharmaceutical coverage and reimbursement policies and pricing in general. Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed
services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Sales of our product candidates will therefore depend substantially, both domestically and
abroad, on the extent to which the costs of our products will be paid by health maintenance organizations, managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management organizations, or reimbursed
by government health administration authorities, such as Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers and other third-party payors. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third-party
payors are increasingly imposing additional requirements and restrictions on coverage and limiting reimbursement levels for medical products, including pharmaceuticals. For
example, federal and state governments reimburse covered prescription drugs at varying rates generally below average wholesale price. These restrictions and limitations influence the purchase of
healthcare services and products. Third-party payors are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products
on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drug products for a particular indication. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining
the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to
demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or
cost-effective. Moreover, a payor's decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be
available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in drug development for a product candidate. Legislative proposals to reform healthcare or
reduce costs under government insurance programs may result in lower reimbursement for our product candidates or exclusion of our product candidates from coverage. The cost containment measures that
healthcare payors and providers are instituting and any healthcare reform could significantly reduce our revenues from the sale of any approved product candidates. We cannot provide any assurances
that we will be able to obtain and maintain third-party coverage or adequate reimbursement for our product candidates in whole or in part. </FONT></P>

Healthcare Reform  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legislative proposals to reform healthcare or reduce costs under government healthcare programs may result in lower reimbursement for our
product candidates or exclusion of our product candidates from coverage. There have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our ability to
profitably sell our product candidates, if approved. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with
the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been
significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. </FONT></P>

of healthcare treatments. This funding was designated for, among other things, conducting, supporting or synthesizing research that compares and evaluates the risks and benefits,
clinical outcomes, effectiveness and appropriateness of products. The ACA also appropriated additional funding to comparative clinical effectiveness research. Although Congress has indicated that this
funding is intended to improve the quality of healthcare, it remains unclear how the research will impact current Medicare coverage and reimbursement or how new information will influence other
third-party payor policies. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It
is possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor's product could adversely affect the sales of our product candidates. If third-party payors
do not consider our product candidates to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our product candidates, once approved, as a benefit under their plans or, if they
do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our product candidates on a profitable basis. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition, in August 2011, President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit
Reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to Congress. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction did not achieve its targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the
years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation's automatic reductions to several government programs. These reductions include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per
fiscal year, which
went into effect on April&nbsp;1, 2013 and will stay in effect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In November 2015, the Bipartisan Budget Act was enacted into law, which,
among other things, extended sequestration through 2025. These and other healthcare reform initiatives may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a
material adverse effect on our financial operations. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that
federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could further limit the prices we are able to charge, or the amounts of reimbursement available, for our product
candidates if they are approved. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
January&nbsp;20, 2017, the new administration signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant
exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers
of pharmaceuticals or medical devices among others. Additionally, in October 2017, the Department of Health and Human Services, jointly with the Department of Labor and the Treasury, issued two
interim rules outlining exemption processes for employers not wanting to offer contraceptive coverage based on their religious beliefs or sincerely held moral convictions. While there is an injunction
against the administration prohibiting it from implementing these rules, the ultimate outcome of that litigation cannot be predicted. Congress also could consider subsequent legislation to repeal and
replace elements of the ACA that are repealed. Therefore, it is difficult to determine the full effect of the ACA or any other healthcare reform efforts on our business. </FONT></P>

Foreign Regulation  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other
countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. For example, in the European
Union, we must obtain authorization of a clinical trial application, or CTA, in each member state in which we intend to conduct a clinical trial. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product,
we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The
approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might

approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. </FONT></P>

Research and Development  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conducting research and development is central to our business model. We have invested and expect to continue to invest significant time and
capital in our research and development operations. Our research and development expenses were $14.4&nbsp;million, $20.9&nbsp;million, and $25.6&nbsp;million for the years ended
December&nbsp;31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. In 2018, we expect our research and development expenses to remain relatively consistent with 2017 expenses. Research and development expenses
in 2018 will consist primarily of those costs associated with the continued development and refinement of our commercial manufacturing process, preparation and resubmission of the NDA for Twirla, and
responding to information requests expected to be received from the FDA as part of their review of our NDA resubmission. We have significantly scaled back equipment qualification and validation of our
commercial manufacturing process and resumption and completion of these activities will require additional capital. </FONT></P>

Intellectual Property  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We strive to protect the proprietary technologies that we believe are important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patent
protection intended to cover our Skinfusion technology, its methods of use, related technologies and other inventions that are important to our business. As more fully described below, our patents and
patent applications are directed to our Skinfusion technology or aspects thereof including certain transdermal delivery systems having an active adhesive matrix and methods of using such transdermal
delivery systems for controlling fertility. We also rely on manufacturing trade secrets and careful monitoring of our proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable
to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our

possibly materially. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
plan to continue to expand our intellectual property estate by filing patent applications directed to novel and nonobvious transdermal contraceptive products. The active
pharmaceutical ingredients, or API, in our potential product candidates are generic and therefore our patents do not include claims directed solely to the API. We anticipate seeking additional patent
protection in the United States and internationally for additional transdermal delivery systems and their methods of use. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
patent positions of pharmaceutical companies like us are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a
patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and the patent's scope can be modified after issuance. Consequently, we do not know whether any of our product candidates
will remain protected by enforceable and valid patents. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the
claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. Any patents that we hold may be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because
patent applications in the United States and certain other jurisdictions generally are maintained in secrecy for 18&nbsp;months, and since publication of discoveries in the
scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain of our entitlement to patent rights in the inventions covered in our issued patents and pending patent
applications. Moreover, we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, USPTO, to determine priority of invention, or in post-grant challenge
proceedings in the USPTO or foreign patent offices such as oppositions, reexamination, inter-partes review, post grant review, or a derivation proceeding, that challenge our entitlement to an
invention or the patentability of one or more claims in our patent applications or issued patents. Such proceedings could result in substantial cost, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More
specifically, Twirla is a transdermal contraceptive hormone delivery system. The system is a patch for application to the skin and contains two API, the hormones levonorgestrel, or
LNG, which is a synthetic progestin, and ethinyl estradiol, a synthetic estrogen. The API are formulated with a combination of skin penetration enhancers, which promote penetration through the dermis
and into the bloodstream, such that effective blood levels of the active agents are achieved to suppress ovulation and thereby prevent pregnancy. One of our other potential product candidates, AG890,
is similar to Twirla, except that it contains only a single API, LNG. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
both our Twirla product candidate line and in AG890, the active adhesive system consists of the active ingredients in a polyacrylate adhesive polymer matrix comprising the permeation
enhancers dimethylsulfoxide, ethyl lactate, capric acid and lauryl lactate. The active blend is coated onto a release liner, and a backing layer is added on top of the active blend. The peripheral
adhesive system, also called the overlay, comprising three layers is added onto the backing layer. The overlay comprises a polyisobutylene adhesive layer, an acrylic adhesive layer, and an overlay
covering. The overlay covering is a commercially available silk-like polyester fabric. The adhesive components of the overlay, in addition to their adhesive function, create an </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>in situ seal</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> with the
disposable release liner, trapping evaporable solvents in the active blend, thereby extending the usable shelf life of the product
candidate and contributing to the comfort and effectiveness of the transdermal system during use. Prior to use of any of our product candidates, the release liner is removed by the user and discarded.
The patch is then applied to the skin. </FONT></P>

Regulatory Exclusivity  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our NDA for Twirla was submitted under Section&nbsp;505(b)(2) of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA. Even though Twirla utilizes API
that were previously approved in the United States, Twirla utilizes LNG in a new dosage form, specifically a transdermal patch, and we provided new clinical data essential to approval in our NDA to
establish the safety and efficacy of Twirla. Therefore, if approved by the FDA, we expect to receive three years of U.S. marketing exclusivity for Twirla. The exclusivity will prohibit the FDA from
approving ANDAs and 505(b)(2) NDAs for the conditions of the Twirla approval. We will consider whether we are going to pursue patent term restoration, however, we do not expect to receive patent term
restoration because, as explained above, Twirla will not be the first approval of the API. </FONT></P>

We are significantly dependent on the success of our product candidate, Twirla, which depends on regulatory
approval. The FDA may determine our clinical trials or other data and information regarding safety, efficacy, consistency of manufacture or compliance with FDA manufacturing regulations are
insufficient for regulatory approval. Failure to obtain regulatory approval or the delay and additional costs that would be required to obtain regulatory approval could require us to reduce or, even
discontinue, operations.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None of our product candidates has been approved for sale by any regulatory agency. Any product candidate we develop is subject to extensive

product candidate, Twirla. The approval process in the U.S. is uncertain, can take many years and require the expenditure of substantial resources, and we are unable to predict the timing of when
regulatory approval may be received, if ever, in any jurisdiction. We are not currently pursuing any regulatory approvals for Twirla or any other potential product candidate outside the United States. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
filed a Section&nbsp;505(b)(2) NDA, for approval of Twirla by the FDA, which is required before marketing a new drug in the United States. Our 505(b)(2) NDA relied in part on
clinical trials that we conducted and in part on the FDA's findings of safety and efficacy from investigations for approved products containing the active ingredients and published scientific
literature for which we have not obtained a right of reference. In connection with the original submission of our NDA in April 2012, the FDA indicated in a Complete Response Letter, or the 2013 CRL,
which we received in February 2013, that our NDA was not sufficient for approval as originally submitted. After multiple communications with the FDA, we received significant guidance as to what
additional clinical development and other activities needed to be completed prior to approval. In accordance with the FDA's advice and comments, we conducted an additional Phase&nbsp;3 clinical
trial, the SECURE clinical trial, which was initiated in 2014 and completed in December 2016. We announced the top-line results for the SECURE clinical trial in January 2017. Based on the guidance
that we received from the FDA in connection with our discussions on clinical trial design, we believed that the results from the SECURE
clinical trial would address all of the clinical issues raised in the CRL. In June 2017, we resubmitted our Twirla NDA, which was accepted for review and assigned a PDUFA goal date of
December&nbsp;26, 2017. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
December&nbsp;21, 2017, the FDA issued a second CRL, or the 2017 CRL, indicating that our resubmitted NDA could not be approved in its present form. The 2017 CRL identifies
deficiencies relating to quality control adhesion test methods and specifications which are part of the manufacturing process for Twirla. The 2017 CRL also noted that objectionable conditions
identified during a pre-approval inspection, or PAI, of a facility of our third-party manufacturer, Corium International&nbsp;Inc., or Corium, for the Twirla NDA must be resolved. Lastly, the 2017
CRL questions the </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>in vivo</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> adhesion properties of Twirla and their potential relationship to the SECURE clinical trial results, stating that we have not
established that Twirla has the adhesion properties requisite for safe and effective use at this time. The FDA stated that it is unclear whether the trial results, including the higher than expected
Pearl Index for a combined hormonal contraceptive, the discontinuation rate, and rates of unscheduled bleeding were a result of the adhesion properties of the product or other factors. The FDA also
suggested, if it is determined that the product adhesion concerns are due to the design or formulation of the drug product, that we may need to design a new transdermal system and conduct another
clinical trial with the new transdermal system in a U.S. population. The FDA also identified additional pregnancies in women who had delays in applying patches, which they argued should be added to
the Pearl Index calculation. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
2017 CRL contains recommendations for developing manufacturing in-process tests for ensuring the quality and </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>in vivo</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> adhesion of the
commercial scale product as well as the finished drug specifications and release test method for adhesion. The 2017 CRL also recommends that we assess the </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>in
vivo</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> adhesion properties demonstrated in the SECURE clinical trial and determine whether there was any relationship between the adhesion properties and study efficacy, bleeding
and discontinuation results. Finally, the 2017 CRL recommends that we address the implications of delays in patch application for real-world use. The 2017 CRL does not identify any issues relating to
the safety of Twirla. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior
to receiving the 2017 CRL, we submitted an amendment to our NDA on December&nbsp;1, 2017 in response to an information request from the FDA on the issues related to the quality
control adhesion test methods cited in the 2017 CRL. In the 2017 CRL, the FDA acknowledged receipt of the amendment and stated that the amendment was not reviewed prior to the FDA's action. In
addition, on November&nbsp;20, 2017 and December&nbsp;1, 2017, Corium provided the FDA with responses addressing each of the observations made during the FDA's facility inspection, which included
a PAI for Twirla. Under the FDA's regulations, we are entitled to request a Type&nbsp;A meeting with the FDA within 90&nbsp;days of receiving a CRL, and the FDA has a goal to grant us a meeting
date within 30&nbsp;days of the meeting request. We have submitted a request for a Type&nbsp;A meeting to the FDA to discuss the deficiencies in </FONT></P>

upcoming meeting. We will also address the FDA's questions regarding implications of delays in patch application for real-world use. However, if we are not able to convince the FDA, then these
observations could cast doubt on the feasibility of Twirla for real-world use, which could adversely impact our NDA, and ultimately, approval of Twirla. Even if the FDA agrees with our position
regarding the relationship between the </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>in vivo adhesion</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> properties of Twirla and the efficacy and safety results from our SECURE clinical trial, the FDA
may still determine that the need for a convenient, contraceptive patch and the demonstrated efficacy of Twirla, including the pearl index from our SECURE clinical trial, do not outweigh the potential
risks associated with the product, and therefore are not sufficient to support the approval of Twirla. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover,
before granting product approval and before we can use them in the commercial manufacture of our products, the FDA must determine that Corium's manufacturing facilities meets
certain FDA requirements for product manufacturing. We cannot assure you that Corium will be able to address the objectionable conditions found during the FDA's facility inspection. If Corium is not
able to address the objectionable conditions to the FDA's satisfaction and we cannot find an alternative supplier, the FDA will not approve our future Twirla NDA resubmission. Failure to comply with
the statutory and regulatory requirements further subjects the manufacturer and product sponsor to possible legal or regulatory action, such as delay of approval, suspension of manufacturing, seizure
of product or voluntary recall of a product, among other regulatory actions. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure
to receive approval or significant additional delay in obtaining an FDA decision on whether to approve our resubmitted NDA for Twirla would have a material adverse effect on our
business and results of operations, including possible termination of Twirla development and restructuring of our organization, which could include reducing, or even terminating, our operations. In
January 2018, following our receipt of the 2017 CRL, we significantly scaled back our preparations for commercialization of Twirla, which reduced our cash outlay; however, we continue to maintain
expenditures relating to completing the development and seeking regulatory approval of Twirla. We will require additional funding to complete the commercial validation of the manufacturing process and
commercial launch for Twirla. We may not be able to obtain sufficient additional funding or generate sufficient revenue and cash flows to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to
reduce, or even terminate, our operations. Even if Twirla is approved, the labeling approved by the FDA may restrict how and to whom we and our potential partners, if any, may market the product or
the manner in which our product may be administered and sold, which could significantly limit the commercial
opportunity for Twirla. See, </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Risks Related to Regulatory Approval and Clinical Trials for Our Product Candidates, Risks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Capital,

cash equivalents of $35.9&nbsp;million. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents should be sufficient to fund our operating expenses through the end of 2018. We have based this estimate on
assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Pursuant to the receipt of the 2017 CRL and the delay in the approval timeline for
Twirla and as a result of our financial condition and other factors described herein, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going
concern will depend on our ability to obtain additional funding, as to which no assurances can be given. We continue to analyze various alternatives, including strategic and refinancing alternatives,
asset sales and mergers and acquisitions. Our future success depends on our ability to raise capital and/or implement the various strategic alternatives discussed above. We cannot be certain that
these initiatives or raising additional capital, whether through selling additional debt or equity securities or obtaining a line of credit or other loan, will be available to us or, if available,
will be on terms acceptable to us. If we issue additional securities to raise funds, these securities may have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to those of our common stock, and our current
shareholders may experience dilution. If we are unable to obtain funds when needed or on acceptable terms, we may be required to curtail our current development programs, cut operating costs, forego

We have not obtained regulatory approval for any of our product candidates in the United States or any other
country.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We currently do not have any product candidates that have gained regulatory approval for sale in the United States or any other country, and we
cannot guarantee that we will ever have marketable products. Our business is substantially dependent on our ability to complete the development of, obtain regulatory approval for and successfully
commercialize product candidates in a timely manner. We cannot commercialize product candidates in the United States without first obtaining regulatory approval to market each product candidate from
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA; similarly, we cannot commercialize product candidates outside of the United States without obtaining regulatory approval from comparable foreign
regulatory authorities. We are not currently pursuing any regulatory approvals for Twirla or any other potential product candidate outside the United States. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before
obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any product candidate for a target indication, we must demonstrate in preclinical studies and well-controlled clinical
trials and, with respect to approval in the United States, to the satisfaction of the FDA, that the product candidate is safe and effective for use for that target indication and that the
manufacturing facilities, processes and controls are adequate. In the United States, it is necessary to submit a new drug application, or NDA, to obtain FDA approval. An NDA must include extensive
preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to establish the product candidate's safety and efficacy for each desired indication, although we may partially rely on published scientific
literature or the FDA's prior approval of similar products. The NDA must also include significant information regarding the chemistry, manufacturing and controls for the product. The FDA may further
inspect our manufacturing facilities to ensure that the facilities can manufacture our product candidates and our products, if and when approved, in compliance with the applicable regulatory
requirements, as well as inspect our clinical trial sites to ensure that our studies are properly conducted. Obtaining approval of an NDA is a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process, and approval
may not be obtained. Upon submission, or resubmission, of an NDA, the FDA must make an initial determination that the application is sufficiently complete to accept the submission for filing. We
cannot be certain that any submissions we might make will be accepted for filing and review by the FDA, or ultimately be approved. If the application is not </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>approved,
the FDA may require that we conduct additional clinical or preclinical trials, address issues with our manufacturing process or facilities, or take other actions before it will reconsider
our application, which we experienced in the previous submissions of our NDA for Twirla in both 2012 and 2017. If the FDA requires additional studies or data, we would incur increased costs and delays
in the marketing approval process, which may require us to expend more resources than we have available. In addition, the FDA may not consider any additional information to be complete or sufficient
to support approval. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
instance, we filed an NDA, with the FDA for Twirla in April 2012, which included results from two previously conducted Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trials for Twirla. In response, the FDA
issued the 2013 CRL, which identified certain issues, including a request for additional clinical data, quality information and chemistry, manufacturing and controls information, which needed to be
addressed before approval could be granted. We continued to interact with the FDA on its CMC and other questions and continued additional supportive testing in order to respond to the FDA's CMC
questions. In addition, we gathered the requested information and conducted an additional Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trial for Twirla, which we refer to as the SECURE clinical trial. The SECURE clinical
trial commenced enrollment during the third quarter of 2014 and was completed in December 2016. In January 2017, we announced top-line results. Based on the results of the SECURE clinical trial and
additional information relating to the manufacture of Twirla, we resubmitted our NDA which was received by the FDA on June&nbsp;26, 2017, acknowledged as a complete response ready for FDA review on
July&nbsp;27, 2017, and assigned a target goal date under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, for completion of the FDA's review, or Target PDUFA Goal Date, of December&nbsp;26, 2017. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
NDA resubmission in 2017 was intended to be a complete response to the 2013 CRL. Although we met with the FDA in October 2013 to discuss an additional Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trial
as requested in the 2013 CRL and received substantial written comments from the FDA in subsequent interactions, we did not seek and have not obtained agreement with the FDA on a special protocol
assessment regarding the completed SECURE clinical trial. In March 2017, at our request, we met with the FDA to share preliminary data from the SECURE clinical trial, including key safety data and
BMI-related efficacy findings, and to seek FDA input as to whether the SECURE clinical trial results constituted a basis for addressing the clinical deficiencies cited in the 2013 CRL. We also
requested feedback on whether the proposed Twirla NDA content would meet the FDA's requirements for submission. In April 2017, we received final meeting minutes from our March 2017 meeting with the
FDA. The FDA indicated that based on the preliminary information provided by us, the SECURE clinical trial results appear acceptable for resubmission and provided feedback on our proposed approach to
the FDA's other questions in the 2013 CRL The FDA further provided responses to us regarding the presentation of efficacy, safety and clinical pharmacology analyses in the NDA and requested that
subgroup analysis of efficacy by body weight be provided. The FDA did not provide us with any feedback on whether the results of the SECURE clinical trial and the contents of the planned, resubmitted
NDA would be sufficient to obtain regulatory approval of Twirla. Our resubmitted NDA included efficacy and safety data from the SECURE clinical trial, the requested manufacturing information, and a
summary response to the 2013 CRL and was intended to address the questions raised in the 2013 CRL. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
December&nbsp;21, 2017, the FDA issued the 2017 CRL, indicating that our resubmitted NDA could not be approved in its present form. The 2017 CRL identifies deficiencies relating to
quality control adhesion test methods and specifications which are part of the manufacturing process for Twirla. The 2017 CRL also noted that objectionable conditions identified during a PAI of the
Company's third-party manufacturer, Corium, for the Twirla NDA must be resolved. Lastly, the 2017 CRL questions the </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>in vivo</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> adhesion properties of
Twirla and their potential relationship to the SECURE clinical trial results, concluding that we have not established that Twirla has the adhesion properties requisite for safe and effective use at
this time. The 2017 CRL contains recommendations </FONT></P>

developing manufacturing in-process tests for ensuring the quality and </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>in vivo</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> adhesion of the commercial scale product as well as the finished drug

in the SECURE clinical trial and determine whether there is an adverse impact on the product. Finally, the 2017 CRL recommends that the Company address the implications of clinical trial subject patch
compliance and the withdrawal and dropout rates. The 2017 CRL does not identify any specific issues relating to the safety of Twirla. Prior to receiving the 2017 CRL, we submitted an amendment to our
NDA on December&nbsp;1, 2017 in response to an information request from the FDA on the issues related to the quality control adhesion test methods cited in the 2017 CRL. In the 2017 CRL, the FDA
acknowledged receipt of the amendment and stated that the amendment was not reviewed prior to the FDA's action. In addition, on November&nbsp;20, 2017 and December&nbsp;1, 2017, Corium provided
the FDA with responses addressing each of the observations made during the FDA's facility inspection, which included a PAI for Twirla. Under the FDA's regulations, we are entitled to request a
Type&nbsp;A meeting with the FDA within 90&nbsp;days of receiving a CRL, and the FDA has a goal to grant us a meeting date within 30&nbsp;days of the meeting request. We have submitted a request
for a Type&nbsp;A meeting to the FDA to discuss the deficiencies in the Twirla NDA and the regulatory path for approval of Twirla. We plan to provide an update on the outcome of the Type&nbsp;A
meeting after we receive the official meeting minutes from the FDA and we will then be better able to determine when we will resubmit our Twirla NDA. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
intend to respond to the 2017 CRL, but there can be no assurance that we will address the outstanding FDA questions in a manner sufficient for approval in the U.S. Consistent with our
previous NDA resubmission in 2017, we currently expect that our resubmission of the NDA responding to the 2017 CRL will be categorized as a Type&nbsp;2 resubmission and receive a review period of
six months from the date of resubmission of the NDA. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover,
before granting product approval and before we can use them in the commercial manufacture of our products, the FDA must determine that Corium's manufacturing facilities meets
certain FDA requirements for product manufacturing. We cannot assure you that Corium will be able to address the objectionable conditions found during the FDA's facility inspection. If Corium is not
able to address the objectionable conditions to the FDA's satisfaction and we cannot find an alternative supplier, the FDA will not approve our future Twirla NDA resubmission. Failure to comply with
the statutory and regulatory requirements subjects the manufacturer and product sponsor to possible legal
or regulatory action, such as delay of approval, suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product or voluntary recall of a product, among other regulatory actions. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
connection with our planned resubmission of the Twirla NDA in response to the 2017 CRL, we cannot predict whether regulators will agree that Corium has adequately remedied the
objectionable inspection conditions or that we will be able to find an alternative supplier, or whether regulators will agree with our responses to the cited 2017 CRL deficiencies or our conclusions
regarding the results of the SECURE clinical trial or any clinical trials we have conducted to date, including whether our data are reliable and generalizable, demonstrate adequate </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>in vivo</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> adhesion
properties and/or demonstrate adequate safety and efficacy sufficient for approval. For example, based on the SECURE clinical trial
top-line data, the Pearl Index for the overall intent to treat population of subjects 35&nbsp;years of age and under was 4.80 with an upper-bound of the 95% confidence interval of 6.06, but in the
obese subpopulation of subjects 35&nbsp;years of age and under, the Pearl Index was 6.42 with an upper-bound of the 95% confidence interval of 8.88. If we were to exclude the top-line data on the
obese subpopulation, our Pearl Index for non-obese patients was 3.94 with an upper-bound of the 95% confidence interval of 5.35. The highest Pearl Index for a hormonal contraceptive product approved
by the FDA to date was 3.19 and the highest upper-bound of the 95% confidence interval was 5.03. In the combined safety database for our three Agile Phase&nbsp;3 trials (n&gt;3,000), there were 5

overall safety and efficacy profile of a product, not only a specific Pearl Index, the FDA could conclude that the Pearl Index is too high to demonstrate efficacy and an adequate risk/benefit profile
for either the overall study population or a subgroup of the study population. Accordingly, the FDA may not approve our Twirla NDA. Alternatively, the FDA may determine that for a specific subgroup of
patients, Twirla has lower efficacy and presents a higher risk, necessitating labeling restrictions. For instance, the FDA may require labeling restrictions on the use of Twirla for patients in
certain BMI categories. We also may not obtain approval of Twirla based on these data or any other basis, or if approved, may only receive approval with significant labeling restrictions. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition, while Corium has provided the FDA with responses to each of the observations made during the FDA's facility inspection, we expect that the FDA will re-inspect its facilities
during its review of our planned resubmission before approval can be granted. The FDA has the authority to re-inspect SECURE clinical trial sites as part of a review of an NDA as well. The FDA may
also determine that our responses to the deficiencies in the 2017 CRL and Corium's responses to the manufacturing facility inspection objectionable conditions are not sufficient or require product
development and additional analyses and/or studies and deny approval of the Twirla NDA on this basis as well. The FDA may also find additional objectionable conditions upon re-inspection of the Corium
facility. If the FDA does not approve the Corium facility for the manufacture of Twirla, or if Corium is not able to address the objectionable conditions found by the FDA, we may need to find an
alternative
supplier, which will take time and monetary expenditures, and which we may not be able to do on favorable terms to us or at all. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regulatory
authorities outside of the United States, such as in Europe and Japan and in emerging markets, also have requirements for approval of drugs for commercial sale with which we
must comply prior to marketing in those areas. Regulatory requirements can vary widely from country to country and could delay or prevent the introduction of our product candidates. Clinical trials
conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries and obtaining regulatory approval in one country does not mean that regulatory approval will be obtained in
any other country. However, the failure to obtain regulatory approval in one jurisdiction could have a negative impact on our ability to obtain approval in a different jurisdiction. Approval processes
vary among countries and can involve additional product candidate testing and validation and additional administrative review periods. Seeking foreign regulatory approval could require additional
non-clinical studies or clinical trials, which could be costly and time consuming. Foreign regulatory approval may include all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. For all of these
reasons, if we seek foreign regulatory approval for Twirla or any of our other product candidates, we may not obtain such approvals on a timely basis, if at all. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
process to develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize product candidates is long, complex and costly both inside and outside of the United States, and approval is
never guaranteed. Even if our product candidates were to successfully obtain approval from regulatory authorities, any such approval might significantly limit the approved indications for use,
including more limited patient populations, require that precautions, contraindications or warnings be included on the product labeling, including black box warnings, require expensive and
time-consuming post-approval clinical studies, risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, or REMS, or surveillance as conditions of approval, or, through the product label, the approval may limit the
claims that we may make, which may impede the successful commercialization of our product candidates. For example, we believe that Twirla, if approved, will have labeling consistent with all other
marketed hormonal contraceptive products, which include class labeling that warns of risks of certain serious conditions, including venous and arterial blood clots, heart attacks, thromboembolism, and
stroke, as well as liver tumors, gallbladder disease, and hypertension, and a boxed warning regarding risks of smoking and CHC use, particularly in women over 35&nbsp;years old who smoke. However,

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may be unable to initiate or complete development of our product candidates on schedule, if at all. The timing for the completion of the
studies for our potential product candidates other than Twirla will require funding beyond our existing cash and cash equivalents. In addition, if regulatory authorities require additional time or
studies to assess the safety or efficacy of Twirla, we may not have or be able to obtain adequate funding to complete the necessary steps for approval for any or all of our product candidates.
Additional delays may result if the FDA, an FDA Advisory Committee or other regulatory authority recommends non-approval or restrictions on approval. Studies required to demonstrate the safety and
efficacy of our product candidates are time consuming, expensive and together take several years or more to complete. In addition, approval policies, regulations or the type and amount of clinical
data necessary to gain approval may change during the course of a product candidate's clinical development and may vary among jurisdictions. We have not obtained regulatory approval for any product
candidate and it is possible that none of our existing product candidates or any product candidates we may seek to develop in the future will ever obtain regulatory approval. Delays in regulatory

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
example, we filed an NDA, with the FDA for Twirla in April 2012, which included results from two previously conducted Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trials for Twirla. The FDA issued a CRL
in February 2013, or the 2013 CRL, which identified certain issues, including a request for additional clinical data, quality information and chemistry, manufacturing and controls information, which
needed to be addressed before approval could be granted. We continued to interact with the FDA on its chemistry manufacturing and control, or CMC, and other questions and continued additional
supportive testing in order to respond to the FDA's CMC questions. In addition, we gathered the requested information and conducted an additional Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trial for Twirla, which we
refer to as the SECURE clinical trial. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
December 2016, we completed the SECURE clinical trial and announced top-line data in early January 2017. In March 2017, at our request, we met with the FDA to share preliminary data
from the SECURE clinical trial, including key safety data and BMI-related efficacy findings, and to seek FDA input as to whether the SECURE clinical trial results constitute a basis for addressing the
clinical deficiencies cited in the 2013 CRL. We also requested feedback on whether the proposed Twirla NDA content would meet the FDA's requirements for submission. In April 2017, we received final
meeting minutes from our March meeting with the FDA. The FDA indicated that based on the preliminary information provided by us, the SECURE clinical trial results appear acceptable for resubmission
and provided feedback on our proposed approach to certain of the FDA's other questions in the 2013 CRL. The FDA further provided responses to us regarding the presentation of efficacy, safety and
clinical pharmacology analyses in the NDA and requested that subgroup analysis of efficacy by body weight be provided. The FDA did not provide us with any feedback on whether the results of the SECURE
clinical trial and the contents of the planned, resubmitted NDA will be sufficient to obtain regulatory approval of Twirla. Our resubmitted NDA was received by the FDA on June&nbsp;26, 2017 and </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>acknowledged
as a complete response ready for FDA review on July&nbsp;26, 2017, with a Target PDUFA Goal Date of December&nbsp;26, 2017. The resubmitted NDA included efficacy and safety data from
the SECURE clinical trial, the requested manufacturing information, and a summary response to the 2013 CRL and was intended to address the questions raised in the 2013 CRL. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
December&nbsp;21, 2017, the FDA issued the 2017 CRL, indicating that our resubmitted NDA could not be approved in its present form. The 2017 CRL identifies deficiencies relating to
quality control adhesion test methods and specifications which are part of the manufacturing process for Twirla. The 2017 CRL also noted that objectionable conditions identified during an inspection
of a facility of Corium, for the Twirla NDA must be resolved. Lastly, the 2017 CRL questions the </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>in vivo</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> adhesion properties of Twirla and their
potential relationship to the SECURE clinical trial results, concluding that we have not established that Twirla has the adhesion properties requisite for safe and effective use at this time. The 2017
CRL contains recommendations for developing manufacturing in-process tests for ensuring the quality and </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>in vivo</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> adhesion of the commercial scale product
as well as the finished drug specifications and release test method for adhesion. The 2017 CRL also recommends that the Company assess the </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>in vivo</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>
adhesion properties demonstrated in the SECURE clinical trial and determine whether there is an adverse impact on the product. Finally, the 2017 CRL recommends that the Company address the
implications of clinical trial subject patch compliance and the withdrawal and dropout rates. The 2017 CRL does not identify any specific issues relating to the safety of Twirla. Prior to receiving
the 2017 CRL, we submitted an amendment to our NDA on December&nbsp;1, 2017 in response to an information request from the FDA on the issues related to the quality control adhesion test methods
cited in the 2017 CRL. In the 2017 CRL, the FDA acknowledged receipt of the amendment and stated that the amendment was not reviewed prior to the FDA's action. In addition, on November&nbsp;20, 2017
and December&nbsp;1, 2017, Corium provided the FDA with responses to each of the observations made during the FDA's facility inspection. Under the FDA's regulations, we are entitled to request a
Type&nbsp;A meeting with the FDA within 90&nbsp;days of receiving a CRL, and the FDA has a goal to grant us a meeting date within 30&nbsp;days of the meeting request. We have submitted a request
for a Type&nbsp;A meeting to the FDA to discuss the deficiencies in the Twirla NDA and the regulatory path for approval of Twirla. We plan to provide an update on the outcome of the Type&nbsp;A
meeting after we receive the official meeting minutes from the FDA and we will then be better able to determine when we will resubmit our Twirla NDA. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consistent
with our previous NDA resubmission in 2017, we currently expect that our resubmission of the NDA responding to the 2017 CRL will be categorized as a Type&nbsp;2 resubmission
and receive a review period of six months from the date of resubmission of the NDA. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
FDA's review of our planned NDA resubmission is subject to all the risks described above in addition to, among other things, the FDA's assessment of our specific response to the 2017
CRL and the efficacy and safety of Twirla as demonstrated in the final SECURE clinical trial results. The FDA may not agree that our CRL response addresses the agency's concerns or may find that
Corium has not adequately addressed the objectionable conditions observed by the FDA during its inspection of the manufacturing facility. If Corium is not able to adequately address the objectionable
conditions observed by the FDA, we may need to find an alternative supplier, which would take time and monetary expenditures, and for which there is no guarantee that we will be able to find an
acceptable alternative or form&nbsp;a relationship on favorable terms. The FDA may also find that our clinical trial results, including the SECURE clinical trial, do not demonstrate the safety or
efficacy of Twirla. The lengthy and unpredictable approval process, as well as the unpredictability of future clinical trial results, may result in our failure to obtain regulatory approval to market
Twirla or any of our other potential product candidates, which would significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects, and we may be unable to continue our operations at planned
levels and be forced to reduce, or even terminate, our operations. </FONT></P>

The publicly reported results of the SECURE clinical trial are based on top-line data and may ultimately
differ from actual results submitted to the FDA.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January 2017, we publicly reported top-line results of the SECURE clinical trial. Generally, top-line results are based on preliminary
analyses of efficacy and safety data, and therefore the reported results, findings and conclusions related to the SECURE clinical trial were subject to change following the full analysis. Since the
initial reporting of the top-line data, all analyses in the statistical analysis plan have been completed and submitted to the FDA. Additional public disclosures of clinical trial data have also been
provided in the form of posters and an oral presentation although such public disclosures did not contain the complete, final clinical trial results. The clinical trial data that were submitted to the
FDA in our NDA for Twirla on June&nbsp;26, 2017, contained the final, complete clinical trial results, and contain minor differences from the results that were reported in January 2017 and
subsequent posters and oral presentation. While, as expected, minor updates in the study results have occurred since the original top-line data were reported, we believe the overall conclusions
regarding the efficacy and safety results of the SECURE clinical trial have not changed. However, third parties, including regulatory agencies, may not accept or agree with our assumptions,
estimations, calculations or analyses or may interpret or weigh the importance of data differently, which could impact the potential for approval of Twirla, or if approved, the labeling and commercial
value of Twirla and our business in general. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;;margin-left:0pt;text-indent:-0pt;"><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>

The FDA may disagree with our interpretation of clinical results obtained from the SECURE clinical trial, our
results do not guarantee support for regulatory approval of our NDA, and, even if the SECURE clinical trial data are deemed to be positive by the FDA, the FDA may disagree with other aspects of the
SECURE clinical trial and decline to approve Twirla for the proposed indication.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have reported positive top-line data from the SECURE clinical trial. However, even if we believe that the data from the SECURE clinical trial
are positive, the FDA could determine that the data from the SECURE clinical trial were negative or inconclusive or could reach a different conclusion than we did on that same data. For instance,
following our resubmission of our NDA, the FDA issued the 2017 CRL and raised questions on the </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>in vivo</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> adhesion properties of Twirla and their potential
adverse impact on our phase&nbsp;3 clinical trial results, concluded that we have not established that Twirla has the adhesion properties requisite for safe and effective use at this time, and
recommended that we assess the </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>in vivo</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> adhesion properties demonstrated in the SECURE clinical trial and determine whether there is an adverse impact on
the product, among other recommendations and deficiencies further described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form&nbsp;10-K. Negative or inconclusive results of a clinical trial or difference of
opinion could cause the FDA to decline to approve our
application or require us to repeat the trial or conduct additional clinical trials prior to obtaining approval for commercialization, and there is no guarantee that additional trials would achieve
positive results to the satisfaction of the FDA or that the FDA will agree with our interpretation of the results. Any such determination by the FDA would delay the timing of our commercialization
plan for Twirla or prevent its further development, or the further development of our other potential product candidates, and adversely affect our business operations. Additionally, the FDA may
provide review commentary at any time during the resubmission and review process which could delay the review timeline, adversely affect the review process, or even prevent the approval of Twirla, any
of which would adversely affect our business. We may not be able to appropriately remedy issues that the FDA has raised in the 2017 CRL or may raise in its review of our NDA resubmission responding to
the 2017 CRL, and we may not have sufficient time or financial resources to conduct future activities to remediate issues raised by the FDA. Moreover, Corium may not be able to remedy the
objectionable conditions found during the FDA's facility inspection and we may not be able to find an alternative supplier. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
March 2017, at our request, we met with the FDA to share preliminary data from the SECURE clinical trial, including key safety data and BMI-related efficacy findings, and to seek FDA
input as to whether the SECURE clinical trial results constituted a basis for addressing the clinical deficiencies cited in the 2013 CRL. We also requested feedback on whether the proposed Twirla NDA
content would meet the FDA's requirements for submission. In April 2017, we received final meeting minutes from our March meeting with the FDA. The FDA indicated that based on the preliminary
information provided by us, the SECURE clinical trial results appear acceptable for resubmission and provided feedback on our proposed approach to certain of the FDA's other questions in the 2013 CRL.
The FDA further provided responses to us regarding the presentation of efficacy, safety and clinical pharmacology analyses in the NDA and requested that subgroup analysis of efficacy by body weight be
provided. The FDA did not provide us with any feedback on whether the results of the SECURE clinical trial and the contents of the planned, resubmitted NDA would be sufficient to obtain regulatory
approval of Twirla. There is no guarantee that the data obtained from the SECURE clinical trial will be supportive of, or guarantee, or result in our successfully obtaining FDA approval of Twirla in a
timely fashion and for a commercially viable indication, if at all. For example, when we resubmit our NDA to respond to the 2017 CRL, the FDA could determine that the trial did not meet its
objectives, or the FDA could still have concerns regarding the conduct of the SECURE clinical trial, including regarding discontinuance of subjects from the trial. At any future point in time, the FDA
could require us to complete further clinical or preclinical trials or take other actions which could delay or preclude approval of the NDA and would require us to obtain significant additional
funding. There is no guarantee such funding would be available to us on favorable terms, if at all, nor is there any guarantee that FDA would consider any additional information complete or sufficient
to support approval. In connection with its review of the planned Twirla resubmission NDA responding to the 2017 CRL, the FDA may hold an advisory committee meeting to obtain committee input on the
safety and efficacy of Twirla. Typically, advisory committees will provide responses to specific questions asked by the FDA, including the committee's view on the approvability of the product
candidate under review. Advisory committee decisions are not binding but an adverse decision at the advisory committee may have a negative impact on the regulatory review of Twirla. Additionally, we
may choose to engage in the dispute resolution process with the FDA if we do not receive approval, which could extend the timeline for any potential approval. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further,
we plan to resubmit our NDA for Twirla with the clinical data from the SECURE clinical trial and additional information and analyses responding to the 2017 CRL. There is no
guarantee that such information, data and analyses will be deemed sufficient by the FDA. While we designed the protocols for the SECURE clinical trial and completed analyses to address the issues
raised in the 2013 CRL, and are completing the analyses and other requested items from the 2017 CRL, there is no guarantee that the FDA will deem such steps to be sufficient to address those issues
when they are formally reviewed as a part of an NDA resubmission or to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA. The FDA has significant discretion in the review process, and we
cannot predict whether the FDA will agree with our conclusions regarding the results of the SECURE clinical trial, including whether our data are reliable and generalizable. For example, the FDA may
disagree with our calculations relating to the number of pregnancies occurring on study, or may view the SECURE clinical trial data, and other information and analyses as insufficient to demonstrate a
favorable benefit/risk profile for approval for the proposed indication. In addition, based on top-line data, the Pearl Index for the overall intent to treat population of subjects 35&nbsp;years of
age and under was 4.80 with an upper-bound of the 95% confidence interval of 6.06, but in the obese subpopulation of subjects 35&nbsp;years of age and under, the Pearl Index was 6.42 with an
upper-bound of the 95% confidence interval of 8.88. If we were to exclude the top-line data on the obese subpopulation, our Pearl Index for non-obese patients was 3.94 with an upper-bound of the 95%
confidence interval of 5.35. The highest Pearl Index for a hormonal contraceptive product approved by the FDA to date was 3.19 and the highest upper-bound of the 95% confidence interval was 5.03. In

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>database
for our three Agile Phase&nbsp;3 trials (n&gt;3,000), there were 5 subjects with potentially study drug related DVTs or PEs, 4 of whom were obese (BMI
<FONT FACE="SYMBOL">&#179;</FONT> 30 kg/m<SUP>2</SUP>). Although ultimate approvability of a hormonal contraceptive is based on a risk/benefit assessment of the overall safety and
efficacy profile of a product, not only a specific Pearl Index, the FDA could conclude that our Pearl Index for either the overall study population or a subgroup of the study population or only the
non-obese study population is too high to demonstrate efficacy and an adequate risk/benefit profile, and as such, the FDA could decline to approve Twirla on this or any other basis. Also, the FDA may
not agree with our analysis of the relationship between BMI and efficacy for Twirla and the FDA may interpret our overall data differently than we do and may decline to approve Twirla on this or any
other basis. Furthermore, in connection with the 2017 CRL, the FDA raised questions on the </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>in vivo</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> adhesion properties of Twirla and their potential
relationship to our phase&nbsp;3 clinical trial results, concluded that we have not established that Twirla has the adhesion properties requisite for safe and effective use at this time, and
recommended that we assess the </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>in vivo</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> adhesion properties demonstrated in the SECURE clinical trial and determine whether there is an adverse impact on
the product. The FDA also recommended we address the implications of clinical trial subject patch compliance and the withdrawal and dropout rates, among other recommendations and deficiencies further
described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form&nbsp;10-K. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover,
even if we obtain approval of Twirla, any such approval might significantly limit the approved indications for use, including by limiting the approved label for use by more
limited patient
populations than we propose, require that precautions, contraindications or warnings be included on the product labeling, including black box warnings, require expensive and time-consuming
post-approval clinical studies, risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, or REMS, or surveillance as conditions of approval, or, through the product label, the approval may limit the claims that we
may make, which may impede the successful commercialization of Twirla. For example, the FDA may deem the higher Pearl Index in the obese subpopulation when combined with safety findings for this
subpopulation to warrant a labeling limitation or warning for such subpopulation, which could limit the commercial potential of the product, if approved. Moreover, because we did not conduct any
head-to-head studies of Twirla against Ortho Evra, we will not be able to make direct comparative claims regarding the safety, efficacy or pharmacokinetics of Twirla and Ortho Evra or its generic
version, Xulane&reg;. </FONT></P>

Failure can occur at any stage of clinical development. If the clinical trials for Twirla or any of our
current or future product candidates are unsuccessful, we could be required to abandon development.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. A failure of one or more clinical
trials can occur at any stage of testing for a variety of reasons. The outcome of preclinical testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the outcome of later clinical trials, and
interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. In some instances, there can be significant variability in safety or efficacy results between different trials of the same
product candidate due to numerous factors, including changes in or adherence to trial protocols, differences in size and type of the subject populations and the rates of dropout among clinical trial
subjects. Our future clinical trial results therefore may not demonstrate safety and efficacy sufficient to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates. For example, we received the 2013 CRL
from the FDA with respect to an NDA previously filed for Twirla, in which the FDA requested, among other items, additional Phase&nbsp;3 clinical data to support the application. The SECURE clinical
trial was designed in consultation with the FDA and is different than the design of our previous clinical trials of Twirla and it is possible that the FDA could conclude that there was significant
variability in the safety and efficacy results of these trials. Additionally, while our SECURE clinical trial was designed and implemented in a manner to address the FDA's comments and guidance, it is
possible that the FDA could ultimately conclude that the data are not supportive of approval. Specifically, following our resubmission of our NDA, the FDA issued the 2017 CRL and raised questions on

clinical trial results, concluded that we have not established that Twirla has the adhesion properties requisite for safe and effective use at this time, and recommended that we assess
the </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>in vivo</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> adhesion properties demonstrated in the SECURE clinical trial and determine whether there is an adverse impact on the product, among other
recommendations and deficiencies further described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form&nbsp;10-K.A number of companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in
advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or adverse
safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier trials. Our clinical trials may not be successful. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flaws
in the design of a clinical trial may not become apparent until the clinical trial is well-advanced. We have limited experience in designing contraceptive clinical trials and may
be unable to design and execute clinical trials to support regulatory approval of our product candidates. In addition, clinical trials often reveal that it is not practical or feasible to continue
development efforts for a product candidate. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
may voluntarily suspend or terminate our clinical trials if at any time we believe that they present an unacceptable risk to subjects. Furthermore, regulatory agencies, Institutional
Review Boards, or IRBs, or data safety monitoring boards, if utilized in our clinical trials, may at any time order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of our clinical trials or request that we
cease using certain investigators in the clinical trials if such regulatory agencies or boards believe that the clinical trials are not being conducted in accordance with applicable regulatory
requirements or that they present an unacceptable safety risk to subjects. Since our inception, we have not voluntarily or involuntarily suspended or terminated a clinical trial due to unacceptable
safety risks to subjects. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
the results of the clinical trials for our current product candidates or clinical trials for any future product candidates do not achieve the primary efficacy endpoints or demonstrate
unexpected safety issues, the prospects for approval of our product candidates will be materially adversely affected. For example, in the 2013 CRL that we received from the FDA in connection with the
NDA previously filed for Twirla, one of the FDA's comments was that acceptable evidence of efficacy was not demonstrated, as measured by Pearl Index, or PI. Specifically, in our completed
Phase&nbsp;3 trials, the PI was higher than that seen in registration trials for previously approved hormonal contraceptives. Experts seem to agree that inconsistent or incorrect use is a major
contributor to the increased PI seen in more recent contraceptive trials. The PI values from clinical trials are also affected by additional factors, including differences in study design, increased
sensitivity of early pregnancy tests, weight and body mass index, or BMI, of the study population and user experience. For example, consistent with other recent hormonal contraceptive clinical trials,
including Ortho Evra&reg; and Quartette&reg;, and the 2015 meta-analysis conducted by the FDA authors on the effect of obesity on the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives, a
relationship between obesity and efficacy was observed among subjects 35&nbsp;years of age and under in our SECURE clinical trial. Moreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to
varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have failed to achieve similar
results in later clinical trials, including longer-term trials, or have failed to obtain regulatory approval of their product candidates. Many compounds that initially showed promise in clinical
trials or earlier preclinical studies have later been found to cause undesirable or unexpected adverse effects that have prevented further development of the compound. The FDA may interpret the data
from the SECURE clinical trial differently than we do and may decline to approve Twirla on this or any other basis. </FONT></P>

our clinical trials or subjects dropping out of or being excluded from participation in our clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate, could increase our costs, slow down our product
development and approval process and harm our business. For example, we experienced a slower than expected rate of enrollment for our SECURE clinical trial of Twirla, which we began enrolling in the

Changes in regulatory requirements and guidance may also occur and we may need to amend clinical trial

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unforeseen adverse effects from any of our product candidates could arise either during clinical development or, if approved, after the approved
product has been marketed. In the combined safety population of our Phase&nbsp;3 trials completed prior to the SECURE clinical trial, there were a total of 22 serious adverse events, or SAEs, of
which 16 occurred in the Twirla cohort, which had approximately 2.3 times as many subjects as the oral contraceptive comparator cohort. Three of the 16 SAEs in the Twirla cohort (0.2% of the overall
Twirla safety population) were considered to be possibly related to Twirla, and included one drug overdose with Benadryl, one case of uncontrollable nausea and vomiting and one instance of DVT. In
addition to the SAEs described above, some subjects taking Twirla experienced non-serious adverse events, such as nausea, headache, application site irritation and breast tenderness. Subjects
receiving the oral contraceptive comparator also experienced non-serious adverse events such as nausea, headache and breast tenderness, though at different rates. In the SECURE clinical trial, SAEs
were observed in approximately 2.0% of the SECURE clinical trial population, and 0.6% of subjects had SAEs that were considered potentially study drug related, including DVT, PE, gallbladder disease,
ectopic pregnancy, and depression. In the combined safety database for the three Agile Phase&nbsp;3 trials (n &gt;3,000), there were 5 subjects with potentially study drug related DVTs or PEs, 4 of
whom were obese (BMI &gt;30kg/m<SUP>2</SUP>). </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any
undesirable adverse effects that may be caused by our product candidates could interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in more restrictive labeling or the denial of
regulatory approval by
the FDA or other regulatory authorities for any or all targeted indications, and in turn prevent us from commercializing our product candidates and generating revenues from their sale. For instance,
the FDA may determine that for specific subgroups of patients, Twirla has lower efficacy and presents a higher risk. Accordingly, the FDA may not approve our Twirla NDA or may require labeling
restrictions. By example, the FDA may require labeling restrictions on the use of Twirla for patients in certain BMI categories. Adverse effects in any clinical trial could also impact subject
recruitment or the ability or willingness of enrolled subjects to complete the trial or result in product liability claims. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and
prospects significantly. </FONT></P>

Our development and commercialization strategy for Twirla depends, in part, on published scientific

may rely in reviewing our NDA.  </I></B></FONT></P>

filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from investigations that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a
right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. The FDA interprets Section&nbsp;505(b)(2) of the FDCA, for purposes of approving an NDA, to permit the
applicant to rely, in part, upon published literature or the FDA's previous findings of safety and efficacy for an approved product. The FDA also requires companies to perform additional clinical
trials or measurements to support any deviation from the previously approved product and to support the reliance on the applicable published literature or referenced product. The FDA may then approve
the new product candidate for all or some of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section&nbsp;505(b)(2)

We have submitted an NDA for Twirla under Section&nbsp;505(b)(2) and as such the NDA relied, in part, on the FDA's previous findings of safety and efficacy from investigations for approved products
containing ethinyl estradiol, or EE, and levonorgestrel, or LNG, and published scientific literature for which we
have not received a right of reference. We also plan to rely on the 505(b)(2) pathway for our other product candidates. We received the 2013 CRL in response to our initial Section&nbsp;505(b)(2) NDA
for Twirla, as well as our NDA resubmission. Even though we may be able to take advantage of Section&nbsp;505(b)(2) to support potential U.S. approval for Twirla, the FDA may require us to perform
additional clinical trials or measurements to support approval over and above the clinical trials that we have already completed. In addition, notwithstanding the approval of many products by the FDA
pursuant to Section&nbsp;505(b)(2), over the last few years some pharmaceutical companies and others have objected to the FDA's interpretation of Section&nbsp;505(b)(2). If the FDA changes its
interpretation of Section&nbsp;505(b)(2), or if the FDA's interpretation is successfully challenged in court, this could delay or even prevent the FDA from approving any Section&nbsp;505(b)(2)
NDAs that we submit. Such a result could require us to conduct additional testing and costly clinical trials, which could substantially delay or prevent the approval and launch of our product
candidates, including Twirla. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our product candidates may be considered by the FDA to be drug-device combination products. While our product candidates, as a whole, will be
subject to the drug approval process, we and any of our contractors will be required to comply with the FDA regulatory requirements related to both drugs and devices. For instance, drug-device
combination products must comply with both the drug cGMPs and device QSRs, which may be done using a streamlined approach. Additionally, drug-device combination products will be subject to additional
reporting requirements. The development of drug-device combination products will also be more complex because the sponsor of the product application will need to demonstrate the combined safety and
efficacy of the drug and device components. These requirements will require additional effort and monetary expenditure to ensure that our and our partners' products and product candidates are in
compliance. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have incurred losses in each year since our inception in December 1997. Our net loss was $28.3&nbsp;million, $28.7&nbsp;million and

believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will not be sufficient to fund our current and planned operations through the 12&nbsp;months following the date of our auditor's report
(March&nbsp;12, 2018), which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern may create negative

If we fail to obtain the capital necessary to fund our operations, we may be unable to obtain regulatory

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need large amounts of capital to support our development and commercialization efforts for Twirla. If we are unable to secure sufficient
capital to fund our
operations, we will not be able to continue these efforts and may not be able to obtain regulatory approval of, or commercialize, Twirla in the U.S. Additionally, in order to raise additional capital,
we might have to enter into strategic collaborations that could require us to share commercial rights to Twirla with third parties in ways that we currently do not intend or on terms that may not be
favorable to us. Our cash and cash equivalents were $35.9&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2017. In January 2018, following our receipt of the 2017 CRL, we significantly scaled back our
preparations for commercialization of Twirla, including commercial pre-launch and manufacturing validation activities, pending our ability to address the 2017 CRL and receive approval of Twirla. Based
on these actions and our current business plan, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents as of December&nbsp;31, 2017 will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements through the end of
2018. Our current business plan assumes resubmission of our NDA for Twirla in the second quarter of 2018, a six-month FDA review of our NDA resubmission, and resumption of both pre-launch commercial
activities and pre-validation and validation of our manufacturing process after Twirla approval. We will require additional capital to fund operating needs beyond 2018, including among other items,
the resumption and completion of our commercial plan for Twirla, which primarily includes validation of our commercial manufacturing process and the commercial launch of Twirla, if approved, and
advancing the development of our other potential product candidates. We cannot assure you that the FDA will approve Twirla, that the FDA's timeline for review will be within six months, or that we
will timely complete the qualification and validation of our commercial manufacturing process. We may also need to raise additional funds prior to the end of 2018 if we choose to accelerate elements
of our commercial plan or we encounter any unforeseen events that affect our current business plan. Adequate additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are
unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms and not enter into strategic collaborations, we may be required to curtail our current development programs, cut operating costs, forgo
future development and other opportunities or even terminate our operations, which may involve seeking bankruptcy protection. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February 2015, we entered into a loan and security agreement, referred to herein as the Hercules Loan Agreement, with Hercules
Capital,&nbsp;Inc., or Hercules, for a term loan of up to $25.0&nbsp;million. The Hercules Loan Agreement was amended effective August&nbsp;25, 2016. A first tranche of $16.5&nbsp;million was
funded upon execution of the Hercules Loan Agreement, approximately $15.5&nbsp;million of which was used to repay our term loan with Oxford. Under terms of the Hercules Loan Agreement, we may, but
are not obligated to, draw an additional tranche of up to $8.5&nbsp;million through March&nbsp;31, 2017, subject to the achievement of certain clinical milestones. The Hercules Loan Agreement was
further amended in May 2017 to extend the period during which we could have drawn the additional tranche of $8.5&nbsp;million to January&nbsp;31, 2018. We are currently in discussions with
Hercules to extend the period during which the additional tranche of $8.5&nbsp;million may be drawn. We can make
no assurances that our discussions will ultimately be successful and, if such discussions result in an extension of the period in which we may draw the additional tranche of $8.5&nbsp;million, we
could incur additional fees to Hercules. If we cannot successfully negotiate the extension of the draw down period with Hercules, we will lose access to additional tranche of the term loan as a
potential source of capital. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Hercules Loan Agreement subjects us to various customary covenants, including requirements as to financial reporting and insurance, and restrictions on our ability to dispose of our
business or property, change our line of business, liquidate or dissolve, enter into any change in control transaction, merge or consolidate with any other entity or acquire all or substantially all
the capital stock or property of another entity, incur additional indebtedness, incur certain types of liens on our property, including our intellectual property, pay any dividends or other
distributions on our capital stock other than dividends payable solely in capital stock or redeem our capital stock. Our business may be adversely affected by these restrictions on our ability to
operate our business. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Hercules Loan Agreement is secured by substantially all of our property other than our intellectual property. As a result of the amendment to the Hercules Loan Agreement, we were
required to make interest-only payments through January 2017. On February&nbsp;1, 2017, we began making principal payments with respect to the Hercules Loan. The Hercules Loan Agreement currently
bears interest at rate of 9.25% per annum and matures on December&nbsp;1, 2018. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally,
we may be required to repay the outstanding indebtedness under the term loan if an event of default occurs under the Hercules Loan Agreement. Under the Hercules Loan
Agreement, an event of default will occur if, among other things, we fail to make payments under the Hercules Loan Agreement or we breach any of our covenants under the Hercules Loan Agreement,
subject to specified cure periods with respect to certain breaches; Hercules determines in good faith that we are unable to satisfy our obligations under the Hercules Loan Agreement as they become due
and that our principal investors do not intend to fund amounts necessary to satisfy such obligations; we or our assets become subject to certain legal proceedings, such as bankruptcy proceedings; we
are unable to pay our debts as they become due; or we default on contracts with third parties which would permit Hercules to accelerate the maturity of such indebtedness or that could have a material
adverse effect on us. We may not have enough available cash or be able to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings to repay such indebtedness at the time any such event of default
occurs. In that case, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product candidate development or commercialization efforts or grant to others rights to develop and market product
candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. Hercules could also exercise its rights as collateral agent to take possession and dispose of the collateral securing the
loan for its benefit, which collateral includes all of our property other than our intellectual property. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely
affected as a result of any of these events. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
January 2018, following our receipt of the 2017 CRL, we significantly scaled back our preparations for commercialization of Twirla, including commercial pre-launch and manufacturing
validation activities, pending our ability to address the 2017 CRL and receive approval of Twirla. Based on these actions and our current business plan, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents
as of December&nbsp;31, 2017 will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements through the end of 2018. Our current business plan assumes resubmission of our NDA for Twirla in the second quarter
of 2018, a six-month FDA review of our NDA resubmission, and resumption of both pre-launch commercial activities and pre-validation and validation of our manufacturing process after Twirla approval.
We will require additional capital to fund operating needs beyond 2018, including among other items, the resumption and completion of our commercial plan for Twirla, which primarily includes the
validation of our commercial manufacturing process and the commercial launch of Twirla, if approved, and advancing the development of our other potential product candidates. Accordingly, we will be
required to obtain further funding through other public or private offerings, debt financing, collaboration or licensing arrangements or other sources. Adequate additional funding may not be available
to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we would be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or
future commercialization efforts. Our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operating requirements is a forward- looking statement and
involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors, including the factors discussed elsewhere in this "Risk Factors" section. For instance, we cannot
assure you that the FDA will approve Twirla, that the FDA's timeline for review will be within six months, or that we will timely complete the qualification and validation of our commercial
manufacturing process. We have based this estimate on a number of assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and changing circumstances beyond our control may cause us to consume capital more rapidly
than we currently anticipate. Our inability to obtain additional funding when we need it could seriously harm our business and we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be
forced to reduce, or even terminate, our operations. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may seek additional capital through a combination of private and public equity offerings, debt financings and strategic collaborations. The
sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in the issuance of additional shares of our capital stock and could result in dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of
indebtedness would result in increased fixed payment obligations and could also result in certain restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our
ability to acquire or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. We cannot guarantee that future financing
will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we will be prevented
from pursuing research and development efforts. This could harm our business, operating results and financial condition and cause the price of our common stock to fall. </FONT></P>

We are substantially dependent on the commercial success of Twirla.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assuming FDA approval, Twirla will be the first product that we commercialize. The rest of our pipeline of products are in earlier stages of
clinical development and will require additional clinical and product development and funding in order to advance towards commercialization, which could take considerable time. If Twirla is not
approved, our business, results of operations and ability to advance our pipeline, would be significantly adversely affected. In addition, we will require additional capital for the validation of our
commercial manufacturing process and commercial launch of Twirla, if approved. Our ability to generate revenues and become profitable will depend in large part on the commercial success of Twirla.
Potential prescribers of Twirla include physicians, nurse practitioners, or NPs, physician's assistants, or Pas, and pharmacists. Registered Pharmacists, or RPh, are authorized to prescribe
contraceptives in some states currently, and others have pending legislation that would allow pharmacists to prescribe contraceptives. If Twirla or any other product that we commercialize in the
future does not gain an adequate level of acceptance among prescribers, patients and third parties, we may not generate significant product revenues or become profitable. Market acceptance of Twirla,
and any other product that we commercialize, by prescribers, patients and third-party payors will depend on a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control,

example, if Twirla is approved by the FDA, prescribers and patients may not be immediately receptive to a transdermal contraceptive system, as opposed to a pill or any other method,

head-to-head trials comparing Twirla to the competing approved patch product have been conducted, the prescribing information approved by the FDA may not contain claims that Twirla is safer or more
effective than the currently approved patch product, or other claims that may be necessary for successful marketing of Twirla. Accordingly, we will not be permitted to promote Twirla, if approved, for
any comparative advantages to the currently marketed contraceptive patch. The availability of numerous inexpensive </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Market acceptance and sales of Twirla, if approved, or any other product that we obtain marketing approval for in the future, will depend on
coverage and reimbursement policies and may be affected by future healthcare reform measures. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance
organizations, decide which medications they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels for approved medications. A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry is cost containment. Government
authorities and these third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. We cannot be sure that coverage or
reimbursement will be available for Twirla, if approved, or any other product that we obtain marketing approval for in the future and, if coverage is available, we cannot be sure of the level of
reimbursement. Reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, Twirla, if approved, and any other products that we obtain marketing approval for and commercialize. Numerous generic products
may be available at lower prices than branded therapy products, such as Twirla, which may also reduce the likelihood and level of reimbursement for Twirla or other products. If coverage and
reimbursement are not available or are available only at limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize Twirla, if approved, or any other product for which we obtain marketing
approval. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are seeking approval for Twirla from the FDA for a contraception indication. Following our original submission of the NDA, we received the
2013 CRL from the FDA requesting, among other things, additional Phase&nbsp;3 data. On December&nbsp;21, 2017, we received the 2017 CRL from the FDA citing deficiencies related to the
manufacturing process for Twirla, our manufacturer, and raising questions on the in vivo adhesion properties of Twirla and their potential relationship to our phase&nbsp;3 clinical trial results,
among other deficiencies further described in this Annual Report on Form&nbsp;10-K. Our ability to commercialize Twirla, and the timing of Twirla commercialization, is dependent on FDA's review of
our response to the 2017 CRL and our NDA for Twirla, and other items such as Corium's correction of objectionable conditions observed during the FDA inspection or the identification of an alternative
supplier, timely and successful completion of the validation of equipment
for commercial manufacturing, ultimate FDA approval, and additional capital. In January 2018, following our receipt of the 2017 CRL, we significantly scaled back our preparations for commercialization
of Twirla, including commercial pre-launch and manufacturing validation activities, pending our ability to address the 2017 CRL and receive approval of Twirla. Our current business plan assumes
resubmission of our NDA for Twirla in the second quarter of 2018, a six-month FDA review of our NDA resubmission, and resumption of both pre-launch commercial activities and pre-validation and
validation of our manufacturing process after Twirla approval, if the FDA approves Twirla. We will require additional capital to fund operating needs beyond 2018, including among other items, the
resumption and completion of our commercial plan for Twirla, which primarily includes the validation of our commercial manufacturing process and the commercial launch of Twirla, if approved, and

along with Corium, our third-party manufacturer, will be able to complete validation of our commercial manufacturing successfully and in a timely manner. </FONT></P>

addition, even if we obtain regulatory approval, the timing of an approval may reduce our ability to commercialize Twirla successfully. For example, if the approval process takes too
long, we may miss market opportunities, give other companies the ability to develop competing products, and require us to raise additional capital, which could delay our commercial launch. Any
regulatory approval we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render Twirla not commercially viable. For example, regulatory authorities may
grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials or other post-marketing commitments, including REMS, or may approve Twirla with a label that contains fewer, or
more limited, indications than requested, warnings, precautions or contraindications, including black box warnings, and the label may not include the claims necessary or desirable for the successful

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover,
we may face additional generic or other drug product competition sooner than we anticipate for Twirla or our other potential product candidates, which would potentially limit
their commercial success. We believe that we may be eligible for three years of FDA marketing exclusivity for Twirla and our other potential product candidates. The FDCA provides a period of three
years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, Section&nbsp;505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA for a drug product that contains a previously approved active moiety, if new clinical
investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, were conducted or sponsored by the applicant and are determined by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application.
This three-year marketing exclusivity, however, does not protect drug products from all competition. For instance, it does not protect against the approval of a full NDA. It also would only protect
against the approval of a product that contains the same conditions of approval as our product candidates. We may not receive the three-year exclusivity for any of our product candidates, and, even if
we do, it may not adequately
protect us from competition. Competition that our product candidates may face from generic or similar versions of our product candidates could materially and adversely impact our future revenue,
profitability and cash flows and substantially limit our ability to obtain a return on the investments we have made in those product candidates. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
Twirla is approved, but does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by prescribers, third-party payors and patients, we may not generate sufficient revenue and we may not be able
to achieve or sustain profitability. Our efforts to educate prescribers, patients and third-party payors on the benefits of Twirla may require significant resources and may never be successful. Even
if we are able to demonstrate and maintain a competitive advantage over our competitors and become profitable, if the market for hormonal contraceptives fails to achieve expected future growth or
decreases, we may not generate sufficient revenue or sustain profitability. Our ability to generate sufficient revenue from Twirla will also be dependent on our ability to support the commercial
demand for Twirla and we cannot assure you that we along with our manufacturing partner Corium will be able to complete validation of our commercial manufacturing successfully and in a timely manner,
and, ultimately, adequately meet the commercial demand for Twirla, if approved. </FONT></P>

The proportion of the contraceptive market that is made up of generic products continues to increase, making
introduction of a branded contraceptive difficult and expensive.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proportion of the U.S. market that is made up of generic products has been increasing over time. In 2005, generic contraceptive products
held 47% of prescription volume and 34% of sales and, by 2011, those values had risen to 68% and 44%, respectively. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2017, approximately 85% of the prescription
volume and approximately 50% of sales of combined hormonal contraceptives, or CHCs, in the U.S. were generated by generic products. Recently, Congress and the FDA have taken steps to increase generic
competition in the market. If this trend continues, it may be more difficult to introduce Twirla, if approved, as a branded contraceptive, at a price that will maximize our revenue and profits. Also,
there may be additional marketing costs to introduce Twirla in order to overcome the trend towards generics and to gain access to reimbursement by payors. If we are unable to introduce Twirla at a
price that is commensurate with that of current branded contraceptive products, or we are unable to gain reimbursement from payors for Twirla, or if patients are unwilling to pay any price
differential between Twirla and a generic contraceptive, our revenues will be limited. For example, in light of the introduction of the generic version of the Ortho Evra product by Mylan&nbsp;Inc.
in April 2014, and the subsequent discontinuation of distribution of Ortho Evra in October 2014 by Janssen in order to be competitive and gain market share, we may increase the rebates available to
commercial payors or we may provide incentives to consumers covered by non-governmental payors, such as coupons or rebates, in order to make up for the difference in the co-payment for Twirla and the
generic patch product. </FONT></P>

Prescribers, patients and payors may not adopt a new contraceptive patch due to concerns based upon the prior

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ortho Evra&reg; contraceptive patch, or Evra, was introduced in early 2002 and was the first FDA-approved contraceptive patch. The
following is a brief history of the Evra market experience:</FONT></P>

<UL>
<DL compact>
<DT style='font-family:times;margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2> Evra had rapid uptake in the contraceptive market, achieving a 10% share of the CHC market by September 2003. The initial approved labeling for
Evra indicated that it delivered a daily EE dose of 20 micrograms. </FONT><FONT SIZE=2>
<BR><BR></FONT></DD><DT style='font-family:times;margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2> Following the approval of Evra, the manufacturer of Evra and the FDA began receiving reports of thrombotic and thromboembolic events. </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2>
<BR><BR></FONT></DD><DT style='font-family:times;margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2> A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in 2005 and later published in the Journal of Clinical Pharmacology comparing Evra to an oral
contraceptive, which demonstrated that Evra was delivering higher serum concentrations of EE compared to an oral contraceptive with an EE dose of 35 micrograms. A pharmacokinetic study evaluates how
the body handles a given drug over time; these studies are conducted by measuring the amount of time it takes for the drug to be absorbed, distributed and eliminated throughout the body. </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2>
<BR><BR></FONT></DD><DT style='font-family:times;margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2> Johnson&nbsp;&amp; Johnson, the manufacturer of Evra, revised the Evra labeling in November 2005 to include information that EE exposure with
Evra is 60% higher than that of an oral contraceptive containing EE of 35 micrograms, based on area under the curve, a commonly-used metric for measuring EE exposure in contraceptives. This
information was ultimately included in a unique black box warning and bolded warning in the Evra labeling. </FONT><FONT SIZE=2>
<BR><BR></FONT></DD><DT style='font-family:times;margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2> The FDA held a Joint Meeting of the Advisory Committees for Reproductive Health Drugs and Drug Safety and Risk Management on December&nbsp;9,
2011. The Committees concluded that users of Evra have an increased risk of venous thromboembolism, or VTE compared to users of second generation contraceptives, such as those containing LNG. The
Committees, through a vote, concluded that the benefits of Evra outweighed the risks, but that the current package insert did not adequately reflect the risk/benefit profile. </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2>
<BR><BR></FONT></DD><DT style='font-family:times;margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2> A subsequent change to the labeling for Evra was implemented in August 2012. </FONT><FONT SIZE=2>
<BR><BR></FONT></DD><DT style='font-family:times;margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2> The Evra market share declined rapidly following the labeling changes, from a peak share of 11% in 2005, to 4% by the end of 2006, to 1.4% by
the end of 2013. </FONT><FONT SIZE=2>
<BR><BR></FONT></DD><DT style='font-family:times;margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2> In April 2014, the Evra label was revised to provide revised dosage form and strength information. However, this revision did not affect the
unique black box warning and bolded warning in the Evra label. </FONT><FONT SIZE=2>
<BR><BR></FONT></DD><DT style='font-family:times;margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2> The approval of a generic equivalent to Evra, Xulane&reg; was announced by Mylan&nbsp;Inc. in April 2014. Subsequently, in October
2014, Janssen discontinued distribution of Evra and currently over 99% of patch prescriptions are filled with the generic. </FONT></DD></DL>
</UL>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
have conducted pharmacokinetic studies of Twirla to demonstrate that it delivers a daily EE dose of approximately 30 micrograms, comparable to a low-dose oral contraceptive. However,
because none of our completed or planned clinical trials studied or expect to study Twirla in a head-to-head comparison with Evra, if Twirla is approved by the FDA, we will not be able to make direct
comparative claims regarding the safety and efficacy of Twirla as compared to Evra. While we expect Twirla, if approved, to have the same black box warning currently required for all CHCs, we cannot
predict whether the FDA will require that we include information in the Twirla labeling or black box warning regarding the additional risks associated with the Evra patch. Assuming approval, if we are
not able to convince prescribers, patients and payors that Twirla delivers a low daily dose of EE, this may limit uptake and usage of Twirla and our revenue will be limited. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive. We would have significant competition with contraceptive products
already in the marketplace, many of which have substantially greater name recognition, commercial infrastructures and financial, technical and personnel resources than we have. Any new product that
competes with a previously approved product may need to demonstrate compelling advantages in efficacy, convenience, tolerability or safety to be commercially successful. In addition, new products
developed by others could emerge as competitors to Twirla, if approved. If we are not able to compete effectively against our current and future competitors, our business will not grow and our
financial condition and operations will suffer. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
potential competitors include large, well-established pharmaceutical companies, and specialty pharmaceutical sales and marketing companies. These companies include
Merck&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Co.,&nbsp;Inc., or Merck, which markets Nuvaring&reg;, Allergan,&nbsp;Inc., or Allergan, which markets several branded and generic contraceptives including
Minastrin&reg; 24, LoLoestrin&reg;, and Taytulla&reg;, Bayer AG, or Bayer, which markets Beyaz&reg;, Yaz&reg;, Yasmin&reg;, and Natazia&reg;,
and Mylan&nbsp;Inc. which markets Xulane&#153;, a generic version of Ortho Evra. Additionally, several generic manufacturers currently market and continue to introduce new generic
contraceptives, including Sandoz International&nbsp;GmbH, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals&nbsp;Ltd., Lupin Pharmaceuticals,&nbsp;Inc., and Amneal Pharmaceuticals&nbsp;LLC. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There
are other contraceptive product candidates in development that, if approved, would potentially compete with Twirla. Specifically, Bayer has a contraceptive patch approved in the
European Union, or E.U. Bayer entered into a license and distribution agreement for the sale of this contraceptive patch in Europe with Gedeon Richter&nbsp;Ltd. Other companies that have new
contraceptive product candidates in various stages of development include Allergan (vaginal ring in Phase&nbsp;3) and Antares Pharma,&nbsp;Inc. (transdermal gel contraceptive in Phase&nbsp;2). </FONT></P>

Sales of our products, if approved, may be adversely affected by the consolidation among wholesale drug
distributors and the growth of large retail drug store chains.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The network through which we will sell our products, if and when approved, has undergone significant consolidation marked by mergers and
acquisitions among wholesale distributors and the growth of large retail drugstore chains. As a result, a small number of large distributors control a significant share of the market. In 2012, three
companies generated about 85% of all revenues from drug distribution in the United States, and in 2010, four chain pharmacy companies owned about 30% of all retail pharmacy outlets. Consolidation of
drug wholesalers and retailers, as well as any increased pricing pressure that those entities face from their customers, including the U.S. government, may increase pricing pressure and place other
competitive pressures on drug manufacturers, including us. </FONT></P>

Recently enacted and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain marketing
approval of and to commercialize Twirla and our other potential product candidates and may affect the prices we may obtain.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes
regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval for Twirla, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell Twirla. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legislative
and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. We do not know whether
additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the FDA's regulations, guidance or interpretations will change, or what the impact of such changes on the potential marketing approval of
Twirla, if any, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of the FDA's approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject us to more
stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
March 2010, President Obama signed into law the ACA, a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance
remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries,
impose new taxes and fees on the healthcare industry and impose additional healthcare policy reforms. The ACA, among other things, increased the Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the
Medicaid Drug Rebate Program for both branded and generic drugs, extended the rebate program to certain individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, addressed new methodologies by
which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are line extension products and expanded the 340B drug discount program (excluding orphan
drugs) to other entities. Further, the ACA imposed a significant annual tax on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products. Substantial new provisions affecting compliance
have also been enacted, which may require us to modify our business practices with regard to healthcare practitioners. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of
particular relevance to our business is the ACA requirement that all health plans, with limited exceptions, cover certain preventive services for women with no cost-sharing, which
means no deductible, no co-insurance and no co-payments by the patient. Contraceptive methods and counseling, including all FDA-approved contraceptive methods as prescribed, are included in the ACA
mandate, and this has come to be known as the "contraceptive mandate." Under the ACA, payors are only required to cover one favored product within each contraceptive "method" without imposing any
cost-sharing obligations on the patient. For example, the introduction of a generic contraceptive patch product with a price that will likely be lower than the price of Twirla makes it less clear that
Twirla would have a preferred position, such as coverage without a co-insurance payment, under the ACA contraceptive mandate. Other products within the same method may also be covered, but payors are
allowed to use reasonable medical management techniques, such as the application of cost-sharing obligations. An amendment was issued that provided an exemption to the contraceptive mandate for group
health plans established or maintained by religious employers. However, the contraceptive mandate has remained controversial, with several legal challenges filed around the country. In June 2014, the
U.S. Supreme Court ruled that owners of certain private companies can object to the contraceptive mandate on religious grounds and in November 2015, the Court agreed to hear arguments from non-profit
organizations requesting similar treatment. In October 2017, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced it will seek to issue regulations that will allow all companies to qualify for
the exemption from the contraceptive mandate on the basis of religious and moral grounds. Although it is too early to determine the full effect of the contraceptive mandate and other provisions of the
ACA on our business, the law appears likely to continue the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs.
Moreover, the U.S. Congress is potentially pursuing legislation, which, if passed and signed into law by the current administration, would repeal and possibly replace certain aspects of the ACA.
Further, on January&nbsp;20, 2017, the current administration signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant
exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers
of pharmaceuticals or medical devices among others. There are several proposals to reform the federal healthcare laws being advocated and it is still unclear whether such reform efforts will succeed
and if so, which proposals will ultimately be successful. Therefore, it is difficult to determine the full effect of the ACA or any other healthcare reform efforts on our business. Any replacement,
however, would likely provide less aggregate health care coverage. </FONT></P>

addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. On August&nbsp;2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among
other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for

2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation's automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to
providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April&nbsp;1, 2013 and will stay in effect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January&nbsp;2, 2013,
President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, or ATRA, which among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals,
imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. We expect that
additional federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, and
in turn could significantly reduce the projected value of our product candidates and reduce our profitability. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover,
the Drug Quality and Security Act imposes obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products related to product tracking and tracing. Among the requirements of this
legislation, manufacturers are required to provide certain information regarding the drug product to individuals and entities to which product ownership is transferred, will be required to label drug
product with a product identifier and are required to keep certain records regarding the drug product. The transfer of information to subsequent product owners by manufacturers will be required to be
done electronically. Manufacturers must also verify that purchasers of the manufacturers' products are appropriately licensed. Further, under this legislation, manufactures have drug product
investigation, quarantine, disposition, and FDA and trading partner notification responsibilities related to counterfeit, diverted, stolen and intentionally adulterated products, as well as products
that are the subject of fraudulent transactions or which are otherwise unfit for distribution such that they would be reasonably likely to result in serious health consequences or death. </FONT></P>

which Twirla or our other potential product candidates are sold through reimbursement schemes under national health insurance programs frequently require that manufacturers and sellers of
pharmaceutical products obtain governmental approval of initial prices and any subsequent price increases. In certain countries, including the United States, government-funded and private medical care
plans can exert significant indirect pressure on prices. We may not be able to sell Twirla or our other potential product candidates profitably if adequate prices are not approved or coverage and

Risks Related to Manufacturing and Our Reliance on Third Parties  </B></FONT></P>

We have no manufacturing capacity and anticipate continued reliance on Corium, our third-party manufacturer,
for the development and commercialization of our product candidates in accordance with manufacturing regulations.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We rely on Corium, our third-party manufacturer, to produce clinical supplies of Twirla and our other potential product candidates, and we plan
to continue relying on them for commercial supplies and samples of our product candidates, if approved. We do not own or operate, and have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities for our
product candidates. We lack the resources and the capabilities to manufacture Twirla or any of our product candidates on a clinical or commercial scale. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
do not control the manufacturing process of, and are completely dependent on Corium for compliance with the FDA's manufacturing regulatory requirements for manufacture of, our product
candidates and our products, if and when approved. If Corium or other contract manufacturers that we may use cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict
regulatory requirements of the FDA, they will not be able to secure or maintain regulatory approval for their manufacturing facilities. The facilities used by Corium to manufacture our product
candidates must be approved by the FDA pursuant to inspections that are conducted in connection with the FDA's review of our NDA for Twirla. On December&nbsp;21, 2017, the FDA issued the 2017 CRL,
indicating that our resubmitted NDA for Twirla could not be approved in its present form. The 2017 CRL identifies deficiencies relating to quality control adhesion test methods which are part of the
manufacturing process for Twirla. The 2017 CRL also noted that observations identified during a PAI for the Twirla NDA of Corium's facility must be resolved. Prior to receiving the 2017 CRL, we
submitted an amendment to our NDA on December&nbsp;1, 2017 in response to an information request from the FDA on the issues related to the quality control adhesion test methods reiterated in the
2017 CRL. In the 2017 CRL, the FDA acknowledged receipt of the amendment and stated that the amendment was not reviewed prior to the FDA's action. In addition, on November&nbsp;20, 2017 and
December&nbsp;1, 2017, Corium provided the FDA with responses to each of the observations made during the FDA's facility inspection, which included a PAI for Twirla. Under the FDA's regulations, we
are entitled to request a Type&nbsp;A meeting with the FDA within 90&nbsp;days of receiving a CRL, and the FDA has a goal to grant us a meeting date within 30&nbsp;days of the meeting request.
We have submitted a request for a Type&nbsp;A meeting to the FDA to discuss the deficiencies in the Twirla NDA and the regulatory path for approval of Twirla. We plan to provide an update on the
outcome of the Type&nbsp;A meeting after we receive the official meeting minutes from the FDA and we will then be better able to determine when we will resubmit our Twirla NDA. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition, while Corium has provided the FDA with responses to each of the observations made during the FDA's facility inspection, we expect that the FDA will re-inspect our
manufacturing partner's facilities during its review of our planned resubmission before approval can be granted. The FDA has the authority to re-inspect SECURE clinical trial sites as part of a review
of an NDA as well. The FDA may also determine that our responses to the manufacturing deficiencies in the 2017 CRL and Corium's responses to the manufacturing facility inspection objectionable
conditions are not sufficient or require product development and additional analyses and/or studies and deny approval of the Twirla NDA on this basis as well. For example, the FDA could determine that
we and Corium have not established comparability between the manufacturing process used in producing the clinical supplies for our SECURE clinical trial and the manufacturing process Corium plans to
use to produce commercial supplies of Twirla, if approved, which in turn could require us and Corium to perform additional work, incur significant costs and delay the timeline for the resubmission of
our NDA. The FDA may also find additional objectionable conditions upon re-inspection of the Corium facility. If the FDA does not approve the Corium facility for the manufacture of Twirla, or if
Corium is not able to address the objectionable conditions found by the FDA, we may need to find an alternative supplier, which will take time and monetary expenditures, and which we may not be able
to do on favorable terms to us or at all. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, we have no control over the ability of our contract manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. If
the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority does not approve these facilities for the manufacture of our product candidates or if it withdraws any such approval in the future, we may need to
find alternative manufacturing facilities that would also require FDA approval, and which would significantly impact our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or market our product
candidates, if approved. Moreover, if our contract manufacturer cannot successfully manufacture materials that conform to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA, we may
be subject to other regulatory enforcement action such as adverse inspectional findings, Warning Letters, Untitled Letters, recall requests, withdrawal of product or investigational approvals,
clinical holds or termination of clinical trials, refusals to approve pending applications, disgorgement, restitution, exclusion from federal healthcare programs product seizures and detention,
consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, criminal and civil penalties, including imprisonment, refusal to permit import or export of the product and injunction against or restriction of
manufacture or distribution. If our contract manufacturer experiences issues in its manufacturing process or is unable to produce clinical supplies in adequate quantity and quality, our clinical trial
could be delayed or our ability to receive regulatory approval of our product candidates could be negatively affected. Additionally, if there are changes to the manufacturing process for Twirla or to
our formulation for Twirla that require a change in the manufacturing process, we could experience significant additional cost and our ability to receive regulatory approval could be delayed. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
machinery and process to produce the commercial supply of Twirla must be qualified and validated, which is time-consuming and expensive, and this machinery is located within one
manufacturing site and is customized to the particular manufacturing specifications of Twirla. If Corium is unable to qualify and validate this equipment and the processes in a timely manner and
successfully produce validation batches, our ability to launch and commercialize Twirla will be compromised and we could require additional capital to complete the validation process. If this
customized equipment malfunctions at any time during the production process, the time it may take Corium to secure replacement parts, to undertake repairs and to revalidate the equipment and process
could limit our ability to meet the commercial demand for Twirla. Similar manufacturing conditions may also apply to our other product candidates. This may increase the risk that the third-party
manufacturer may not manufacture Twirla in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements, that we may not have sufficient quantities of Twirla or our potential product candidates or that we
may not have such quantities at an acceptable cost, any of which could delay, prevent, or impair the commercialization of Twirla, if approved, and the development of our other potential product
candidates. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although
we have manufacturing agreements with Corium for the clinical and commercial supply of Twirla, Corium and several of its suppliers of raw materials will be single source
providers to us for a significant period of time. In particular, Corium manufactures Twirla using EE and LNG and components that it purchases from third parties, most of which are single source
suppliers of the applicable material. We do not have any control over the process or timing of the acquisition of these raw materials by Corium. Although we generally do not begin a clinical trial
unless we believe we have a sufficient supply of a product candidate to complete the clinical trial, any significant delay in the supply of a product candidate, or the raw material components thereof,
for an ongoing clinical trial due to the need to replace a third-party manufacturer could considerably delay completion of our clinical trials, product testing and potential regulatory approval of our
product candidates. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because
we outsource all of our manufacturing processes, there is no guarantee that there will be sufficient supplies to fulfill our requirements or that we may obtain such supplies on
acceptable terms. Although Corium intends to enter into agreements with critical manufacturers, component fabricators and secondary service providers to secure commercial supply of Twirla, not all of
such suppliers and </FONT></P>

becomes necessary to engage an additional third-party manufacturer to produce Twirla, we may need to license certain manufacturing know-how from Corium, or our commercial supply will be limited while

that we may engage in the future to manufacture a product for commercial sale or for our clinical trials, should cease to continue to manufacture our product candidates for any reason, we likely would
experience delays in obtaining sufficient quantities of our product candidates for us to meet commercial demand or to advance our clinical trials while we identify and qualify alternative suppliers.

are available from another supplier, if any of these materials becomes unavailable to us for any reason, we likely would incur added costs and delays in identifying or qualifying replacement materials
and there can be no assurance that replacements would be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. In certain cases, we may be required to get regulatory approval to use alternative suppliers,
and this process of approval could delay development of our product candidates and, assuming FDA approval, commercial production of Twirla, indefinitely. For example, the sole manufacturer of one of
the components of the packaging of our Twirla patch notified us that it would be discontinuing manufacture of the component. We currently believe that manufacturing of this component has now been
discontinued. In conjunction
with Corium, we were able to secure an amount of inventory of the packaging component that we believe will last until at least 2019. We are currently evaluating sources for a replacement for this
discontinued component and, assuming FDA approval of this replacement material, we could eventually use the replacement material in connection with the commercial production of Twirla. </FONT></P>

We rely on third parties to conduct aspects of our clinical trials. If these third parties do not
successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines or comply with applicable regulatory requirements, we may be delayed in obtaining or ultimately not be able to obtain marketing
approval for our product candidates.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We currently rely on CROs and clinical trial sites for most aspects of our clinical trials, including trial conduct, data management,
statistical analysis and electronic compilation of our NDA. We may enter into agreements with additional CROs and clinical trial sites to obtain additional resources and expertise in an attempt to
accelerate our progress with regard to new or ongoing clinical and preclinical programs. Entering into relationships with CROs and clinical trial sites involves substantial cost and requires extensive
management time and focus. In addition, typically there is a transition period between engagement of a CRO and clinical trial sites and the time the CRO and sites commences work. As a result, delays
may occur, which may materially impact our ability to meet our desired clinical development timelines and ultimately have a material adverse impact on our operating results, financial condition or
future prospects. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
CROs and clinical investigators are not our employees, we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our clinical trials for which they are engaged to
perform, and whether they comply with the applicable regulatory requirements, known as Current Good Clinical Practices, or cGCPs, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA, the
Competent Authorities of the Member States of the European Economic Area, or EEA, and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for all of our product candidates in clinical development, which include
requirements related to the conduct of the study, subject informed consent, and IRB approval. Regulatory authorities enforce these cGCPs through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal
investigators and trial sites. Although we may rely on third parties for the execution of our trials, we are nevertheless responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance
with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory and scientific standards and our reliance on CROs and clinical trial sites does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. If we, any of our
CROs, or clinical trial sites fail to comply with applicable cGCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA, European Medicines Agency or comparable
foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications, in addition to the SECURE clinical trial. We cannot assure you that,
upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical trials complies with cGCP regulations. In addition, our clinical trials must be
conducted with product candidate materials produced in compliance with the FDA's manufacturing regulations. Our failure to comply with these regulations may require us to discontinue or repeat
clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process. If the CROs or clinical trial sites we engage do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations, conduct the
clinical trials in accordance with all regulatory requirements and the applicable protocols, or meet expected deadlines, or if they need to be replaced,
or the quality or accuracy of the data they provide is compromised due to the failure to adhere to regulatory requirements or for other reasons, then our development programs may be extended, delayed
or terminated, or we may not be able to obtain marketing approval for or successfully commercialize our product candidates. Failure to comply with clinical trial regulatory requirements may further
subject us to regulatory action, including Warning Letters, Untitled Letters, adverse inspectional findings, clinical holds or termination of clinical trials, non-approval of marketing applications,
criminal and civil penalties, including imprisonment, injunction against manufacture or distribution and debarment. As a result, our financial results and the commercial prospects for our product
candidates would be harmed and our costs would increase. </FONT></P>

require that precautions, contraindications, or warnings be included on the product labeling, including black box warnings, or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly and
time-consuming post-approval studies, including Phase&nbsp;4 clinical trials, and post-market surveillance to monitor safety and efficacy. Claims that we may make may also be restricted through our
approved labeling. For example, based on the SECURE clinical trial top-line data, the Pearl Index for the overall intent to treat population of subjects 35&nbsp;years of age and under was 4.80 with
an upper-bound of the 95% confidence interval of 6.06, but in the obese subpopulation of subjects 35&nbsp;years of age and under, the Pearl Index was 6.42 with an upper-bound of the 95% confidence
interval of 8.88. The highest Pearl Index for a hormonal contraceptive product approved by the FDA to date was 3.19 and the highest upper-bound of the 95% confidence interval was 5.03. In the combined
safety database for our three Agile Phase&nbsp;3 trials (n&gt;3,000), there were 5 subjects with potentially study drug related DVTs or PEs, 4 of whom were obese (BMI
<FONT FACE="SYMBOL">&#179;</FONT> 30 kg/m<SUP>2</SUP>). Although ultimate approvability of a hormonal contraceptive is based on a risk/benefit assessment of the overall safety and
efficacy profile of a product, not only a specific Pearl Index, the FDA could conclude that the Pearl Index in the overall population or a subpopulation is too high to demonstrate efficacy and an
adequate risk/benefit profile. As such, we may not obtain approval of Twirla based on these data or any other basis. Even if we receive approval of Twirla, FDA may determine that for a specific
subgroup of patients, Twirla has lower efficacy and presents a higher risk, necessitating labeling restrictions. For instance, FDA may require labeling restrictions on the use of Twirla for patients
in certain BMI categories or otherwise require labeling limitations or warnings for such subpopulation, which could limit the commercial potential of the product, if approved. FDA may further require
us to include other information and/or data in the label for Twirla that may make it more difficult for us to successfully commercialize the product, if approved. For instance, FDA may require us to
include the Pearl Index results from the previously conducted Phase&nbsp;3 trials, which were higher than the SECURE clinical trial's overall and certain sub-group Pearl Index results. We will
discuss specific labeling requirements with the FDA in the future. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
approved, Twirla and our other potential product candidates, if approved, will also be subject to ongoing regulatory requirements governing the manufacturing, labeling, packaging,
storage, distribution, import, export, safety surveillance, advertising, marketing promotion, recordkeeping, reporting of adverse events and other post-market information, and further development.
These requirements include registration with the FDA, listing of our drug products, payment of annual fees, as well as continued compliance with cGCPs for any clinical trials that we conduct
post-approval. Application holders must notify the FDA, and depending on the nature of the change, obtain FDA pre-approval for product manufacturing changes. In addition, manufacturers of drug
products and their facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with the FDA's manufacturing requirements relating to
quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents. If we are found to be noncompliant with applicable requirements, the FDA and other government authorities may
issue a Warning Letter or Untitled Letter, or take other regulatory action such as a product seizure and detention, withdrawal of product approval, request for a recall, refusal to allow the import or
export of the product, criminal or civil penalties, injunction against or restriction of manufacture or distribution, consent decrees, disgorgement, restitution, clinical holds or terminations of
clinical trials, exclusion from federal healthcare programs, corporate integrity agreements, or imprisonment. </FONT></P>

FDA has the authority to require a REMS as part of an NDA or after approval, which may impose further requirements or restrictions on the information that patients must be provided,

U.S. Prescription Drug Marketing Act. We may also be subject, directly or indirectly through our customers and partners, to various fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the U.S.
Anti-Kickback Statute, U.S. False Claims Act and similar state laws, which impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs. If we participate in the
U.S. Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, the Federal Supply Schedule of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, or other government drug programs, we will be subject to complex laws and regulations
regarding reporting and payment obligations. All of these activities are also potentially subject to U.S. federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. Similar requirements exist
in many of these areas in other countries. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition, if Twirla and our other potential product candidates are approved, our product labeling, advertising and promotional materials would be subject to regulatory requirements
and continuing review by the FDA, Department of Justice, Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General, state attorneys general, members of Congress and the public. The FDA
strictly regulates the promotional claims that may be made about prescription products. In particular, a product may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA as reflected in the
product's approved labeling, a practice known as off-label promotion. If we receive marketing approval for Twirla or our other potential product candidates, physicians may nevertheless prescribe the
products to their patients in a manner that is inconsistent with the approved label. If we are found to have promoted such off-label uses, we may become subject to significant liability and government
fines. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be
subject to significant sanctions. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion and has enjoined several companies from engaging in
off-label promotion. The FDA has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees of permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed. For example, we
believe that Twirla, if approved, will have a label consistent with all other marketed hormonal contraceptive products, which include class labeling that warns of risks of certain serious conditions,
including venous and arterial blood clots, such as heart attacks, thromboembolism and stroke, as well as liver tumors, gallbladder disease, and hypertension, and a black box warning regarding risks of
smoking and CHC use, particularly in women over 35&nbsp;years old that smoke. However, regulatory authorities may require the
inclusion of additional statements about adverse events in the label, including additional black box warnings or contraindications. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the United States, engaging in the impermissible promotion of our products, following approval, for off-label uses can also subject us to false claims litigation under federal and
state statutes, which can lead to civil and criminal penalties and fines, agreements with governmental authorities that materially restrict the manner in which we promote or distribute drug products
through, for example, corporate integrity agreements, and debarment, suspension or exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs. These false claims statutes include the
federal civil False Claims Act, which allows any individual to bring a lawsuit against a pharmaceutical company on behalf of the federal government alleging submission of false or fraudulent claims or
causing others to present such false or fraudulent claims, for payment by a federal program such as Medicare or Medicaid. If the government decides to intervene and prevails in the lawsuit, the
individual will share in the proceeds from any fines or settlement funds. If the government declines to intervene, the individual may pursue the case alone. Since 2004, these False Claims Act lawsuits
against pharmaceutical companies have increased significantly in volume and breadth, leading to several substantial civil and criminal settlements regarding certain sales practices promoting off-label
drug uses involving fines that are as much as $3.0&nbsp;billion. This growth in litigation has increased the risk that a pharmaceutical company will have to defend a false claim action, pay
settlement fines or restitution, as well as criminal and civil </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to market Twirla or any other potential product candidate outside the United States, we must obtain separate marketing approvals and
comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials and commercial sales, pricing and
distribution of our product candidates. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. The marketing approval
process in other countries may include all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval in the United States, as well as other risks. For example, legislation analogous to
Section&nbsp;505(b)(2) of the FDCA in the United States, which relates to the ability of an NDA applicant to use published data not developed by such applicant, may not exist in other countries. In
territories where data is not freely available, we may not have the ability to commercialize our products, when and if approved, without negotiating rights from third parties to refer to their
clinical data in our regulatory applications, which could require the expenditure of significant additional funds. Further, we may be unable to obtain rights to the necessary clinical data and may be
required to develop our own proprietary safety and efficacy dossiers. In addition, in many countries outside the United States, it is required that a product receive pricing and reimbursement approval
before the product can be commercialized. This can result in substantial delays in such countries. Further, the product labeling requirements outside the United States may be different and
inconsistent with the U.S. labeling and to the detriment to the product, and therefore negatively affect the ability to market in countries outside the United States. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marketing
approval in one country does not ensure marketing approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining marketing approval in one country may have a negative effect on the
regulatory process in others. In addition, we may be subject to fines, suspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal
prosecution if we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements. If we fail to comply with regulatory requirements in international markets or to obtain and maintain required
approvals, our ability to market to our full target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of our product candidates will be harmed. </FONT></P>

require approval from the FDA regardless of whether we have secured a formal trademark registration from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO. The FDA typically conducts a review of proposed
product names, including an evaluation of the potential for confusion with other product names. The FDA may also object to a product name if it believes the name inappropriately implies medical claims
or contributes to an overstatement of efficacy. If the FDA objects to any of our proposed product names, we may be required to adopt alternative names for our product candidates. If we adopt
alternative names, we would lose the benefit of our existing trademark applications for such product candidate and may be required to expend significant additional resources in an effort to identify a
suitable product name that would qualify under applicable trademark laws, not infringe the existing rights of third parties and be acceptable to the FDA. We may be unable to build a successful brand
identity for a new trademark in a timely manner or at all, which would limit our ability to commercialize our product candidates. </FONT></P>

risk of our being found in violation of these laws and regulations is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the relevant government or regulatory
authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Moreover, recent healthcare reform legislation has strengthened these laws. For example, the ACA, among other
things, amended the intent requirement of the federal anti-kickback and criminal healthcare fraud statutes; such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of these statutes or
specific intent to violate them. In addition, the ACA provided that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute
constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims statutes. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Efforts
to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations are costly. It is possible that governmental authorities
will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our
operations, including anticipated activities conducted by our sales team in the sale of Twirla or our other potential product candidates, if approved, are found to be in violation of any of these laws
or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to a variety of different consequences, depending upon which law we are found to have violated, including significant
civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, corporate integrity agreements, refusal of government
contracts, contract debarment and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found to not be in

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We depend on our ability to protect our proprietary technology. We rely on trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws, and
confidentiality, licensing and other agreements with employees and third parties, all of which offer only limited protection. Our success depends in large part on our ability and any future licensee's
ability to maintain our patents and to obtain additional patent protection in the United States and other countries with respect to our proprietary technology and products. We believe we will be able
to obtain, through prosecution of our pending patent applications, additional patent protection for our proprietary technology. If we are compelled to spend significant time and money protecting or
enforcing our patents, designing around patents held by others or licensing or acquiring, potentially for large fees, patents or other proprietary rights held by others, our business and financial
prospects may be harmed. If we are unable to effectively protect the intellectual property that we own, other companies may be able to offer for sale the same or similar products containing the
generically available active pharmaceutical ingredients in our product candidates, which could materially adversely affect our competitive business position and harm our business prospects. Our
patents may be challenged, narrowed, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing the same or similar products or limit the length of term of patent
protection that we may have for our product candidates. Even if our patents are unchallenged, they may not adequately protect our intellectual property, provide exclusivity for our product candidates
or prevent others from designing around our claims. Any of these outcomes could impair our ability to prevent competition from third parties, which may have an adverse impact on our business. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The

Recent patent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of
our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On September&nbsp;16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a
number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. In particular, under the
Leahy-Smith Act, the United States transitioned in March 2013 to a "first to file" system in which the first inventor to file&nbsp;a patent application will be entitled to the patent. Third parties
are allowed to submit prior art before the issuance of a patent by the USPTO and may become involved in post-grant proceedings including reexamination, post-grant review, inter-partes review, or
derivation or interference proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope or
enforceability of, or invalidate, our patent rights, which could adversely affect our competitive position. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
USPTO has developed regulations and procedures to govern administration of the Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act,
and in particular, the first to file provisions, did not become effective until March&nbsp;16, 2013. However, the full impact of the Leahy-Smith Act and the courts' review of any appeals to related
proceedings, is in its early stages. Accordingly, the full impact that the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business is not clear. However, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation
could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, as well as our ability to bring about timely

Obtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, documentary,

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Periodic maintenance fees on any issued patent are due to be paid to the USPTO and foreign patent agencies in several stages over the lifetime
of the patent. The USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent
application process. While an inadvertent lapse can in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which
noncompliance can result in unenforceability, invalidity, abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction.
Noncompliance events that could result in unenforceability, invalidity, abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include, but are not limited to, failure to respond to official actions
within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. If we or any future licensors fail to maintain the patents and patent applications

We may infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which may prevent or delay our product
development efforts and stop us from commercializing or increase the costs of commercializing our products, when and if approved.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our commercial success depends significantly on our ability to operate without infringing the patents and other intellectual property rights of
third parties. For example, there could be issued patents of which we are not aware that our current or future product candidates infringe. There also could be patents that we believe we do not
infringe, but that we may ultimately be found to infringe. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover,
patent applications are in some cases maintained in secrecy until patents are issued. The publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature frequently occurs
substantially later than the date on which the underlying discoveries were made and patent applications were filed. There may be currently pending applications of which we are unaware that may later
result in issued patents that our current or future product candidates infringe. For example, pending applications may exist that claim or can be amended to claim subject matter that our current or
future product candidates infringe. Competitors may file continuing patent applications claiming priority to already issued patents in the
form of continuation, divisional or continuation-in-part applications, in order to maintain the pendency of a patent family and attempt to cover our product candidates. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third
parties may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization and may sue us for patent or other intellectual property infringement or
misappropriation. These lawsuits are costly and could adversely affect our results of operations and divert the attention of managerial and scientific personnel. If we are sued for patent
infringement, we would need to demonstrate that our product candidates or methods either do not infringe the claims of the relevant patent or that the patent claims are invalid or unenforceable, and
we may not be able to do this. Proving invalidity or unenforceability is difficult. For example, in the United States, proving invalidity requires a showing of clear and convincing evidence to
overcome the presumption of validity enjoyed by issued patents. Even if we are successful in these proceedings, we may incur substantial costs and the time and attention of our management and
scientific personnel could be diverted in pursuing these proceedings, which could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, we may not have sufficient resources to bring these actions to a
successful conclusion. If a court holds that any third-party patents are valid, enforceable and cover our product candidates or their use, the holders of any of these patents may be able to block our
ability to commercialize our product candidates unless we acquire or obtain a license under the applicable patents or until the patents expire. We may not be able to enter into licensing arrangements
or make other arrangements at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms. Any inability to secure licenses or alternative technology could result in delays in the introduction of our product candidates
or lead to prohibition of the manufacture or sale of product candidates by us. Even if we are able to obtain a license, it may be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same
technologies licensed to us. We could be forced, including by court order, to cease commercializing the infringing technology or product. In addition, in any such proceeding or litigation, we could be
found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys' fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing
our product candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could materially harm our business. Any claims by third parties that we have misappropriated their confidential
information, know-how or trade secrets could have a similar negative impact on our business. In addition, any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could have
a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our operations. </FONT></P>

We may be subject to claims that we or our employees have misappropriated the intellectual property,

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of our employees, consultants and contractors were previously employed at or engaged by biotechnology companies or other pharmaceutical
companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Some of these employees, consultants and contractors, including each member
of our senior management, executed proprietary rights, non-disclosure and non-competition agreements in connection with such previous employment. Although we try to ensure that our employees,
consultants and contractors do not use the intellectual property and other proprietary information or know-how or trade secrets of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or
these employees, consultants and contractors have used or disclosed such intellectual property, including know-how, trade secrets or other proprietary information. Litigation may be necessary to
defend against these claims. We are not aware of any threatened or pending claims related to these matters or concerning agreements with our senior management, or other of our employees, consultants
and contractors, but litigation may be necessary in the future to defend against such claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable
intellectual property rights, or personnel or access to consultants and contractors. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a
distraction to management. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition, while we typically require our employees, consultants and contractors who may be involved in the development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such
intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who in fact develops intellectual property that we regard as our own, which may result in claims by
or against us related to the ownership of such intellectual property. If we fail in prosecuting or defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual
property rights. Even if we are successful in prosecuting or defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to our management and scientific

We may be unable to adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary technological advances and know-how, especially where we do not believe patent protection is
appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We rely in part on confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, contractors, outside scientific
collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors, including the third parties we rely on to manufacture our product candidates, to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information.
However, any party with whom we have executed such an agreement may breach that agreement and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets. Accordingly, these agreements may not
effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. Costly and time-consuming
litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights. In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets and proprietary information. Further, the
FDA, as part of its Transparency Initiative, a proposal to increase disclosure and make data more accessible to the public, is currently considering whether to make additional information publicly
available on a routine basis, including information that we may consider to be trade secrets or other proprietary information, and it is not clear at the present time how the FDA's disclosure policies
may change in the future, if at all. Failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could enable competitors to use our proprietary information to develop products that compete with our
products or cause additional, material adverse effects upon our competitive business position and financial results. </FONT></P>

Any lawsuits relating to infringement of intellectual property rights brought by or against us will be costly
and time consuming and may adversely impact the price of our common stock.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may be required to initiate litigation to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights. These lawsuits can be very time consuming and
costly. There is a substantial amount of litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical industry generally. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially
increase our operating expenses and reduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing or distribution activities. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
infringement litigation, any award of monetary damages we receive may not be commercially valuable. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection
with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information and trade secrets could be compromised by disclosure during litigation. Moreover, there can be no
assurance that we will have sufficient financial or other resources to file and pursue such infringement claims, which typically last for years before they are resolved. Further, any claims we assert
against a perceived infringer could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging that we have infringed their patents. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of
such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other
proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition, our patents and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdiction could face other challenges, such as derivation or interference proceedings, opposition
proceedings, </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>inter partes</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> review, reexamination proceedings, third party submissions of prior art, and other forms of post-grant challenges. In the
United States, for example, post-grant review, which is similar to opposition proceedings available in many countries other than the U.S., was newly established by the Leahy-Smith Act. Any of these
challenges, if successful, could result in the invalidation of, or in a narrowing of the scope or preventing the issuance of, any of our patents and patent applications subject to challenge. Any of
these challenges, regardless of their success, would likely be time consuming and expensive to defend and resolve and would divert our management and scientific personnel's time and attention. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In

If we fail to develop and commercialize Twirla and our current pipeline of additional potential product
candidates, our prospects for future growth and our ability to reach or sustain profitability may be limited.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A key element of our long-term strategy is to develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize our portfolio of potential product
candidates in addition to Twirla. To do so, we plan to utilize our proprietary transdermal delivery technology, Skinfusion, to develop additional potential product candidates. We may not be successful
in our efforts to develop our portfolio of additional potential product candidates, and any product candidates we do develop may not produce commercially viable products that safely and effectively
treat their indicated conditions. To date, our efforts have identified three additional potential product candidates in addition to Twirla, including AG200-ER, which is a regimen designed to allow a
woman to extend the length of her cycle, AG200-SP, which is a regimen designed to provide shorter, lighter periods, and AG890, which is a progestin-only contraceptive patch intended for use by women
who are unable or unwilling to take
estrogen. AG200-SP and AG200-ER are intended to be Twirla line extensions that would expand the use of Twirla beyond its initial approved use. In July 2016, we began preparations for an initial
Phase&nbsp;2 clinical trial examining the use of AG200-SP along with a smaller lower dose combination ethinyl estradiol/levonorgestrel patch (SmP) in the fourth week of the woman's cycle. We have
decided to postpone the trial and will continue to evaluate the timing for initiating dosing of subjects for this Phase&nbsp;2 clinical trial, which is dependent on financial and other capital
resources. Our planned Phase&nbsp;2 clinical trial of AG200-SP (SmP) is only the initial clinical trial in this program and AG200-SP (SmP) may require additional clinical trials to establish the
safety and efficacy of this product candidate. The other potential product candidates in our pipeline will require additional product development efforts to optimize patch formulations and dosing. In
addition, we will need to conduct additional clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of these potential product candidates which will require additional capital. Our ability to develop
these potential product candidates, in particular AG200-SP and AG200-ER, could be significantly affected by our inability to get Twirla approved. Substantially all of our resources are currently
dedicated to developing and seeking regulatory approval for Twirla. We will require additional capital to resume and complete the commercialization plan for Twirla, if approved and to advance the
development of our other potential product candidates. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
development programs may initially show promise in identifying potential product leads yet fail to produce product candidates for clinical development. In addition, identifying new
treatment needs and product candidates requires substantial technical, financial and human resources on our part. If we are unable to obtain development partners or additional development program
funding, or to continue to devote substantial technical and human resources to such programs, we may have to delay or abandon these programs. Any product candidate that we successfully identify may
require substantial additional development efforts prior to commercial sale, including preclinical studies, extensive clinical testing and approval by the FDA and applicable foreign regulatory
authorities. All product candidates are susceptible to the risks of failure that are inherent in pharmaceutical product development. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The licensing and acquisition of pharmaceutical products is competitive. A number of more established companies are also pursuing strategies to
license or acquire products. These established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, cash resources or greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities.
In addition, we expect competition in acquiring product candidates to increase, which may lead to fewer suitable acquisition opportunities for us as well as higher acquisition prices. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Various macroeconomic factors could adversely affect our business and the results of our operations and financial condition, including changes
in inflation, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, and overall economic conditions and uncertainties, including those resulting from political instability and the current and future
conditions in the global financial markets. For instance, if inflation or other factors were to significantly increase our business costs, it may not be feasible to pass through price increases to
patients. Interest rates, the liquidity of the credit markets and the volatility of the capital markets could also affect the value of our investments and our ability to liquidate our investments in
order to fund our operations, if necessary. </FONT></P>

rates and the ability to access credit markets could also adversely affect the ability of patients, payors and distributors to purchase, pay for and effectively distribute our
products if and when approved. Similarly, these macroeconomic factors could affect the ability of our current or potential future contract manufacturers, sole-source or single-source suppliers, or
licensees to remain in business or otherwise manufacture or supply our product candidates. Failure by any of them to remain in business could affect our ability to manufacture product candidates. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a public company, we continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. In
addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and the Nasdaq Global Market, impose various requirements on public companies, including requiring establishment
and maintenance of effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting and changes in corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial
amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs and have made some activities more time-consuming and
costly. We estimate that we will annually incur approximately $2.0&nbsp;million in expenses in response to these requirements. </FONT></P>

internet, attachments to emails, persons inside our organization, or persons with access to systems inside our organization. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through
cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments, and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and
intrusions from around the world have increased. If such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our drug development programs.
For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or ongoing or planned clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to
recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or
proprietary information, we could incur liability and the further development of our product candidates could be delayed. </FONT></P>

Our ability to use net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain built-in losses to reduce

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sections&nbsp;382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, contain rules that limit the ability of a company
that undergoes an ownership change, which is generally any change in ownership of more than 50% of its stock over a three-year period, to utilize its net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards
and certain built-in losses recognized in years after the ownership change. These rules generally operate by focusing on ownership changes involving stockholders owning, directly or indirectly, 5% or
more of the stock of a company and any change in ownership arising from a new issuance of stock by the company. Generally, if an ownership change occurs, the yearly taxable income limitation on the
use of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain built-in losses is equal to the product of the applicable long-term tax exempt rate and the value of the company's stock immediately
before the ownership change. We may be unable
to offset future taxable income, if any, with losses, or our tax liability with credits, before such losses and credits expire and therefore would incur larger federal income tax liability. Our net
operating loss carryforwards arising in taxable years ending on or prior to December&nbsp;31, 2017 will expire between 2018 and 2037 if we have not used. Net operating loss carryforwards arising in
taxable years ending after December&nbsp;31, 2017 are no longer subject to expiration under the Code. </FONT></P>

the operating performance of these companies. In the past, when the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock have instituted securities class action litigation against the
company that issued the stock. If any of our stockholders brought a lawsuit against us, we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit. Such a lawsuit could also divert the time and attention

directors and the
approval of mergers or other business combination transactions. These stockholders may be able to determine all matters requiring stockholder approval. The interests of these stockholders may not
always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders. This may also prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that other stockholders
may feel are in their best interest and our large stockholders may act in a manner that advances their best interests and not necessarily those of other stockholders, including seeking a premium value

fail to meet our reporting obligations. In addition, any testing by us conducted in connection with Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or the subsequent testing by our independent
registered public accounting firm, may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses or that may require prospective or retroactive
changes to our financial statements or identify other areas for further attention or improvement. If we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if
our independent registered public accounting firm determines we have a material weakness or significant deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting once that firm begin its
Section&nbsp;404 reviews, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to
sanctions or investigations by the Nasdaq Global Market, the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to

Overview  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a forward-thinking women's healthcare company dedicated to fulfilling the unmet health needs of today's women. Twirla and our other
current potential product candidates are designed to provide women with contraceptive options that offer greater convenience and facilitate compliance. Our lead product candidate, Twirla&reg;,
also known as AG200-15, is a once-weekly prescription contraceptive patch that is at the end of Phase&nbsp;3 clinical development. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since
our inception in 1997, we have devoted substantial resources to developing Twirla, building our intellectual property portfolio, business planning, raising capital and providing
general and administrative support for these operations. We incurred research and development expenses of $14.4&nbsp;million, $20.9&nbsp;million and $25.6&nbsp;million during the years ended
December&nbsp;31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We anticipate that a portion of our operating expenses will continue to be related to research and development as we continue to develop Twirla
and advance our pipeline of potential product candidates. Substantially all of our resources are currently dedicated to developing and seeking regulatory approval for Twirla. We will require
additional capital to fund our operating needs beyond 2018 including, among other items, the resumption and completion of our commercial plan for Twirla, which primarily includes the validation of our
manufacturing process and the commercial launch of Twirla, if approved, and advancing the development of our other potential product candidates. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
have funded our operations primarily through sales of common stock, convertible preferred stock, convertible promissory notes and term loans. As of December&nbsp;31, 2017, and 2016,
respectively, we had $35.9&nbsp;million and $48.8&nbsp;million in cash and cash equivalents. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
May 2014, we completed our initial public offering whereby we sold 9,166,667 shares of common stock, at a public offering price of $6.00 per share, before underwriting discounts and
expenses. The aggregate net proceeds received by us from the initial public offering were approximately $49.7&nbsp;million. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
January 2015, we completed a private placement of approximately 3.4&nbsp;million shares of common stock at $5.85 per share. Proceeds from the private placement, net of commissions
and other offering costs were approximately $19.3&nbsp;million. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
February 2015, we entered into a loan and security agreement with Hercules Technology Growth Capital,&nbsp;Inc. or Hercules, for a term loan of up to $25.0&nbsp;million, which we
refer to as the Hercules Loan Agreement. A first tranche of $16.5&nbsp;million was funded upon execution of the Hercules Loan Agreement, approximately $15.5&nbsp;million of which was used to repay
our existing term loan. The Hercules Loan Agreement was amended in August 2016 to, among other things, extend the period during which we could have drawn the additional tranche of $8.5&nbsp;million
to March&nbsp;31, 2017 and
extended the period during which we make interest-only payments until January&nbsp;31, 2017. The Hercules Loan Agreement was further amended in May 2017 to extend the period during which we could
have drawn the additional tranche of $8.5&nbsp;million to January&nbsp;31, 2018. We are currently in discussions with Hercules to extend the period during which the additional tranche of
$8.5&nbsp;million may be drawn. We can make no assurances that our discussions will ultimately be successful and, if such discussions result </FONT></P>

an extension of the periods in which we may draw the additional tranche of $8.5&nbsp;million, we could incur additional fees to Hercules. On February&nbsp;1, 2017, we began making principal
payments with respect to the Hercules Loan. See further discussion in "Funding Requirements and Other Liquidity Matters" below. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
January 2016, we closed an underwritten public offering of 5,511,812 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $6.35 per share. In February 2016, the underwriters of the
public offering of common stock exercised in full their option to purchase an additional 826,771 shares of common stock at the public offering price of $6.35 per share, less underwriting discounts and
commissions. A total of 6,338,583 shares of common stock were sold in the public offering, resulting in total net proceeds of approximately $37.5&nbsp;million. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
August 2017, we completed an underwritten public offering of 5,333,334 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $3.75 per share. Proceeds from our August 2017 public
offering, net of underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering costs were approximately $18.5&nbsp;million. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
December&nbsp;21, 2017, the FDA issued a complete response letter, or the 2017 CRL, indicating that our resubmitted NDA for Twirla could not be approved in its present form. The
2017 CRL identifies deficiencies relating to quality control adhesion test methods and specification which are part of the manufacturing process for Twirla. The 2017 CRL also noted that objectionable
conditions identified during an inspection for the Twirla NDA of our third-party manufacturer, Corium International&nbsp;Inc., or Corium's, facility must be resolved. Prior to receiving the 2017
CRL, we submitted an amendment to our NDA on December&nbsp;1, 2017 in response to an information request from the FDA on the issues related to the quality control adhesion test methods cited in the
2017 CRL. In the 2017 CRL, the FDA acknowledged receipt of the amendment and stated that the amendment was not reviewed prior to the FDA's action. In addition, on November&nbsp;20, 2017 and
December&nbsp;1, 2017, Corium provided the FDA with responses to each of the observations made during the FDA's facility inspection. We believe that the Corium submissions along with our
December&nbsp;1, 2017 NDA amendment will provide a basis for addressing the 2017 CRL. Under the FDA's regulations, we are entitled to request a Type&nbsp;A meeting with the FDA within
90&nbsp;days of receiving a CRL, and the FDA has a goal to grant us a meeting date within 30&nbsp;days of the meeting request. We have submitted a request for a Type&nbsp;A meeting to the FDA to
discuss the deficiencies in the Twirla NDA and the regulatory path for approval of Twirla. We plan to provide an update on the outcome of the Type&nbsp;A meeting after we receive the official
meeting minutes from the FDA and we will then be better able to determine when we will resubmit our Twirla NDA. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition, while Corium has provided the FDA with responses to each of the observations made during the FDA's facility inspection, we expect that the FDA will re-inspect our
manufacturing partner's facilities during its review of our planned resubmission before approval can be granted. The FDA has the authority to re-inspect SECURE clinical trial sites as part of a review
of an NDA as well. The FDA may also determine that our responses to the manufacturing deficiencies in the 2017 CRL and Corium's responses to the manufacturing facility inspection observations are not
sufficient or require additional analyses and/or studies and deny approval of the Twirla NDA on this basis as well. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
connection with the receipt of the 2017 CRL, and the delay in the approval timeline for Twirla, our ability to continue operations after December&nbsp;31, 2018 will depend on our
ability to obtain additional funding. There can be no assurance that any financing by us can be realized, or if realized, what the terms of any such financing may be, or that any amount that we are
able to raise will be adequate. Based upon the foregoing there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. See further discussion in "Funding Requirements and Other
Liquidity Matters" in this section. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
have not generated any revenue and have never been profitable for any year. Our net loss was $28.3&nbsp;million, $28.7&nbsp;million and $30.3&nbsp;million for the years ended
December&nbsp;31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We expect to incur increased expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable </FONT></P>

as we seek the approval of our New Drug Application, or NDA for Twirla, complete the qualification and validation of our commercial manufacturing process, initiate pre-launch commercial
activities, commercially launch Twirla, if approved, advance our other potential product candidates and expand our research and development programs. Substantially all of our resources are currently
dedicated to developing and seeking regulatory approval for Twirla. We will require additional capital to fund our operating needs beyond 2018 including, among other items, the resumption and
completion of our commercial plan for Twirla, which primarily includes the validation of our commercial manufacturing process and the commercial launch of Twirla, if approved, and advancing the
development of our other potential product candidates. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
do not own any manufacturing facilities and rely on Corium for all aspects of the manufacturing of Twirla. We will continue to invest in the manufacturing process for Twirla, and
incur significant expenses, in order to complete the equipment qualification and validation related to the expansion of Corium's manufacturing capabilities in order to be capable of supplying
projected commercial quantities of Twirla, if approved. We continue to plan the process of scaling up the commercial manufacturing capabilities for Twirla with Corium and the associated costs and
timelines. We expect the validation and expansion of our commercial manufacturing process to be completed after the approval of Twirla. If we obtain regulatory approval for Twirla, we expect to incur
significant expenses in order
to create an infrastructure to support the commercialization of Twirla, including sales, marketing, distribution, medical affairs and compliance functions, which will require additional capital. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. Accordingly, we will need additional financing to support our continuing
operations and pipeline in addition to the commercial activities required for the pre-launch and launch of Twirla, if approved. We will seek to fund our operations through public or private equity or
debt financings or other sources, which may include collaborations with third parties. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Our failure to raise
capital as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy. We will need to generate significant revenue to achieve
profitability, and we may never do so. </FONT></P>

Revenue  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To date, we have not generated any revenue. In the future, we may generate revenue from product sales, license fees, milestone payments and
royalties from the sale of products developed using our intellectual property. Our ability to generate revenue and become profitable depends on our ability to successfully commercialize Twirla and any
product candidates that we may advance in the future. If we fail to complete the development of Twirla or any other potential product candidates we advance in a timely manner or obtain regulatory
approval for them, our ability to generate future revenue, and our results of operations and financial position, will be adversely affected. </FONT></P>

Research and Development Expenses  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since our inception, we have focused our resources on our research and development activities. Research and development expenses consist

and development costs are expensed as incurred. Costs for certain development activities, such as clinical trials, are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to
completion of specific tasks using data such as subject enrollment, clinical site activations or information provided to us by our third-party vendors. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research
and development activities are central to our business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in
earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We do not currently utilize a formal time allocation system to capture expenses
on a project-by-project basis, as the majority of our past and planned expenses have been and will be in support of Twirla. In 2018, we expect our research and development expenses to remain
relatively consistent with 2017 expenses. Research and development expenses in 2018 will consist primarily of those costs associated with the continued development and refinement of our commercial
manufacturing process, preparation and resubmission of the NDA for Twirla, and responding to information requests expected to be received from the FDA as part of their review of our NDA resubmission.
In response to the 2017 CRL, we have significantly scaled back equipment qualification and validation of our commercial manufacturing process and resumption and completion of these activities will
require additional capital. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
date, our research and development expenses have related primarily to the development of Twirla. We expect research and development expenses in 2018 to focus on preparing the
resubmission of our new drug application, or NDA, and also toward the qualification and validation of our commercial manufacturing process. For the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2017, 2016 and 2015,
our research and development expenses were approximately $14.4&nbsp;million, $20.9&nbsp;million and $25.6&nbsp;million, respectively. The following table summarizes our research and development

potential product candidates in addition to Twirla will depend on a variety of factors, including the uncertainties of future clinical trials and preclinical studies, the rate of subject
enrollment, obtaining additional capital, and significant and changing government regulation. In addition, the probability of success for each product candidate will depend on numerous factors,
including competition, manufacturing capability and commercial viability. A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of a product candidate could mean a
significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. For example, if the FDA, or another regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical
trials beyond those that we currently anticipate will be required for the completion of clinical development of a product candidate, or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our
clinical trials, or experience issues with our manufacturing capabilities we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time with respect to the development of that
product candidate. We will determine which programs to pursue and how much to fund each program in response to the scientific and clinical success of each product candidate, as well as an assessment
of each product candidate's commercial potential. Substantially all of our resources are currently dedicated to developing and seeking regulatory approval for Twirla. We will require additional
capital to fund our operating needs beyond 2018 including, among other items, the resumption and completion of our commercial plan for Twirla, which primarily includes the validation of our commercial
manufacturing process and the commercial launch of Twirla, if approved, and advancing the development of our other potential product candidates. </FONT></P>

General and Administrative Expenses  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General and administrative expenses consist principally of salaries and related costs for personnel in executive, finance and administrative
functions including payroll taxes and health insurance, stock-based compensation and travel expenses. Other general and administrative expenses include facility-related costs, insurance and
professional fees for legal, patent review, consulting and accounting services. General and administrative expenses are expensed as incurred. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, our general and administrative expenses totaled approximately $12.4&nbsp;million, $8.8&nbsp;million and
$7.5&nbsp;million, respectively. In January 2018, following our receipt of the 2017 CRL, we significantly scaled back our preparations for commercialization of Twirla, including commercial
pre-launch activities, pending our ability to address the 2017 CRL and receive approval of Twirla. However, if Twirla is approved, we intend to commercialize Twirla in the United States through a
direct sales force. We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future with the continued research, development and potential commercialization of Twirla, its
planned line extensions, and any of our other potential product candidates, and as we operate as a public company. These increases will likely include increased selling and marketing costs, including
payroll and operating costs, related to the commercial launch of Twirla, if approved, legal and accounting services, stock registration and printing fees, addition of new personnel to support
compliance and communication needs, increased insurance premiums, outside consultants and investor
relations. Additionally, if in the future we believe regulatory approval of Twirla or any of our other potential product candidates appears likely, we anticipate that we would begin preparations for
commercial operations, which would result in an increase in payroll and other expenses, particularly with respect to the sales and marketing of our product candidates. </FONT></P>

Accrued Research and Development Expenses  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued expenses, particularly for product
development costs. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the
level of services performed and the associated costs incurred for the services when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual costs. The majority of our service providers
invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based
on facts and circumstances known to us at
that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with service providers and make adjustments as necessary. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses
include:</FONT></P>

</UL>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
base our expenses related to clinical studies on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple CROs that conduct and manage clinical
studies on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which
payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the clinical expense. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the
successful enrollment of subjects and the completion of clinical trial milestones. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed, enrollment of subjects,
number of sites activated and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the

services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in our reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. Based on
historical experience, actual results have not been materially different from our estimates. </FONT></P>

Warrant Liability  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We account for detachable warrants with non-standard anti-dilution provisions (referred to as down round protection) to purchase convertible
preferred stock (prior to our IPO) and common stock as liabilities, as they are freestanding derivative financial instruments. The warrants are recorded as liabilities at fair value, estimated using a
Black-Scholes option pricing model, and are subject to re-adjustment at each balance sheet date, otherwise known as marked-to-market, with changes in the fair value of the warrants recorded in our
statements of operations. </FONT></P>

Stock-Based Compensation  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We account for stock-based compensation under Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 718, </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Accounting for Stock Based
Compensation</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. All stock-based awards granted to nonemployees are accounted for at their fair value in accordance with ASC 718, and ASC 505, </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Accounting
for Equity Instruments that are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services,</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> under which compensation expense is generally
recognized over the vesting period of the award. Determining the amount of stock-based compensation to be required requires us to develop estimates of fair values of stock options as of the grant
date. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
account for stock-based compensation by measuring and recognizing expense for all stock-based payments made to employees and directors based on estimated grant date fair values. We
use the straight-line method to allocate compensation cost to reporting periods over each optionee's requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. We estimate the fair value of our
stock-based awards to employees and directors using the Black-Scholes option valuation model, or Black-Scholes model. The Black-Scholes model requires the input of subjective assumptions, including
the expected stock price volatility, the calculation of expected term and the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant, among other inputs. The risk-free interest rate was
determined with the implied yield currently available for zero-coupon U.S. government issues with a remaining term approximating the expected life of the options. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
also award restricted stock units ("RSUs") to employees and our board of directors (the "Board"). RSUs are generally subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to the
completion of the vesting restrictions. We expense the cost of the RSUs, which is determined to be the fair market value of the shares of common stock underlying the RSUs at the date of grant, ratably
over the period during which the vesting restrictions lapse. Cost associated with performance-based restricted stock units with a performance condition which affects the vesting is recognized only if
the performance condition is probable of being satisfied. </FONT></P>

earnings recorded within change in fair value of warrant liability. The fair value of the convertible preferred stock warrants (prior to the IPO) and common stock warrants with non-standard
anti-dilution provisions are determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model which incorporates a number of assumptions and judgments to estimate the fair value of these warrants including the
fair value per share of the underlying stock, the remaining contractual term of the warrants, risk-free interest rate, expected dividend yield, credit spread and expected volatility of the price of
the underlying stock. During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016, the fair value of our warrant liability changed by $0.2&nbsp;million compared to year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, primarily

Net Operating Losses and Tax Carryforwards  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2017, we had approximately $202.1&nbsp;million of federal and $68.8&nbsp;million of state net operating loss
carryforwards. We also potentially have federal and state research and development tax credits which would offset future taxable income. We have not completed a study to assess whether an ownership
change has occurred, or whether there have been multiple ownership changes since our inception, due to the significant costs and complexities associated with such studies. Accordingly, our ability to
utilize the aforementioned carryforwards may be limited. Additionally, U.S. tax laws limit the time during which these carryforwards may be utilized against future taxes. As a result, we may not be
able to take full advantage of these carryforwards for federal and state tax purposes. As of December&nbsp;31, 2017, all of our net operating losses were fully offset by a valuation allowance. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
December&nbsp;22, 2017, the United States Congress and the Administration have approved a bill reforming the US corporate income tax code which will reduce our corporate tax rate
from 34% to 21%. The rate reduction would generally take effect on January&nbsp;1, 2018. The carrying value of our
deferred tax assets is also determined by the enacted US corporate income tax rate. Consequently, any changes in the US corporate income tax rate will impact the carrying value of our deferred tax
assets. Under new corporate income tax rate 21%, deferred income tax assets will decrease by $26.5&nbsp;million and valuation allowance will decrease by $26.5&nbsp;million. There was no net effect
of the tax reform enactment on financial statements as of December&nbsp;31, 2017. </FONT></P>

Liquidity and Capital Resources  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On May&nbsp;29, 2014, we completed our initial public offering whereby we sold 9,166,667 shares of common stock, at a public offering price of
$6.00 per share, before underwriting discounts and expenses. The aggregate net proceeds received by us from the offering were $49.7&nbsp;million. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
January 2015, we completed a private placement of approximately 3.4&nbsp;million shares of common stock at $5.85 per share. Proceeds from our private placement, net of commissions
and other offering costs, were $19.3&nbsp;million. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
February 2015, we entered into a loan and security agreement with Hercules Technology Growth Capital,&nbsp;Inc. or Hercules, for a term loan of up to $25.0&nbsp;million. A first
tranche of $16.5&nbsp;million was funded upon execution of the loan agreement, approximately $15.5&nbsp;million of which was used to repay our existing term loan. The Hercules Loan Agreement was
amended in August 2016 to, among other things, extend the period during which we can draw the second tranche of $8.5&nbsp;million to March&nbsp;31, 2017 and extend the period during which we make
interest-only payments to January&nbsp;31, 2017. We are currently in discussions with Hercules to extend the period beyond March&nbsp;31, 2017 during which the additional tranche of
$8.5&nbsp;million may be drawn. We can make no assurances that our discussions will ultimately be successful and, if such discussions result in an extension of the period in which we may draw the
additional tranche of $8.5&nbsp;million, we could incur additional fees payable to Hercules. On February&nbsp;1, 2017, we began making principal payments with respect to the Hercules Loan. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January 2016, we closed an underwritten public offering of 5,511,812 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $6.35 per share. In February 2016,
the underwriters of the public offering of common stock exercised in full their option to purchase an additional 826,771 shares of common stock at the public offering price of $6.35 per share, less
underwriting discounts and commissions. A total of 6,338,583 shares of common stock were sold in the public offering, resulting in total net proceeds of approximately $37.5&nbsp;million. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
August 2017, we completed an underwritten public offering of 5,333,334 shares of common stock registered under the 2015 Shelf Registration Statement at a public offering price of
$3.75 per share. Proceeds from this public offering, net of underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering costs were approximately $18.5&nbsp;million. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At
December&nbsp;31, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $35.9&nbsp;million. We invest our cash equivalents in highly liquid, interest-bearing investment-grade and
government securities in order to preserve principal. </FONT></P>

Operating Activities  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have incurred significant costs in the area of research and development, including CRO fees, manufacturing, regulatory and other clinical
trial costs, as our primary product candidate Twirla was being developed. Net cash used in operating activities was $24.6&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2017 and consisted of a
net loss of $28.3&nbsp;million which was offset, in part, by non-cash compensation and non-cash interest expense of $4.3&nbsp;million as well as a decrease in prepaid clinical trial costs of
$1.8&nbsp;million. Net cash used in operating activities was $23.3&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016 and consisted of a net loss of $28.7&nbsp;million which was offset, in
part, by non-cash compensation and non-cash interest expense of $4.4&nbsp;million as well as a decrease in prepaid clinical trial costs of $0.8&nbsp;million. Net cash used in operating activities
was $25.5&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and consisted of a net loss of $30.3&nbsp;million which was offset, in part, by non-cash stock compensation expense of
$3.0&nbsp;million and a loss on extinguishment of debt of $1.0&nbsp;million. Cash used in operations in both 2016 and 2015 has been offset, in part, by the proceeds received from the sale of New
Jersey NOLs. We began incurring expenses for the clinical development of AG200-SP in the third quarter of 2016. We have decided to postpone the planned Phase&nbsp;2 clinical trial for AG200-SP and
will continue to evaluate the timing for initiating dosing of subjects for the planned Phase&nbsp;2 clinical trial, which is dependent on financial and other capital resources. The
decreased clinical development expenses were offset by increased commercial development and commercial manufacturing expenses related to the initialization of pre-commercialization activities for
Twirla. </FONT></P>

30&nbsp;days of the meeting request. We have submitted a request for a Type&nbsp;A meeting to the FDA to discuss the deficiencies in the Twirla NDA and the regulatory path for approval of Twirla.
We plan to provide an update on the outcome of the Type&nbsp;A meeting after we receive the official meeting minutes from the FDA and we will then be better able to determine when we will resubmit
our Twirla NDA. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consistent
with our previous NDA resubmission in 2017, we currently expect that our resubmission of the NDA responding to the 2017 CRL will be categorized as a Type&nbsp;2 resubmission
and receive a review period of six months from the date of resubmission of the NDA. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future. We
anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially if and as we:</FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
January 2018, in response to the 2017 CRL, we significantly scaled back equipment qualification and validation of our commercial manufacturing process and our other commercial
pre-launch activities. Based on these actions and our current business plan, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents as of December&nbsp;31, 2017 will be sufficient to meet our operating
requirements through the end of 2018. Our current business plan assumes resubmission of our NDA for Twirla in the second quarter of 2018, a six-month FDA review of our NDA resubmission, and resumption
of both pre-launch commercial activities and pre-validation and validation of our manufacturing process after Twirla approval, if the FDA approves Twirla. We will require additional capital to fund
operating needs beyond 2018, including among other items, the completion of our commercialization plan for Twirla, which primarily includes the validation of our commercial manufacturing process and

be within six months, or that we will timely complete the qualification and validation of our commercial manufacturing process. We may also need to raise additional funds prior to the end of 2018 if
we choose to accelerate components of our commercial plan or we encounter any unforeseen events that affect our current business plan. Adequate additional funding may not be available to us on
acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms and not enter into strategic collaborations, we may be required to curtail our current development
programs, cut operating costs, forgo future development and other opportunities or even terminate our operations, which may involve seeking bankruptcy protection. Because of the numerous risks and
uncertainties associated with the development, including, among other things, manufacturing scale up, FDA review of the NDA for Twirla and commercialization of Twirla, if approved, we are unable to
estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenses associated with completing the development of Twirla. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors,

Going Concern  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to the receipt of the 2017 CRL, and the delay in the approval timeline for Twirla, our ability to continue operations after
December&nbsp;31, 2018 will depend on our ability to obtain additional funding, as to which no assurances can be given. Based upon the foregoing, there is substantial doubt about our ability to
continue as a going concern. There can be no assurance that any financing by us can be realized, or if realized, what the terms of any such financing may be, or that any amount that we are able to
raise will be adequate. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
of December&nbsp;31, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $35.9&nbsp;million. We continue to analyze various alternatives, including strategic and refinancing alternatives,
asset sales and mergers and acquisitions. Our future success depends on our ability to raise capital and/or implement the various strategic alternatives discussed above. We cannot be certain that
these initiatives or raising additional capital, whether through selling additional debt or equity securities or obtaining a line of credit or other loan, will be available to us or, if available,
will be on terms acceptable to us. If we issue additional securities to raise funds, whether through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, or any combination thereof, these securities
may have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to those of our common stock, and our current shareholders may experience dilution. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include
covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take </FONT></P>

February 2015 Loan and Security Agreement&#151;Hercules Capital,&nbsp;Inc.  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first tranche of the Hercules Loan was funded in February 2015. In August 2016, we entered into the First Amendment to Loan and Security
Agreement, or the "First Amendment" with Hercules which amends certain terms of the Hercules Loan Agreement. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
First Amendment extended our option to draw down the second tranche of $8.5&nbsp;million referred to as the "Second Term Loan Advance", of the term loan facility provided under the
Hercules Loan, or the Term Loan, until March&nbsp;31, 2017 and made the Second Term Loan Advance subject to the consent of Hercules, among other customary conditions. The Hercules Loan Agreement was
further amended in May 2017 to extend the period during which we could draw the second tranche of $8.5&nbsp;million to January&nbsp;31, 2018 and continues to make the Second Term Loan Advance
subject to the consent of Hercules, among other customary conditions. We are currently in discussions with Hercules to extend the period beyond March&nbsp;31, 2017 during which the additional
tranche of $8.5&nbsp;million may be drawn. We cannot assure you that our discussions will ultimately be successful and, if such discussions result in an extension of the period in which we may draw
the additional tranche of $8.5&nbsp;million, we could incur additional fees payable to Hercules. The First Amendment also extended the interest-only payments until January&nbsp;31, 2017, in
connection with the first tranche of $16.5&nbsp;million, </FONT></P>

the First Term Loan Advance, and together with the Second Term Loan Advance, referred to as the Term Loan Advances. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
First Amendment provides that the Term Loan will mature on December&nbsp;1, 2018. The First Amendment also provides that as part of the extension of the interest-only period from
the First Term Loan Advance, Hercules returned to us the principal payments paid by us in July and August 2016, which such returned payments will once again constitute Term Loan Advances under the
Hercules Loan. In connection with the execution of the First Amendment, we paid Hercules a facility fee of $0.165&nbsp;million. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Hercules Loan accrues interest at a rate of the greater of 9.0% or 9.0% plus Prime minus 4.25% and is payable monthly. Principal is due in 23 consecutive monthly installments
beginning on February&nbsp;1, 2017 and ending on December&nbsp;1, 2018. In addition, we are required to make a final payment of $610,500 on the maturity date of the Hercules Loan,
December&nbsp;1, 2018. The final payment is being accrued and recorded to interest expense over the life of the Hercules Loan. On February&nbsp;1, 2017, we began making principal payments with
respect to the Hercules Loan. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
may prepay all, but not less than all, of the Hercules Loan subject to a prepayment premium of 3.0% of the outstanding principal if prepaid during the first year, 2.0% of the
outstanding principal if prepaid during the second year and 1.0% of the outstanding principal if prepaid after the second year. Our obligations under the Hercules Loan are secured by a perfected first
position lien on all of our assets, excluding intellectual property assets. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
connection with the Hercules Loan, we issued Hercules a warrant to purchase 180,274 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $5.89 per share and granted Hercules the right
to participate in future equity financings in an amount up to $2.0&nbsp;million while the loan and warrant are outstanding. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
allocated the proceeds of $16.5&nbsp;million in accordance with ASC 470 based on the relative fair values. The relative fair value of the warrants of approximately
$1.2&nbsp;million at the time of issuance, which was determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, was recorded as additional paid-in capital and reduced the carrying value of the debt.
The discount on the debt is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the debt. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
December 2012, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement, the Oxford Loan, with Oxford Finance,&nbsp;LLC, or Oxford, pursuant to which we borrowed a total of
$15.0&nbsp;million from Oxford. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
February 2015, we terminated and repaid all amounts outstanding under the Oxford Loan. As a result of this repayment, we recorded a loss on the extinguishment of debt of approximately
$1.0&nbsp;million on our statement of operations for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, primarily representing a prepayment premium and the write off of deferred financing costs. </FONT></P>

Registration Statement was declared effective by the SEC. During the first quarter of 2016 and the third quarter of 2017, we completed offerings of common stock utilizing the 2015 Shelf Registration
Statement (see below). In the future, we may periodically offer one or more of these securities in amounts, prices and terms to be announced when and if the securities are offered. At the time any of
the securities covered by the 2015 Shelf Registration Statement are offered for sale, a prospectus supplement will be prepared and filed with the SEC containing specific information about the terms of
any such offering. </FONT></P>

Interest Rate Risk  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. Market risk is the risk of change in fair value of a financial instrument
due to changes in interest rates, equity prices, financing, exchange rates or other factors. These market risks are principally limited to interest rate fluctuations. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
had cash and cash equivalents of $35.9&nbsp;million and $48.8&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2017 and December&nbsp;31, 2016, respectively consisting primarily of funds in
cash and money market accounts. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing income without significantly increasing risk. We do not enter
into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Due to the short-term nature of our investment portfolio, we do not believe an immediate 10.0% increase in interest rates would have a material
effect on the fair market value of our portfolio, and accordingly we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be materially affected by a sudden change in market interest rates. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest rates, principally in connection with our loan agreement with Hercules. We do not believe
we are materially exposed to changes in interest rates. We do not currently use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes. We estimate that a 1% unfavorable
change in interest rates would have resulted in approximately a $137,000 increase in interest expense for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2017. </FONT></P>

material effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2017. </FONT></P>

Opinion on the Financial Statements  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Agile Therapeutics,&nbsp;Inc. (the "Company") as of December&nbsp;31, 2017 and 2016, the
related statements of operations, statements of convertible preferred stock and changes in stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December&nbsp;31,
2017, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
Company at December&nbsp;31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2017, in conformity with US
generally accepted accounting principles. </FONT></P>

The Company's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in
Note&nbsp;1 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations, has experienced delays in the approval of its product candidate and has stated that substantial
doubt exists about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management's evaluation of the events and conditions and management's plans regarding these matters are also described in
Note&nbsp;1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. </FONT></P>

Basis for Opinion  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent
with respect to the Company in accordance with the US federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not
required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion. </FONT></P>

Nature of Operations  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agile Therapeutics,&nbsp;Inc. ("Agile" or the "Company") was incorporated in Delaware on December&nbsp;22, 1997. Agile is a forward-thinking
women's healthcare company dedicated to fulfilling the unmet health needs of today's women. The Company's activities since inception have consisted principally of raising capital and performing
research and development. The Company is headquartered in Princeton, New Jersey. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company's lead product candidate, Twirla&reg;, also known as AG200-15, is a once-weekly prescription contraceptive patch that is at the end of Phase&nbsp;3 clinical
development. Substantially all of the Company's resources are currently dedicated to developing and seeking regulatory approval for Twirla. The Company has not generated product revenue to date and is
subject to a number of risks similar to those of other early stage companies, including dependence on key individuals, the difficulties inherent in the development of commercially usable products, the
potential need to obtain additional capital necessary to fund the development of its products, and competition from larger companies. The Company has incurred losses each year since inception. As of
December&nbsp;31, 2017, the Company had an accumulated deficit of approximately $221.8&nbsp;million. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company has financed its operations to date primarily through the issuance and sale of its common stock in both public and private offerings (see Note&nbsp;8), private placements
of its convertible preferred stock, venture loans, and non-dilutive grant funding. The Company expects to continue to incur net losses into the foreseeable future. </FONT></P>

Going Concern  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December&nbsp;21, 2017, the Company received a complete response letter (the "2017 CRL") from the FDA citing deficiencies
related to the manufacturing process for Twirla, and raising questions on the in vivo adhesion properties of Twirla and their potential relationship to the Company's phase&nbsp;3 clinical trial

other items such as timely and successful completion of the validation of equipment for commercial manufacturing, ultimate FDA approval, and additional capital. In January 2018, following the
Company's receipt of the 2017 CRL, the Company significantly scaled back its preparations for commercialization of Twirla, including commercial pre-launch and manufacturing validation activities,
pending its ability to address the 2017 CRL and receive approval of Twirla. The Company's current business plan assumes resubmission of its NDA for Twirla in the second quarter of 2018, a six-month
FDA review of its NDA resubmission, and resumption of both pre-launch commercial activities and pre-validation and validation of the Company's manufacturing process after Twirla approval, if the FDA
approves Twirla. The Company will require additional capital to fund operating needs beyond 2018, including among other items, the resumption and completion of our commercialization plan for Twirla,
which primarily includes the validation of our commercial manufacturing process and the commercial launch of Twirla, if approved, and advancing the development of its other potential product
candidates. The Company cannot assure you that the FDA will approve Twirla, that the FDA's timeline for review will be within six months, or that the Company </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company's ability to continue operations after December&nbsp;31, 2018 will depend on its ability to obtain additional funding, as to which no assurances can be given. There can be
no assurance that any financing by the Company can be realized by the Company, or if realized, what the terms of any such financing may be, or that any amount that the Company is able to raise will be
adequate. Based upon the foregoing, there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
of December&nbsp;31, 2017, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $35.9&nbsp;million. The Company continues to analyze various alternatives, including strategic and
refinancing alternatives, asset sales and mergers and acquisitions. The Company's future success depends on its ability to raise capital and/or implement the various strategic alternatives discussed
above. The Company cannot be certain that these initiatives or raising additional capital, whether through selling additional debt or equity securities or
obtaining a line of credit or other loan, will be available to it or, if available, will be on terms acceptable to the Company. If the Company issues additional securities to raise funds, these
securities may have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to those of its common stock, and the Company's current shareholders may experience dilution. If the Company is unable to obtain funds
when needed or on acceptable terms, the Company may be required to curtail its current development programs, cut operating costs, forego future development and other opportunities and may need to seek
bankruptcy protection. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
audited financial statements as of December&nbsp;31, 2017 have been prepared under the assumption that the Company will continue as a going concern for the next 12&nbsp;months.
The Company's ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its uncertain ability to obtain additional equity and/or debt financing and reduce expenditures. The accompanying financial
statements as of December&nbsp;31, 2017 do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. </FONT></P>

connection with the completion of the Company's initial public offering in May 2014, the warrants to purchase shares of Series&nbsp;A-1 and Series&nbsp;A-2 preferred stock expired
unexercised and the warrants to purchase shares of Series&nbsp;C preferred stock automatically converted into warrants to purchase shares of common stock. Warrants with non-standard anti-dilution

Taxes</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial statement reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities,
operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred income taxes are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are anticipated to be in effect when the differences are expected to
reverse. The measurement of deferred income tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits which are not expected to be realized. The effect on deferred income tax
assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that such tax rate changes are enacted. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company has adopted the authoritative guidance on accounting for and disclosure of uncertainty in tax positions which prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement

date. Compensation cost is recognized for all share-based payments granted and is based on the grant-date fair value estimated using the weighted-average assumption of the Black-Scholes option pricing
model based on key assumptions such as stock price, expected volatility and expected term. The Company elects to account for forfeitures when they occur. The equity instrument is not considered to be
issued until the instrument vests. As a result, compensation cost is recognized over the requisite service period with an offsetting credit to additional paid-in capital. </FONT></P>

Company also awards restricted stock units ("RSUs") to employees and its board of directors (the "Board"). RSUs are generally subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to
the completion of the vesting restrictions. The Company expenses the cost of the RSUs, which is determined to be the fair market value of the shares of common stock underlying the RSUs at the date of
grant, ratably over the period during which the vesting restrictions lapse. Cost associated with performance-based restricted stock units with a performance condition which affects the vesting is

an option pricing method and a probability-weighted expected return methodology that determined an estimated value under an initial public offering ("IPO") scenario and a sale scenario based upon an
assessment of the probability of occurrence of each scenario. Each valuation methodology includes estimates and assumptions that require the Company's judgment. These estimates include assumptions
regarding future performance, including the successful completion of clinical trials and the time to completing an IPO or sale of the Company. As with any valuation, significant changes to the key
assumptions used in the valuations could result in different fair values of common stock at each valuation date. </FONT></P>

shares outstanding for the period, without consideration for common stock equivalents. Diluted net loss per share is calculated by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period determined using the treasury-stock and if-converted methods. For
purposes of diluted net loss per share calculation, common stock warrants, unvested RSUs and stock options are considered to be potentially dilutive securities but are excluded from the calculation of
diluted net loss per share because their effect would be anti-dilutive and therefore, basic and diluted net loss per share were the same for all periods presented. </FONT></P>

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") or other standard setting
bodies that the Company adopts as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed below, the Company does not believe that the adoption of recently issued standards have or may have a
material impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
May 2014, as part of its ongoing efforts to assist in the convergence of U.S.&nbsp;GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)
</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, which is a new standard related to revenue recognition. Under the new standard, recognition of
revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised services or goods in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or
services. In addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts. The standard must be adopted using
either a full retrospective approach for all periods presented in the period of adoption or a modified retrospective approach. In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>Revenue from Contracts with Customers&#151;Deferral of
the Effective Date</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, which defers the implementation of this new standard to be effective
for fiscal years beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted effective January&nbsp;1, 2017. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Principal
versus Agent Considerations</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, which clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations in the new revenue recognition standard pursuant to ASU
2014-09. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, and in May 2016, the
FASB issued ASU 2016-12, </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, which amend certain aspects of the new revenue recognition standard
pursuant to ASU 2014-09. In December 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-20, </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Technical Corrections and Improvements</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> to Topic 606, </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>Revenue from Contracts with Customers</I></FONT><FONT
SIZE=2> to clarify the codification or to correct unintended application of guidance. In September and November 2017, the
FASB issued ASU 2017-13, </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Revenue Recognition</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> (Topic&nbsp;605), </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Revenue from Contracts with Customers</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Polices (Continued) </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>Company
has not recognized any revenue to date, the adoption did not have any impact on the Company's financial statements. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.&nbsp;2016-02, </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Leases</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. The new standard establishes a right-of-use ("ROU") model that requires
a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12&nbsp;months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with
classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the statement of operations. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2018, including interim
periods within those fiscal years. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in
the financial statements. In September 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-13, </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Revenue Recognition (Topic&nbsp;605), Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Leases
(Topic 840), and Leases (Topic&nbsp;842)</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> which amends certain aspects of the new lease standard. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the pending adoption of the
new standard on the Company's financial statements. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
May 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-09, </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Compensation&#151;Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> to
provide clarity and reduce both (1)&nbsp;diversity in practice and (2)&nbsp;cost and complexity when applying the guidance in Topic 718, </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Compensation&#151;Stock
Compensation</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, to change the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award. The amendments in this Update provide guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of
a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting in Topic 718. This Update is the final version of Proposed ASU
2016-360</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>&#151;Compensation&#151;Stock Compensation (Topic 718)&#151;Scope of Modification Accounting</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, which has been deleted. The
amendments in this Update are effective for all entities for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted.
This ASU is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
July 2017, the FASB issued ASU No.&nbsp;2017-11, </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Earnings Per Share (Topic 260); Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480); Derivatives and Hedging
(Topic 815): (Part&nbsp;1) Accounting for Certain Financial
Instruments with Down Round Features, (Part&nbsp;II) Replacement of the Indefinite Deferral for Mandatorily Redeemable Financial Instruments of Certain Nonpublic Entities and Certain Mandatorily
Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests with a Scope Exception."</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> This ASU eliminates the requirement to consider "down round" features when determining whether certain
equity-linked financial instruments or embedded features are indexed to an entity's own stock. ASU 2017-11 is effective for annual periods beginning after December&nbsp;31, 2018. Early adoption is
permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2017-11 on its financial statements. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Management
does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material impact on the accompanying consolidated
financial statements. </FONT></P>

3. Fair Value Measurements  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ASC&nbsp;820, </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, describes the fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the
first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, that may be used to measure fair value. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair
value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset
or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value are reported using a three-level fair value hierarchy
that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. This hierarchy maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the
use of unobservable inputs. The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:</FONT></P>

<UL>
<DL compact>
<DT style='font-family:times;margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2> Level&nbsp;1&#151;Quotes prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. The Company's Level&nbsp;1 assets and

for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets and liabilities.
The Company has no Level&nbsp;2 assets or liabilities. </FONT><FONT SIZE=2>
<BR><BR></FONT></DD><DT style='font-family:times;margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2> Level&nbsp;3&#151;Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market data and which require internal development of
assumptions about how market participant price the fair value of the assets or liabilities. The Company's Level&nbsp;3 liabilities consist of the warrant liability. </FONT></DD></DL>
</UL>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company is required to mark the value of its warrant liability to market and recognize the change in valuation in its statements of operations each reporting period. </FONT></P>

Oxford Finance&nbsp;LLC  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December 2012, the Company entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the "Oxford Loan") with Oxford Finance&nbsp;LLC ("Oxford") pursuant
to which the Company borrowed a total of $15.0&nbsp;million from Oxford. The Oxford Loan accrued interest at a fixed annual rate equal to 9.20% (Three-month U.S. Libor rate of 0.47% plus 8.73%). </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest
on the Oxford Loan was payable monthly and principal was due in 30 equal consecutive monthly installments beginning on February&nbsp;1, 2015 and ending on July&nbsp;1, 2017.
In addition, the
Company was required to make a final payment of $675 on the maturity date of the Oxford Loan (July&nbsp;1, 2017). </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
connection with the Oxford Loan, the Company issued Oxford warrants to purchase 62,505 shares of common stock at $6.00 per share. These warrants expire on December&nbsp;14, 2019. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
February 2015, the Company terminated and repaid all amounts outstanding under the Oxford Loan and recorded a loss on the extinguishment of the Oxford Loan (see further discussion
below). </FONT></P>

Hercules Capital,&nbsp;Inc.  </I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February 2015, the Company entered into a loan and security agreement (the "Hercules Loan") with Hercules Capital,&nbsp;Inc. ("Hercules")
for a term loan of up to $25.0&nbsp;million. In August 2016, the Company entered into the First Amendment to Loan and Security Agreement (the "First Amendment") with Hercules which amends certain
terms of the Hercules Loan. In May 2017, the Company entered into the Second Amendment to Loan and Security Agreement (the "Second Amendment") with Hercules which further amended certain terms of the
Hercules Loan. A first tranche of $16.5&nbsp;million was funded upon execution of the Hercules Loan, approximately $15.5&nbsp;million of which was used to repay the Company's existing term loan
with Oxford. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
First Amendment extended the Company's option to draw down the second tranche of $8.5&nbsp;million (the "Second Term Loan Advance") of the term loan facility provided under the
Hercules Loan (the "Term Loan") until March&nbsp;31, 2017, and made the Second Term Loan Advance subject to the consent of Hercules, among other customary conditions. The Second Amendment further
extended the Company's option to draw the Second Term Loan Advance until January&nbsp;31, 2018, and continues to make the Second Term Loan Advance subject to the consent of Hercules, among other
customary conditions. The First Amendment also extended the interest-only payments until January&nbsp;31, 2017, in connection with the first tranche of $16.5&nbsp;million (the "First Term Loan
Advance" and together with the Second Term Loan Advance, the "Term Loan Advances"). The Company is currently in discussions with Hercules to extend the period during which the additional tranche of
$8.5&nbsp;million may be drawn. The Company can make no assurances that its discussions will ultimately be successful and, if such discussions result in an extension of the periods in which the
Company may draw the additional tranche of $8.5&nbsp;million, the Company could incur additional fees to Hercules. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
First Amendment provides the Term Loan will mature on December&nbsp;1, 2018. As a result of the First Amendment, and in connection with the extension of the interest-only period
from the First Term Loan Advance, Hercules returned to the Company the principal payments paid by the Company </FONT></P>

7. Loan and Security Agreements (Continued) </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>in
July and August 2016, which such returned payments will once again constitute outstanding Term Loan advances under the Hercules Loan. In connection with the execution of the First Amendment, the
Company paid Hercules a facility fee of $165. The facility fee represents a debt issue cost which is being reflected as a reduction to the carrying amount of loan payable in accordance with ASU
2015-03. Such issue costs are being amortized to interest expense over the life of the loan using the effective interest method. As of December&nbsp;31, 2017, $10.9&nbsp;million and $0 are
recorded on the balance sheet in Loan payable, current portion and Loan payable, long-term, respectively. As of December&nbsp;31, 2016, $5.6&nbsp;million and $10.9&nbsp;million are recorded on
the balance sheet in Loan payable, current portion and Loan payable, long-term, respectively. As of December&nbsp;31, 2017 and December&nbsp;31, 2016, the Company had outstanding borrowings of
$10.9&nbsp;million and $16.5&nbsp;million, respectively, related to the Hercules Loan. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Hercules Loan accrues interest at a rate of the greater of 9.0% or 9.0% plus Prime minus 4.25% and is payable monthly. Principal is due in 23 consecutive monthly installments
beginning on February&nbsp;1, 2017 and ending on December&nbsp;1, 2018. In addition, the Company is required to make a final payment of approximately $611 on the maturity date of the Hercules Loan
(December&nbsp;1, 2018). The amount of the end of term final payment is being accrued over the loan term as interest expense. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company may prepay all, but not less than all, of the Hercules Loan subject to a prepayment premium of 1.0% of the outstanding principal. The obligations of the Company under the
Hercules Loan are secured by a perfected first position lien on all of the assets of the Company, excluding intellectual property assets. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
connection with the Hercules Loan, the Company issued Hercules a warrant to purchase 180,274 shares of the Company's common stock at an exercise price of $5.89 per share which expires
on February&nbsp;24, 2020 and granted Hercules the right to participate in future equity financings in an amount up to $2.0&nbsp;million while the loan and warrant are outstanding. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company allocated the proceeds of $16.5&nbsp;million in accordance with ASC 470 based on the relative fair values. The relative fair value of the warrants of approximately
$1.2&nbsp;million at the time of issuance, which was determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, was recorded as additional paid-in capital and reduced the carrying value of the debt.
The significant assumptions used in preparing the option pricing model for valuing the Company's warrant issued to Hercules include (i)&nbsp;volatility (75.0%), (ii)&nbsp;risk free interest rate
of 1.22% (estimated using treasury bonds with a 4-year life), (iii)&nbsp;strike price ($5.89) for the common stock warrant, (iv)&nbsp;fair value of common stock ($9.82) and (v)&nbsp;expected
life (4&nbsp;years). The discount on the debt is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the debt. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
a result of the repayment of the Oxford Loan, the Company recorded a loss on the extinguishment of debt of approximately $1.0&nbsp;million on the Company's statement of operations
for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, representing a prepayment premium, the unamortized discount of the Oxford Loan and the write off of deferred financing costs. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest
expense on the Oxford Loan and the Hercules Loan including the accretion of the value of the related warrants, accrual of term loan back-end fee and amortization of the deferred
financing </FONT></P>

expected term of the
stock option grants. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><I> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expected dividend yield.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company bases the expected dividend yield assumption on the fact that it has never paid cash dividends and
has no
present intention to pay cash dividends. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expected volatility.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expected volatility assumption is based on volatilities of a peer group of similar companies whose share prices
are publicly
available. The peer group was developed based on comparable companies in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><I> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expected term.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expected term represents the period of time that options are expected to be outstanding. Because the Company does
not have
historic exercise behavior, management determined the expected life assumption using the simplified method, which is an average of the contractual term of the option and its ordinary vesting period. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forfeitures.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has elected to record forfeitures as they occur. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
of December&nbsp;31, 2017, the unrecorded deferred stock-based compensation balance related to stock options was approximately $4.5&nbsp;million and will be recognized over an
estimated weighted-average amortization period of 1.62&nbsp;years. The weighted average grant date fair value of options granted during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2017 was $1.75. </FONT></P>

addition to the RSUs detailed in the table above, during 2017 the Company granted up to 260,000 shares of performance-based restricted stock units ("Performance Units") under the
Company's 2014 Incentive Compensation Plan, to executive officers which are primarily contingent upon achievement of performance goals during the performance period beginning on the date of grant and
ending on December&nbsp;31, 2018 as set forth in each officer's performance unit agreement. For awards with a performance condition which affects the vesting of the Performance Units, cost is
recognized only if the performance condition is probable of being satisfied. Given the uncertainty of the achievement of the performance goals during the performance period, the Company has not
recorded compensation expense related to these awards for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2017. These performance-based restricted stock units expired and were subsequently replaced with new awards
in January 2018 (see Note&nbsp;13). </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December&nbsp;22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law an Act to provide for reconciliation pursuant to titles II and V of the concurrent resolution on the
budget for fiscal year 2018 (commonly known as "the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act"), which introduced a comprehensive set of tax reforms. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act significantly revises U.S. tax law by, among
other provisions, lowering the Company's corporate tax rate from 34% to 21% and eliminating or reducing certain income tax deductions. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
effects of changes in tax laws are required to be recognized in the period in which the legislation is enacted. However, due to the complexity and significance of the Tax Cuts and
Jobs Act's provisions, the Company recorded the tax effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on a provisional basis </FONT></P>

on a reasonable estimate, and will, if necessary, subsequently adjust such amounts during a limited measurement period as more information becomes available. The measurement period ends when a
company has obtained, prepared, and analyzed the information necessary to finalize its accounting, but cannot extend beyond one year from enactment. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act did not have a material impact on the Company's financial statements since its net deferred tax assets are fully offset by a valuation allowance and the Company
does not have any off shore earnings from which to record the mandatory transition tax. However, given the significant complexity of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, anticipated guidance from the U.S.
Treasury about implementing the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and the potential for additional guidance from the FASB related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, these estimates may be adjusted during the
measurement period. The provisional amounts were based on the Company's present interpretations of the Tax Cuts and
Jobs Act and currently available information, including assumptions and expectations about future events, such as its projected financial performance, and are subject to further refinement as
additional information becomes available (including the Company's actual results of operations for the year ending December&nbsp;31, 2017, as well as potential new or interpretative guidance issued
by the FASB or the Internal Revenue Service and other tax agencies) and further analyses are completed. The Company continues to analyze the changes in certain income tax deductions, and gather
additional data to compute the full impacts on the Company's deferred and current tax assets and liabilities. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
of December&nbsp;31, 2017, the Company had available net operating loss carryforwards ("NOLs") of approximately $202.1&nbsp;million and $68.8&nbsp;million for federal and state
income tax reporting purposes, respectively, which are available to offset future federal and state taxable income, if any, through 2037. The Company also has research and development tax credit
carryforwards of approximately $5.4&nbsp;million and $0.9&nbsp;million for federal and state income tax reporting purposes, respectively, which are available to reduce federal and state income
taxes, if any, through 2037 and state income taxes, if any, through 2032. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") provides for a limitation on the annual use of NOLs and other tax attributes (such as research and development tax credit
carryforwards) following certain ownership changes, as defined by the Code that could significantly limit the Company's ability to utilize these carryforwards. At this time, the Company has not
completed a study to assess whether an ownership change under Section&nbsp;382 of the Code has occurred, or whether there have been multiple ownership changes since the Company's formation, due to
the costs and complexities associated with such a study. The Company is likely to have experienced various ownership changes, as defined by the Code, as a result of past financings. Accordingly, the
Company's ability to utilize the aforementioned carryforwards may be limited. Additionally, U.S. tax laws limit the time during which these carryforwards may be applied against future taxes.
Therefore, the Company may not be able to take full advantage of these carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company does not have any significant unrecognized tax benefits. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
of December&nbsp;31, 2017, the Company has not accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions. The Company's tax returns for the years ended December&nbsp;31,
2014 through December&nbsp;31, 2016 are still subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions. However, the Internal </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
all years through December&nbsp;31, 2017, the Company generated research credits but has not conducted a study to document the qualified activities. This study may result in an
adjustment to the Company's research and development credit carryforwards; however, until a study is completed and any adjustment in known, no amounts are being presented as an uncertain tax position.
A full valuation allowance has been provided against the Company's research and development credits and, if an adjustment is required, this adjustment would be offset by an adjustment to the deferred

gross deferred tax assets and the valuation allowance shown above represent the items which reduce the income tax benefit which would result from applying the federal statutory tax
rate to the pretax loss and cause no income tax expense or benefit to be recorded for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2017 and 2016. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
net change in the valuation allowance for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2017 and 2016 was a decrease of $14.6&nbsp;million and an increase of $10.4&nbsp;million,
respectively. The decrease in 2017 related primarily to the change in the Federal tax rate as discussed earlier under the Act. The increase in 2017 related primarily to net operating losses incurred
by the Company which are not currently deductible. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On January&nbsp;6, 2017, and January&nbsp;20, 2017, two previously disclosed complaints captioned Peng v. Agile Therapeutics,&nbsp;Inc.,
Alfred Altomari, and Elizabeth Garner, No.&nbsp;17-cv-119 (D.N.J.), and Lichtenthal v. Agile Therapeutics,&nbsp;Inc., Alfred Altomari, and Elizabeth Garner, No.&nbsp;17-cv-405 (D.N.J.),
respectively, were filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey on behalf of a putative class of investors who purchased shares of the Company's common
stock from March&nbsp;9, 2016, through January&nbsp;3, 2017. The complaints alleged violations of the federal securities laws based on public statements made regarding the Company's Phase&nbsp;3
SECURE clinical trial and sought an unspecified amount of damages to be determined at trial. The Company denied all allegations in the complaints. On May&nbsp;15, 2017, the complaints were
consolidated the lawsuits as In re Agile Therapeutics,&nbsp;Inc. Securities Litigation, Master File No.&nbsp;17-cv-119 (D.N.J.), and Hoyt W. Clark was appointed as a class representative for the
putative class. On June&nbsp;26, 2017, Mr.&nbsp;Clark agreed to dismiss the consolidated case voluntarily, without payment by the Company of any consideration and with each side bearing its own
attorneys' fees and costs. The presiding judge dismissed the consolidated action with prejudice as to all defendants on July&nbsp;13, 2017. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company records a provision for contingent losses when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. An unfavorable
outcome to any legal matter, if material, could have an adverse effect on the Company's operations or its financial position. As of December&nbsp;31, 2017, the Company has not recorded a provision
for any contingent losses. </FONT></P>

Sale of New Jersey Net Operating Losses  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January 2018, the Company received net proceeds of approximately $0.5&nbsp;million in non-dilutive financing through the State of New
Jersey's Technology Business Tax Certificate Transfer Program (the "Program"). The Program enables approved biotechnology companies to sell their unused Net Operating Loss Carryovers and unused
Research and Development Tax Credits for at least 80% of the value of the tax benefits to unaffiliated, profitable corporate taxpayers in the State of New Jersey. The New Jersey Economic Development
Authority and the New Jersey Department of the Treasury's Division of Taxation administer the Program. The Company intends to use the proceeds from the sale for working capital purposes. The Company
has now reached the maximum lifetime benefit of $15.0&nbsp;million under the Program and will no longer be eligible to participate in the Program. </FONT></P>

Performance Based Restricted Stock Awards  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January 2018, the Company granted up to 365,000 shares of performance-based restricted stock units ("Performance Units") under the Company's
2014 Incentive Compensation Plan primarily to executive officers which are largely contingent upon the achievement of performance goals during the performance period beginning on the date of grant and
ending on December&nbsp;31, 2019 as set forth in each individual's performance unit agreement. Performance Units granted in January 2018 replaced Performance Units granted in April 2017 which

Disclosure Controls and Procedures  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures as of December&nbsp;31, 2017. The term "disclosure controls and procedures," as defined in Rules&nbsp;13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, mean controls and
other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and principal
financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can
provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based
on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December&nbsp;31, 2017, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure
controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable level. </FONT></P>

Management's Annual Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over
financial reporting is defined in Rule&nbsp;13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act and is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive and principal
financial officers and effected by our board of directors, management and other personnel, to:</FONT></P>

<BR><BR></FONT></DD><DT style='font-family:times;margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2> Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2>
<BR><BR></FONT></DD><DT style='font-family:times;margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2> Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets
that could have a material effect on the financial statements. </FONT></DD></DL>
</UL>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Our management assessed
the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2017. In making this assessment, the Company's management used the criteria set forth by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control&#151;Integrated Framework. </FONT></P>
