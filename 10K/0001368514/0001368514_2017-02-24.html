company that develops, manufactures and intends to commercialize specialty plasma-based biologics for the proposed treatment of
immune deficiencies and prevention of certain infectious diseases. Our targeted patient populations include immune-compromised
individuals who suffer from an underlying immune deficiency disorder or who may be immune-suppressed for medical reasons. Our product

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">We are currently developing our lead product
candidate, RI-002, for the treatment of Primary Immune Deficiency Disease, or PIDD, and have completed a pivotal Phase III clinical
study. RI-002 is derived from human plasma blended from normal donors and donors tested to have high levels of neutralizing titers
to Respiratory Syncytical Virus, or RSV. RI-002 is manufactured using a process called fractionation, which purifies immune globulins,
or IgG, from this blended plasma pool resulting in a final IVIG product enriched with naturally occurring polyclonal anti-pathogen
antibodies (e.g., streptococcus pneumonia, H. influenza type B, Cytomegalovirus or CMV, measles, tetanus, etc.). We use our proprietary
RSV microneutralization assay to test for standardized levels of neutralizing antibodies to RSV in the final drug product.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">In the third quarter of 2015, the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, accepted for review our Biologics License Application, or BLA, for RI-002 for
the treatment of PIDD. In July 2016, the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter, or CRL. The CRL did not cite any concerns
with the clinical safety or efficacy data for RI-002 submitted in the BLA, nor did the FDA request any additional clinical
studies be completed prior to FDA approval of RI-002. The FDA identified in the CRL, among other things, certain
outstanding inspection issues and deficiencies relating to Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls, or CMC, at our
third-party contract manufacturers and vendors and requested documentation of corrections for a number of those issues. The
FDA indicated in the CRL that it cannot grant final approval of the BLA until, among other things,&nbsp;these deficiencies
are resolved. Since receiving the CRL, we have worked diligently with our contract fill and finisher as well as the contract
testing laboratory. We have also continued to work with our third-party contract manufacturer, Biotest Pharmaceuticals
Corporation, or Seller or BPC, and on January 23, 2017 we announced the signing of a definitive acquisition agreement to
acquire certain manufacturing and therapy-related assets from BPC in Boca Raton, Florida, a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Biotest AG, or Biotest, in efforts to address the CRL and remediate the outstanding warning letter and other matters at the
manufacturing facility.</P>

our third-party manufacturers and vendors to identify solutions to outstanding issues identified in the CRL. We are
currently preparing documentation for an additional submission to the FDA to address the CRL. We, along with our vendors, are
awaiting certain feedback from the FDA regarding previous submissions and we intend to provide a timeline for resubmission of
our BLA for RI-002 as soon as practicable. If RI-002 is approved by the FDA for PIDD, we intend to commercialize RI-002 for the
treatment of PIDD and explore alternative regulatory processes to evaluate and seek approval for RI-002 for additional
indications, patient populations and uses.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">PIDD, a genetic disorder that causes a deficient
or absent immune system, is caused by hereditary or genetic defects and can affect anyone regardless of age or gender. PIDD patients
are more vulnerable to infections and more likely to suffer complications from these infections. IVIG is a plasma derived product
that is used to prevent serious infections in patients with PIDD. It is comprised of polyclonal antibodies, which are proteins
produced by B-cells that are used by the body&rsquo;s immune system to neutralize foreign objects such as bacteria and viruses.
It is estimated that there are about 250,000 diagnosed PIDD patients in the U.S., approximately half of whom are treated
with IVIG regularly. In the U.S., sales of immune globulin products for all its uses were reported to be approximately
$4.8 billion in 2014.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">The RI-002 pivotal Phase III clinical trial
was conducted as a single arm study in which patients were treated approximately once per month for a period of 12 months plus
90 days for follow up. Fifty-nine patients were enrolled in nine treatment centers in the U.S. The pivotal Phase III primary
endpoint followed published FDA industry guidance, which provides for a reduction in the incidence of serious infections to less
than one per year in each subject receiving IVIG. The secondary outcome was safety and included other pharmacokinetic, or PK, data
collection points including antibody titers for certain agents, including RSV antibody levels at various time points after infusion.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">RI-002 demonstrated positive results in
the Phase III study in patients with PIDD, meeting its primary endpoint, of no&nbsp;Serious Bacterial Infections, or SBI,&nbsp;reported.
RI-002 was administered a total of 793 infusions with zero serious adverse events to 59 patients in nine treatment centers throughout
the U.S. These results, included in the BLA, more than meet the requirement specified by FDA guidance of&nbsp;&le; 1
SBI per patient-year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">On February 22, 2015, at the 2015 American
Academy of Allergy, Asthma &amp; Immunology Annual Meeting, scientific investigators reported on the secondary outcomes that included:
a total of 93 days, or 1.66 days per patient per year lost from work or school due to infection; one hospitalization due to an
infection of only five days duration in the entire study and IgG trough levels above those required by the FDA for IVIG products.
Additionally, there was a marked increase in all of the measured specific anti-pathogen antibodies in PK subjects (n=31). The mean
of maximum fold increases in specific antibody levels after infusion of RI-002 ranged from 1.9 fold (S. pneumonia type 19A) to
5.3 fold (RSV), which were statistically significant fold increases from the pathogen's specific measured baselines. The safety
profile of RI-002 is comparable to that of other immunoglobulins.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">RSV is a common virus that ordinarily leads
to mild, cold-like symptoms in healthy adults and children. In high-risk groups, such as the PIDD population and the other immune-compromised
populations, RSV can lead to a more serious infection and may even cause death. The polyclonal antibodies which are present in
RI-002 are expected to prevent infections in immune-compromised patients.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">We previously conducted a randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled Phase II clinical trial to evaluate RI-001, RI-002&rsquo;s predecessor product candidate, in immune-compromised,
RSV-infected patients. This trial was conducted with 21 patients in the U.S., Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. The
Phase II dose-ranging trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in the change from baseline RSV titers to day
18 in the high dose and low dose treatment groups when compared with placebo (p=0.0043 and p=0.0268, respectively). The mean fold
increase for high dose was 9.24 (95% CI 4.07, 21.02) and the observed mean fold increase for low dose was 4.85 (95% CI 2.22, 10.59).
The mean fold change for placebo treated patients was 1.42 (95% CI 0.64, 3.17). In addition, more patients in the high dose (85.7%)
and low dose (42.9%) groups experienced greater than a four-fold increase from baseline to day 18 in RSV titer levels compared
to placebo (0%). There were no serious drug-related adverse events reported during the trial.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">From April 2009 through February 2011, RI-001
was also administered to 15 compassionate use patients where physicians requested access to the product for treating their patients
with documented lower respiratory tract RSV infections due to the fact that these patients had failed conventional therapeutic
interventions. Serum samples were obtained from 13 patients. Samples showed that patients demonstrated a four-fold or greater rise
in RSV antibody titers from baseline. Serum samples were not obtained from two patients that received Palivizumab. All 11 patients
who received RI-001 within 4.2 days after the onset of the diagnosis of RSV survived. The drug was well-tolerated in all 15 patients
and there were no reports of serious adverse events attributable to RI-001. Data from our Phase II clinical trial, compassionate
use experience and data obtained from the evaluation of RI-002 in the infected cotton rat animal model has been presented at various
conferences during 2014, 2015 and 2016.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">During the second quarter of 2015, we received
a notice of allowance from the U.S. Patent Office, or USPTO, for our RI-002 patent filed under U.S. patent application
14/592,721 entitled &lsquo;Compositions and Methods for the Treatment of Immunodeficiency,&rsquo; which extends through January
2035. &nbsp;During the third quarter of 2015, our U.S. Patent 9,107,906 was issued by the USPTO. This patent describes methods
by which the blending of plasma obtained from normal donors with plasma obtained from donors selected to have high levels of neutralizing
titers to RSV form a unique antibody enriched plasma pool and provide for the standardization of the levels of anti-RSV antibodies
in the RI-002 final product. Our proprietary microneutralization assay allows us to effectively identify and isolate donor plasma

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">Our wholly-owned subsidiary, ADMA BioCenters,
operates two FDA-licensed, German Health Authority, or GHA, and Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety, or MFDS, certified source
plasma collection facilities located in Norcross, Georgia and Marietta, Georgia, which provide us with a portion of our blood plasma
for the manufacture of RI-002. Our plasma collection center in Marietta, Georgia received FDA approval in the third quarter of
2015. A typical plasma collection center, such as those operated by&nbsp;ADMA BioCenters, can collect approximately 30,000 to 50,000
liters of source plasma annually, which may be sold for different prices depending upon the type of plasma, quantity of purchase,
and market conditions at the time of sale. Plasma collected from ADMA BioCenters' two Georgia facilities that is not used for making
RI-002 is sold to third-party customers in the U.S.,&nbsp;and other locations&nbsp;where we are approved globally under
supply agreements or in the open &quot;spot&quot; market. We have entered into long-term manufacturing and licensing agreements
with Biotest&nbsp;and its U.S. subsidiary, BPC, that provide for the exclusive manufacture of RI-002. At the same
time, we granted Biotest  an exclusive, royalty-bearing license to market and sell RSV antibody-enriched IVIG in Europe and in
other selected territories in North Africa and the Middle East.</P>

characterized by defects in the immune system, due to either a lack of necessary antibodies or a failure of these antibodies to
function properly.&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the World Health Organization, there are over 150 different presentations of PIDD.&nbsp;&nbsp;As
patients suffering from PIDD lack a properly functioning immune system, they typically receive monthly, outpatient infusions of
IVIG therapy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Without this exogenous antibody immune support, these patients would be susceptible to a wide variety
of infectious diseases.&nbsp;&nbsp;PIDD has an estimated prevalence of 1:1,200 in the U.S., or approximately 250,000 people.&nbsp;&nbsp;Of
these 250,000 people diagnosed with PIDD in the U.S., approximately 125,000 receive monthly infusions of IVIG and it is
estimated that over 300,000 patients worldwide receive monthly IVIG infusions for PIDD.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">As most&nbsp;patients with PIDD present
with infections, the differential diagnosis and initial investigations for an underlying immune defect are typically guided by
the clinical presentation.&nbsp; In subjects with PIDD, individual infections are not necessarily more severe than those that occur
in a normal host.&nbsp; Rather, the clinical features suggestive of an immune defect may be the recurring and/or chronic nature
of infections with common pathogens that may result in end organ damage, such as bronchiectasis.&nbsp; In addition, subjects with
PIDD will often respond poorly to standard antimicrobial therapy or they may have repeated infections with the same pathogen.&nbsp;
The virulence of the infecting organism should also be considered, and a subject&rsquo;s immune competence should be questioned
when invasive infections are caused by low virulence or opportunistic pathogens.&nbsp; For example, infection with the opportunistic
pathogens Pneumocystis jiroveci (previously Pneumocystis carinii) or atypical mycobacteria should prompt an investigation for underlying
immunodeficiency. Typical clinical presentations for subjects with PIDD are:</P>

adulthood, posing a considerable challenge for the practicing physician to know when and how to evaluate a subject for a possible
immune defect. &nbsp;Subjects with marked antibody deficiencies are generally&nbsp;dependent on IVIG therapy for survival.&nbsp;
Benefits of adequate IVIG therapy in subjects not able to produce antibodies normally include a reduction of the severity and frequency
of infections, prevention of chronic lung disease and prevention of enteroviral meningoencephalitis.&nbsp; Several immune globulin
products have already been approved by the FDA.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">RI-002, our IVIG product candidate, contains
polyclonal antibodies against various infectious agents (e.g., streptococcus pneumoniae, H. influenza type B, CMV, measles, tetanus,
etc.) including standardized antibodies against RSV.&nbsp;RSV is a common respiratory virus that often presents during the winter
months.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearly all children will have been infected with RSV by three years of age; however, the immune systems of most
healthy children prevent significant morbidity and mortality.&nbsp;&nbsp;Conversely, in patients who are immune-compromised, such
as those with PIDD or who have undergone a hematopoietic stem cell or solid organ transplant and may be on immunosuppressive drugs
or chemotherapy, RSV infection can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality.&nbsp;&nbsp;Immune-compromised patients
historically have a 5% to 15% rate of RSV infection, and, if left untreated, lower respiratory tract RSV infections in immune-compromised
patients can result in a mortality rate of up to 40% of infected patients.&nbsp;&nbsp;In hematopoietic stem cell transplant, or
HSCT, patients, a subset of the immune-compromised patient population with approximately 25,000 transplants being performed annually
in the U.S., it is estimated that about 25% of patients treated with the current standard of care (aerosolized Ribavirin)
will progress to lower respiratory tract infection, or LRTI, while 41% of patients untreated with the current standard of care
will progress to LRTI.</P>

&ldquo;plasmapheresis.&rdquo; During plasmapheresis, a donor&rsquo;s blood is drawn into a specialized medical device that separates
the plasma component through centrifugation, and then returns the other blood components back into the donor&rsquo;s bloodstream.&nbsp;&nbsp;Plasmapheresis
is performed utilizing an FDA-approved, automated device with a sterile, self-contained collection kit.&nbsp;&nbsp;The plasma that
is collected is known as &ldquo;normal source plasma.&rdquo; There are over 500 plasma donation centers in the U.S. As
noted in a variety of plasma industry trade reports and related conferences, approximately 35 million liters of source plasma were
collected in the U.S. in 2015.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the U.S., a donor may donate plasma a maximum of two times during
any seven-day period, with at least two days in between donations.&nbsp;&nbsp;Plasma donation centers in the U.S. typically
pay donors $25 to $50 per donation and some donors with rare or high antibody levels can be paid more.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">In order to isolate the desired therapeutic
elements in normal source plasma, it must initially undergo a manufacturing process called &ldquo;fractionation.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
process of fractionation was invented in the 1940&rsquo;s by E.J. Cohn and is referred to as the Cohn method or cold ethanol fractionation.&nbsp;&nbsp;First,
the source plasma undergoes a process called pooling, in which the individual plasma donations are combined into a pooling tank.&nbsp;&nbsp;Second,
the Cohn fractionation method, which is a combination of time, temperature, pH, alcohol concentration, and centrifugation, is used
to separate the desired plasma protein components, or &ldquo;fractions.&rdquo; After fractionation, the separated proteins are
then re-suspended and are treated with a solvent detergent treatment process for viral inactivation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, other forms
of filtration (e.g., nanofiltration) are performed as an additional viral removal and viral reduction step.&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally,
with the various components separated and purified, the bulk product is formulated and filled into final, finished vials.&nbsp;&nbsp;During
these various steps of manufacturing, each lot is reviewed and tested for potency and purity prior to being approved for release.</P>

categories: albumin (60% of protein volume), immune globulins (15% of protein volume), coagulation factors (1% of protein volume),
and other proteins (24% of protein volume) such as alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor, C1 esterase inhibitor, fibrin sealants and fibrinogen.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many
of the other proteins in plasma have yet to be developed into commercial therapies.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the U.S., not only are
the plasma collection centers subject to FDA licensure, but each plasma protein product that is derived and fractionated from plasma
must undergo an approval process with FDA&rsquo;s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>

three ways: intramuscularly, intravenously or subcutaneously.&nbsp;&nbsp;IVIG principally contains antibodies and, as such, provides
passive immunization for individuals who are immune-deficient or who have been exposed to various infectious agents.&nbsp;&nbsp;IVIG
is used therapeutically in a variety of immunological diseases/deficiencies, such as PIDD, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,
Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome, Kawasaki disease, bone marrow transplant, and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy.&nbsp;&nbsp;We
are aware that other companies are also evaluating IVIG in a clinical study for the treatment of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease. Additionally,
IVIG is also used as therapy in a variety of other diseases that do not involve primary or secondary immune deficiencies, such
as multiple sclerosis, skin disease, and asthma.&nbsp;&nbsp;These latter uses are referred to as &ldquo;off-label&rdquo; or evidence-based
uses because the FDA has not approved their use in these indications and promotion of such uses is not permitted by FDA unless
a BLA or BLA supplement with additional data is approved.&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the various IVIG products, there are only 14 labeled
indications approved by the FDA.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, medical literature identifies at least 150 evidence based uses for IVIG, of
which approximately 60 are currently included on lists of reimbursable uses by Medicare and other healthcare plans.&nbsp;&nbsp;This

standard and hyperimmune.&nbsp;&nbsp;The difference between standard immune globulins and hyperimmune globulins is that the latter
are manufactured using plasma obtained from donors who have elevated amounts (high-titers) of specific antibodies.&nbsp;&nbsp;These
high-titer products can be used to treat and prevent diseases that present those specific antigens that are reactive with the high-titer
antibodies.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hyperimmune products currently available include hepatitis B, tetanus, rabies cytomegalovirus and RhoD immune
globulins.</P>

candidate, RI-002, for the treatment of PIDD, and have completed a pivotal Phase III clinical study. RI-002 is derived from human
plasma blended from normal donors and donors tested to have high levels of neutralizing titers to RSV. RI-002 is manufactured using
a process called fractionation, which purifies immune globulins, or IgG, from this blended plasma pool resulting in a final IVIG
product enriched with naturally occurring polyclonal anti-pathogen antibodies (e.g., streptococcus pneumonia, H. influenza type
B, Cytomegalovirus or CMV, measles, tetanus, etc.). We use our proprietary RSV microneutralization assay to test for standardized
levels of neutralizing antibodies to RSV in the final drug product.</P>

the clinical safety or efficacy data for RI-002 submitted in the BLA, nor did the FDA request any additional clinical studies be
completed prior to FDA approval of RI-002. The FDA identified in the CRL, among other things, certain outstanding inspection issues

of those issues. The FDA indicated in the CRL that it cannot grant final approval of the BLA until, among other things,&nbsp;these
deficiencies are resolved.</P>

or absent immune system, is caused by hereditary or genetic defects and can affect anyone regardless of age or gender. PIDD patients
are more vulnerable to infections and more likely to suffer complications from these infections. IVIG is a plasma derived product
that is used to prevent serious infections in patients with PIDD. It is comprised of polyclonal antibodies, which are proteins
produced by B-cells that are used by the body&rsquo;s immune system to neutralize foreign objects such as bacteria and viruses.
It is estimated that there are about 250,000 diagnosed PIDD patients in the U.S., approximately half of whom are treated
with IVIG regularly. In the U.S., sales of immune globulin products for all its uses were reported to be approximately
$4.8 billion in 2014.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">The RI-002 pivotal Phase III clinical
trial was conducted as a single arm study in which patients were treated approximately once per month for a period of 12
months plus 90 days for follow up. Fifty-nine  patients were enrolled in nine treatment centers in the U.S. The pivotal Phase
III primary endpoint followed published FDA industry guidance, which provides for a reduction in the incidence of serious
infections to less than one per year in each subject receiving IVIG. The secondary outcome was safety and included other
pharmacokinetic, or PK, data collection points including antibody titers for certain agents, including RSV antibody levels at
various time points after infusion.</P>

a total of 93 days, or 1.66 days per patient per year lost from work or school due to infection; one hospitalization due to an
infection of only five days duration in the entire study and IgG trough levels above those required by the FDA for IVIG products.
Additionally, there was a marked increase in all of the measured specific anti-pathogen antibodies in PK subjects (n=31). The mean
of maximum fold increases in specific antibody levels after infusion of RI-002 ranged from 1.9 fold (S. pneumonia type 19A) to
5.3 fold (RSV), which were statistically significant fold increases from the pathogen's specific measured baselines. The safety

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">RSV is a common virus that ordinarily leads
to mild, cold-like symptoms in healthy adults and children. In high-risk groups, such as the PIDD population and the other immune-compromised
populations, RSV can lead to a more serious infection and may even cause death. The polyclonal antibodies which are present in
RI-002 are expected to prevent infections in immune-compromised patients.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">We previously conducted a randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled Phase II clinical trial to evaluate RI-001, RI-002&rsquo;s predecessor product candidate, in immune-compromised,
RSV-infected patients. This trial was conducted with 21 patients in the U.S., Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. The
Phase II dose-ranging trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in the change from baseline RSV titers to day
18 in the high dose and low dose treatment groups when compared with placebo (p=0.0043 and p=0.0268, respectively). The mean fold
increase for high dose was 9.24 (95% CI 4.07, 21.02) and the observed mean fold increase for low dose was 4.85 (95% CI 2.22, 10.59).
The mean fold change for placebo treated patients was 1.42 (95% CI 0.64, 3.17). In addition, more patients in the high dose (85.7%)
and low dose (42.9%) groups experienced greater than a four-fold increase from baseline to day 18 in RSV titer levels compared
to placebo (0%). There were no serious drug-related adverse events reported during the trial.</P>

was also administered to 15 compassionate use patients where physicians requested access to the product for treating their patients
with documented lower respiratory tract RSV infections due to the fact that these patients had failed conventional therapeutic
interventions. Serum samples were obtained from 13 patients. Samples showed that patients demonstrated a four-fold or greater rise
in RSV antibody titers from baseline. Serum samples were not obtained from two patients that received Palivizumab. All 11 patients
who received RI-001 within 4.2 days after the onset of the diagnosis of RSV survived. The drug was well-tolerated in all 15 patients
and there were no reports of serious adverse events attributable to RI-001. Data from our Phase II clinical trial, compassionate
use experience and data obtained from the evaluation of RI-002 in the infected cotton rat animal model has been presented at various

in Norcross and Marietta, Georgia, which facilities provide us with a portion of our plasma requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;By using our
patented proprietary assay, we can identify plasma donors with elevated amounts of RSV antibodies and formulate RI-002 with an
appropriate RSV titer level to ensure the final product is standardized to contain high levels of RSV antibodies.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once
source plasma has been collected, it is then fractionated and purified into specialized therapies, which are used by patients who
require them.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have agreements with independent third parties for the sourcing of blood plasma and for the fractionation

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">Although blood plasma and its derivative
proteins are not subject to patent protection, the FDA recognizes each immune globulin product as unique and generally requires
a separate Investigational New Drug, or IND, clinical trial and BLA for each as a condition to approval.&nbsp;&nbsp;Regardless
of whether competitors are able to develop an assay that can achieve our level of consistency and reproducibility in providing
RSV antibody titer data, we believe they would still be required to validate and qualify such an assay as well as conduct clinical
trials and undergo an FDA review prior to marketing an immune globulin product.&nbsp;&nbsp;The plasma products industry is highly
competitive.&nbsp;&nbsp;We face, and will continue to face, intense competition from both U.S.-based and foreign producers
of plasma products, some of which have lower cost structures, greater access to capital, direct ownership of manufacturing facilities,
greater resources for research and development, and sophisticated marketing capabilities.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">These competitors may include: CSL Behring,
Grifols Biologicals, Shire, Octapharma and Kedrion.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to competition from other large worldwide plasma products
providers, we face competition in local areas from smaller entities.&nbsp;&nbsp;In Europe, where the industry is highly regulated
and health care systems vary from country to country, local companies may have greater knowledge of local health care systems,
more established infrastructures and have existing regulatory approvals or a better understanding of the local regulatory process,
allowing them to market their products more quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, plasma therapy generally faces competition from non-plasma
products and other courses of treatments.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, recombinant Factor VIII products compete with plasma-derived
products in the treatment of Hemophilia A.</P>

a notice of allowance from the U.S. Patent Office, or USPTO, for our RI-002 patent filed under U.S. patent application
14/592,721 entitled &lsquo;Compositions and Methods for the Treatment of Immunodeficiency,&rsquo; which extends through January
2035. &nbsp;During the third quarter of 2015 our U.S. Patent 9,107,906 was issued by the USPTO. This patent describes methods by
which the blending of plasma obtained from normal donors with plasma obtained from donors selected to have high levels of neutralizing
titers to RSV form a unique antibody enriched plasma pool and provide for the standardization of the levels of anti-RSV antibodies
in the RI-002 final product. Our proprietary microneutralization assay allows us to effectively identify and isolate donor plasma
with high-titer RSV antibodies and to standardize RI-002&rsquo;s antibody profile, which we believe may enable us to garner a premium
price.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">In the U.S., the FDA regulates products
under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and related regulations. Our current and anticipated future product candidates
are considered &ldquo;biologics&rdquo; under the FDA regulatory framework. FDA's regulatory authority for the approval of biologics
resides in the PHS Act. However, biologics are also subject to regulation under the FDCA because most biological products also
meet the FDCA&rsquo;s definition of &quot;drugs.&quot; Most pharmaceuticals or &ldquo;conventional drugs&rdquo; consist of pure
chemical substances and their structures are known. Most biologics, however, are complex mixtures that are not easily identified
or characterized. Biological products differ from conventional drugs in that they tend to be heat-sensitive and susceptible to
microbial contamination. This requires sterile processes to be applied from initial manufacturing steps.&nbsp;&nbsp;The process
required by the FDA before our product candidates may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following (although the FDA
is given wide discretion to impose different or more stringent requirements on a case-by-case basis):</P>

the application should be approved, which information is taken into consideration along with FDA&rsquo;s own review
findings.&nbsp;&nbsp;The FDA may refuse to approve a BLA and issue a&nbsp;CRL&nbsp;if the applicable regulatory criteria are
not satisfied.&nbsp;&nbsp;In a CRL, it may also require additional clinical or other data, including one or more additional
pivotal Phase III clinical trials.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if such requested data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that
the BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval and issue a denial of the BLA.&nbsp;&nbsp;Data from clinical trials are
not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we do.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the FDA&rsquo;s evaluations of the
BLA and the clinical and manufacturing procedures and facilities are favorable, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a
CRL, which contains the conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the BLA.&nbsp;&nbsp;If a CRL is
issued, a company has up to twelve months to resubmit or withdraw the BLA, unless the FDA allows for an extension. If a CRL is
issued, if and when those items have been resolved to the FDA&rsquo;s satisfaction, the FDA will issue an approval letter,
authorizing commercial marketing of the product for certain indications.&nbsp;&nbsp;The FDA may withdraw product approval if
ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems occur after the product reaches the market.&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition, the FDA may require testing, including Phase IV clinical trials, and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of
approved products that have been commercialized, and the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product
based on the results of these post-marketing programs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Products may be marketed only for the FDA-approved
indications and in accordance with the FDA-approved label.&nbsp;The FDA generally does not allow drugs to be promoted for
&ldquo;off-label&rdquo; uses &ndash; that is, uses that are not described in the product&rsquo;s approved labeling and that
differ from those that were approved by the FDA. Furthermore, the FDA generally limits approved uses to those studied in
clinical trials. If there are any modifications to the product, including changes in indications, other labeling changes, or
manufacturing processes or facilities, we may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new BLA or BLA supplement,
which may require us to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials, and/or require
additional manufacturing data.</P>

approval requirements or similar requirements of foreign regulatory agencies typically takes several years, and the actual time
required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease.&nbsp;&nbsp;Typically, if
a product candidate is intended to treat a chronic disease, as is the case with RI-002, safety and efficacy data must be gathered
over an extended period of time.&nbsp;&nbsp;Government regulation may delay or prevent marketing of product candidates for a considerable
period of time and impose costly procedures upon our activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;The FDA or any other regulatory agency may not grant
approvals for changes in dose form or new indications for a product candidate on a timely basis, or at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if
a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific disease states, patient
populations and dosages.&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, even after regulatory approval is obtained, later discovery of previously unknown
problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market.&nbsp;&nbsp;Delays
in obtaining, or failures to obtain, regulatory approvals for any of our product candidates would harm our business.&nbsp;&nbsp;In

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">Biological drug products manufactured
or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to extensive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other
things, requirements relating to recordkeeping (including certain electronic record and signature requirements), periodic reporting,
product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of certain adverse experiences, deviations, and other
problems with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling
claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products
and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with
clinical data.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">Manufacturers must continue to comply
with cGMP requirements, which are extensive and require considerable time, resources and ongoing investment to ensure compliance.
In addition, changes to the manufacturing process generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types
of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further
FDA review and approval.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">Manufacturers and certain other entities
involved in the manufacturing and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA
and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance
with cGMP and other laws. The cGMP requirements apply to all stages of the manufacturing process, including the production, processing,
sterilization, packaging, labeling, storage and shipment of the product. Manufacturers must establish validated systems to ensure
that products meet specifications and regulatory standards, and test each product batch or lot prior to its release. For biologics
products in particular, for each product lot the applicant must submit materials relating to that lot to the FDA before the lot
can be released for distribution.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">Changes to the manufacturing process
are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation
and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party
manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in
the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">The FDA may impose a number of
post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an application. The FDA may withdraw a product approval if
compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later
discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency,
problems with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in restrictions on the
product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. Failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory
requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, suspension of
manufacturing, sales or use, seizure of product, injunctive action or possible fines and other penalties.&nbsp;&nbsp;We
cannot be certain that we or our present or future third-party manufacturers or suppliers will be able to comply with the
cGMP regulations and other ongoing FDA regulatory requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;If we or our present or future third-party
manufacturers or suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements, the FDA may halt our clinical trials, require us
to recall a product from distribution, or withdraw approval of the BLA for that product.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">The FDA closely regulates the post-approval
marketing and promotion of products, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion,
industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet.&nbsp;&nbsp;A company
can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are approved by the FDA.&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure to comply with these
requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning and/or other regulatory letters, corrective advertising and potential major
fines and other penalties.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">In addition, the distribution of
prescription drug products (including biological drug products) is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA), which
regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and
regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription product samples
and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly
change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. In addition
to new legislation, FDA regulations, guidance, and policies are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may
significantly affect our business and our product candidates. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative or FDA regulation
or policy changes will be enacted or implemented and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.</P>

manufacturing centers which engage in interstate commerce must be licensed by the FDA.&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to achieve licensure,
the organization must submit a BLA and undergo pre-licensure inspection.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our ADMA BioCenters, located in Norcross and
Marietta, Georgia, have completed these requirements and hold FDA licenses along with GHA and MFDS certifications.&nbsp;&nbsp;In
order to maintain the license, the facilities operated by ADMA BioCenters will be inspected at least every two years.&nbsp;&nbsp;ADMA

of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of any future product.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether
or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign
countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries.&nbsp;&nbsp;The approval process
varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.&nbsp;&nbsp;The requirements
governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">Significant uncertainty exists as
to the coverage and reimbursement status of any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. In the U.S., sales
of any products for which we may receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage
and reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities, managed care providers, private health
insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate
from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product. Third-party payors may limit
coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for
a particular indication. Moreover, a payor&rsquo;s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate
reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels
sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0 0pt 1in; text-indent: 0in">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">Third-party payors are increasingly
challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition
to their safety and efficacy. In order to obtain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, we
may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of
any products, in addition to the costs required to obtain regulatory approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically
necessary or cost-effective. If third-party payors do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies,
they may not cover the product after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient
to allow a company to sell its products at a profit.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">The U.S. government and state legislatures
have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs,
including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription
drugs. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation
Act, collectively, the Healthcare Reform Law, contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products, including,
for example, increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care
plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies&rsquo; share
of sales to federal health care programs. Adoption of government controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies
in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceuticals.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer
if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, an increasing emphasis
on cost containment measures in the U.S. has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical
pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement
status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement
rates may be implemented in the future.</P>

our ability to raise additional capital, fund our research and development and commercial programs, establish and build out a commercial

capital during the second half of 2017, we will likely not have sufficient cash flow and liquidity to fund our business operations
as we currently operate, forcing us to curtail our activities and&nbsp;potentially significantly reduce, or potentially cease operations.
Even if we are able to raise additional capital, such financings may only be available on unattractive terms, resulting in significant
dilution of stockholders' interests and, in such event, the value and potential future market price of our common stock may decline.

are sufficient to fund our operations, as currently conducted, into the second half of 2017. These estimates may change based upon
whether or when the FDA approves RI-002, the timing of any required commercial manufacturing scale up activities or if any of our
other assumptions change. These estimates may also change based upon the timing of the completion of the Proposed Acquisition which

us consisting of: $12.5 million in funding, $15.0 million in debt financing and an additional $12.5 million commitment towards
a future equity financing is expected to be sufficient to fund operations into the first quarter of 2018. There is no assurance

do not have arrangements to obtain additional financing. Any such financing could be difficult to obtain or only available on unattractive
terms and could result in significant dilution to stockholders. Failure to secure necessary financing in a timely manner and on
favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business plan and financial performance and could delay, discontinue
or prevent product development, clinical trial or commercialization activities, or the approval of any of our potential products.
In addition, we could be forced to reduce or forego sales and marketing efforts and forego attractive business opportunities.</P>

accompanies our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016, indicating that our current
liquidity position raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to improve our liquidity
position we may not be able to continue as a going concern.&nbsp; If we are unable to continue as a going concern, we may have
to liquidate our assets and may receive less than the value at which those assets are carried on our financial statements. We may
also be forced to make reductions in spending, including delaying or curtailing our clinical development, trials or commercialization
efforts, or seek to extend payment terms with our vendors and licensing partners. Our ability to raise or borrow the capital needed
to improve our financial condition may be hindered by a variety of factors, including market conditions and the availability of
such financing on acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funding, our business, prospects, financial
condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected and we may be unable to continue as a going concern.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result if we are unable to continue
as a going concern and, therefore, be required to realize our assets and discharge our liabilities other than in the normal course
of business which could cause our security holders to suffer the loss of all or a substantial portion of their investment in our

of 2017. In order to have sufficient cash to fund our operations thereafter, we will need to raise additional equity or debt capital
by the end of the second half of 2017 in order to continue as a going concern, and we cannot provide any assurance that we will
be successful in doing so. This time frame may change based upon the timing of our commercial manufacturing scale up activities
and the timing of the closing of the Proposed Acquisition. If our assumptions underlying our estimated expenses prove to be wrong,
we may have to raise additional capital sooner than the second half of 2017. These assumptions may also change based upon the timing
of the completion of the Proposed Acquisition, anticipated during the first half of 2017, of which funds received from BPC
at the closing of the Proposed Acquisition are expected to be sufficient to fund operations into the first quarter of 2018.</P>

results of later clinical trials will replicate the results of prior clinical trials and preclinical testing. The clinical trial
process may fail to demonstrate that our product candidates are safe for humans and effective for indicated uses. This failure
would cause us to abandon a product candidate and may delay development of other product candidates. Any delay in, or termination
of, our clinical trials will delay our ability to commercialize our product candidates and generate product revenues. In addition,
our clinical trials involve a relatively small patient population. Because of the small sample size, the results of these clinical
trials may not be indicative of future results. In addition, certain portions of the clinical trial and product testing for RI-002
were performed outside of the U.S., and therefore, may not have been performed in accordance with standards normally required
by the FDA and other regulatory agencies.</P>

RI-002 or any other product candidate we may acquire or develop in the future. In order to obtain FDA approval of RI-002 or any
other product candidate requiring FDA approval, our clinical development must demonstrate that the product candidate is safe for
humans and effective for its intended use, and we must submit a BLA. To obtain required FDA approval of any other product candidate
generally requires significant research and testing, referred to as preclinical studies, as well as human tests, referred to as
clinical trials. Satisfaction of the FDA's regulatory requirements typically takes many years, depends upon the type, complexity
and novelty of the product candidate and requires substantial resources for research, development and testing. We cannot predict
whether our research and clinical approaches will result in products that the FDA considers safe for humans and effective for indicated
uses. The FDA has substantial discretion in the product approval process and may require us to conduct additional preclinical and
clinical testing or to perform post-marketing studies. The approval process may also be delayed by changes in government regulation,
future legislation or administrative action or changes in FDA policy that occur prior to or during our regulatory review. Delays

advertising and promotion of prescription drugs. These regulations include standards and restrictions for direct-to-consumer advertising,
industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, promotional activities involving the Internet and off-label promotion.
The FDA generally does not allow drugs to be promoted for &ldquo;off-label&rdquo; uses&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;that is, uses that
are not described in the product&rsquo;s labeling and that differ from those that were approved by the FDA. Generally, the FDA
limits approved uses to those studied by a company in its clinical trials. In addition to the FDA approval required for new formulations,
any new indication for an approved product also requires FDA approval. We have sought approval from FDA to market RI-002 for the
treatment of PIDD and, even if approved, we cannot be sure whether we will be able to obtain FDA approval for any desired future
indications for RI-002.</P>

and are generally permitted to prescribe drugs for uses that are not described in the product&rsquo;s labeling, and for uses that
differ from those tested in clinical studies and approved by the regulatory authorities, our ability to promote our products is
narrowly limited to those indications that are specifically approved by the FDA. &ldquo;Off-label&rdquo; uses are common across
medical specialties and may constitute an appropriate treatment for some patients in varied circumstances. Regulatory authorities
in the U.S. generally do not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. Regulatory authorities do, however,
restrict communications by pharmaceutical companies on the subject of off-label use. Although recent court decisions suggest that
certain off-label communications (e.g., truthful and non-misleading speech) may be protected under the First Amendment, the scope
of any such protection is unclear, and there are still significant risks in this area as it is unclear how these court decisions
will impact the FDA&rsquo;s enforcement practices, and there is likely to be substantial disagreement and difference of opinion
regarding whether any particular statement is truthful and not misleading. Moreover, while we intend to promote our products
consistent with what we believe to be the approved indication for our drugs, the FDA may disagree. If the FDA determines that
our promotional activities fail to comply with the FDA&rsquo;s regulations or guidelines, we may be subject to warnings from,
or enforcement action by, these authorities. In addition, our failure to follow FDA rules and guidelines relating to promotion
and advertising may cause the FDA to issue warning letters or untitled letters, bring an enforcement action against us, suspend
or withdraw an approved product from the market, require a recall or institute fines or civil fines, or could result in disgorgement
of money, operating restrictions, injunctions or criminal prosecution, any of which could harm our reputation and our business.</P>

and Security Agreement, or LSA, with Oxford for up to $21.0 million and refinanced our existing loan with Hercules Technology Growth
Capital, Inc. or Hercules. The first tranche of $16.0 million from the Oxford loan was primarily used to repay our existing facility
with Hercules. In May 2016, we amended the LSA with Oxford and we borrowed an additional $4.0 million, bringing the total principal
amount borrowed to $20.0 million. The LSA bears interest at a rate per annum equal to the greater of (i) 7.80% and (ii) the sum
of (a) the three month U.S. LIBOR rate (as reported in <I>The Wall Street Journal</I>) on the date occurring on the last business
day of the month that immediately precedes the month in which the interest will accrue, plus (b) 7.54% on the outstanding principal
balance. We became obligated to begin to repay the principal over 36 months beginning February 1, 2017, unless accelerated as a
result of certain events of default.&nbsp; A final payment equal to 8.95% of the funded loan amount is due at the earlier of loan
maturity or prepayment. In addition, a facility fee of $105,000 was paid at closing.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event we elect to prepay
the loan, we are obligated to pay a prepayment charge corresponding to a percentage of the principal amount of the loan, with such
percentage being: (i) for a prepayment made on or after the funding date of the applicable term loan through and including the
first anniversary of its funding date, an amount equal to 3.00% of the principal amount of the term loan prepaid; (ii) for a prepayment
made after the first anniversary of the funding date of the applicable term loan through and including the second anniversary of
such funding date, an amount equal to 2.00% of the principal amount of such term loan prepaid; and (iii) for a prepayment of a
term loan made after the second anniversary of its funding date and prior to its maturity date, an amount equal to 1.00% of the
principal amount of the term loan prepaid.&nbsp; The loan matures no later than January 1, 2020.&nbsp; The loan is secured by our
assets, except for our intellectual property (which is subject to a negative pledge). Events of default under the agreement include,
but are not limited to: (i) insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy or similar events; (ii) failure to pay any debts due under the
LSA or other loan documents on a timely basis; (iii) failure to observe any covenant or secured obligation under the LSA or other
loan documents, which failure, in most cases, is not cured within 10 days of written notice by lender; (iv) occurrence of any default
under any other agreement between us and the lender, which is not cured within 10 days; (v) occurrence of an event that could reasonably
be expected to have a material adverse effect;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vi) material misrepresentations; (vii) occurrence of any default under
any other agreement involving indebtedness or the occurrence of a default under any agreement that could reasonably be expected
to have a material adverse effect; and (viii) certain money judgments are entered against us or a certain portion of its assets
are attached or seized.&nbsp;Remedies for events of default include acceleration of amounts owing under the LSA and Oxford taking
immediate possession of, and selling, any collateral securing the loan.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries
are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. Should we obtain regulatory approval for RI-002
or any future product we may develop, we will have to compete with existing therapies. In addition, other companies may pursue
the development of pharmaceuticals that target the same diseases and conditions that we are targeting. We face competition from
pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in the U.S. and abroad. In addition, companies pursuing different but related
fields represent substantial competition. Many of these organizations competing with us have substantially greater capital resources,
larger research and development staffs and facilities, longer product development history in obtaining regulatory approvals and
greater manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do. These organizations also compete with us to attract qualified personnel

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">As we move forward in clinical development
we are also uncovering novel aspects of our product and are drafting patents to cover our inventions.&nbsp;&nbsp;We rely on a combination
of patent rights, trade secrets and nondisclosure and non-competition agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property,
and we will continue to do so. There can be no assurance that our patent, trade secret policies and practices or other agreements
will adequately protect our intellectual property. Our issued patent may be challenged, found to be over-broad or otherwise invalidated
in subsequent proceedings before courts or the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Even if enforceable, we cannot provide
any assurances that it will provide significant protection from competition. The processes, systems, and/or security measures we
use to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies
as a result of any such breaches. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors.

develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets
or proprietary knowledge. To the extent that our consultants, contractors or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others
in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">In the pharmaceutical and biotechnology
industries, the majority of an innovative product&rsquo;s commercial value is realized during its market exclusivity period. In
the U.S. and in some other countries, when market exclusivity expires and generic versions are approved and marketed or when biosimilars
are introduced (even if only for a competing product), there are usually very substantial and rapid declines in a product&rsquo;s
revenues.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">Market exclusivity for our products is based
upon patent rights and certain regulatory forms of exclusivity. The scope of our patent rights may vary from country to country
and may also be dependent on the availability of meaningful legal remedies in a country. The failure to obtain patent and other
intellectual property rights, or limitations on the use or loss of such rights, could be material to us. In some countries, basic
patent protections for our products may not exist because certain countries did not historically offer the right to obtain specific
types of patents and/or we (or our licensors) did not file in those markets. In addition, the patent environment can be unpredictable
and the validity and enforceability of patents cannot be predicted with certainty. Absent relevant patent protection for a product,
once the data exclusivity period expires, generic versions can be approved and marketed.</P>

of our patent rights/or before the final resolution of related patent litigation. Enforcement of claims in patent litigation can
be very costly and&nbsp;no assurance can be given that we will prevail.&nbsp;There is no assurance that RI-002, or any other of
our products for which we are issued a patent, will enjoy market exclusivity for the full time period of the respective patent.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">We may not be able to operate our business
without infringing third-party patents. Numerous U.S. and foreign patents and pending patent applications owned by third
parties exist in fields that relate to the development and commercialization of immune globulins. In addition, many companies have
employed intellectual property litigation as a way to gain a competitive advantage. It is possible that infringement claims may
occur as the number of products and competitors in our market increases. In addition, to the extent that we gain greater visibility
and market exposure as a public company, we face a greater risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement claims.
We cannot be certain that the conduct of our business does not and will not infringe intellectual property or other proprietary
rights of others in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions. If our products, methods, processes and other technologies
are found to infringe third party patent rights, we could be prohibited from manufacturing and commercializing the infringing technology,
process or product unless we obtain a license under the applicable third party patent and pay royalties or are able to design around
such patent. We may be unable to obtain a license on terms acceptable to us, or at all, and we may not be able to redesign our
products or processes to avoid infringement. Even if we are able to redesign our products or processes to avoid an infringement
claim, our efforts to design around the patent could require significant time, effort and expense and ultimately may lead to an
inferior or more costly product and/or process. Any claim of infringement by a third party, even those without merit, could cause
us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim and could distract our management from our business. Furthermore, if
any such claim is successful, a court could order us to pay substantial damages, including compensatory damages for any infringement,
plus prejudgment interest and could, in certain circumstances, treble the compensatory damages and award attorney fees. These damages
could be substantial and could harm our reputation, business, financial condition and operating results. A court also could enter
orders that temporarily, preliminarily or permanently prohibit us, our licensees, if any, and our customers from making, using,
selling, offering to sell or importing one or more of our products or practicing our proprietary technologies or processes, or
could enter an order mandating that we undertake certain remedial activities. Any of these events could seriously harm our business,
operating results and financial condition.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">Financial markets in the U.S.,
Canada, Europe and Asia continue to experience disruption, including, among other things, significant volatility in security prices,
declining valuations of certain investments, as well as severely diminished liquidity and credit availability. Business activity
across a wide range of industries and regions continues to be greatly reduced and local governments and many businesses are still
suffering from the lack of consumer spending and the lack of liquidity in the credit markets. As a clinical-stage biotechnology
company, we rely on third parties for several important aspects of our business, including contract manufacturing of drug product,
plasma collection supplies, transportation and storage of plasma, and conduct of our clinical trials. These third parties may be
unable to satisfy their commitments to us due to tightening of global credit from time to time, which would adversely affect our
business. The continued instability in the credit and financial market conditions may also negatively impact our ability to access
capital and credit markets and our ability to manage our cash balance. While we are unable to predict the continued duration and
severity of the adverse conditions in the U.S. and other countries, any of the circumstances mentioned above could adversely

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">For example, under the Anti-Kickback Law
and similar state laws and regulations, the offer or payment of anything of value for patient referrals, or in return for purchasing,
leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, or ordering of any time or service reimbursable in whole
or in part by a federal health care program is prohibited.&nbsp;&nbsp;This places constraints on the marketing and promotion of
products and on common business arrangements, such as discounted terms and volume incentives for customers in a position to recommend
or choose products for patients, such as physicians and hospitals, and these practices can result in substantial legal penalties,
including, among others, exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Arrangements with referral sources such as purchasers,
group purchasing organizations, physicians and pharmacists must be structured with care to comply with applicable requirements.
Also, certain business practices, such as payments of consulting fees to healthcare providers, sponsorship of educational or research
grants, charitable donations, interactions with healthcare providers that prescribe products for uses not&nbsp;approved by the
FDA and financial support for continuing medical education programs, must be conducted within narrowly prescribed and controlled
limits to avoid any possibility of wrongfully influencing healthcare providers to prescribe or purchase particular products or
as a reward for past prescribing. Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the companion Health Care and Education
Reconciliation Act, which together are referred to as the healthcare reform law, such payments by pharmaceutical manufacturers
to U.S. healthcare practitioners and academic medical centers must be publicly disclosed. A number of states have similar
laws in place. Additional and stricter prohibitions could be implemented by federal and state authorities. Where such practices
have been found to be improper incentives to use such products, government investigations and assessments of penalties against
manufacturers have resulted in substantial damages and fines. Many manufacturers have been required to enter into consent decrees
or orders that prescribe allowable corporate conduct.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">Failure to satisfy requirements under the
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act can also result in penalties, as well as requirements to enter into consent decrees or orders
that prescribe allowable corporate conduct. In addition, while regulatory authorities generally do not regulate physicians' discretion
in their choice of treatments for their patients, they do restrict communications by manufacturers on unapproved uses of approved
products or on the potential safety and efficacy of unapproved products in development. Companies in the U.S., Canada
and the European Union cannot promote approved products for other indications that are not specifically approved by the competent
regulatory authorities (e.g., FDA in the U.S.), nor can companies promote unapproved products. In limited circumstances,
companies may disseminate to physicians information regarding unapproved uses of approved products or results of studies involving
investigational products. If such activities fail to comply with applicable regulations and guidelines of the various regulatory
authorities, we may be subject to warnings from, or enforcement action by, these authorities. Furthermore, if such activities are
prohibited, it may harm demand for our products. Promotion of unapproved drugs or devices or unapproved indications for a drug
or device is a violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and subjects us to civil and criminal sanctions. Furthermore,
sanctions under the Federal False Claims Act have recently been brought against companies accused of promoting off-label uses of
drugs, because such promotion induces the use and subsequent claims for reimbursement under Medicare and other federal programs.
Similar actions for off-label promotion have been initiated by several states for Medicaid fraud. The healthcare reform law significantly
strengthened provisions of the Federal False Claims Act, the Anti-Kickback Law that applies to Medicare and Medicaid, and other
health care fraud provisions, leading to the possibility of greatly increased qui tam suits by relators for perceived violations.

regulatory authorities, such as the U.S. Health and Human Services Department Office of Inspector General, or OIG, have
recommended the adoption and implementation of a comprehensive health care compliance program that generally contains the elements
of an effective compliance and ethics program described in Section 8B2.1 of the U.S. Sentencing Commission Guidelines
Manual. Increasing numbers of U.S.-based pharmaceutical companies have such programs. In the future, we may need to adopt
healthcare compliance and ethics programs that would incorporate the OIG's recommendations, and train our applicable employees

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">Plasma is a raw material that is susceptible
to damage and contamination and may contain human pathogens, any of which would render the plasma unsuitable as raw material for
further manufacturing. For instance, improper storage of plasma, by us or third-party suppliers, may require us to destroy some
of our raw material. If unsuitable plasma is not identified and discarded prior to the release of the plasma to the manufacturing
process, it may be necessary to discard intermediate or finished product made from that plasma or to recall any finished product
released to the market, resulting in a charge to cost of goods sold. The manufacture of our plasma products is an extremely complex
process of fractionation, purification, filling and finishing. Our products can become non-releasable or otherwise fail to meet
our stringent specifications or regulatory agencies' specifications through a failure in one or more of these process steps. We
may detect instances in which an unreleased product was produced without adherence to our manufacturing procedures or plasma used
in our production process was not collected or stored in a compliant manner consistent with our cGMP or other regulations. Such
an event of noncompliance would likely result in our determination that the implicated products should not be released or maybe
replaced or withdrawn from the market and therefore should be destroyed. Once manufactured, our plasma-derived products must be
handled carefully and kept at appropriate temperatures. Our failure, or the failure of third parties that supply, ship or distribute
our products, to properly care for our products may require that those products be destroyed. Even if handled properly, biologics
may form or contain particulates or have other issues or problems after storage which may require products to be destroyed or recalled.
While we expect to write off small amounts of work-in-progress in the ordinary course of business due to the complex nature of
plasma, our processes and our products, unanticipated events may lead to write-offs and other costs materially in excess of our
expectations and the reserves we have established for these purposes. Such write-offs and other costs could cause material fluctuations

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">Despite overlapping safeguards, including
the screening of donors and other steps to remove or inactivate viruses and other infectious disease causing agents, the risk of
transmissible disease through blood plasma products cannot be entirely eliminated. For example, since plasma-derived therapeutics
involves the use and purification of human plasma, there has been concern raised about the risk of transmitting human immunodeficiency
virus, or HIV, prions, West Nile virus, H1N1 virus or &quot;swine flu&quot; and other blood-borne pathogens through plasma-derived
products. There are also concerns about the future transmission of H5N1 virus, or &quot;bird flu.&quot; In the 1980s, thousands
of hemophiliacs worldwide were infected with HIV through the use of contaminated Factor VIII. Other producers of Factor VIII, though
not us, were defendants in numerous lawsuits resulting from these infections. New infectious diseases emerge in the human population
from time to time. If a new infectious disease has a period during which time the causative agent is present in the bloodstream
but symptoms are not present, it is possible that plasma donations could be contaminated by that infectious agent. Typically, early
in an outbreak of a new disease, tests for the causative agent do not exist. During this early phase, we must rely on screening
of donors (e.g., for behavioral risk factors or physical symptoms) to reduce the risk of plasma contamination. Screening methods
are generally less sensitive and specific than a direct test as a means of identifying potentially contaminated plasma units. During
the early phase of an outbreak of a new infectious disease, our ability to manufacture safe products would depend on the manufacturing
process' capacity to inactivate or remove the infectious agent. To the extent that a product's manufacturing process is inadequate
to inactivate or remove an infectious agent, our ability to manufacture and distribute that product would be impaired. If a new
infectious disease were to emerge in the human population, the regulatory and public health authorities could impose precautions
to limit the transmission of the disease that would impair our ability to procure plasma, manufacture our products or both. Such
precautionary measures could be taken before there is conclusive medical or scientific evidence that a disease poses a risk for
plasma-derived products. In recent years, new testing and viral inactivation methods have been developed that more effectively
detect and inactivate infectious viruses in collected plasma. There can be no assurance, however, that such new testing and inactivation
methods will adequately screen for, and inactivate, infectious agents in the plasma used in the production of our products.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">In order for plasma to be used in the manufacturing
of our products, the individual centers at which the plasma is collected must be licensed by the FDA, and approved by the regulatory
authorities of any country in which we may wish to commercialize our products. When we open a new plasma center, and on an ongoing
basis after licensure, it must be inspected by the FDA for compliance with cGMP and other regulatory requirements. An unsatisfactory
inspection could prevent a new center from being licensed or risk the suspension or revocation of an existing license. We do not
and will not have adequate source plasma to manufacture RI-002. Therefore, we are reliant on purchasing normal source plasma to
manufacture RI-002. We can give no assurances that normal source plasma will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms
or at all. In order to maintain a plasma center's license, its operations must continue to conform to cGMP and other regulatory
requirements. In the event that we determine that plasma was not collected in compliance with cGMP, we may be unable to use and
may ultimately destroy plasma collected from that center, which would be recorded as a charge to cost of goods. Additionally, if
non-compliance in the plasma collection process is identified after the impacted plasma has been pooled with compliant plasma from
other sources, entire plasma pools, in-process intermediate materials and final products could be impacted. Consequently, we could
experience significant inventory impairment provisions and write-offs which could adversely affect our business and financial results.
We plan to increase our supplies of plasma for use in the manufacturing processes through increased purchases of plasma from third
party suppliers as well as collections from our existing ADMA BioCenters plasma collection centers. This strategy is dependent
upon our ability to maintain a cGMP compliant environment in both plasma centers and to expand production and attract donors to
both centers. There is no assurance that the FDA will inspect and license our unlicensed plasma collection centers in a timely
manner consistent with our production plans. If we misjudge the readiness of a center for an FDA inspection, we may lose credibility
with the FDA and cause the FDA to more closely examine all of our operations. Such additional scrutiny could materially hamper
our operations and our ability to increase plasma collections. Our ability to expand production and increase our plasma collection
centers to more efficient production levels may be affected by changes in the economic environment and population in selected regions
where ADMA BioCenters operates its current or future plasma centers, by the entry of competitive plasma centers into regions where
ADMA BioCenters operates such centers, by misjudging the demographic potential of individual regions where ADMA BioCenters expects
to expand production and attract new donors, by unexpected facility related challenges, or by unexpected management challenges
at selected plasma centers.</P>

will be diminished if our products sell for inadequate prices or patients are unable to obtain adequate levels of reimbursement.
Significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products, as well as to the timing,
language, specifications and other details pertaining to the approval of such products. Healthcare payers, including Medicare,
are challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. Government and other healthcare payers increasingly attempt
to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for products. Even if one of our product candidates
is approved by the FDA, insurance coverage may not be available, and reimbursement levels may be inadequate, to cover such product.
If government and other healthcare payers do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement levels for one of our products, once
approved, market acceptance of such product could be reduced. Prices in many countries, including many in Europe, are subject to
local regulation and certain pharmaceutical products, such as plasma-derived products, are subject to price controls in several
of the world's principal markets, including many countries within the European Union. In the U.S., where pricing levels
for our products are substantially established by third-party payors, including Medicare, if payors reduce the amount of reimbursement
for a product, it may cause groups or individuals dispensing the product to discontinue administration of the product, to administer
lower doses, to substitute lower cost products or to seek additional price-related concessions. These actions could have a negative
effect on financial results, particularly in cases where our products command a premium price in the marketplace, or where changes
in reimbursement induce a shift in the site of treatment. The existence of direct and indirect price controls and pressures over
our products could materially adversely affect our financial prospects and performance.</P>

product, and has no clinically meaningful differences in terms of safety and effectiveness from the reference product. The
law provides that a biosimilar application may be submitted as soon as four  years after the reference product is first
licensed, and that the FDA may not make approval of an application effective until 12 years after the reference product was
first licensed.&nbsp; Since the enactment of the law, the FDA has issued several guidance documents to assist sponsors of
biosimilar products prepare their approval applications.&nbsp; The FDA approved the first biosimilar product in 2015, and

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">Through the March 2010 adoption of the healthcare
reform law in the U.S., substantial changes are being made to the current system for paying for healthcare in the U.S., including programs to extend medical benefits to millions of individuals who currently lack insurance coverage. The changes
contemplated by the healthcare reform law are subject to rule-making and implementation timelines that extend for several years,
and this uncertainty limits our ability to forecast changes that may occur in the future. However, implementation has already begun
with respect to certain significant cost-saving measures under the healthcare reform law, for example with respect to several government
healthcare programs that may cover the cost of our future products, including Medicaid, Medicare Parts B and D, and these efforts
could have a materially adverse impact on our future financial prospects and performance. For example, with respect to Medicaid,
in order for a manufacturer's products to be reimbursed by federal funding under Medicaid, the manufacturer must enter into a Medicaid
rebate agreement with the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and pay certain rebates to the
states based on utilization data provided by each state to the manufacturer and to CMS, and pricing data provided by the manufacturer
to the federal government. The states share this savings with the federal government, and sometimes implement their own additional
supplemental rebate programs. Under the Medicaid drug rebate program, the rebate amount for most branded drug products was previously
equal to a minimum of 15.1% of the Average Manufacturer Price, or AMP, or the AMP less Best Price, whichever is greater. Effective
January 1, 2010, the healthcare reform law generally increases the size of the Medicaid rebates paid by manufacturers for single
source and innovator multiple source (brand name) drug product from a minimum of 15.1% to a minimum of 23.1% of the AMP, subject
to certain exceptions, for example, for certain clotting factors, the increase is limited to a minimum of 17.1% of the AMP. For
non-innovator multiple source (generic) products, the rebate percentage is increased from a minimum of 11.0% to a minimum of 13.0%
of AMP.&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2010, the healthcare reform law also newly extended this rebate obligation to prescription drugs covered
by Medicaid managed care organizations. These increases in required rebates may adversely affect our future financial prospects
and performance. In order for a pharmaceutical product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicare Part B and Medicaid
programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate
in the 340B drug pricing program.&nbsp;&nbsp;The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the AMP and Medicaid
rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer.&nbsp;&nbsp;As the 340B drug pricing is determined based on AMP and Medicaid rebate
data, the revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required 340B discount to
increase.</P>

rebate obligations for our products under Medicare Part D, a partial, voluntary prescription drug benefit created by the U.S. federal government primarily for persons 65 years old and over. The Part D drug program is administered through private
insurers that contract with CMS. Beginning in 2011, the healthcare reform law generally requires that in order for a drug manufacturer's
products to be reimbursed under Medicare Part D, the manufacturer must enter into a Medicare Coverage Gap Discount Program agreement
with the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and reimburse each Medicare Part D plan sponsor
an amount equal to 50% savings for the manufacturer's brand name drugs and biologics which the Part D plan sponsor has provided
to its Medicare Part D beneficiaries who are in the &quot;donut hole&quot; (or a gap in Medicare Part D coverage for beneficiaries
who have expended certain amounts for drugs). The Part D plan sponsor is responsible for calculating and providing the discount
directly to its beneficiaries and for reporting these amounts paid to CMS's contractor, which notifies drug manufacturers of the
rebate amounts it must pay to each Part D plan sponsor. The rebate requirement could adversely affect our future financial performance,
particularly if contracts with Part D plans cannot be favorably renegotiated or the Part D plan sponsors fail to accurately calculate
payments due in a manner that overstates our rebate obligation. Regarding access to our products, the healthcare reform law established
and provided significant funding for a Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to coordinate and fund Comparative Effectiveness
Research, or CER. While the stated intent of CER is to develop information to guide providers to the most efficacious therapies,
outcomes of CER could influence the reimbursement or coverage for therapies that are determined to be less cost-effective than
others. Should any of our products be determined to be less cost effective than alternative therapies, the levels of reimbursement
for these products, or the willingness to reimburse at all, could be impacted, which could materially impact our future financial
prospects and results.</P>

affect demand for our products. RI-002, our current product candidate, is expected to be sold to hospitals, specialty pharmacies
and clinicians in the U.S. As a result of loss of jobs, patients may lose medical insurance and be unable to purchase
supply or may be unable to pay their share of deductibles or co-payments. Hospitals adversely affected by the economy may steer
patients to less costly therapies, resulting in a reduction in demand, or demand may shift to public health hospitals, which may
purchase at a lower government price. While to date we cannot directly trace any material reduction in demand to the recession,
if economic conditions do not improve, the impact may become material.</P>

must be considered in light of the uncertainties, risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by similarly situated

million and $18.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have an accumulated deficit
of $106.9 million since inception. We expect to make substantial expenditures and incur increasing operating costs in the future
and our accumulated deficit will increase significantly as we expand commercial development, infrastructure, manufacturing and
inventory planned requirements and clinical trial activities for our product candidates. Our losses have had, and are expected
to continue to have, an adverse impact on our working capital, total assets and stockholders' equity. Because of the risks and
uncertainties associated with product development, we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses, whether we will ever

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">Our operations have consumed
substantial amounts of cash since inception. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we incurred research and
development expenses of approximately $7.7 million and $7.0 million, respectively. We expect to continue to spend substantial
amounts on product development, including commercialization activities, procuring raw material plasma, manufacturing,
conducting potential future clinical trials for our product candidates and purchasing clinical trial materials from our
suppliers. We anticipate that, based upon our projected revenue and expenditures, our current cash and cash equivalents,
short term investments and accounts receivable will be sufficient to fund our operations, as currently conducted, into
the second half of 2017. This time frame may change based upon the timing of the closing of our Proposed Acquisition, and
how aggressively we execute on our operational initiatives. If our assumptions underlying our estimated expenses prove to
be wrong, we may have to raise additional capital sooner than the second half of 2017. These assumptions may also change
based upon the timing of the completion of the Proposed Acquisition, anticipated during the first half of 2017, of which
funds received from BPC at the closing of the Proposed Acquisition are expected to be sufficient to fund operations into
the first quarter of 2018. We have based this estimate, however, on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could
spend our available financial resources much faster than we currently expect. Until such time, if ever, as we can generate
a sufficient amount of product revenue and achieve profitability, we expect to seek to finance future cash needs through
equity or debt financings or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements. If we are unable to raise additional
capital, we will have to delay, curtail or eliminate our product development, including conducting clinical trials for our
product candidates and purchasing clinical trial materials from our suppliers, as well as future commercialization
efforts.</P>

also deter potential acquirers of our company, thereby reducing the likelihood that you could receive a premium for your common

potentially impair the liquidity of our securities not only in the number of shares that could be bought and sold at a given price,
which may be depressed by the relative illiquidity, but also through delays in the timing of transactions and the potential reduction
in media coverage. As a result, an investor might find it more difficult to dispose of our common stock. We believe that current

failure at any time to meet the continuing NASDAQ listing requirements could have an adverse impact on the value of and trading

31, 2016 of $10,661,037 is primarily comprised of $10,518,203 from the sale of normal source human plasma through our FDA-licensed,

greater than 95% of our total revenues, with BPC representing approximately 82% of our total revenues and SK representing approximately
14% of our total revenues.</P>

plasma collected at our FDA-licensed plasma collection centers are recognized at the time of transfer of title and risk of loss
to the customer, which occurs, depending on the agreement with the customer, at the time of shipment or at the time of delivery

deferred revenue of $1,500,000 for a milestone payment provided to us from BPC upon filing the BLA for RI-002 with the FDA,
in accordance with the terms of the license agreement. Deferred revenue is recognized over the term of the license. Deferred revenue
is amortized into income for a period of approximately 20 years, which is the term of the license agreement.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">Research and development, or R&amp;D, expenses,
attributable to our R&amp;D segment, consists of clinical research organization costs, clinical trial costs related to our clinical
trial, consulting expenses relating to regulatory and medical affairs, quality assurance and control, manufacturing, assay development,
ongoing testing costs, drug product manufacturing costs, including the cost of plasma, plasma storage and transportation costs,
as well as wages and benefits for employees, including stock-based compensation directly related to the R&amp;D of RI-002. All
R&amp;D costs are expensed as incurred.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">The process of conducting preclinical studies,
clinical trials and regulatory activities necessary to obtain FDA approval is costly and time consuming.&nbsp;&nbsp;The probability
of success for each product candidate and clinical trial may be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the
quality of the product candidate&rsquo;s early clinical data, investment in the program, competition, regulatory, manufacturing
capabilities and commercial viability.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the uncertainties discussed above, the uncertainties associated
with clinical trial enrollments and the risks inherent in the development process, we are unable to determine the duration and
completion costs of current or future clinical stages of our product candidates or when, or to what extent, we will generate revenues
from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates.&nbsp;&nbsp;Development timelines, probability of success
and development costs vary widely. For the year ended December 31, 2016, R&amp;D expenses increased as compared to R&amp;D expenses
for the year ended December 31, 2015 due to higher validation, testing and production costs related to RI-002 along with increased
regulatory consulting services related to our BLA. We anticipate that 2017 R&amp;D expenses will decrease, as compared to 2016,
as a result of reduced testing and validation services related to RI-002 offset by increased costs related to regulatory activities
in connection with the CRL. Once we have clarity for the timing of our expected BLA resubmission and anticipated RI-002 approval,
we would then expect our R&amp;D costs to increase.</P>

expenses, consist of wages, stock-based compensation, benefits for senior management and staff unrelated to R&amp;D, legal fees,
accounting and auditing fees, commercialization and marketing activities, information technology, investor relations fees, rent,
maintenance and utilities, insurance, travel and other expenses related to the general operations of our business. For the year
ended December 31, 2016, G&amp;A expenses increased as a result of higher marketing, commercial planning, increased headcount,
wages and benefits for employees, including stock-based compensation and consulting expenses associated with commercialization
activities as well as additional expenses incurred related to the Proposed Acquisition of certain assets of BPC. We expect that our G&amp;A expenses will decrease as we continue to manage our costs through deferring certain pre-launch
and commercial planning activities, while we focus on addressing the CRL. Once we have clarity for the timing of our expected BLA
resubmission and anticipated RI-002 approval, we would then expect our G&amp;A costs to increase.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">We recorded total revenue of $10,661,037
during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $7,177,633 during the year ended December 31, 2015. Product revenue was $10,518,203
for the year ended December 31, 2016,&nbsp;which is attributable to our ADMA BioCenters plasma collection centers segment and derived
from the sale of human source plasma collected in our FDA-licensed, GHA and MFDS-certified Georgia-based blood plasma collection
centers, compared to product revenue of $7,050,283 for the year ended December 31, 2015.&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in product revenue
of $3,467,920 was primarily attributable to increased plasma collections and sales from our Marietta, Georgia plasma center which
received FDA approval to sell human source plasma within the U.S. during the third quarter of 2015. Product revenue for the year
ended December 31, 2016 was primarily attributable to sales made pursuant to our plasma supply agreement with BPC under which
BPC purchases normal source plasma from ADMA BioCenters for their manufacturing, in addition to selling increased quantities
of normal source plasma to a second customer. We sold a majority of the normal source plasma collected from our plasma centers
throughout 2016.&nbsp;&nbsp;The normal source plasma and high-titer RSV plasma we did not sell was allocated to inventory in anticipation
of commercial manufacturing.&nbsp;&nbsp;For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, license and other revenue was $142,834
and $127,350, respectively, which relates to services&nbsp;and financial payments provided&nbsp;by BPC and Biotest  in accordance
with our license agreement.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have not generated any revenue from our therapeutics research and development business.</P>

center operating expenses consist of: general and administrative plasma center costs; overhead comprised of rent, maintenance,
utilities, wages, stock-based compensation and benefits for center staff, plasma collection supplies, plasma transportation and
storage (off-site); advertising and promotion expenses; and computer software fees related to donor collections. The increase in
expenses was primarily the result of increased plasma collections at our ADMA BioCenters Marietta collection facility, which received
FDA approval during the third quarter of 2015. The increased expenses include higher costs in wages, rent, maintenance and plasma
collection supplies for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.&nbsp; We expect that
as plasma collection increases, our operating expenses will also increase accordingly.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">As of December 31, 2016, we had working
capital of $10.4 million, consisting primarily of $9.9 million of cash and cash equivalents, $5.4 million of short term investments,
$5.0 million of inventories, $1.0 million of accounts receivable and $0.3 million of prepaid expenses, offset by $11.2 million
of current liabilities, which are mainly comprised of the current portion of our note payable due to Oxford and accounts payable
and accrued expenses.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">We have had limited revenue from operations
and we have incurred cumulative losses of $106.9 million since inception.&nbsp;&nbsp; We have funded our operations to date primarily
from equity investments, loans from venture debt lenders and loans from our primary stockholders. In May 2016, we completed an
underwritten public offering of our common stock and we received net proceeds of approximately $12.9 million. In May 2016, we amended
our Loan and Security Agreement, or LSA, with Oxford and borrowed an additional $4.0 million. In March 2015, we received net cash
proceeds of approximately $10.2 million from an underwritten public offering from the sale of our common stock. In October 2013,
we received net cash proceeds of approximately $26.6 million from our initial public offering, or IPO. In various financings since
2012, we received a total of $20.0 million from venture debt lenders. In February 2012, we received net cash proceeds of approximately
$15.3 million from a private placement of our common stock. Our funds are being used and have been used: to conduct clinical trials;
to manufacture drug products; to collect and procure plasma; to test plasma donors for RSV titers; to file our BLA for RI-002;
to conduct pre-launch activities; for commercialization and marketing activities; for the buildout and expansion of our first plasma
center and the buildout of our second plasma center; for our Proposed Acquisition of certain assets of BPC and the remainder for
payment of existing accounts payable; for general and administrative, research and development expenses; and for other business
activities and general corporate purposes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">We expect to continue to spend substantial
amounts of capital on product development, including commercialization activities, procuring raw material plasma, manufacturing
activities, regulatory activities, consulting fees in connection with our BLA and the potential approval of RI-002, conducting
potential future studies and/or clinical trials for our product candidates and purchasing clinical trial materials from our suppliers.
Based upon our projected revenue and expenditures for 2017, including the ongoing regulatory activities associated with pursuing
the BLA for RI-002, implementation of our planned potential commercialization and expansion activities, we currently believe that
our cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable as of February 24, 2017 are sufficient to fund
our operations, as currently conducted, into the second half of 2017. In order to have sufficient cash to fund our operations thereafter
and to continue as a going concern, we will need to raise additional equity or debt capital by the end of the second half of 2017,
and we cannot provide any assurance that we will be successful in fundraising.&nbsp; This time frame may change based upon the
timing of the closing of our Proposed Acquisition of certain assets of BPC, our interactions with
FDA, potential timing of our commercial manufacturing scale up activities, our generation of future revenue, how aggressively we
execute on our regulatory strategy and/or commercial initiatives and when the FDA approves our BLA for RI-002, if at all. This
timing may also change based upon the timing of the completion of the Proposed Acquisition, anticipated during the first half of
2017. Upon the closing of the Proposed Acquisition, BPC will be providing us funds consisting of: $12.5 million in funding,
$15.0 million in debt financing and an additional $12.5 million commitment towards a future equity financing is expected to be
sufficient to fund operations into this first quarter of 2018.&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than the funding to be provided by BPC we currently
do not have arrangements to obtain additional financing. There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully close on the
Proposed Acquisition. Any such financing could be difficult to obtain or only available on unattractive terms and could result
in significant dilution of stockholders' interests. Failure to secure any necessary financing in a timely manner and on favorable
terms could have a material adverse effect on our business plan and financial performance and, as a result, we&nbsp;could be forced
to delay, discontinue or prevent product development, clinical trial or commercialization activities,&nbsp;delay or discontinue&nbsp;the
approval of any of our potential products, curtail our activities and potentially significantly reduce,&nbsp;or potentially cease
operations. In addition, we could be forced to reduce or forego sales and marketing efforts and forego attractive business opportunities.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">In June 2015, we entered into the LSA with
Oxford , as collateral agent and lender, pursuant to which we were provided an initial term loan in the aggregate principal amount
of $16.0 million, of which $15.7 million was used to repay an existing loan balance of $15.0 million, along with $0.4 million of
interest and $0.3 million of prepayment premium&nbsp;and other fees, under our prior loan and security agreement, dated December
21, 2012, with Hercules (the &ldquo;Prior Loan Agreement&rdquo;), as amended on February 24, 2014 (the &ldquo;Prior Loan Amendment&rdquo;).
In May 2016, we amended the LSA with Oxford (the &ldquo;Amended LSA&rdquo;) which provided us with an additional $4.0 million term
loan, bringing the total principal amount borrowed to $20.0 million. The LSA bears interest at a rate per annum equal to the greater
of (i) 7.80% and (ii) the sum of (a) the three month U.S. LIBOR rate (as reported in <I>The Wall Street Journal</I>) on the date
occurring on the last business day of the month that immediately precedes the month in which the interest will accrue, plus (b)
7.54% on the outstanding principal balance. We are obligated to begin to repay the principal over 36 months beginning February
1, 2017, unless accelerated as a result of certain events of default.&nbsp; At our option, if we receive BLA approval for RI-002
within the initial 18-month interest only period, the interest only period may be extended for an additional six months. A final
payment equal to 8.95% of the funded loan amount is due at the earlier of loan maturity or prepayment. In the event of the six-month
interest only extension, the final payment will be 9.95% of the funded loan, which shall also be due at the earlier of loan maturity
or prepayment. In addition, a facility fee of $105,000 was paid at closing.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event we elect to prepay the loan,
we are obligated to pay a prepayment charge corresponding to a percentage of the principal amount of the loan, with such percentage
being: (i) for a prepayment made on or after the funding date of the applicable term loan through and including the first anniversary
of its funding date, an amount equal to 3.00% of the principal amount of the term loan prepaid; (ii) for a prepayment made after
the first anniversary of the funding date of the applicable term loan through and including the second anniversary of such funding
date, an amount equal to 2.00% of the principal amount of such term loan prepaid; and (iii) for a prepayment of a term loan made
after the second anniversary of its funding date and prior to its maturity date, an amount equal to 1.00% of the principal amount
of the term loan prepaid. The loan matures no later than January 1, 2020.&nbsp; The loan is secured by our assets, except for our
intellectual property (which is subject to a negative pledge). The LSA contains customary representations, warranties and covenants,
including limitations on incurring indebtedness, engaging in mergers or acquisitions and making investments, distributions or transfers.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
representations, warranties and covenants contained in the LSA were made only for purposes of such agreement and as of a specific
date or specific dates, were solely for the benefit of the parties to such agreement, and may be subject to limitations agreed
upon by the contracting parties, including being qualified by confidential disclosures exchanged between the parties in connection
with the execution of the LSA. Events of default under the agreement include, but are not limited to: (i) insolvency, liquidation,
bankruptcy or similar events; (ii) failure to pay any debts due under the LSA or other loan documents on a timely basis; (iii)
failure to observe any covenant or secured obligation under the LSA or other loan documents, which failure, in most cases, is not
cured within 10 days of written notice by lender; (iv) occurrence of any default under any other agreement between us and the lender,
which is not cured within 10 days; (v) occurrence of an event that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vi)
material misrepresentations; (vii) occurrence of any default under any other agreement involving indebtedness or the occurrence
of a default under any agreement that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect; and (viii) certain money
judgments are entered against us or a certain portion of our assets are attached or seized.&nbsp;Remedies for events of default
include acceleration of amounts owing under the LSA and taking immediate possession of, and selling, any collateral securing the
loan.</P>

2015, we issued Oxford a seven-year warrant, expiring on June 19, 2022, to purchase 74,309 shares of common stock at an exercise
price of $8.51 per share. We recorded $367,700 as the fair value of the warrant to additional paid-in capital and as a debt discount
to the carrying value of the loan. The key assumptions used to value the warrants included: (i) volatility of 57% on our common
stock based upon a pro rata percentage of our common stock&rsquo;s volatility and similar public companies&rsquo; volatilities
for comparison; (ii) an expected dividend yield of 0.0%; (iii) a risk-free interest rate of 1.99%; and (iv) a term of seven years.
As a result of prepaying the Hercules loan prior to maturity, we incurred a loss on extinguishment of debt of $0.7 million comprised
of unamortized debt issuance costs, unamortized debt discount related to the warrants issued to Hercules, along with a prepayment
penalty.</P>

addition, on May 13, 2016, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the LSA as modified by the Amended LSA, we agreed to issue to
the lenders warrants to purchase shares of our common stock, upon our draw of each term loan tranche. The aggregate number of shares
of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants is equal to 3.95% of the amount drawn of such tranche, divided by the average
reported closing price per share of common stock for the consecutive 10 trading days prior to the applicable draw.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>

drawdown of the Term B Loan. We recorded $86,300 as the fair value of the warrant to additional paid-in capital and as a debt

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">In connection with our Prior Loan Agreement
with Hercules, we borrowed a total of $15.0 million, which was repaid and terminated in June 2015 through a new loan with Oxford.
We recorded a loss on extinguishment of $0.7 million comprised of an early prepayment penalty and the remaining unamortized debt
issuance costs and end of term fee. The loan&rsquo;s interest at a rate per annum was equal to the greater of (i) 8.75% and (ii)
the sum of (a) 8.75% plus (b) the Prime Rate (as reported in <I>The Wall Street Journal</I>) minus (c) 5.75%. Payment-in-kind interest
accrues on the outstanding principal balance of the loan compounded monthly at 1.95% per annum. Such accrued and unpaid interest
is added to the principal balance of the loan on the first day of each month beginning on the month after the closing. In connection
with the Prior Loan Agreement and Prior Loan Amendment with Hercules, we issued to Hercules a warrant to purchase 31,750 shares
of common stock in December 2012, with an exercise price of $7.56 and in connection with the Prior Loan Agreement and Prior Loan
Amendment, we issued to Hercules a warrant to purchase an additional 58,000 shares of our common stock, comprised of a warrant
to purchase 23,200 shares of common stock issued in February 2014 and a warrant to purchase 34,800 shares of common stock issued
in December 2014, each warrant issued under the Prior Loan Amendment and Prior Loan Agreement having an exercise price of $7.50.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
warrants expire after 10 years and have piggyback registration rights with respect to the shares of common stock underlying the
warrant.&nbsp;&nbsp;The fair value of the Prior Loan Agreement and Prior Loan Amendment warrants were calculated using a lattice-based
option model in order to account for features in the warrant that could cause the exercise price to reset (&ldquo;down round protection&rdquo;)
as a result of the next issuance of our common stock (&ldquo;the next round of equity financing&rdquo;). We initially recorded
the fair value of the warrant of $219,588 as warrant liability and as a debt discount to the carrying value of the loan. The key
assumptions used to value the warrants included the expected date of the next round of equity financing, volatility of 59% for
our common stock based upon similar public companies&rsquo; volatilities for comparison, an expected dividend yield of 0.0%, a
risk-free interest rate of 2.53% and a term of 10 years. As of December 31, 2014, we recorded $476,760 as the fair value of the
warrant for the purchase of 58,000 shares of common stock. As a result of the increase in warrant liability, we recorded an expense
of $74,356 from the change in the fair value of warrant liability. During the first quarter ended March 31, 2015, we recorded $408,900
as the fair value of the warrant for the purchase of 58,000 shares of common stock. As a result of the decrease in warrant liability,
we recorded a change in the fair value of stock warrants of $67,860 from the December 31, 2014 balance. The key assumptions used
to value the warrants included the expected date of the next round of equity financing, volatility of 58% based upon a pro rata
percentage of our common stock and similar public companies&rsquo; volatilities, an expected dividend yield of 0.0%, a risk-free
rate of 1.99% and a term of 10 years. This warrant liability was adjusted from the date of the Prior Loan Agreement on February
24, 2014 to fair value each reporting period using a lattice-based option model and the debt discount will be amortized to interest
expense over the term of the loan. The down round warrant protection feature resulting in the warrant liability&rsquo;s quarterly
&ldquo;mark-to-market&rdquo; valuation has terminated as of February 24, 2015, which was the end of the one-year period following
the amended loan closing on February 24, 2014 and as a result the warrant liability of $408,900 was reclassified to additional
paid-in capital.</P>

Canada, Europe and Asia continue to experience disruption, including, among other things, significant volatility in security prices,
declining valuations of certain investments, as well as severely diminished liquidity and credit availability.&nbsp;&nbsp;Business
activity across a wide range of industries and regions continues to be greatly reduced and local governments and many businesses
are still suffering from the lack of consumer spending and the lack of liquidity in the credit markets.&nbsp;&nbsp;Instability
in the credit and financial market conditions may negatively impact our ability to access capital and credit markets and our ability
to manage our cash balance.&nbsp;&nbsp;While we are unable to predict the continued duration and severity of the adverse conditions
in the U.S. and other countries, any of the circumstances mentioned above could adversely affect our business, financial

the following steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3)
determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize
revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. This update will replace existing revenue recognition guidance

Startups Act, or the JOBS Act, was signed into law.&nbsp;&nbsp;The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, reduce
certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies.&nbsp;&nbsp;We could be an emerging growth company until December
31, 2018, which is the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the first sale of our common equity securities
pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act. However, if certain events occur prior to the end of
such five-year period, including if we become a &ldquo;large accelerated filer,&rdquo; our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion
or we issue more than $1 billion of non-convertible debt in any three-year period, we would cease to be an emerging growth company
prior to the end of such five-year period. As an &ldquo;emerging growth company,&rdquo; we may, under Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the
Securities Act, delay adoption of new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies until such standards would
otherwise apply to private companies.&nbsp;&nbsp;We may take advantage of this extended transition period until the first to occur
of the date that we (i) are no longer an &ldquo;emerging growth company&rdquo; or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of
this extended transition period.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.&nbsp;&nbsp;Until
the date that we are no longer an &ldquo;emerging growth company&rdquo; or affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the exemption
provided by Securities Act Section 7(a)(2)(B), upon issuance of a new or revised accounting standard that applies to our financial
statements and that has a different effective date for public and private companies, we will disclose the date on which adoption
is required for non-emerging growth companies and the date on which we will adopt the recently issued accounting standard. As an
emerging growth company, we are also exempt from the requirement to have our independent auditors provide an attestation report
on our internal control over financial reporting.</P>

of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., or GAAP.&nbsp;&nbsp;The preparation of these financial
statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses.&nbsp;&nbsp;On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates and assumptions, including those described below.&nbsp;&nbsp;We
base our estimates on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.&nbsp;&nbsp;These
estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not
readily apparent from other sources.&nbsp;&nbsp;Actual results and experiences may differ materially from these estimates.</P>

to our employees, non-employees and directors and officers during the year ended December 31, 2016, we used the Black-Scholes option
pricing model. We granted options to purchase an aggregate of 100,984 shares of common stock during the year ended December 31,
2016. To determine the risk-free interest rate, we utilized the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant with
a term consistent with the expected term of our awards. The expected term of the options granted is in accordance with Staff Accounting
Bulletins 107 and 110, which is based on the average between vesting terms and contractual terms. The expected dividend yield reflects
our current and expected future policy for dividends on our common stock. The expected stock price volatility for our stock options
was calculated by examining the pro rata historical volatilities for similar publicly traded industry peers and the trading history
for our common stock. We will continue to analyze the expected stock price volatility and expected term assumptions. We have not
experienced any material forfeitures of stock options and, as such, have not established a forfeiture rate since the stock options
currently outstanding are primarily held by our senior management and directors. We will continue to evaluate the effects of such
future potential forfeitures, as they may arise, to evaluate our estimated forfeiture rate.&nbsp;</P>

revenue from the sale of human plasma collected by ADMA BioCenters is recognized at the time of transfer of title and risk of loss
to the customer, which usually occurs at the time of shipment. Product revenue is recognized at the time of delivery if we retain
the risk of loss during shipment. Our product revenues are substantially attributable to two customers. One customer accounts for
greater than 80% and another customer accounts for greater than 10% of our product revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016.
Revenue from license fees and research and development services rendered are recognized as revenue when the performance obligations
under the terms of the license agreement with Biotest  have been completed. During the third quarter 2015, we recorded deferred
revenue of $1.5 million in accordance with a license agreement payment we received related to the filing of our BLA with the FDA.
Deferred revenue of $1.7 million was recorded in 2013 as a result of certain research and development services provided in accordance
with a license agreement. Deferred revenue is recognized over the term of the license. Deferred revenue is amortized into income
for a period of approximately 20 years, the term of the license agreement.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of ADMA Biologics, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements
of operations, changes in stockholders&rsquo; (deficiency) equity, and cash flows for the years then ended. The Company&rsquo;s
management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">We conducted our audits in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement.
The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&rsquo;s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall consolidated financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of ADMA Biologics, Inc. and Subsidiaries
as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The accompanying consolidated financial
statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As further discussed in Note 1 to the
accompanying consolidated financial statements, management believes that the Company will continue to incur net losses and negative
net cash flows from operating activities through the drug development, approval and commercialization preparation process. These
conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">ADMA Biologics,
Inc. (&ldquo;ADMA&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) is a late stage biopharmaceutical company that develops, manufactures,
and intends to commercialize specialty plasma-based biologics for the proposed treatment of immune deficiencies and
prevention of certain infectious diseases. The Company&rsquo;s targeted patient populations include immune-compromised
individuals who suffer from an underlying immune deficiency disease or who may be immune-suppressed for medical reasons. ADMA
also operates through its wholly-owned subsidiary, ADMA Bio Centers Georgia Inc., (&ldquo;ADMA BioCenters&rdquo;), a source
plasma collection business with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (&ldquo;FDA&rdquo;) approved facilities in Norcross,
Georgia and Marietta, Georgia. Each facility holds certifications from the German Health Authority (&ldquo;GHA&rdquo;) and
the Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (&ldquo;MFDS&rdquo;). ADMA BioCenters supplies ADMA with a portion of its raw
material plasma for the manufacture of RI-002, ADMA&rsquo;s lead product candidate, which the Company is currently developing
for the treatment of Primary Immune Deficiency Disease (&ldquo;PIDD&rdquo;). A Biologics License Application
(&ldquo;BLA&rdquo;) for RI-002 was submitted to the FDA and accepted for review during the third quarter of 2015 for the
treatment of PIDD. In July 2016, the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter (&ldquo;CRL&rdquo;) to the Company for its BLA for
RI-002. The CRL did not cite any concerns with the clinical safety or efficacy data for RI-002 submitted in the BLA, nor did
the FDA request any additional clinical studies be completed prior to FDA approval of RI-002. The FDA identified in the CRL,
among other things, certain outstanding inspection issues and deficiencies at the Company&rsquo;s third-party contract
manufacturers and vendors and requested documentation of corrections for a number of those issues. The FDA indicated in the
CRL that it cannot grant final approval of the BLA until, among other things,&nbsp;these deficiencies are resolved. Since
receiving the CRL, the Company has worked diligently with its contract fill and finisher as well as the contract testing
laboratory. The Company has also continued to work with its third-party contract manufacturer, Biotest Pharmaceuticals
Corporation (&ldquo;BPC&rdquo; or &ldquo;Seller&rdquo;), and on January 21, 2017, the Company signed a definitive acquisition agreement to
acquire certain manufacturing and therapy-related assets from Biotest in Boca Raton, Florida, a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Biotest Aktiengesellschaft (&ldquo;Biotest&rdquo;) in efforts to address the CRL and remediate the outstanding warning
letter at the manufacturing facility. The acquisition of certain manufacturing and therapy-related assets of Biotest  (the &ldquo;Proposed Acquisition&rdquo;) is anticipated to close during the first half of 2017. The Company
and its vendors are awaiting certain feedback from the agency on submissions already made and the Company intends to provide
a timeline for resubmission of the BLA for RI-002 as soon as practicable.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">The Company has experienced net losses and
negative cash flows from operations since inception in 2004 and expects these conditions to continue for the foreseeable future.
Since inception, the Company has needed to raise capital from the sales of its equity securities and debt financings to sustain
operations. In May 2016, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of its common stock, raising gross proceeds of approximately
$14.1 million, and subsequently borrowed an additional $4.0 million under its Loan and Security Agreement (&ldquo;LSA&rdquo;) with
Oxford Finance LLC (&ldquo;Oxford&rdquo;), which brought the total principal borrowed to $20.0 million (see Note 5). In February
and December 2014, the Company borrowed a total of $15 million from Hercules Technology Growth Capital, Inc. (&ldquo;Hercules&rdquo;)
and subsequently refinanced its borrowings of $16 million with Oxford (see Note 5). In March 2015, ADMA completed an underwritten
public offering of its common stock, raising gross proceeds of $11.3 million.&nbsp;In June 2015, ADMA entered into the LSA with Oxford, as collateral agent and lender, pursuant to which ADMA accessed an initial term
loan in the aggregate principal amount of $16.0 million, of which $15.7 million was used to repay the Hercules loan balance of
$15.0 million, along with $0.4 million of interest, and $0.3 million of prepayment premium&nbsp;and other fees, (the &ldquo;Prior
Loan Agreement&rdquo;).&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>

<B>NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</B><BR>
<B>DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND 2015</B></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: center">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">As of December 31, 2016, the Company had
working capital of $10.4 million, consisting primarily of $9.9 million of cash and cash equivalents, $5.4 million of short-term
investments, $1.0 million of accounts receivable, $5.0 million of inventories, and $0.3 million of prepaid expenses, offset primarily
by the current portion of note payable due to Oxford of $6.1 million, $2.6 million of accounts payable, $2.4 million of accrued
expenses and $0.2 million of deferred revenue. Based upon the Company&rsquo;s projected revenue and expenditures for 2017, including
the fees associated to the Proposed Acquisition of certain BPC assets, regulatory and consulting fees for RI-002 associated
with third-party manufacturers and ongoing discussions with the FDA, continuing implementation of the Company&rsquo;s commercialization
and expansion activities and certain other assumptions, management currently believes that its cash, cash equivalents, short-term
investments, projected revenue and accounts receivable are sufficient to fund ADMA&rsquo;s operations, as currently conducted,
into the second half of 2017. These estimates may change based upon the timing of the closing of the Proposed Acquisition of certain
BPC assets, whether or when the FDA approves RI-002, the timing of any required commercial manufacturing scale up activities
or if any other assumptions of the Company change.<FONT STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif">&nbsp;</FONT>&nbsp;
This timing may also change based upon the timing of the completion of the Proposed Acquisition, anticipated during the first half
of 2017. Upon the closing of the Proposed Acquisition, BPC will be providing funds to ADMA consisting of: $12.5 million in
funding, $15.0 million in debt financing and an additional $12.5 million commitment towards a future equity financing is expected
to be sufficient to fund operations into the first quarter of 2018.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully
close on the Proposed Acquisition. Other than the funding to be provided by BPC, the Company does not currently have arrangements
to obtain additional financing. Furthermore, if the Company&rsquo;s assumptions underlying its estimated expenses and revenues
are incorrect, it may have to raise additional capital sooner than anticipated.&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to numerous risks and uncertainties
associated with the research and development and potential future commercialization of its product candidate, the Company is unable
to estimate with certainty the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with its development
activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&rsquo;s current estimates may be subject to change as circumstances regarding its business requirements
evolve. The Company may decide to raise capital through public or private equity offerings or debt financings, or obtain a bank
credit facility or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company does not have any existing commitments
for future external funding.&nbsp;&nbsp;The sale of additional equity or debt securities, if convertible, could result in dilution
to the Company&rsquo;s stockholders.&nbsp;&nbsp;The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and
could also result in covenants that would restrict the Company&rsquo;s operations or other financing alternatives.&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional
equity or debt financing, grants, or corporate collaboration and potential licensing arrangements may not be available on acceptable
terms, if at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;If adequate funds are not available, the Company may be required to delay, reduce the scope of or
eliminate the Company&rsquo;s research and development programs, reduce the Company&rsquo;s planned clinical trials and delay or
abandon potential commercialization efforts of the Company&rsquo;s lead or other product candidates.&nbsp;The Company has reported
losses since inception in June 2004 through December 31, 2016 of $106.9 million. Management believes that the Company will continue
to incur net losses and negative net cash flows from operating activities to fund its research and development, commercial programs
and meet its obligations on a timely basis through the foreseeable future. As such, these factors raise substantial doubt about
the Company&rsquo;s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any
adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts and the classification of liabilities that
might be necessary from the outcome of this uncertainty.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">ADMA&rsquo;s long-term liquidity will be
dependent upon on its ability to raise additional capital, to fund its research and development and commercial programs and meet
its obligations on a timely basis. If ADMA is unable to successfully raise sufficient additional capital, it will likely not have
sufficient cash flow and liquidity to fund its business operations, forcing ADMA to curtail activities and, potentially significantly
reduce, or potentially cease operations. Even if ADMA is able to raise additional capital, such financings may only be available
on unattractive terms, resulting in significant dilution of stockholders&rsquo; interests and, in such event, the value and potential
future market price of its common stock may decline.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">There can be no assurance that the Company&rsquo;s
research and development will be successfully completed or that any product will be approved or commercially viable. The Company
is subject to risks common to companies in the biotechnology industry including, but not limited to, dependence on collaborative
arrangements, development by the Company or its competitors of new technological innovations, dependence on key personnel, protection
of proprietary technology, and compliance with FDA and other governmental regulations and approval requirements.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">The Company considers all highly-liquid

with maturity schedules of three, six, nine and twelve months. Instruments with original maturities greater than three months but
less than twelve months are included in short-term investments.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">The Company regularly maintains cash and
short-term investments at third-party financial institutions in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC, insurance
limit. While the Company monitors the daily cash balances in the operating accounts and adjusts the balances as appropriate, these
balances could be impacted, and there could be a material adverse effect on the Company&rsquo;s business, if one or more of the
financial institutions with which the Company has deposits fails or is subject to other adverse conditions in the financial or
credit markets. To date, the Company has not experienced a loss or lack of access to its invested cash or cash equivalents; however,
the Company cannot provide assurance that access to its invested cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions
in the financial and credit markets.</P>

product revenues from the sale of human plasma collected at the Company&rsquo;s FDA-licensed plasma collection centers are recognized
at the time of transfer of title and risk of loss to the customer, which occurs at the time of shipment.&nbsp;&nbsp;Product revenues
are recognized at the time of delivery if the Company retains the risk of loss during shipment.&nbsp;&nbsp;For the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2016, two of the Company&rsquo;s customers, SK Plasma Co., Ltd., &ldquo;SK&rdquo;, and BPC, represented
greater than 95% of our total revenues, with BPC representing approximately 82% of our total revenues and SK representing approximately
14% of our total revenues.</P>

2016 are comprised of product revenues from the sale of normal source human plasma collected from the Company&rsquo;s plasma collection
centers segment and license and other revenues are primarily attributable to the out-licensing of RI-002 to Biotest AG to market
and sell in Europe and selected countries in North Africa and the Middle East.&nbsp;&nbsp;Biotest  and BPC, a subsidiary
of Biotest, have provided the Company with certain services and financial payments in accordance with the related Biotest
license agreement and is obligated to pay the Company certain amounts in the future if certain milestones are achieved.&nbsp;&nbsp;During
the third quarter of 2015, the Company recorded deferred revenue of $1.5 million for a milestone payment provided to the Company
after the BLA for RI-002 was filed with the FDA, in accordance with the terms of the Biotest  license agreement. Deferred revenue
is recognized over the term of the Biotest AG license.&nbsp;&nbsp;Deferred revenue is amortized into income for a period of approximately
20 years, the term of the Biotest  license agreement.</P>

and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements

tax basis of assets and liabilities and their respective financial reporting amounts (&ldquo;temporary differences&rdquo;) at enacted
tax rates in effect for the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance
on its deferred income tax assets if it is more likely than not that these deferred income tax assets will not be realized.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">During the years ended December 31, 2016
and 2015, the Company recorded stock-based compensation expense to employees of $1,250,074 and $1,711,047, respectively. The fair
value of employee options granted was determined on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes model. The Black-Scholes option valuation
model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of publicly traded options, which have no vesting restrictions and are
fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected
stock price volatility. The Company&rsquo;s employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded
options, and changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate. To determine the risk-free
interest rate, the Company utilized the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant with a term consistent with
the expected term of the Company&rsquo;s awards. The expected term of the options granted is in accordance with Staff Accounting
Bulletins 107 and 110, which is based on the average between vesting terms and contractual terms. The expected dividend yield reflects
the Company&rsquo;s current and expected future policy for dividends on the Company&rsquo;s common stock. The expected stock price
volatility for the Company&rsquo;s stock options was calculated by examining the pro rata historical volatilities for similar publicly
traded industry peers and the trading history for the Company&rsquo;s common stock. The Company will continue to analyze the expected
stock price volatility and expected term assumptions. The Company has not experienced any material forfeitures of stock options
and, as such, has not established a forfeiture rate since the stock options currently outstanding are primarily held by the Company&rsquo;s
senior management and directors. The Company will continue to evaluate the effects of such future potential forfeitures, as they
may arise, to evaluate the Company&rsquo;s estimated forfeiture rate.&nbsp;</P>

an LSA with Oxford for up to $21.0 million of debt financing in two term loan tranches.&nbsp;The first term loan tranche of $16.0
million from the LSA (the &ldquo;Term A Loan&rdquo;) was primarily used to repay the Company&rsquo;s&nbsp;previous debt facility
with Hercules dated December 2012. As a result of prepaying the Hercules loan prior to maturity, the Company incurred a loss on
extinguishment of debt of $0.7 million comprised of unamortized debt issuance costs, unamortized debt discount related to the warrants
issued to Hercules, along with a prepayment penalty.</P>

the interest will accrue, plus (b) 7.54% on the outstanding principal balance.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company became obligated to begin
to repay the principal over 36 months beginning on February 1, 2017, unless accelerated as a result of certain events of default.&nbsp;
A final payment equal to 8.95% of the funded loan amount is due at the earlier of loan maturity or prepayment. All term loans mature
no later than January 1, 2020.&nbsp; The loans are secured by the Company&rsquo;s assets, except for its intellectual property
(which is subject to a negative pledge). The LSA contains customary representations, warranties and covenants, including limitations

on June 19, 2015, the Company issued to Oxford a seven-year warrant, expiring on June 19, 2022, to purchase 74,309 shares of common
stock at an exercise price of $8.51 per share. The Company recorded $367,700 as the fair value of the warrant to additional paid-in
capital and as a debt discount to the carrying value of the loan.&nbsp;&nbsp;The key assumptions used to value the warrants included:
(i) volatility of 57% on our common stock based upon a pro rata percentage of our common stock&rsquo;s volatility and similar public
companies&rsquo; volatilities for comparison; (ii) an expected dividend yield of 0.0%; (iii) a risk-free interest rate of 1.99%;

the availability of which was conditioned on completing an equity financing of its common stock of at least $10.0 million in gross
proceeds no later than May 31, 2016. On May 3, 2016, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of its common stock,
raising gross proceeds of approximately $14.1 million and subsequently borrowed the additional $4.0 million from Oxford under the
Amended LSA, which brings the total principal amount borrowed to $20.0 million.</P>

prepayment of a term loan prior to its maturity date as follows:&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) for a prepayment made on or after the funding date
of the applicable term loan through and including the first anniversary of its funding date, an amount equal to 3.00% of the principal
amount of the term loan prepaid; (ii) for a prepayment made after the first anniversary of the funding date of the applicable term
loan through and including the second anniversary of such funding date, an amount equal to 2.00% of the principal amount of such
term loan prepaid; and (iii) for a prepayment of a term loan made after the second anniversary of its funding date and prior to

defined terms were adjusted, including a new Amortization Date that is defined as&nbsp;(a) February 17, 2017, if the Term C Loan
is not made and (b) August 1, 2017 if the Term C Loan is made.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Amended LSA further provides for customary representations,

into a Manufacturing, Supply and License Agreement with BPC, which replaces a prior agreement that expired on December 31,
2012.&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the agreement, the Company agreed to purchase exclusively from BPC its worldwide requirements of RSV
immune globulin manufactured from human plasma containing RSV antibodies.&nbsp;&nbsp;The term of the agreement is for a period
of ten years from January 1, 2013, renewable for two additional five-year periods at the agreement of both parties. The Company
is obligated under this agreement to purchase a minimum of at least one lot of product during each calendar year after the finished
product is approved by the FDA.&nbsp;&nbsp;This number is subject to increase at the Company&rsquo;s option.&nbsp;&nbsp;As consideration
for BPC&rsquo;s obligations under the agreement, the Company is obligated to pay a dollar amount per lot of RSV immune globulin
manufactured from human plasma containing RSV antibodies, as well as a percentage royalty on the sales thereof and of RI-002, up
to a specified cumulative maximum.&nbsp;&nbsp;The agreement may be terminated by either party (a) by reason of a material breach
if the breaching party fails to remedy the breach within 120 days after receiving notice of the breach from the other party, (b)
upon bankruptcy, insolvency, dissolution, or winding up of the other party, or (c) if the other party is unable to fulfill its
obligations under the agreement for 120 consecutive days or more as a result of (a) or (b) above. The parties have agreed to a
mutual release with respect to any claims relating to or arising from any breach or default under the existing Manufacturing Supply

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">In a separate license agreement effective
December 31, 2012, the Company granted BPC an exclusive license to market and sell RSV antibody-enriched Immune Globulin Intravenous
(&ldquo;IVIG&rdquo;) in Europe and in selected countries in North Africa and the Middle East, collectively referred to as the Territory,
to have access to the Company&rsquo;s testing services for testing of BPC&rsquo;s plasma samples using the Company&rsquo;s
proprietary RSV assay, and to reference (but not access) the Company&rsquo;s proprietary information for the purpose of BPC
seeking regulatory approval for the RSV antibody-enriched IVIG in the Territory.&nbsp;&nbsp;As consideration for the license, BPC
agreed to provide the Company with certain services at no charge and also compensate us with cash payments upon the completion
of certain milestones.&nbsp;&nbsp;Such services have been accounted for as deferred revenue which were recorded in 2013 as a result
of certain research and development services as provided for in accordance with a license agreement. Deferred revenue is recognized
over the term of the license and is amortized into income for a period of approximately 20 years, the term of the license agreement.
BPC is also obligated to pay the Company an adjustable royalty based on a percentage of revenues from the sale of RSV antibody-enriched
IVIG in the Territory for 20 years from the date of first commercial sale. Additionally, BPC has agreed to grant the Company
an exclusive license for marketing and sales in the U.S. and Canada for BPC&rsquo;s Varicella Zoster Immune Globulin
(&ldquo;VZIG&rdquo;); however, as a result of the Proposed Acquisition the terms associated to VZIG will be terminated upon the

Agreement with BPC, the Company has agreed to purchase from BPC an annual minimum volume of source plasma containing antibodies
to RSV to be used in the manufacture of RI-002.&nbsp;&nbsp;This volume will increase at the earlier of the Company&rsquo;s receipt
of a BLA from the FDA, or March 31, 2016.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company must purchase a to-be-determined and agreed upon annual minimum
volume from BPC but may also collect high-titer RSV plasma from up to five wholly-owned ADMA BioCenters.&nbsp;&nbsp;During
2015, BPC and ADMA amended their  Plasma Purchase Agreement to allow ADMA the ability to collect its raw material
RSV high-titer plasma from other third party collection organizations, thus allowing ADMA to expand its reach for raw material
supply as the Company approaches commercialization for RI-002. Unless terminated earlier, the agreement expires in November 2021,
after which it may be renewed for two additional five-year periods if agreed to by the parties.&nbsp;&nbsp;Either party may terminate
the agreement if the other party fails to remedy any material default in the performance of any material condition or obligation
under the agreement following notice.&nbsp;&nbsp;Either party may also terminate the agreement, after providing written notice,
if a proceeding under any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement of debts, insolvency or receivership law is filed by or against
the other party, and is not dismissed or stayed, or a receiver or trustee is appointed for all or a substantial portion of the
assets of the other party, or the other party makes an assignment for the benefit of its creditors or becomes insolvent.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company may also terminate the agreement upon written notice if the clinical development of its product candidate is halted or
terminated, whether by the FDA, a Data Safety Monitoring Board, or any other regulatory authority.&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon termination
of the agreement, the Company must pay for any source plasma already delivered to the Company and for any source plasma collected
under the terms of the agreement. As part of the acquisition of certain assets of BPC, BPC and ADMA amended the Plasma
Purchase Agreement, to extend the purchase from BPC an annual minimum of plasma containing antibodies to RSV for ten years
through the closing date of the transaction which is anticipated during the first half of 2017.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">We have incurred substantial losses during
our history. As of December 31, 2016, we had Federal and state Net Operating Losses, (&ldquo;NOLs&rdquo;) of $87.8 million and
$75.2 million, respectively, as well as Federal research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately $4.1 million.
The $87.8 million and $75.2 million in Federal and state NOLs, respectively, will begin to expire at various dates beginning in
2027, if not limited by triggering events prior to such time. Under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, changes in our
ownership, in certain circumstances, will limit the amount of Federal NOLs that can be utilized annually in the future to offset
taxable income. In particular, Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code imposes limitations on a company&rsquo;s ability to use
NOLs upon certain changes in such ownership. If we are limited in our ability to use our NOLs in future years in which we have
taxable income, we will pay more taxes than if we were able to utilize our NOLs fully. We may experience ownership changes in the
future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership that we cannot predict or control that could result in further limitations
being placed on our ability to utilize our Federal NOLs.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">A valuation allowance, if needed, reduces
deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. When determining the amount of net deferred tax assets that are more
likely than not to be realized, the Company assesses all available positive and negative evidence. This evidence includes, but
is not limited to, prior earnings history, expected future earnings, carry-back and carry-forward periods and the feasibility of
ongoing tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of the realization of a deferred tax asset. The weight given
to the positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent the evidence may be objectively verified. As such, it is
generally difficult for positive evidence regarding projected future taxable income exclusive of reversing taxable temporary differences
to outweigh objective negative evidence of recent financial reporting losses. Based on these criteria and the relative weighting
of both the positive and negative evidence available, management continues to maintain a full valuation allowance against its net
deferred tax assets.</P>

returns, post-market commitments, recalls, adverse event reporting, product deviation reporting, lookbacks, market

equal to 4,295,580 common shares and (y) non-voting common stock equal to 8,591,160 shares of the Company&rsquo;s non-voting
common stock representing the balance of the Biotest Equity Interest which is convertible into common stock of the Company
upon the occurrence of certain specified events; (iii) upon the closing, the Company agreed to issue to Seller warrants, if
any, necessary to acquire additional shares of the Company&rsquo;s capital stock equal to the excess, if any, of (x) the
number of shares represented by rights, options and warrants issued by the Company between September 12, 2016 until the
closing, over (y) 184,000 shares; and (iv) on January 1, 2019, pursuant to the terms of a separate purchase agreement to be
entered into by the parties at the closing, the Company has agreed to sell, transfer and convey to Seller for no additional
consideration, all of its right, title and interest in and to the Company&rsquo;s certain biocenter located in Norcross,
Georgia and the Company&rsquo;s certain biocenter located in Marietta, Georgia, which are subject to a repurchase right in
favor of the Company if within five years after January 1, 2019, the Biotest  stockholders and its related entities own
less than 20% of the Company&rsquo;s issued and outstanding capital stock. As part of the consideration, upon the closing,
Seller will also be granted the right to designate one director and one observer to the Company&rsquo;s board of directors,

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">Additionally, on the closing
date, Seller has agreed to (i) deliver to the Company a capital contribution of $12.5 million in respect of the Biotest
Equity Interest, which capital contribution will be contributed by Seller to Buyer; and (ii) fund a $15.0 million unsecured
subordinated loan to the Company, which (a) will bear interest at a rate of 6% per annum, payable semiannually in arrears,
(b) has a term of five years and (c) will not be subject to any prepayment penalty or other breakage costs. Such loan will be
subordinated to the Company&rsquo;s existing indebtedness as of the signing of the Purchase Agreement and any additional
indebtedness approved by the Company&rsquo;s board of directors which is secured only by a mortgage on the owned real
property acquired in connection with the transaction. Such loan will rank pari passu with all additional indebtedness
approved by the Company&rsquo;s board of directors that is not secured only by a mortgage on such owned real property and if
such additional indebtedness is secured, the loan from Seller will be secured on a pari passu basis with such additional
indebtedness. At any time after the closing, if the Company undertakes an underwritten equity financing or a Private
Investment in Public Equity,  or PIPE, offering involving at least one unrelated third party, Biotest  and/or Seller have
agreed to participate pro rata in accordance with the Biotest Equity Interest up to an aggregate amount equal to $12.5
million.</P>
