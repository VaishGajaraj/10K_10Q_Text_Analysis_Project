<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Overview</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a biotechnology company that designs, optimizes and develops
novel drugs that block key enzymes involved in cancer, cardiovascular diseases, autoimmune
diseases, and viral infections. BioCryst integrates the necessary disciplines of biology,
crystallography, medicinal chemistry and computer modeling to effectively use structure-based drug
design to discover and develop small molecule pharmaceuticals.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our lead product candidate, Fodosine&#153;, is a transition-state analog inhibitor of the target
enzyme purine nucleoside phosphorylase (&#147;PNP&#148;). The compound is currently in a Phase IIb trial,
which is planned to be a pivotal trial, for patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(&#147;T-ALL&#148;). The trial is being conducted under a special protocol assessment (&#147;SPA&#148;) negotiated with
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (&#147;FDA&#148;). Additionally, Fodosine&#153; is currently being studied
in a Phase I/II trial with an oral formulation in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (&#147;CTCL&#148;) and we are in
active discussions with the FDA to determine what would be required to initiate a pivotal trial in
CTCL during 2007. Fodosine&#153; has been granted Orphan Drug status by the FDA for three indications:
T-cell non-Hodgkin&#146;s lymphoma, including CTCL; chronic lymphocytic leukemia (&#147;CLL&#148;) and related
leukemias including T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, adult T-cell leukemia, and hairy cell leukemia;
and for treatment of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (&#147;B-ALL&#148;). Additionally the FDA has
granted &#147;fast track&#148; status to the development of Fodosine&#153; for the treatment of relapsed or
refractory T-cell leukemia. In February&nbsp;2006, we announced an exclusive licensing agreement with
Mundipharma International Holdings Limited (&#147;Mundipharma&#148;) to develop and commercialize Fodosine&#153;
in markets across Europe, Asia and Australasia for use in oncology.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our second most advanced drug candidate is peramivir, an inhibitor of influenza neuraminidase.
We re-initiated clinical development of peramivir during 2006 with a focus on intravenous and
intramuscular delivery. During 2006, we tested peramivir in multiple Phase I trials in healthy
volunteers and early in 2007 we initiated a Phase II trial with the intramuscular formulation. In
January&nbsp;2007, we announced the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (&#147;HHS&#148;) had awarded the
Company a $102.6&nbsp;million, four-year contract for the advanced development of peramivir. Funding
from the contract will support manufacturing of clinical lots, process validation, clinical studies and other
product approval requirements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November&nbsp;2005, the Company announced it had entered into an exclusive worldwide licensing
agreement with F.Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd and Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. (&#147;Roche&#148;) to develop and
commercialize BCX-4208, our second generation PNP inhibitor for the prevention of acute rejection
in transplantation and for the treatment of autoimmune diseases.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our business strategy is to use structure-based drug design technologies to develop
innovative, small-molecule pharmaceuticals to treat a variety of diseases and disorders. We focus
our drug discovery efforts on building potent, selective inhibitors of enzymes associated with
targeted diseases. Enzymes are proteins that cause or enable biological reactions necessary for the
progression of the disease or disorder. The specific enzymes on which we focus are called enzyme
targets. We aim to design compounds that will inhibit an enzyme target by fitting the active site
of a particular enzyme. Inhibition means interfering with the functioning of an enzyme target,
thereby stopping or slowing the progression of the disease or disorder. The principal elements of
our strategy are:

expenditures on applications of structure-based drug design technologies to design and develop drug candidates.
Structure-based drug design is a process by which we design a drug candidate through detailed analysis of the enzyme
target, which the drug candidate must inhibit in order to stop the progression of the disease or disorder. We believe
that structure-based drug design is a powerful tool for efficient development of small-molecule drug candidates that
have the potential to be safe, effective and relatively inexpensive to manufacture. Our structure-based drug design

pharmaceutical or biotechnology partners for final development and
global marketing. We believe partnerships are a good source of
development payments, license fees, future event payments and

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Overview</I>. The human immune system employs specialized cells, including T-cells, to control
infection by recognizing and attacking disease-causing viruses, bacteria and parasites. T-cells are
an essential part of the body&#146;s immune system that serve a dual purpose to both orchestrate and
participate in the body&#146;s immune response. For the most part, this system works flawlessly to
protect the body. However, when T-cells multiply uncontrollably, T-cell proliferative diseases,
such as T-cell cancers, can occur.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The link between T-cell proliferation and the purine nucleoside phosphorylase, or PNP, enzyme
was first discovered approximately twenty-five years ago when a patient, who was genetically
deficient in PNP, exhibited limited T-cell activity, but reasonably normal activity of other immune
functions. In other patients lacking PNP activity, the T-cell population was selectively depleted;
however, B-cell function tended to be normal. Based on these findings and the results of cell
culture studies, inhibiting PNP appears to produce selective suppression of T-cells without
significantly impairing the function of other cells.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia</I>. The most common form of leukemia in children is acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (&#147;ALL&#148;). According to the American Cancer Society, 5,200 new cases (adult
and children combined) will be diagnosed in the United States in 2007 (T-cell and B-cell). ALL
results from an acquired injury to the DNA of a single cell in the bone marrow.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>T-cell Lymphoma</I>. Lymphoma is a general term for a group of cancers that originate in the
lymphatic system. About 63,190 Americans will be diagnosed with a non-Hodgkin&#146;s lymphoma in 2007
and approximately 15% of these will be considered T-cell lymphomas. T-cell lymphoma results when a
T-lymphocyte (a type of white blood cell) undergoes a malignant change and begins to multiply,
eventually crowding out healthy cells and creating tumors, which enlarge the lymph nodes and invade
other sites in the body. CTCL is a primary skin neoplasm and accounts for nearly 50% of all T-cell
malignancies.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>T-cell Mediated Autoimmune Diseases. </I>There are more than 80 clinically distinct autoimmune
diseases such as psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and Crohn&#146;s disease, which
appear to have activated T-cells as a major part of their pathogenesis. These diseases occur when
the immune system attacks the body&#146;s own cells rather than invading microorganisms. Therefore,
inhibition and/or elimination of activated T-cells could have a beneficial effect on these
diseases.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Transplant Rejection. </I>The greatest threat to transplant patients is rejection of the
transplanted organ by the body&#146;s own immune system. For this reason, transplant recipients must
take drugs to suppress the immune response and prevent rejection usually for the rest of their
lives. A regimen combining several drugs is usually given and this treatment has to be continued
indefinitely. For kidney transplant recipients, rejection of the new kidney by the patient&#146;s immune
system can lead to loss of the transplanted organ and a return to dialysis. For heart, lung and
liver transplant patients, loss of the transplanted organ presents an immediate threat to life.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>B-cell Related Cancers</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Overview</I>. There are two types of lymphocytes in the broadest sense &#150; T-cells and B-cells.
Although PNP inhibitors were developed specifically to block the T-cells, recent work indicates
that the same biochemical event &#150; the intracellular accumulation of deoxyguanosine triphosphate
(dGTP) also occurs in malignant B-cells. Furthermore, work of Dr.&nbsp;Varsha Gandhi at MD Anderson
Cancer Center has shown that PNP inhibitors, when acting <I>in vitro </I>on B-cells from patients with CLL
induce accumulation of dGTP with resultant apoptosis (cell death).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These studies open the possibility of treating CLL, B-ALL and B-cell non-Hodgkin&#146;s Lymphoma
(NHL)&nbsp;with Fodosine. Importantly, B-cell malignancies are considerably more prevalent than are the
T-cell leukemias and lymphomas.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>PNP Inhibition</I>. PNP is an enzyme that plays an important role in T-cell proliferation, because
it is necessary to maintain normal DNA synthesis in human T-cells. Selective inhibition of PNP
causes certain nucleosides, including deoxyguanosine, to accumulate. As the concentration of
deoxyguanosine increases within T-cells, it is converted by specific enzymes to dGTP. A high
concentration of dGTP in T-cells causes an imbalance in the intra-cellular trinucleotide pool and
thus causes cell death.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June&nbsp;2000, we licensed a series of potent PNP inhibitors from AECOM and IRL. The lead drug
candidate from this collaboration, Fodosine&#153;, is a more potent inhibitor of human lymphocyte
proliferation than other previously known PNP inhibitors. Clinical data in our past and ongoing
clinical trials, plus extensive preclinical studies indicate that Fodosine&#153; can modulate T-cell
activities. Fodosine&#153; is an investigational PNP inhibitor for the potential treatment of T-cell
leukemias and lymphomas. In February&nbsp;2006, we licensed Fodosine&#153; to Mundipharma to develop and
commercialize in markets across Europe, Asia and Australasia for use in oncology.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2002, we exercised the option to add a new compound, BCX-4208, to the series of
inhibitors of PNP licensed from AECOM and IRL. Preclinical results indicated that BCX-4208 was a
more potent inhibitor than Fodosine&#153;. We completed a Phase I single ascending dose clinical trial
and a Phase Ib multi-dose clinical trial, both in healthy volunteers. In November&nbsp;2005, we licensed
BCX-4208 to Roche for the world wide development and commercialization in autoimmune diseases and
transplant rejection.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first clinical trial with an intravenous formulation of Fodosine&#153;, which began in 2002,
was a Phase I clinical trial that enrolled T-ALL patients at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in
Houston, Texas. Simultaneously, there were preclinical studies being conducted at the M.D. Anderson
Cancer Center which indicated that Fodosine&#153; induces the same biochemical changes in various other
types of leukemia cells that are responsible for the inhibition of T-leukemia cells. The results of
these preclinical studies led us to expand beyond the single starting trial in T-ALL by initiating
additional clinical trials for refractory patients with B-ALL, CTCL, and hematologic malignancies.
Based on the encouraging results of these initial studies, we are working with our partner,
Mundipharma, to develop a strategy for the simultaneous development of Fodosine&#153; in multiple
indications using intravenous, oral and combination dosing regimens.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Fodosine&#153; Clinical Development for Aggressive T-cell Malignancies</I>. During 2004, we initiated a
Phase IIa trial to enroll patients with aggressive T-cell malignancies. Despite encouraging results
observed with other T-cell specific agents, the prognosis for patients with relapsed or refractory
leukemia or lymphoma is poor and treatment options remain limited. The goal of the Phase IIa
clinical trial was to determine the therapeutic effect produced by Fodosine&#153; as it relates to the
proposed mechanism of action in the inhibition of proliferating T-lymphocytes in patients with
T-ALL.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the results of the Phase IIa trial, we have negotiated a SPA agreement with the FDA
for the design of a multicenter, open-label, non-randomized repeat-dose registration study to
evaluate an intravenous treatment of Fodosine&#153; followed by an oral treatment of Fodosine&#153; in
patients with relapsed or refractory T-ALL. This study is designed to determine the rate of
complete remission achieved with Fodosine&#153; and will be a multinational trial which will include
sites in the United States, Eastern and Western Europe and South America. We announced the start of
this trial in January&nbsp;2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have obtained orphan drug status for Fodosine&#153; in multiple indications in both the U.S. and
Europe and the FDA has granted &#147;fast track&#148; status to the development of Fodosine&#153; for the
treatment of relapsed or refractory T-cell leukemia. Our current intent is to maintain significant
rights in this program and for BioCryst itself to potentially market and distribute Fodosine&#153; in
the United States for treatment of T-cell cancers.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2004, we initiated a Phase I/II trial with an oral formulation of Fodosine&#153; for treatment
of patients with CTCL. Based on the encouraging results of this trial, we are in active discussions
with the FDA to determine what would be required to initiate a pivotal trial in CTCL during 2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February&nbsp;2006, we and Mundipharma entered into an exclusive license agreement to develop
and commercialize Fodosine&#153;, in markets across Europe, Asia and Australasia for use in oncology.
The agreement covers a number of markets in Asia and Australasia including Japan, Australia, New
Zealand, China and India. This collaboration should help maximize the global development,
commercialization, and market potential of Fodosine&#153; in a variety of serious medical conditions
potentially including T-cell leukemia, CTCL, CLL, T-cell non-Hodgkin&#146;s lymphoma and B-cell
non-Hodgkin&#146;s lymphoma. Based on preclinical studies conducted at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center
which indicated that Fodosine&#153; induces the same biochemical changes in various other types of
leukemia cells that are responsible for the inhibition of T-leukemia cells, we initiated two small
clinical studies late in 2005 in B-cell leukemias, which are more prevalent than T-cell leukemias.
First, we initiated a Phase II trial with oral Fodosine&#153; in patients with CLL in an advanced stage
and refractory to fludarabine, the current standard of therapy. Next, we initiated a Phase I/II
clinical trial of Fodosine&#153; to determine the safety of repeat doses of an intravenous (IV)
formulation of the drug in patients with B-ALL. We are completing the evaluation of patients from
these trials and are reviewing the results with Mundipharma to determine the best clinical strategy
going forward.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the fourth quarter of 2004, we began clinical development of BCX-4208, a
second-generation PNP inhibitor, as a drug candidate for the treatment of T-cell mediated
autoimmune diseases, including psoriasis, and transplant rejection. Although BCX-4208 and Fodosine&#153;
are both investigational PNP inhibitors, BCX-4208 differs from Fodosine&#153; in significant ways. For
example, BCX-4208 is more potent, and has the ability to suppress PNP for longer periods of time.
Thus, BCX-4208 has potential advantages over Fodosine&#153; for the treatment of diseases requiring
long-term, chronic administration of a PNP inhibitor.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We completed our initial Phase I study, a single dose pharmacokinetic trial in healthy
volunteers, early in 2005 and during the third quarter of 2005, we initiated a Phase Ib multi dose
trial in healthy volunteers to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of multiple
oral doses of BCX-4208. In November&nbsp;2005, we and Roche announced an exclusive license agreement for
the worldwide development and commercialization of BCX-4208 for the prevention of acute rejection
in transplantation and for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. This collaboration provided
substantial strategic and economic benefit to us and also all the essential elements for the rapid,
comprehensive and competitive development of BCX-4208. The two companies have established a joint
committee to set the clinical development strategy and the future development program for BCX-4208.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We completed the dosing of subjects in the Phase Ib trial during 2006 and we are currently

characterized by symptoms including fever, cough, sore throat, fatigue, headache, and/or chills.
According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (&#147;CDC&#148;), an estimated 5% to 20% of
the American population suffers from influenza annually, more than 200,000 people are hospitalized
from flu complications, and approximately 36,000 people die. Influenza is particularly dangerous to
the elderly, young children and people with certain health conditions. Outbreaks of seasonal flu
tend to follow predictable patterns usually occurring in the winter. New vaccines are developed
annually based on known flu strains and are usually available for the annual flu season. There are
also antiviral treatments available for the treatment of people infected with influenza.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Avian Influenza</I>. According to information from the CDC, avian influenza, or bird flu is an
infection caused by viruses which occur naturally among birds. This form of flu is very contagious
among birds and can lead to serious illness and sometimes death. There are two main forms of
disease that infect domestic poultry, one a low pathogenic form and the other a highly pathogenic
form. The latter form can cause disease that affects multiple internal organs and with a mortality
rate between 90-100% in these birds within 2&nbsp;days.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While there are many different subtypes of the influenza A virus, only three subtypes are
known to be currently circulating among humans. Avian influenza A viruses are found chiefly in
birds, but there have been confirmed cases of infection in humans, generally as a result of contact
with infected birds. These infections have led to symptoms ranging from those of normal flu to more
severe and life threatening conditions. Influenza A (&#147;H5N1&#148;) is a subtype of an influenza virus
that is highly contagious among birds and can be very deadly to them. Of the avian influenza
viruses that have crossed the species barrier to infect humans, the H5N1 virus has caused the
largest number of detected cases of severe disease and death in humans. Thus far, this virus does
not spread easily from one person to another, but as influenza A viruses constantly change, they
could mutate over time to have the ability to spread rapidly among humans.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Pandemic Influenza</I>. Pandemic influenza is a global disease outbreak that occurs when a new
influenza virus emerges so that people have had no previous exposure. This situation occurs very
rarely and only occurred three times in the 20<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">th</SUP> century.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Influenza Prevention and Treatment</I>. The development of effective therapeutics has challenged
medical researchers due to the seasonal variation in viral strains and the highly infectious nature
of influenza. Patients, therefore, have limited treatment options. Amantadine and rimantadine are
used for treatment of influenza A but are ineffective against influenza B. In addition, these drugs
cause some adverse side effects, and the virus tends to develop resistance to these drugs. The CDC
has recommended against the use of amantadine and rimantadine for the treatment or prophylaxis of
influenza in the United States until susceptibility to these antiviral medications has been
re-established among circulating influenza A viruses.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vaccines are available against the disease but have limitations: people require advance
vaccination; vaccines are limited by their specificity to particular strains of the virus; and
vaccines offer little protection if the vaccine is inaccurate. In addition, many people decline the
required injections because of fear and/or discomfort. The ability of the virus to change its
structure to avoid the body&#146;s natural defenses is a serious obstacle to developing an effective
vaccine against influenza. Different strains can arise when surface antigens on the virus (the
portion of the virus that causes an immune reaction in humans) undergo minor genetic mutations each
year as the virus replicates. Because of this mutability, the immunity acquired in response to
infection by a particular strain of the virus does not provide adequate protection against viruses
that subsequently arise. The production of a new vaccine each year is not only complex and
expensive, but also an inefficient method of global disease control.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Inhibiting Influenza Neuraminidase. </I>Research during the past two decades has seen dramatic
advances in understanding the molecular structure and function of the influenza virus. Considerable
attention has been focused on the enzyme neuraminidase, which is located on the surface of the
virus. Neuraminidase assists in the release and spread of the flu virus by breaking the chemical
strands that hold the new viruses to the cell surface, allowing the replicated virus to spread and
infect other cells. This process progresses until the host&#146;s immune response can produce enough
antibodies to bring the infection under control. Inhibiting the neuraminidase enzyme keeps new
viruses attached to the cell surface, thereby preventing the spread of the virus and the further
infection of other cells. The subsequent quantities of virus in the bloodstream are not enough to
cause disease but are sufficient to induce the body to mount an immune response.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to our neuraminidase inhibitor drug candidate, both Roche, in collaboration with
Gilead Sciences, and GlaxoSmithKline (&#147;GSK&#148;) have neuraminidase inhibitors. Roche&#146;s neuraminidase
inhibitor is a twice-a-day, orally active neuraminidase inhibitor, while GSK&#146;s neuraminidase
inhibitor is administered by dry powder inhaler twice a day. Both drugs are approved for marketing
in the United States and other countries for treatment of influenza. Roche&#146;s neuraminidase
inhibitor is also approved for prophylaxis use for prevention of influenza. In addition to these
companies with neuraminidase inhibitors, there are other companies working to develop additional
antiviral drugs to be used against various strains of influenza.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Background. </I>In 1987, scientists at The University of Alabama at Birmingham (&#147;UAB&#148;), in
collaboration with our scientists, began determining the molecular structure of the influenza
neuraminidase enzyme from several different strains of influenza, using X-ray crystallography.
Subsequently, our scientists and UAB scientists developed numerous new inhibitors of these enzymes
using structure-based drug design. We licensed the influenza neuraminidase program from UAB in 1994
and proceeded to complete the studies of the enzyme&#146;s molecular structure needed to advance the
development of neuraminidase inhibitors. The structure of the active site of influenza
neuraminidase is similar among different viral strains. Because of this similarity, we believe that
our neuraminidase inhibitors may be effective in the treatment and prevention of influenza,
regardless of changes in the virus.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Current status of peramivir. </I>Due to the recent international concern about a potential
influenza pandemic that could be initiated by avian strains of the virus, peramivir has received
considerable attention, since it is positioned to be one of very few advanced antiviral
alternatives behind oseltamivir, or Tamiflu, for addressing a potential pandemic. As a result, we
re-initiated the clinical development of peramivir during 2006.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Current Development Strategy</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preclinical studies comparing peramivir with other anti-influenza drugs have demonstrated that
peramivir has outstanding broad-spectrum potency against multiple strains of influenza, including
the avian strain H5N1. In addition, peramivir retains activity against nearly all Tamiflu-resistant
strains of influenza that have been identified to date. We are currently focusing on injectable
formulations of peramivir that may achieve high blood levels that should be effective against most
strains of influenza, including strains that may be resistant to Tamiflu. Our investigational new
drug application (&#147;IND&#148;) for i.v. peramivir became effective in December&nbsp;2005 and for i.m. in
November&nbsp;2006. We received fast track designation from the FDA in January&nbsp;2006 and initiated a
Phase I clinical trial with i.v. peramivir in March&nbsp;2006. During 2006, we conducted multiple Phase
I clinical trials in healthy volunteers in preparation for the Phase II trials to be initiated
during the 2006-2007 influenza season, which began with the initiation of a Phase II study with the
i.m. formulation in January&nbsp;2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our plan is to develop two injectable formulations, including intravenous peramivir for
treating acutely ill patients, and an intramuscular injectable formulation for treatment of
earlier-stage infected patients. We expect the clinical development for these injectable
formulations to follow a classical development pathway. Initial testing in patients infected with
seasonal flu began with the initiation of the Phase II study with the i.m. formulation in January
2007. Preclinical studies have indicated that a single injection of peramivir is effective at
preventing death in mice from infections with virulent strains of influenza. If this finding can be
confirmed in clinical trials, we believe the i.m. formulation will have considerable potential for
treating patients with seasonal influenza infections, in addition to providing an effective
mechanism for treating large numbers of patients rapidly in the event of a flu pandemic.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Congress approved an appropriation of $3.8&nbsp;billion for 2006 to support the development of
various countermeasures for a flu pandemic. The appropriation included funding for the development
of new antiviral agents. In January&nbsp;2007, we announced that HHS had awarded the Company a $102.6
million, four-year contract for the advanced development of peramivir for U.S. licensure. Funding
from the contract will support manufacturing of clinical lots, process validation, clinical studies and other
product approval requirements needed for U.S. licensure.

related to the hepatitis C polymerase target associated with hepatitis C viral infections. Under
the original terms of the agreement, the research investigators from Emory provided us with
materials and technical insight into the target.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are targeting HCV polymerase through collaborative and in-house efforts. Specifically, we
are focused on development of orally active inhibitors against the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Competition for this target is less intense than for the HCV protease target and history suggests
the likelihood of designing a useful inhibitor against this target may be better than designing
inhibitors against the protease.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have designed, synthesized and screened potential compounds against HCV polymerase.
Specifically, our scientists have measured the potency and ability of potential drug candidates to
block the replication of HCV polymerase in vitro, or in test tubes. These experiments measure the
potency of each selected compound&#146;s ability to block replication. Advanced screening was also used
to measure the fit of promising compounds in the HCV polymerase active site using X-ray
crystallography and computer molecular modeling. The goal has been to identify a series of
compounds that are potent in vitro inhibitors of the active site of the HCV polymerase for further
testing and lead optimization.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2005, we identified a lead compound, BCX-4678, for which we have made progress in the
preclinical development, plus major improvements in the large-scale synthesis. In addition, we have
identified a number of other preclinical candidates for this therapeutic area and we are currently
evaluating and prioritizing which candidate(s) to bring into clinical development.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Structure-based drug design is a drug discovery approach by which we design synthetic
compounds from detailed structural knowledge of the active sites of enzyme targets associated with
particular diseases. Enzymes are proteins that act as catalysts for many vital biological
reactions. Our goal generally is to design a compound that will fit in the active site of an enzyme
(the active site of an enzyme is the area into which a chemical or biological molecule fits to
initiate a biochemical reaction) and thereby interfere with the progression of disease.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our structure-based drug design involves the application of both traditional biology and
medicinal chemistry and an array of advanced technologies. We use X-ray crystallography, computer
modeling of molecular structures and advanced chemistry techniques to focus on the
three-dimensional molecular structure and active site characteristics of the enzymes that control
cellular biology.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that structure-based drug design technologies are superior to drug screening
techniques. By identifying the target enzyme in advance and by discovering the chemical and
molecular structure of the enzyme, we believe it is possible to design a better drug to interact
with the enzyme. In addition, the structural data obtained by X-ray crystallographic analysis allow
additional analysis and compound modification at each stage of the biological evaluation. This
capability makes structure-based drug design a powerful tool for efficient development of drugs
that are highly specific for particular enzyme target sites.

with Shionogi &#038; Co., Ltd. (&#147;Shionogi&#148;) to develop and commercialize the Company&#146;s lead influenza
neuraminidase inhibitor, peramivir, in Japan for the treatment of seasonal and potentially
life-threatening human influenza. Under the terms of the agreement, Shionogi obtained rights to
injectable formulations of peramivir in Japan in exchange for a $14&nbsp;million up-front payment. The
license provides for future event payments for achieving specified development, regulatory and
commercial events (including certain sales level amounts following a product&#146;s launch) for certain
indications. In addition, the Company will receive royalties based on a percentage of net product
sales. Generally, all payments under the agreement are nonrefundable and non-creditable, but they
are subject to audit. The Company developed peramivir under a license from UAB and will owe
sublicense payments to them on the upfront payment and any future event payments and/or royalties
received by the Company from Shionogi. The Company retains all rights to commercialize peramivir
in North America, Europe, and other countries outside of Korea and Japan.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January&nbsp;2007, we announced that HHS had awarded the Company a $102.6&nbsp;million, four-year
contract for the advanced development of peramivir for U.S. licensure. Funding from the contract
will support manufacturing of clinical lots, process validation, clinical studies and other product approval
requirements needed for U.S. licensure. HHS has indicated that antiviral drugs are an important
element of their pandemic influenza preparedness efforts and that their strategy includes not only
stockpiling of existing antiviral drugs but also seeking out new antiviral medications to further
broaden their capabilities to treat and prevent all forms of influenza. Peramivir is in the same
class of neuraminidase inhibitors as oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza), all of which
are antiviral drugs, but the method of delivery for peramivir will be parenteral (i.m. and i.v.) as
compared to the oral Tamiflu or inhaled Relenza. We are committed to working with HHS for the
development of these parenteral formulations of peramivir which could be especially useful in
hospital settings or pandemic situations due to the ability to achieve high levels of the drug
rapidly throughout the body.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This contract is a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract, which is milestone-driven. HHS will make
periodic assessments of progress and the continuation of the contract is based on our performance,
timeliness and quality of deliverables, and other factors. The government has rights under certain
contract clauses to terminate this contract.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Patents and Proprietary Information</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and enforce patent protection for our
products, methods, processes and other proprietary technologies, preserve our trade secrets, and
operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of other parties, both in the United States
and in other countries. We own or have rights to certain proprietary information, proprietary
technology, issued and allowed patents and patent applications which relate to compounds we are
developing. We actively seek, when appropriate, protection for our products, proprietary technology
and proprietary information by means of U.S. and foreign patents, trademarks and contractual
arrangements. In addition, we rely upon trade secrets and contractual arrangements to protect
certain of our proprietary information, proprietary technology and products.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal
and factual questions. Our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary position for our
technology will depend on our success in obtaining effective patent claims and enforcing those
claims once granted. We do not know whether any of our patent applications or those patent
applications that we license will result in the issuance of any patents. Our issued patents and
those that may issue in the future, or those licensed to us, may be challenged, invalidated,
rendered unenforceable or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from
marketing related products or the length of term of patent protection that we may have for our
products. In addition, the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with
competitive advantages against competitors with similar compounds or technology. Furthermore, our
competitors may independently develop similar technologies or duplicate any technology developed by
us in a manner that does not infringe our patents or other intellectual property. Because of the
extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it

six additional composition of matter patents and two pending composition of matter patents from
AECOM and IRL for our PNP inhibitors, plus additional manufacturing patents related to these PNP
inhibitors and one patent from Emory related to hepatitis C. Additionally, we have 16 U.S. patent
applications pending related to PNP, neuraminidase, RNA viral polymerase, paramyxovirus
neuraminidase, and serine protease inhibitors. Our pending applications may not result in issued
patents, and our patents may not provide us with sufficient protection against competitive products
or otherwise be commercially viable.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our success is also dependent upon the skills, knowledge and experience of our scientific and
technical personnel, none of which is patentable. To help protect our rights, we require all
employees, consultants, advisors and partners to enter into confidentiality agreements, which
prohibit the disclosure of confidential information to anyone outside of our company and, where
possible, requires disclosure and assignment to us of their ideas, developments, discoveries and

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We currently plan to market, distribute and sell Fodosine&#153; in the U.S. for use in treatment of
T-cell and B-cell cancers. Although our general strategy is to rely on major marketing companies
for worldwide commercialization of most products we may develop, we believe that we can manage the
highly specialized oncology market for Fodosine&#153; within the U.S. Most patients with advanced T-cell
malignancies in the U.S. are treated at major referral cancer centers, and many of these centers
have been participating in our Fodosine&#153; clinical trials and will thus be familiar with Fodosine&#153;
if it reaches the market. However, we lack experience in marketing, distributing and selling
pharmaceutical products. Our general strategy is to rely on partners, licensees or arrangements
with others to provide for the marketing, distribution and sales of products we may develop. We may
not be able to establish and maintain acceptable commercial arrangements with partners, licensees
or others to perform such activities.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Competition</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive. Many companies,
including biotechnology, chemical and pharmaceutical companies, are actively engaged in activities
similar to ours, including research and development of drugs for the treatment of cancer,
infectious, autoimmune, inflammatory and cardiovascular diseases and disorders. Many of these
companies have substantially greater financial and other resources, larger research and development
staffs, and more extensive marketing and manufacturing organizations than we do. In addition, some
of them have considerable experience in preclinical testing, clinical trials and other regulatory
approval procedures. For example, in October&nbsp;2005, the FDA announced the approval of Arranon
(nelarabine)&nbsp;for the treatment of adults and children with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
This drug was approved under the FDA&#146;s orphan drug and accelerated approval (fast track) programs
and is being distributed and marketed by GSK. We are currently testing Fodosine&#153; in T-cell ALL and
have also received both orphan drug and fast track designation from the FDA. There are also
academic institutions, governmental agencies and other research organizations that are conducting
research in areas in which we are working. They may also market commercial products, either on
their own or through collaborative efforts.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We expect to encounter significant competition for any of the pharmaceutical products we plan
to develop. Companies that complete clinical trials, obtain required regulatory approvals and
commence commercial sales of their products before their competitors may achieve a significant
competitive advantage. Such is the case with GSK&#146;s Arranon for T-cell ALL and the current
neuraminidase inhibitors marketed by GSK and Roche for influenza. In addition, several
pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms, including major pharmaceutical companies and specialized
structure-based drug design companies, have announced efforts in the field of structure-based drug
design and in the fields of PNP, HCV, influenza, and other therapeutic areas where we are focusing
our drug discovery efforts.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to compete successfully, we must develop proprietary positions in patented drugs for
therapeutic markets that have not been satisfactorily addressed by conventional research strategies
and, in the process, expand our expertise in structure-based drug design. Our products, even if
successfully tested and developed, may not be adopted by physicians over other products and may not

commercialization. The FDA regulates, among other things, the development, testing, manufacture,
safety, efficacy, record-keeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and
distribution of pharmaceutical products. In foreign countries, our products are also subject to
extensive regulation by foreign governments. These government regulations will be a significant
factor in the production and marketing of any pharmaceutical products that we develop. Failure to
comply with applicable FDA and other regulatory requirements at any stage during the regulatory
process may subject us to sanctions, including:

obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any products, we or our partners must
demonstrate that our product candidates are safe and effective for use in humans. The approval
process takes many years, substantial expenses may be incurred and significant time may be devoted
to clinical development.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before testing potential candidates in humans, we carry out laboratory and animal studies to
determine safety and biological activity. After completing preclinical trials, we must file an IND,
including a proposal to begin clinical trials, with the FDA. We have filed thirteen INDs to date
and plan to file, or rely on future partners to file, additional INDs in the future as our
potential drug candidates advance to that stage of development. Thirty days after filing an IND, a
Phase I human clinical trial can start, unless the FDA places a hold on the study.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Phase I trials are designed to determine safety in a small group of patients or healthy
volunteers. We also assess tolerances and the metabolic and pharmacologic actions of our drug
candidates at different doses. After we complete the initial trials, we conduct Phase II trials to
assess safety and efficacy and establish the optimal dose in patients. If Phase II trials are
successful, we or our partners conduct Phase III trials to verify the results in a larger patient
population. Phase III trials are required for FDA approval to market a drug. A Phase III trial may
require hundreds or even thousands of patients and is the most expensive to conduct. The goal in
Phase III is to collect enough safety and efficacy data to obtain FDA approval of a drug for

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After completion of the clinical trials of a product, we or our partners must submit a NDA to
the FDA for marketing approval before commercialization of the product. The FDA may not grant
approval on a timely basis, if at all. The FDA, as a result of the Food and Drug Administration
Modernization Act of 1997, has six months to review and act upon license applications for priority
therapeutics that are for life-threatening or unmet medical needs. Standard reviews can take
between one and two years, and can even take longer if significant questions arise during the
review process. The FDA may withdraw any required approvals, once obtained.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to clinical development regulations, we and our contract manufacturers and
partners must comply with the applicable FDA current good manufacturing practice (&#147;GMP&#148;)
regulations. GMP regulations include requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance
as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Manufacturing facilities are
subject to inspection by the FDA. Such facilities must be approved before we can use them in
commercial manufacturing of our potential products. We or our contract manufacturers may not be
able to comply with the applicable GMP requirements and other FDA regulatory requirements. If we or
our contract manufacturers fail to comply, our business, financial condition and results of
operations will be materially adversely affected.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>An investment in our stock involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the
following risks, along with all of the other information included in our other filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, before deciding to buy our common stock. Additional risks and
uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also impair
our business operations. If we are unable to prevent events that have a negative effect from
occurring, then our business may suffer. Negative events are likely to decrease our revenue,
increase our costs, make our financial results poorer and/or decrease our financial strength, and
may cause our stock price to decline. In that case, you may lose all or a part of your investment
in our common stock.</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Risks Relating to Our Business</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B><I>We have incurred substantial losses since our inception in 1986, expect to continue to incur such
losses, and may never be profitable.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since our inception in 1986, we have not been profitable. We expect to incur additional losses
for the foreseeable future, and our losses could increase as our research and development efforts
progress. As of December&nbsp;31, 2006, our accumulated deficit was approximately $195.5&nbsp;million. To
become profitable, we must successfully develop drug product candidates, enter into profitable
agreements with other parties and our product candidates must receive regulatory approval. We or
these other parties must then successfully manufacture and market our product candidates. It could
be several years, if ever, before we receive royalties from any current or future license
agreements or revenues directly from product sales.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing our product
candidates and their potential for commercialization, we are unable to predict the extent of any
future losses or when we will become profitable, if at all. Even if we do achieve profitability, we
may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. If we are
unable to achieve and sustain profitability, the market value of our common stock will likely
decline.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Our success depends upon our ability to advance our products through the various stages of
development, especially through the clinical trial process.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To receive the regulatory approvals necessary for the sale of our product candidates, we or
our partners must demonstrate through preclinical studies and clinical trials that each product
candidate is safe and effective. The clinical trial process is complex and uncertain. Because of
the cost and duration of clinical trials, we may decide to discontinue development of product
candidates that are unlikely to show good results in the trials, unlikely to help advance a product
to the point of a meaningful collaboration, or unlikely to have a reasonable commercial potential.
We may suffer significant setbacks in pivotal clinical trials, even after earlier clinical trials
show promising results. Any of our product candidates may produce undesirable side effects in
humans. These side effects could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt
clinical trials of a product candidate. These side effects could also result in the FDA or foreign
regulatory authorities refusing to approve the product candidate for any targeted indications. We,
our partners, the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may suspend or terminate clinical trials at
any time if we or they believe the trial participants face unacceptable health risks. Clinical
trials may fail to demonstrate that our product candidates are safe or effective.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clinical trials are lengthy and expensive. We or our partners incur substantial expense for,
and devote significant time to, preclinical testing and clinical trials, yet cannot be certain that
the tests and trials will ever result in the commercial sale of a product. For example, clinical
trials require adequate supplies of drug and sufficient patient enrollment. Delays in patient
enrollment can result in increased costs and longer development times. Even if we or our partners
successfully complete clinical trials for our product candidates, we or our partners might not file
the required regulatory submissions in a timely manner and may not receive regulatory approval for

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To date, we have financed our operations primarily from sale of our equity securities and cash
from collaborative and other research and development agreements, and, to a lesser extent,
interest. For the year, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance has decreased
from $60.0&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2005 to $46.2&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2006, primarily due
to the monthly cash burn from operations less the cash received from collaborations, which totaled
to approximately $31.8&nbsp;million net of sublicense fees.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the award of the HHS contract to fund the development of peramivir and the current and
planned trials for Fodosine&#153;, we expect an increase in our operating expenses for 2007. However,
with the expected reimbursement from the HHS contract and our other partners, we are projecting our net cash burn rate to average approximately $3.0&nbsp;million per month in 2007. We caution that both
our expenses and our cash flows will vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to the nature
of the trials in influenza and the reimbursement from HHS.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As our clinical programs continue to grow and patient enrollment increases, our costs will
increase. Our current and planned clinical trials plus the related manufacturing, personnel
resources and testing required for supporting the development of our drug candidates will consume
significant capital resources and will increase our expenses. Our expenses, revenues and burn rate
could vary significantly depending on many factors, including our ability to raise additional
capital, the development progress of our collaborative agreements for our drug candidates, the
amount of funding we receive from HHS for peramivir, the amount of funding or assistance, if any,
we receive from other governmental agencies or other new partnerships with third parties for the
development of our drug candidates, the progress and results of our current and proposed clinical
trials for our most advanced drug products, the progress made in the manufacturing of our lead
products and the progression of our other programs.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2006, we had $46.2&nbsp;million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable
securities. With our currently available funds and amounts to be received from HHS, Shionogi (and
our other collaborators), we believe these resources will be sufficient to fund our operations for
at least the next twelve months. However, this is a forward looking statement, and there may be
changes that would consume available resources significantly before such time. Our long-term
capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend upon many factors,

commercialization of our current product candidates. Additional funding, whether through additional
sales of securities or collaborative or other arrangements with corporate partners or from other
sources, including governmental agencies, in general and from the HHS contract specifically, may
not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to us. The issuance of preferred or common
stock or convertible securities, with terms and prices significantly more favorable than those of
the currently outstanding common stock, could have the effect of diluting or adversely affecting
the holdings or rights of our existing stockholders. In addition, collaborative arrangements may
require us to transfer certain material rights to such corporate partners. Insufficient funds may
require us to delay, scale-back or eliminate certain of our research and development programs.

As part of any such audit or review, the U.S. government may review the adequacy of, and our
compliance with, our internal control systems and policies, including those relating to our
purchasing, property, estimating, compensation and management information systems. Based on the
results of its audits, the U.S. government may adjust our contract-related costs and fees,

illegal activity, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions,
including termination of our contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and
suspension or prohibition from doing business with the U.S. government. We could also suffer
serious harm to our reputation if allegations of impropriety were made against us. In addition,
under U.S. government purchasing regulations, some of our costs may not be reimbursable or allowed
under our contracts. Further, as a U.S. government contractor, we are subject to an increased risk
of investigations, criminal prosecution, civil fraud, whistleblower lawsuits and other legal
actions and liabilities as compared to private sector commercial companies.

with pharmaceutical companies, research institutions, the United States government and universities
for the preclinical development, clinical development, regulatory approval, marketing, domestic and
international sales and distribution of our drug product candidates. Our general strategy is to
rely upon other parties for all of these steps so that we can focus exclusively on the key areas of
our expertise. For some smaller niche markets, we may perform these steps ourselves and outsource
those functions where we do not have the internal expertise.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, we have established collaborative relationships with four pharmaceutical companies,
Roche, Mundipharma, Shionogi and Green Cross for development and commercialization of BCX-4208,

responsibility of our partner. If we are unable to establish and maintain collaborative
relationships on acceptable terms, we may have to delay or discontinue further development of one

find alternative sources of funding. Any delay in the development or commercialization of our

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We depend on contract research organizations, third-party vendors and investigators for
preclinical testing and clinical trials related to our drug discovery and development efforts,
including the HHS contract. We intend to depend on them to assist in our future discovery and
development efforts. These parties are not our employees and we cannot control the amount or
timing of resources that they devote to our programs. If they fail to devote sufficient time and
resources to our drug development programs or if their performance is substandard, it will delay
the approval of our products. The parties with which we contract for execution of our clinical
trials play a significant role in the conduct of the trials and the subsequent collection and
analysis of data. Their failure to meet their obligations could adversely affect clinical
development of our products. Moreover, these parties may also have relationships with other
commercial entities, some of which may compete with us. If they assist our competitors it could
harm our competitive position.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we lose our relationship with any one or more of these parties, we could experience a
significant delay in both identifying another comparable provider and then contracting for its
services. We may be unable to retain an alternative provider on reasonable terms, if at all. Even
if we locate an alternative provider, it is likely that this provider may need additional time to
respond to our needs and may not provide the same type or level of service as the original
provider. In addition, any provider that we retain will be subject to current Good Laboratory
Practices (&#147;cGLP&#148;), current Good Manufacturing Practices (&#147;cGMP&#148;), or current Good Clinical
Practices (&#147;cGCP&#148;), and similar foreign standards and we do not have control over compliance with
these regulations by these providers. Consequently, if these practices and standards are not
adhered to by these providers, the development and commercialization of our product candidates
could be delayed.

of clinical trials, we may decide to discontinue development of product candidates that are
unlikely to show good results in the trials, unlikely to help advance a product to the point of a
meaningful collaboration, or unlikely to have a reasonable commercial potential. Positive results
from preclinical studies and early clinical trials do not ensure positive results in clinical
trials designed to permit application for regulatory approval, called pivotal clinical trials. We
may suffer significant setbacks in pivotal clinical trials, even after earlier clinical trials show
promising results. Any of our product candidates may produce undesirable side effects in humans.
These side effects could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical
trials of a product candidate. These side effects could also result in the FDA or foreign
regulatory authorities refusing to approve the product candidate for any targeted indications. We,
our partners, the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may suspend or terminate clinical trials at
any time if we or they believe the trial participants face unacceptable health risks. Clinical
trials may fail to demonstrate that our product candidates are safe or effective.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We negotiated a special protocol assessment, or SPA, with the FDA for the recently initiated
pivotal clinical trial of our lead anti-cancer compound, Fodosine&#153;. An SPA is an agreement between
an applicant and the FDA on the design and the size of clinical trials that is intended to form the
basis of a New Drug Application (&#147;NDA&#148;). Once the FDA and an applicant reach an agreement on an
SPA, the SPA cannot be changed after the clinical trial begins, except in limited circumstances
such as a change in the science or clinical knowledge about the conditions being studied. Any
significant change to the protocols for a clinical trial subject to an SPA would require prior FDA
approval, which could delay implementation of such a change and continuation and completion of the
related clinical trial. Receipt of the SPA does not ensure that Fodosine&#153; will receive FDA
approval or that the process will be accelerated.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clinical trials are lengthy and expensive. We or our partners incur substantial expense for,
and devote significant time to, preclinical testing and clinical trials, yet cannot be certain that
the tests and trials will ever result in the commercial sale of a product. For example, clinical
trials require adequate supplies of drug and sufficient patient enrollment. Delays in patient
enrollment can result in increased costs and longer development times. Even if we or our partners
successfully complete clinical trials for our product candidates, we or our partners might not file
the required regulatory submissions in a timely manner and may not receive regulatory approval for
the product candidate.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We or our partners must obtain regulatory approval before marketing or selling our future drug
products. If we or our partners are unable to receive regulatory approval and do not market or sell
our future drug products, we will never receive any revenue from such product sales. In the United
States, we or our partners must obtain FDA approval for each drug that we intend to commercialize.
The FDA approval process is typically lengthy and expensive, and approval is never certain.
Products distributed abroad are also subject to foreign government regulation. Neither the FDA nor
foreign regulatory agencies have approved any of our drug product candidates. We have several drug
products in various stages of preclinical and clinical development; however, we are unable to
determine when, if ever, any of these products will be commercially available. Because of the risks
and uncertainties in biopharmaceutical development, our product candidates could take a
significantly longer time to gain regulatory approval than we expect or may never gain approval. If
the FDA delays regulatory approval of our product candidates, our management&#146;s credibility, our
company&#146;s value and our operating results may suffer. Even if the FDA or foreign regulatory
agencies approve a product candidate, the approval may limit the indicated uses for a product
candidate and/or may require post-marketing studies.

clinical data and our manufacturing data at our facility. While we do store duplicate copies of
most of our clinical data offsite and a significant portion of our data is included in regular

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our success will depend in part on our ability and the abilities of our partners to obtain
patent protection for our products, methods, processes and other technologies we may license or
develop, to preserve our trade secrets, and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of
third parties both domestically and abroad. The patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical
companies is generally highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has
recently been the subject of much litigation. Neither the United States Patent and Trademark Office
(&#147;USPTO&#148;) nor the courts have a consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed or the
degree of protection afforded under many biotechnology and pharmaceutical patents. The validity,
enforceability and commercial value of these rights, therefore, is highly uncertain.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our success depends in part on avoiding the infringement of other parties&#146; patents and
proprietary rights as well as avoiding the breach of any licenses relating to our technologies and
products. In the U.S., patent applications filed in recent years are confidential for 18&nbsp;months,
while older applications are not published until the patent issues. As a result, avoiding patent
infringement may be difficult and we may inadvertently infringe third-party patents or proprietary
rights. These third parties could bring claims against us, our partners or our licensors that even
if resolved in our favor, could cause us to incur substantial expenses and, if resolved against us,
could additionally cause us to pay substantial damages. Further, if a patent infringement suit were
brought against us, our partners or our licensors, we or they could be forced to stop or delay
research, development, manufacturing or sales of any infringing product in the country or countries
covered by the patent we infringe, unless we can obtain a license from the patent holder. Such a
license may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all, particularly if the third party is
developing or marketing a product competitive with the infringing product. Even if we, our partners
or our licensors were able to obtain a license, the rights may be nonexclusive, which would give
our competitors access to the same intellectual property.

related to intellectual property rights, including proceedings before the USPTO. Any judgment
adverse to us in any litigation or other proceeding arising in connection with a patent or patent

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our success is also dependent upon the skills, knowledge and experience, none of which is
patentable, of our scientific and technical personnel. To help protect our rights, we require all
employees, consultants, advisors and partners to enter into confidentiality agreements that
prohibit the disclosure of confidential information to anyone outside of our company and require
disclosure and assignment to us of their ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions. These
agreements may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary
information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure or the lawful development by others
of such information, and if any of our proprietary information is disclosed, our business will
suffer because our revenues depend upon our ability to license our technology and any such events

services might impede the achievement of our development and commercial objectives. Competition for
key personnel with the experience that we require is intense and is expected to continue to
increase. Our inability to attract and retain the required number of skilled and experienced
management, operational and scientific personnel, will harm our business because we rely upon these
personnel for many critical functions of our business. In addition, we rely on members of our
scientific advisory board and consultants to assist us in formulating our research and development

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the United States, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals, at
both the federal and state government levels, to change the healthcare system in ways that could
affect our ability to sell our products profitably, if approved. For example, the Medicare
Prescription Drug and Modernization Act of 2003 (&#147;MMA&#148;), went into effect in 2006 and has changed
the types of drugs covered by Medicare, and the methodology used to determine the price for such
drugs. Further federal and state proposals and healthcare reforms are likely. Our business could be
harmed by the MMA, by the possible effect of this legislation on amounts that private payors will
pay and by other healthcare reforms that may be enacted or adopted in the future.

expensive. As a result, we may be unable to obtain sufficient insurance or increase our existing
coverage at a reasonable cost to protect us against losses that could have a material adverse
effect on our business. An individual may bring a product liability claim against us if one of our
products or product candidates causes, or is claimed to have caused, an injury or is found to be
unsuitable for consumer use. Any product liability claim brought against us, with or without merit,

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Because stock ownership is concentrated, you and other investors will have limited influence on
stockholder decisions.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2006, our directors, executive officers and some principal stockholders and
their affiliates beneficially owned approximately 31.7% of our outstanding common stock and common
stock equivalents. As a result, these holders, if acting together, are able to significantly
influence matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors. This
concentration of ownership may delay, defer or prevent a change in our control.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>We have anti-takeover provisions in our corporate charter documents that may result in outcomes
with which you do not agree.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 4,955,000 shares of undesignated
preferred stock and to determine the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of those
shares without further vote or action by our stockholders. The rights of the holders of any
preferred stock that may be issued in the future may adversely affect the rights of the holders of
common stock. The issuance of preferred stock could make it more difficult for third parties to
acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, our certificate of incorporation provides for staggered terms for the members of
the board of directors and supermajority approval of the removal of any member of the board of
directors and prevents our stockholders from acting by written consent. Our certificate also
requires supermajority approval of any amendment of these provisions. These provisions and other
provisions of our by-laws and of Delaware law applicable to us could delay or make more difficult a
merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving us.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June&nbsp;2002, our board of directors adopted a stockholder rights plan and, pursuant thereto,
issued preferred stock purchase rights (&#147;Rights&#148;) to the holders of our common stock. The Rights
have certain anti-takeover effects. If triggered, the Rights would cause substantial dilution to a
person or group of persons who acquires more than 15% (19.9% for William W. Featheringill, a
Director who owned approximately 9.58% as of December&nbsp;31, 2006, but owned more than 15% at the time
the Rights were put in place) of our common stock on terms not approved by the board of directors.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>We have never paid dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable
future.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have never paid cash dividends on our stock. We currently intend to retain all future
earnings, if any, for use in the operation of our business. Accordingly, we do not anticipate
paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.

uncertainties. These forward-looking statements can generally be identified by the use of words
such as &#147;may,&#148; &#147;will,&#148; &#147;intends,&#148; &#147;plans,&#148; &#147;believes,&#148; &#147;anticipates,&#148; &#147;expects,&#148; &#147;estimates,&#148;

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our revenues have generally been limited to license fees, event payments, research and
development fees, and interest income. Revenue is recognized in accordance with Staff Accounting
Bulletin No.&nbsp;104, <I>Revenue Recognition </I>(&#147;SAB No.&nbsp;104&#148;) and Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 00-21,
<I>Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables </I>(&#147;EITF Issue 00-21&#148;). License fees, future event
payments, and research and development fees are recognized as revenue when the earnings process is
complete and we have no further continuing performance obligations or we have completed the
performance obligations under the terms of the agreement. Fees received under licensing agreements
that are related to future performance are deferred and recognized as earned over an estimated
period determined by management based on the terms of the agreement and the products licensed. For
example, in the Roche and Mundipharma licenses agreements, we deferred the upfront payments over
the remaining life of the patents which are through 2023 and 2017, respectively. We are currently
evaluating the period of deferral for the upfront payment related to the Shionogi agreement. In the
event a license agreement contains multiple deliverables, we evaluate whether the deliverables are
separate or combined units of accounting in accordance with EITF Issue 00-21. Revisions to revenue
or profit estimates as a result of changes in the estimated revenue period are recognized
prospectively.

satisfying these criteria are recorded as deferred revenue.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the guidance of EITF Issue 99-19 and EITF Issue 01-14, reimbursements received for
direct out-of-pocket expenses related to research and development costs are recorded as revenue in
the income statement rather than as a reduction in expenses. For example, the amounts received from
our collaboration with Mundipharma for the reimbursement of clinical trial costs and the costs
received from HHS for reimbursement will be recorded as revenue in the period the related costs
were recorded. Significant direct costs incurred upon entering into a licensing arrangement, such
as our sublicense fees to AECOM and IRL, are deferred and charged to expense in proportion to the
revenue recognized.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Royalty revenue is recognized based on estimates of royalties earned during the applicable
period and adjusted for differences between the estimated and actual royalties in the following
period. If royalties can not be reasonably estimated, revenue is recognized upon receipt of
royalty statements from the licensee. We have not received any royalties from the sale of licensed
pharmaceutical products.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It could be several years, if ever, before we will recognize significant revenue from
royalties received pursuant to our license agreements or revenue directly from product sales.
Future revenues, if any, are likely to fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above expenditures for contract research and development for our current and future drug
candidates will vary from quarter-to-quarter depending on the status of our research and
development projects. For example, during the third quarter of 2006, we incurred significant costs
related to the Phase I trials with peramivir and the ongoing validation manufacturing for peramivir
drug substance. Results from these Phase I trials have enabled us to design the Phase II trials
beginning in the 2006-2007 flu season. In addition, we initiated a Phase II pivotal trial with
Fodosine&#153; in January&nbsp;2007. As these trials progress and additional trials are started in other
indications, our costs for clinical studies will increase significantly. In addition, the costs
associated with the manufacturing of Fodosine&#153; and peramivir will increase as we continue scaling
up to the larger production runs required for clinical development, manufacturing validation and
additional toxicology studies for these programs.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes in our existing and future research and development and collaborative relationships
also will impact the status of our research and development projects. For example, in January&nbsp;2007,
we announced a $102.6&nbsp;million contract with HHS for the full funding of the development,
manufacturing and clinical trials required for licensure of peramivir with both the i.v. and i.m.
formulations. In March&nbsp;2007, we announced a license agreement with Shionogi for the development and
commercialization of peramivir in Japan for an upfront payment of $14&nbsp;million. In November&nbsp;2005 we
entered into a license agreement with Roche for the worldwide development and commercialization for
our second PNP inhibitor, BCX-4208. In addition to an upfront payment plus an advance payment for
manufacturing we performed, Roche has taken over the development and is paying all costs associated
with this program. In February&nbsp;2006, we licensed Fodosine&#153; to Mundipharma for the development and
commercialization of this drug in Europe, Asia and Australasia. In addition to the upfront payment
of $10&nbsp;million, Mundipharma is paying 50% of the clinical development costs we incur for Fodosine&#153;
on existing and planned clinical trials, but their portion shall not exceed $10&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Roche and Mundipharma collaborations, we will owe sublicense payments to AECOM and IRL
on all upfront, future event payments and royalties. For the Shionogi and Green Cross
collaborations, we will owe sublicense payments to UAB. For 2006, we paid approximately $8.2
million related to the Roche and Mundipharma agreements. The revenue from these agreements has been
recorded as deferred revenue on our balance sheet and will be recognized over the remaining patent
life of the related drug candidate. The payments to AECOM and IRL have been recorded as deferred
assets on our balance sheet and will be recognized over the period of the related revenue
recognition. Due to the nature of the potential milestones in our collaborations, it is difficult
to predict if and when particular milestones will be achieved by us or our partners.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contract with HHS is a standard cost-plus-fixed-fee contract which provides for the
reimbursement of allowable costs plus an element of overhead and profit. This is expected to have a
significant positive revenue impact on our financial statements. As the costs of our peramivir
program increase for the clinical trials, manufacturing and other expenses we will submit invoices
to HHS for reimbursement of expenses allowable under the contract. The expenses are recorded as R&#038;D
expenses and reimbursements are recorded as revenue. In the same way, as we incur R&#038;D costs for our
Fodosine&#153; program that are reimbursable under the Mundipharma contract or R&#038;D expenses for
peramivir that are related to the Shionogi contract, we will invoice the respective company for
those costs. The amounts reimbursable will be recorded as revenue in the same period the costs are
incurred. During January&nbsp;2007, we initiated a pivotal clinical trial with Fodosine&#153; in T-ALL, which
triggered a $5&nbsp;million milestone payment from Mundipharma. The revenues expected from the
Mundipharma agreement in 2007 will consist of continuing reimbursement of R&#038;D expenses in
accordance with the contract and the amortization of the upfront and milestone payments. The
primary revenue expected from the Roche agreement for 2007 is the continuing amortization of the
upfront payment received.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we may, in some cases, be able to control the timing of development expenses, in part
by accelerating or decelerating certain costs, many of these costs will be incurred irrespective of
whether we are able to discover drug candidates or obtain collaborative partners for
commercialization. In addition, the achievement of milestones in our collaboration agreements is
uncertain and unpredictable and would most likely have a significant impact on our operating
results in the periods they are achieved. As a result, we believe that quarter-to-quarter
comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon
as an indication of future performance. If we fail to meet the research, clinical and financial
expectations of securities analysts and investors, it could have a material adverse effect on the
price of our common stock.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In August&nbsp;2006, we opened an office in Cary, North Carolina for the establishment of our
clinical and regulatory operation. We currently have 5,375 square feet under lease through February
2010. This lease requires us to pay $7,391 per month and escalates annually to $7,841 per month in
the final year.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have not incurred any significant charges related to building renovations since 2001. Our
capital costs during 2006 were approximately $1.4&nbsp;million and we anticipate capital costs of
approximately $2.0&nbsp;million in 2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2006, we had long-term operating lease obligations, which provide for
aggregate minimum payments of $549,758 in 2007, $565,257 in 2008 and $538,351 in 2009. These
obligations include the future rental of our operating facilities.

$60&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2005 to $46.2&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2006, primarily due to the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February&nbsp;2006, we licensed Fodosine&#153; to Mundipharma for the development and
commercialization of this drug in Europe, Asia and Australasia. In addition to the upfront payment
of $10&nbsp;million, which was received in February&nbsp;2006, Mundipharma is paying 50% of the clinical
development costs we are incurring for Fodosine&#153; on existing and planned clinical trials, but their
portion shall not exceed $10&nbsp;million. In addition, Mundipharma will conduct additional clinical
trials at their own cost up to a maximum of $15&nbsp;million. The agreement also provides for future
event payments and royalties to be made by Mundipharma upon the achievement of certain clinical,
regulatory and sales events. In January&nbsp;2007, we initiated our pivotal study with Fodosine&#153; in
T-cell leukemia patients, which triggered a $5&nbsp;million event payment from Mundipharma.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January&nbsp;2007, we announced that HHS had awarded the Company a $102.6&nbsp;million, four-year
contract for the advanced development of peramivir. Funding from the contract will support
manufacturing, process validation, clinical studies and other product approval requirements for
peramivir. The contract is a standard cost plus fixed fee contract, which will have a significant
positive impact on our financial position and cash flow. We will bill our incurred costs to HHS on
a monthly basis. Any significant delays in payment or cancellation of this contract by HHS would
have a significant negative effect on our financial position.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January&nbsp;2007, we announced the initiation of a pivotal Phase IIb clinical trial with
Fodosine&#153; in patients with T-ALL. This trial is being conducted under a SPA negotiated with the
FDA. In addition, we are in active discussions with the FDA to determine what would be required to
initiate a pivotal clinical trial with Fodosine&#153; in CTCL patients later in 2007. With the
initiation of the pivotal Phase IIb clinical trial, we achieved one milestone related to our
collaboration with Mundipharma, which triggered a $5.0&nbsp;million payment. In addition, Mundipharma
will reimburse us for our clinical development costs of Fodosine&#153; up to the $10&nbsp;million defined in
our agreement. In March&nbsp;2007, we announced a collaborative agreement with Shionogi for rights to
peramivir in Japan. This agreement requires an upfront payment of $14&nbsp;million that will be received
in 2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the award of the HHS contract to fund the development of peramivir and the current and
planned trials for Fodosine&#153;, we expect an increase in our research and development expenses for
2007. However, with the expected reimbursement from the HHS contract and our other partners, we are
projecting our net cash burn rate to average approximately $3.0&nbsp;million per month in 2007. We
caution that both our expenses and our cash flows will vary significantly from quarter to quarter
due to the nature of the trials in influenza and the reimbursement from HHS.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As our clinical programs continue to grow and patient enrollment increases, our costs will
increase. Our current and planned clinical trials plus the related manufacturing, personnel
resources and testing required to support the development of our drug candidates will consume
significant capital resources and will increase our expenses. Our expenses, revenues and burn rate
could vary significantly depending on many factors, including our ability to raise additional
capital, the development progress of our collaborative agreements for our drug candidates, the
amount of funding we receive from HHS for peramivir, the amount of funding or assistance, if any,
we receive from other governmental agencies or other new partnerships with third parties for the
development of our drug candidates, the progress and results of our current and proposed clinical
trials for our most advanced drug products, the progress made in the manufacturing of our lead
products and the progression of our other programs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2006, we had $46.2&nbsp;million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable
securities. With our currently available funds and amounts to be received from HHS, Shionogi (and
our other collaborators), we believe these resources will be sufficient to fund our operations for
at least the next twelve months. However, this is a forward looking statement, and there may be
changes that would consume available resources significantly before such time. Our long-term
capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend upon many factors,
including:

be available when needed or on terms acceptable to us. The issuance of preferred or common stock or
convertible securities, with terms and prices significantly more favorable than those of the
currently outstanding common stock, could have the effect of diluting or adversely affecting the

third-parties as part of in-licensing and development programs. Payments under these agreements
generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental, regulatory and/or
commercial milestones. Because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor
reasonably estimable, such contingencies have not been recorded on our balance sheet.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Critical Accounting Policies</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have established various accounting policies that govern the application of accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States, which were utilized in the preparation of our
financial statements. Certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by
management that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities.
Management considers such accounting policies to be critical accounting policies. The judgments and
assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors, which are
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Because of the nature of the judgments and
assumptions made by management, actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates,
which could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results
of operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to our financial
statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006, we
believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully
understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and affect the more significant
judgments and estimates that we use in the preparation of our financial statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Revenue Recognition</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our revenues have generally been limited to license fees, event payments, research and
development fees, and interest income. Revenue is recognized in accordance with SAB No.&nbsp;104 and
EITF Issue 00-21. License fees, future event payments, and research and development fees are
recognized as revenue when the earnings process is complete and we have no further continuing
performance obligations, or we have completed the performance obligations under the terms of the
agreement. Fees received under licensing agreements that are related to future performance are
deferred and recognized as earned over an estimated period determined by management based on the
terms of the agreement and the products licensed. For example, in the Roche and Mundipharma
licenses agreements, we deferred the upfront payments over the remaining life of the patents which
are 2023 and 2017, respectively. We are currently evaluating the deferral period for recognizing
the upfront payment from Shionogi. In the event a license agreement contains multiple deliverables,
we evaluate whether the deliverables are separate or combined units of accounting in accordance
with EITF Issue 00-21. Revisions to revenue or profit estimates as a result of changes in the
estimated revenue period are recognized prospectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Future event payments are recognized as revenue upon the achievement of specified events if
(1)&nbsp;the event is substantive in nature and the achievement of the event was not reasonably assured
at the inception of the agreement and

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">(2)&nbsp;the fees are non-refundable and non-creditable. Any event payments received prior to
satisfying these criteria are recorded as deferred revenue.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the guidance of EITF Issue 99-19 and EITF Issue 01-14, reimbursements received for
direct out-of-pocket expenses related to research and development costs are recorded as revenue in
the income statement rather than as a reduction in expenses. For example, the amounts received from
our collaboration with Mundipharma for the reimbursement of clinical trial costs and the costs
received from HHS for reimbursement will be recorded as revenue in the period the related costs
were recorded. Significant direct costs incurred upon entering into a licensing arrangement, such
as our sublicense fees to AECOM and IRL, are deferred and charged to expense in proportion to the
revenue recognized.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Royalty revenue is recognized based on estimates of royalties earned during the applicable
period and adjusted for differences between the estimated and actual royalties in the following
period. If royalties can not be reasonably estimated, revenue is recognized upon receipt of
royalty statements from the licensee. We have not received any royalties from the sale of licensed
pharmaceutical products.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Research and Development Expenses</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Major components of R&#038;D expenses consist of personnel costs, including salaries and benefits,
manufacturing costs, clinical, regulatory, and toxicology services performed by contract research
organizations (CRO&#146;s), materials and supplies, and overhead allocations consisting of various
administrative and facilities related costs. We charge these costs to expense when incurred,
consistent with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;2, <I>Accounting for Research and
Development Costs</I>. These costs are a significant component of R&#038;D expenses. Most of our
manufacturing and our clinical and preclinical studies are performed by third-party CRO&#146;s. We
accrue costs for studies performed by CRO&#146;s over the service periods specified in the contracts and
adjust our estimates, if required, based upon our on-going review of the level of services actually
performed. We expense both our internal and external research and development costs as incurred.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, we have license agreements with third parties, such as AECOM and IRL that
require maintenance fees or fees related to sublicense agreements. These fees are generally
expensed as incurred unless they are related to revenues that have been deferred in which case the
expenses will be deferred and recognized over the related revenue recognition period.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We group our R&#038;D expenses into two major categories: direct external expenses and all other
R&#038;D expenses. Direct external expenses consist of costs of outside parties to conduct laboratory
studies, to develop manufacturing processes and manufacture the product candidate, to conduct and
manage clinical trials and similar costs related to our clinical and preclinical studies. These
costs are accumulated and tracked by program. All other R&#038;D expenses consist of costs to compensate
personnel, to purchase lab supplies and services, to maintain our facility, equipment and overhead
and similar costs of our research and development efforts. These costs apply to work on our
clinical and preclinical candidates as well as our discovery research efforts. These costs have not
been charged directly to each program historically because the number of product candidates and
projects in research and development may vary from period to period and because we utilize internal
resources across multiple projects at the same time.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following table summarizes our R&#038;D expenses for the periods indicated:

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, due to the risks inherent in the clinical trial process and given the stages of
our various product development programs, we are unable to estimate with any certainty the costs we
will incur in the continued development of our drug candidates for potential commercialization.
While we are currently focused on advancing each of our development programs, our future R&#038;D
expenses will depend on the determinations we make as to the scientific and clinical success of
each drug candidate, as well as ongoing assessments as to each drug candidate&#146;s commercial
potential. As such, we are unable to predict how we will allocate available resources among our
product development programs in the future. In addition, we cannot forecast with any degree of
certainty the development progress of our existing partnerships for our drug candidates, which drug
candidates will be subject to future collaborations, when such arrangements will be secured, if at
all, and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital
requirements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The successful development of our drug candidates is uncertain and subject to a number of
risks. We cannot be certain that any of our drug candidates will prove to be safe and effective or
will meet all of the applicable regulatory requirements needed to receive and maintain marketing
approval. Data from preclinical studies and clinical trials are susceptible to varying
interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory clearance. We, the FDA or other
regulatory authorities may suspend clinical trials at any time if we or they believe that the
subjects participating in such trials are being exposed to unacceptable risks or if such regulatory
agencies find deficiencies in the conduct of the trials or other problems with our products under
development. Delays or rejections may be encountered based on additional governmental regulation,
legislation, administrative action or changes in FDA or other regulatory policy during development
or the review process. Other risks associated with our product development programs are described
in Risk Factors in Part&nbsp;I, Item&nbsp;1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as updated from time to time
in our subsequent periodic reports and current reports filed with the SEC. Due to these
uncertainties, accurate and meaningful estimates of the ultimate cost to bring a product to market,
the timing of completion of any of our product development programs and the period in which
material net cash inflows from any of our product development programs will commence are
unavailable.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the process of preparing financial statements, we are required to estimate accrued
expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with
our applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating
the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not
yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost. The majority of our service providers
invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as
of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to
us. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make
adjustments if necessary. Examples of estimated accrued expenses include:

on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial
milestones. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be
performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the
performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we will adjust the accrual
accordingly. If we do not identify costs that we have begun to incur or if we underestimate or
overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of these services, our actual expenses
could differ from our estimates.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2006, we have two stock-based employee compensation plans, the Stock Incentive
Plan and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Prior to January&nbsp;1, 2006, we accounted for these plans
under the recognition and measurement provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.&nbsp;25,
<I>Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees</I>, and other related Interpretations, as permitted by
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;123, <I>Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation</I>
(&#147;Statement No.&nbsp;123&#148;). No stock-based compensation cost related to our employees was recognized in
the Statements of Operations for any period ending prior to January&nbsp;1, 2006, as all options granted
to our employees had exercise prices equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on
the date of grant. Effective January&nbsp;1, 2006, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;123 (revised 2004), <I>Share-Based Payment </I>(&#147;Statement
No.&nbsp;123R&#148;), using the modified prospective transition method. Compensation cost recognized during
2006 included: (a)&nbsp;compensation cost for all share-based payments granted prior to, but not yet
vested as of December&nbsp;31, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the
original provisions of Statement No.&nbsp;123, and (b)&nbsp;compensation cost for all share-based payments
granted subsequent to January&nbsp;1, 2006, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance
with the provisions of Statement No.&nbsp;123R. Results for prior periods have not been restated.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the fair value recognition provisions of Statement No.&nbsp;123R, stock-based compensation
cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as
expense over the requisite service period of the award. Consistent with the valuation method we
used for disclosure-only purposes under the provisions of Statement No.&nbsp;123, we use the
Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate fair value under Statement No.&nbsp;123R. Determining
the appropriate fair value model and the related assumptions for the model requires judgment,
including estimating the life of an award, the stock price volatility, and the expected term.
Compensation cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.

ABOUT MARKET RISK.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing
the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing our risk. We invest
excess cash principally in U.S. marketable securities from a diversified portfolio of institutions
with strong credit ratings and in U.S. government and agency bills and notes, and by policy, limit
the amount of credit exposure at any one institution. Some of the securities we invest in may have
market risk. This means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount
of the investment to fluctuate. To minimize this risk, we schedule our investments to have
maturities that coincide with our expected cash flow needs, thus avoiding the need to redeem an
investment prior to its maturity date. Accordingly, we believe we have no material exposure to
interest rate risk arising from our investments. Therefore, no quantitative tabular disclosure is
provided.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;), a Delaware corporation, is a biotechnology
company that designs, optimizes, and develops novel drugs that block key enzymes involved in
cancer, cardiovascular diseases, autoimmune diseases, and viral infections. The Company integrates
the necessary disciplines of biology, crystallography, medicinal chemistry, and computer modeling
to effectively use structure-based drug design to discover and develop small molecule
pharmaceuticals. The Company has multiple research projects in different stages of development
from early discovery to a pivotal Phase II trial of the Company&#146;s most advanced drug candidate,
Fodosine&#153;. While the prospects for a project may increase as the project advances to the next stage
of development, a project can be terminated at any stage of development. Until the Company
generates revenues from either a research project or an approved product, the Company&#146;s ability to
continue research projects is dependent upon its ability to raise funds through the sale of equity
securities or through collaborative arrangements with government agencies or third-party partners.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Cash and Cash Equivalents</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company generally considers cash equivalents to be all cash held in money market accounts
or investments in debt instruments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase
in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;95, <I>Statement of Cash Flows</I>
(&#147;Statement No.&nbsp;95&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Marketable Securities</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is required to classify securities as trading, available-for-sale, or
held-to-maturity. The appropriateness of each classification is assessed at the time of purchase
and at each reporting date. At December&nbsp;31, 2006, the Company had $41,818,058 marketable securities
of which $15,276,235 is classified as available-for-sale and $26,541,823 is classified as
held-to-maturity. Securities available-for-sale consisted of U.S. Agency securities carried at
estimated fair values. The estimated fair value of these securities was based on independent quoted
market prices. At December&nbsp;31, 2006, the amortized cost of securities available-for-sale was
$15,243,772. Unrealized gains and losses on securities available-for-sale are recognized in other
comprehensive income. Securities held-to-maturity consisted primarily of U.S. Agency securities
carried at amortized cost. The estimated fair value of securities held-to-maturity at December&nbsp;31,
2006 was $26,459,243 based on independent quoted market prices. While this represents an unrealized
loss position, the loss does not represent an other-than-temporary impairment, as the Company has
the ability and intent to hold the securities until maturity, at which time the cost of the
investments will be recovered. At December&nbsp;31, 2006, all of the non-current portions of marketable
securities mature in 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Included in held-to-maturity securities, is a U.S. Treasury security in the amount of
$132,000. This security is held in escrow for the payment of rent and performance of other
obligations specified in the Company&#146;s lease on the facilities in Birmingham, Alabama. The amount
deposited in escrow decreases $65,000 annually throughout the term of the lease.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Receivables from Collaborations</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company records amounts due from partners for amounts related to up-front payments, event
payments, and research and development fees. These receivables are evaluated to determine if any
reserve or allowance should be established at each reporting date. To date, the Company has not
established a reserve and has never had any default of amounts from partners.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Furniture and Equipment</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furniture
and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line
method with estimated useful lives of five and seven years. Laboratory equipment, office equipment,
leased equipment, and software are depreciated over a life of five years. Furniture and fixtures
are depreciated over a life of seven years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over their
estimated useful lives or the remaining lease term, whichever is less. In accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;144, <I>Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets</I> (&#147;Statement No.&nbsp;144&#148;), the Company periodically
reviews its furniture and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such
assets may not be recoverable. Determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of
undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. In
the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of
the assets, the assets are written down to their estimated fair
values. Furniture and equipment to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying
amount or fair value less cost to sell.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Patents and Licenses</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patents and licenses are recorded at cost and amortized on a straight-line basis over their
estimated useful lives or 20&nbsp;years, whichever is less. The Company periodically reviews its patents
and licenses for impairment in accordance with Statement No.&nbsp;144 to determine any impairment that
needs to be recognized. During each of the last three preceding years, the Company identified
certain patents and licenses that no longer met its strategic objectives, which were determined to
be unrecoverable, and for which the Company had no alternative future uses. Accordingly, the
Company recorded impairment losses for such patents and licenses totaling $14,295, $101,437, and
$8,339 for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. These impairment
losses are included in general and administrative expenses in the statements of operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Accrued Expenses</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company records all expenses in the period incurred. In addition to recording expenses for
invoices received, the Company estimates the cost of services provided by third parties or
materials purchased for which no invoices have been received as of each balance sheet date. Accrued
expenses as of December&nbsp;31, 2006, 2005, and 2004 consisted primarily of development and clinical
trial expenses payable to contract research organizations in connection with the Company&#146;s research
and development programs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Income Taxes</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The liability method is used in accounting for income taxes in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;109, <I>Accounting for Income Taxes </I>(&#147;Statement No.&nbsp;109&#148;). Under
this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between
financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax
rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Comprehensive Income</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accumulated other comprehensive income is comprised of unrealized gains and losses on
securities available-for-sale and is disclosed as a separate component of stockholders&#146; equity. The
Company had $32,463 of unrealized gains on its securities that are included in accumulated other
comprehensive income at December&nbsp;31, 2006.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Revenue Recognition</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s revenues have generally been limited to license fees, event payments, research
and development fees, and interest income. Revenue is recognized in accordance with Staff
Accounting Bulletin No.&nbsp;104, <I>Revenue Recognition </I>(&#147;SAB No.&nbsp;104&#148;) and Emerging Issues Task Force
Issue 00-21, <I>Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables </I>(&#147;EITF Issue 00-21&#148;). License fees,
future event payments, and research and development fees are recognized as revenue when the
earnings process is complete and the Company has no further continuing performance obligations, or
the Company has completed the performance obligations under the terms of the agreement. Fees
received under licensing agreements that are related to future performance are deferred and
recognized over an estimated period determined by management based on the terms of the agreements
and the products licensed. In the event a license agreement contains multiple deliverables, the
Company evaluates whether the deliverables are separate or combined units of accounting in
accordance with EITF Issue 00-21. Revisions to revenue or profit estimates as a result of changes
in the estimated revenue period are recognized prospectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Future event payments are recognized as revenue upon the achievement of specified events if
(1)&nbsp;the event is substantive in nature and the achievement of the event was not reasonably assured
at the inception of the agreement and (2)&nbsp;the fees are non-refundable and non-creditable. Any
event payments received prior to satisfying these criteria are recorded as deferred revenue.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Significant direct costs incurred upon entering into a licensing arrangement are deferred and
charged to expense in proportion to the revenue recognized. Under the guidance of Emerging Issues
Task Force Issue 99-19, <I>Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent </I>(&#147;EITF Issue
99-19&#148;), and Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 01-14, <I>Income Statement Characterization of
Reimbursements Received for &#147;Out-of-Pocket&#148; Expenses </I>(&#147;EITF Issue 01-14&#148;), reimbursements received
for direct out-of-pocket expenses related to research and development costs are recorded as revenue
in the income statement rather than as a reduction in expenses.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Royalty revenue is recognized based on estimates of royalties earned during the applicable
period and adjusted for differences between the estimated and actual royalties in the following
period. If royalties can not be reasonably estimated, revenue is recognized upon receipt of
royalty statements from the licensee. The Company has not received any royalties from the sale of
licensed pharmaceutical products.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Research and Development Expenses</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;2, <I>Accounting for Research
and Development Costs</I>, the Company expenses research and development costs as incurred. Research
and development expenses include, among other items, personnel costs, including salaries and
benefits, manufacturing costs, clinical, regulatory, and toxicology services performed by contract
research organizations (&#147;CRO&#146;s&#148;), materials and supplies, and overhead allocations consisting of
various administrative and facilities related costs. Most of the Company&#146;s manufacturing and
clinical and preclinical studies are performed by third-party CRO&#146;s. Costs for studies performed by
CRO&#146;s are accrued by the Company over the service periods specified in the contracts and estimates
are adjusted, if required, based upon the Company&#146;s on-going review of the level of services
actually performed.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, the Company has license agreements with third parties, such as Albert Einstein
College of Medicine of Yeshiva University (&#147;AECOM&#148;) and Industrial Research, Ltd. (&#147;IRL&#148;) that
require maintenance fees or fees related to sublicense agreements. These fees are generally
expensed as incurred unless they are related to revenues that have been deferred, in which case the
expenses are deferred and recognized over the related revenue recognition period.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Stock-Based Compensation</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&nbsp;2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;123 (revised 2004), <I>Share-Based Payment </I>(&#147;Statement No.&nbsp;123R&#148;),
which revises Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;123, <I>Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation </I>(&#147;Statement No.&nbsp;123&#148;), supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.&nbsp;25,
<I>Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees </I>(&#147;APB No.&nbsp;25&#148;), and amends Statement No.&nbsp;95. Generally,
the approach in Statement No.&nbsp;123R is similar to the approach described in Statement No.&nbsp;123.
However, Statement No.&nbsp;123R requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of
stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. Pro forma
disclosure, allowed by Statement No.&nbsp;123, is no longer an alternative.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March&nbsp;2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#147;SEC&#148;) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin
No.&nbsp;107, <I>Share-Based Payment</I>, which provided further clarification on the implementation of
Statement No.&nbsp;123R. Statement No.&nbsp;123R originally required adoption no later than July&nbsp;1, 2005.
In April&nbsp;2005, the SEC issued a release that delayed the effective date for Statement No.&nbsp;123R
until January&nbsp;1, 2006.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Statement No.&nbsp;123R permits companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods, a
&#147;modified prospective&#148; transition method or a &#147;modified retrospective&#148; transition method. Both
methods are similar, except that the modified retrospective transition method permits entities to
restate, based on the amounts previously recognized under Statement No.&nbsp;123 for purposes of pro
forma disclosures, either (a)&nbsp;all prior periods presented or (b)&nbsp;prior interim periods of the year
of adoption.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2006, the Company had two stock-based employee compensation plans, the Stock
Incentive Plan (&#147;Plan&#148;), which amended and restated the Company&#146;s 1991 Stock Option Plan (&#147;1991
Plan&#148;), and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (&#147;ESPP&#148;). These stock-based compensation plans are
described in more detail below and in Note 7. Prior to January&nbsp;1, 2006, the Company accounted for
those plans under the recognition and measurement provisions of APB No.&nbsp;25 and other related
Interpretations, as permitted by Statement No.&nbsp;123. No stock-based compensation cost related to
the Company&#146;s employees was recognized in the Statements of Operations for any period ending prior
to

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">January&nbsp;1, 2006, as all options granted by the Company had exercise prices equal to the market
value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2005,
stock-based compensation cost of $26,392 was recognized by the Company for options granted to
non-employee consultants. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2004, stock-based compensation cost of
$512,427 was recognized by the Company for options granted to non-employee consultants and due to a
modification of options outstanding to outside Directors. Effective January&nbsp;1, 2006, the Company
adopted the fair value recognition provisions of Statement No.&nbsp;123R, using the modified prospective
transition method. Under that transition method, total compensation cost of $3,338,761 ($3,243,751
of expense related to the Plan and $95,010 of expense related to the ESPP) was recognized during
2006 and includes: (a)&nbsp;compensation cost for all share-based payments granted prior to, but not
yet vested as of December&nbsp;31, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with
the original provisions of Statement No.&nbsp;123, and (b)&nbsp;compensation cost for all share-based
payments granted subsequent to January&nbsp;1, 2006, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in
accordance with the provisions of Statement No.&nbsp;123R. In accordance with the modified prospective
transition method adopted, results for prior periods have not been restated. The following table
illustrates the pro forma effect on net loss and net loss per share had the Company applied the
fair value recognition provisions of Statement No.&nbsp;123R for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2005 and
2004. For purposes of the pro forma disclosure, the value of the options was estimated using a
Black-Scholes option pricing model and amortized to expense over the vesting periods of the options
using a straight-line expense attribution method.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2006, there was approximately $9,386,233 of total unrecognized compensation
cost related to non-vested employee stock option awards granted under the Plan and the ESPP. That
cost is expected to be recognized as follows: $3,562,441 in 2007, $2,716,561 in 2008, $2,194,977
in 2009, and $912,254 in 2010.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Statement 123R also requires that the benefits from tax deductions in excess of recognized
compensation cost should be reported as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash
flow. The Company has never recognized any benefits from such tax deductions, as the Company has
always maintained a loss position.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Net Loss Per Share</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company computes net loss per share in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No.&nbsp;128, <I>Earnings Per Share</I>. Net loss per share is based upon the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per share is equivalent to basic net
loss per share for all periods presented herein because common equivalent shares from unexercised
stock options and common shares expected to be issued under the Company&#146;s employee stock purchase
plan were anti-dilutive.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Use of Estimates</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
amounts reported in the financial statements. Examples include accrued clinical and preclinical
expenses. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company invests its excess cash principally in U.S. marketable securities from a
diversified portfolio of institutions with strong credit ratings and in U.S. government and agency
bills and notes and, by policy, limits the amount of credit exposure at any one institution. These
investments are generally not collateralized and mature within less than three years. The Company
has not realized any losses from such investments. At December&nbsp;31, 2006, $2,445,758 was invested in
the Merrill Lynch Premier Institutional Fund, a money market mutual fund that invests in near cash
securities with weighted average maturities of less than 90&nbsp;days. The Merrill Lynch Premier
Institutional Fund is not insured.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s raw materials, drug substances, and drug products are manufactured by a limited
group of suppliers and some at a single facility. If any of these suppliers were unable to produce
these items, this could significantly impact the Company&#146;s supply of drugs for further preclinical
testing and clinical trials.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rent expense for operating leases was $566,524, $560,322, and $583,969 in 2006, 2005, and
2004, respectively. The commitment for operating leases is primarily related to building leases in
Birmingham, Alabama and Cary, North Carolina. The lease for the building in Birmingham, Alabama
expires in June&nbsp;2010. This lease, as amended effective December&nbsp;1, 2005 for a reduction in occupied
space, currently requires monthly rents of $37,963 in December&nbsp;2006 and escalates annually to a
minimum of $41,481 per month in the final year. The Company has an option to renew the Birmingham,
Alabama lease for an additional five years at the current market rate on the date of termination
and a one-time option to terminate the lease on June&nbsp;30, 2008, subject to a reasonable termination
fee. The lease for the building in Cary, North Carolina expires in July&nbsp;2009. This lease, as
amended effective October&nbsp;1, 2006 for an increase in occupied space, requires monthly rents of
$4,500 beginning in October&nbsp;2006 and escalates annually to a minimum of $4,774 per month in the
final year. The lease was subsequently amended in February&nbsp;2007 for an additional 2,000 square
feet requiring monthly rents of $7,391 beginning in March&nbsp;2007 and ending in February&nbsp;2010. The
Company has an option to twice renew the Cary, North Carolina lease for an additional three years
at the current market rate prior to lease termination.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On August&nbsp;5, 2002, at the request of the compensation committee, the Company&#146;s Board of
Directors approved a reduction in salary of 25% for Dr.&nbsp;Charles E. Bugg, Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer and Dr.&nbsp;J. Claude Bennett, President, Chief Operating Officer and Medical
Director, effective August&nbsp;1, 2002. In the event of any change of control of the Company, any
cumulative salary reductions up to the date of the change of control would become due and payable.
The monthly amount of the reduction was $14,677 combined. On December&nbsp;8, 2003, the Board of
Directors approved the recommendation of the compensation committee to restore their salaries to
their previous amounts effective January&nbsp;1, 2004, leaving the cumulative reduction of $249,509
outstanding in the event of a change in control.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2006, the Company has an unused letter of credit of $1.8&nbsp;million. This
letter of credit was originally obtained for a customs bond that was required in order to import
certain compound into the country that was manufactured abroad. The Company does not anticipate
drawing any funds against this letter of credit in the future, but it could remain in force for up
to one year or until customs closes the file on the particular receipt of goods for which the bond
was required.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the majority of the deferred tax assets relate to net operating loss (&#147;NOL&#148;)
carryforwards that can only be realized if the Company is profitable in future periods and because
the Company has never been profitable in the past, it is uncertain whether the Company will realize
any tax benefit related to the NOL carryforwards. Accordingly, the Company has provided a
valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets due to uncertainties as to their ultimate
realization. The valuation allowance will remain at the full amount of the deferred tax asset until
it is more likely than not that the related tax benefits will be realized.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use of the carryforward tax benefits will be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to
the change of ownership provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. The annual limitation is expected
to result in the expiration of a portion of the carryforward tax benefits before utilization. The
ownership change which occurred in 1996 has been considered by the Company in its computations
under Statement No.&nbsp;109. Due to recent stock issuances, it is possible that additional limitations
could currently apply. The Company has not performed a detailed analysis to determine if an
additional ownership change has occurred under the tax code or to determine its impact on its
ability to use these net operating loss and research credit carryforwards. However, it is not
anticipated that any such analysis would have a material impact on the balance sheet as a result of
offsetting changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February&nbsp;4, 2004, the Company entered into a Placement Agency Agreement with Leerink Swann
&#038; Company in connection with a registered direct offering of 3,571,667 shares of its common stock
at an offering price of $6.00 per share. The common stock was issued pursuant to a prospectus
supplement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule&nbsp;424(b)(2) of the
Securities Act in connection with a shelf takedown from the Company&#146;s registration statement on
Form S-3 (333-111226), filed on December&nbsp;16, 2003 and which became effective on January&nbsp;5, 2004.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February&nbsp;17, 2004, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Caduceus
Private Investments II, LP, Caduceus Private Investments II (QP), LP and UBS Juniper Crossover
Fund, L.L.C. As part of this agreement, the Company granted these investors the right to appoint a
member to its board of directors effective as of the closing of the offering. On February&nbsp;18,
2004, the Company completed a $21.4&nbsp;million registered direct offering of 3,571,667 shares of its
common stock to a group of institutional investors.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June&nbsp;2002, the Board of Directors adopted a stockholder rights plan and, pursuant thereto,
issued preferred stock purchase rights (&#147;Rights&#148;) to the holders of the Company&#146;s common stock.
The Rights have certain anti-takeover effects. If triggered, the Rights would cause substantial
dilution to a person or group of persons who acquires more than 15% (19.9% for William W.
Featheringill, a Director who owned approximately 9.58% at December&nbsp;31, 2006, but owned more than
15% at the time the Rights were put in place) of the Company&#146;s common stock on terms not approved
by the Board of Directors. The rights are not exercisable until the distribution date, as defined
in the Rights Agreement by and between the Company and American Stock Transfer &#038; Trust Company, as
Rights Agent. The Rights will expire at the close of business on June&nbsp;24, 2012, unless that final
expiration date is extended or unless the rights are earlier redeemed or exchanged by the Company.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company one one-thousandth of a
share of Series&nbsp;B Junior Participating Preferred Stock (&#147;Series&nbsp;B&#148;), par value $0.001 per share, at
a purchase price of $26.00, subject to adjustment. Shares of Series&nbsp;B purchasable upon exercise of
the Rights will not be redeemable. Each share of Series&nbsp;B will be entitled to a dividend of 1,000
times the dividend declared per share of common stock. In the event of liquidation, each share of
Series&nbsp;B will be entitled to a payment of 1,000 times the payment made per share of common stock.
Each share of Series&nbsp;B will have 1,000 votes, voting together with the common stock. Finally, in
the event of any merger, consolidation, or other transaction in which shares of common stock are
exchanged, each share of Series&nbsp;B will be entitled to receive 1,000 times the amount received per
share of common stock. Effective in December&nbsp;2005, we increased the authorized shares available
under these rights to 45,000 to match the authorized common shares of 45,000,000. In addition, our
Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to 4,955,000 shares of undesignated preferred
stock and to determine the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of those shares without
further vote or action by our stockholders.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November&nbsp;1991, the Board of Directors adopted the 1991 Stock Option Plan (&#147;1991 Plan&#148;) for
key employees and consultants of the Company and reserved 500,000 shares of common stock for
issuance. The 1991 Plan was approved by the stockholders in December&nbsp;1991. The original term for
options granted under the 1991 Plan was for ten years and included provisions for issuance of both
incentive stock options and non-statutory options. The exercise price of the options granted under
the 1991 Plan is not to be less than the fair market value of common stock on the grant date.
Options granted under the 1991 Plan generally vest 25% after one year and monthly thereafter on a
pro rata basis over the next three years until fully vested after four years and expire ten years
after the grant date. Options are generally granted to all full-time employees. The vesting and
exercise provisions of options granted under the Plan are subject to acceleration in the event of
certain stockholder-approved transactions, or upon the occurrence of a Change in Control as defined
by the Plan.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1991 Plan was amended and restated in February&nbsp;1993 to effect the following changes: (i)
divide the 1991 Plan into two separate incentive programs: the Discretionary Option Grant Program
and the Automatic Option Grant Program (for outside Directors), (ii)&nbsp;increase the number of shares
of the Company&#146;s common stock available for issuance by 500,000 shares and (iii)&nbsp;expand the level
of benefits available. The Board amended the 1991 Plan in December&nbsp;1993 to increase the number of
shares issuable by 500,000 shares and subsequently amended and restated the 1991 Plan in its
entirety in February&nbsp;1994. In March&nbsp;1995, the Board authorized another 500,000 shares for issuance
under the 1991 Plan. The 1991 Plan was subsequently amended and restated in March&nbsp;1997, which
increased the number of shares issuable by 1,000,000 shares. The 1991 Plan (as so amended and
restated) was further amended in March&nbsp;1999 to increase the share reserve by 400,000 shares. The
Board amended and restated the 1991 Plan in its

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">entirety in March&nbsp;2000, increasing the reserved shares by 1,200,000 and extending the term of
the 1991 Plan for ten years from the date of the amendment. This restatement was approved by the
Company&#146;s stockholders in May&nbsp;2000. The 1991 Plan was amended in March&nbsp;2004 to increase the number
of shares reserved for issuance by 1,000,000 and to amend the automatic option grant program
related to initial grants, vesting, and option terms. The automatic option grant program grants
options to purchase 10,000 shares to new non-employee Board members, prorated from their initial
appointment to the next Annual Meeting, and an additional 10,000 shares annually over such period
of continued service (all of which vest one-twelfth per month). Directors receiving options under
the automatic option grant program will have the full term of the original option to exercise all
options vested at the time of their cessation from service. This amendment was approved by the
Company&#146;s stockholders in May&nbsp;2004.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most recently, the 1991 Plan was amended and restated by the Company&#146;s Stock Incentive Plan
(&#147;Plan&#148;), which increased the number of shares reserved for issuance by 1,500,000 shares; increased
the amounts of the initial automatic option grants to non-employee Board members from 10,000 shares
to 20,000 shares; increased the amounts of the annual automatic option grants to non-employee Board
members from 10,000 shares to 15,000 shares; and allow the Company to make discretionary stock
issuances. The Plan was subsequently approved by the Company&#146;s stockholders in May&nbsp;2006.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For option awards granted under the Plan during 2006, 2005, and 2004, the fair value of the
award was estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model and the
assumptions noted in the table below. The weighted average grant date fair value of the options
granted under the Plan during 2006, 2005, and 2004 was $8.64, $3.48, and $6.83, respectively. The
fair value expense of options granted is amortized to expense over the vesting periods of the
options using a straight-line expense attribution method.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following explanations describe the assumptions used by the Company to value the options
granted during 2006. The expected life is based on the average of the assumption that all
outstanding options will be exercised at full vesting and the assumption that all outstanding
options will be exercised at the midpoint of the valuation date and the full contractual term. The
expected volatility represents an average of the implied volatility on the Company&#146;s publicly
traded options, the volatility over the most recent period corresponding with the expected life,
and the Company&#146;s long-term reversion volatility. The Company has assumed no expected dividend
yield, as dividends have never been paid to stock or option holders and will not be for the
foreseeable future. The weighted average risk-free interest rate is the implied yield currently
available on zero-coupon government issues with a remaining term equal to the expected term.

Corporation, an option in 1990 to acquire exclusive licenses to a class of inhibitors arising from
research performed by the Company by February&nbsp;1991. The option was exercised and a $500,000 fee was
paid to the Company in 1993. Milestone payments are due upon approval of a new drug application.
The Company will also receive royalties based upon a percentage of sales of any resultant products.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Note 10 &#150; Subsequent Events</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January&nbsp;2007, the Company announced that it had been awarded a four-year contract from the
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (&#147;HHS&#148;) to develop its influenza neuraminidase
inhibitor, peramivir, for the treatment of seasonal and life-threatening influenza, including avian
flu. The contract commits $102.6&nbsp;million to support the full development of both intravenous and
intramuscular formulations of peramivir. In addition, the contract also funds the validation of
U.S. based manufacturing facilities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contract with HHS is defined as a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract. That is, the Company is
entitled to receive reimbursement for all costs incurred in accordance with the contract provisions
that are related to the development of peramivir plus a fixed fee, or profit. The contract is
effective January&nbsp;3, 2007. As of December&nbsp;31, 2006, the Company had incurred approximately $2.3
million of pre-contract costs directly related to the Phase 2 trials for both the intravenous and
intramuscular peramivir products. These costs were incurred in anticipation of a contract award
from HHS and were required to meet the delivery schedule of the proposed contract. In accordance
with the provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulation&nbsp;31.205-32, the costs were included in the
Company&#146;s request for proposal and are
eligible for reimbursement from HHS. The $2.3&nbsp;million of costs incurred prior to the contract
award date were deferred and are included in other current assets on the Company&#146;s balance sheet at
December&nbsp;31, 2006. In the first quarter of 2007, the $2.3&nbsp;million in costs will be billed and
expensed. Concurrently, revenue will be recognized for these costs plus the applicable fixed fee.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March&nbsp;2007, the Company entered into an exclusive license agreement with Shionogi &#038; Co.,
Ltd. (&#147;Shionogi&#148;) to develop and commercialize the Company&#146;s lead influenza neuraminidase
inhibitor, peramivir, in Japan for the treatment of seasonal and potentially life-threatening human
influenza. Under the terms of the agreement, Shionogi obtained rights to injectable formulations of
peramivir in Japan in exchange for a $14&nbsp;million up-front payment. The license provides for future
event payments for achieving specified development, regulatory and commercial events (including
certain sales level amounts following a product&#146;s launch) for certain indications. In addition, the
Company will receive royalties based on a percentage of net product sales. Generally, all payments
under the agreement are nonrefundable and non-creditable, but they are subject to audit. The
Company developed peramivir under a license from UAB and will owe sublicense payments to them on
the upfront payment and any future event payments and/or royalties received by the Company from
Shionogi. The Company retains all rights to commercialize peramivir in North America, Europe, and
other countries outside of Korea and Japan.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Note 11 &#150; Recent Accounting Pronouncements</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September&nbsp;2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;157, <I>Fair
Value Measurements </I>(&#147;Statement No.&nbsp;157&#148;). The standard provides enhanced guidance for using fair
value to measure assets and liabilities and also responds to investors&#146; requests for expanded
information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value, the
information used to measure fair value, and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings.
While the standard applies whenever other standards require (or permit) assets or liabilities to be
measured at fair value, it does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances.
Statement No.&nbsp;157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
November&nbsp;15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Management of the Company is
evaluating the impact of this standard, but does not anticipate that it will have a significant
impact on its financial statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July&nbsp;2006, the FASB issued Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No.&nbsp;48,
<I>Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No.&nbsp;109, Accounting
for Income Taxes </I>(&#147;FIN No.&nbsp;48&#148;). This interpretation creates a single model to address uncertainty
in tax positions. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum
recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial
statements. The interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition, measurement,
classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition.
FIN 48 is effective for years beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2006. Management of the Company is
evaluating the impact of this pronouncement, but does not anticipate that it will have a
significant impact on its financial statements.

to express an opinion on management&#146;s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to

maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating management&#146;s assessment, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1)&nbsp;pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)&nbsp;provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the company; and (3)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#146;s assets that could have
a material effect on the financial statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our opinion, management&#146;s assessment that BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2006, is fairly stated, in

subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

undertaken an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as
of December&nbsp;31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#151; Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO
Framework). Management&#146;s assessment included an evaluation of the design of our internal control
over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of those controls.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on this assessment, management has concluded that as of December&nbsp;31, 2006, our internal
control over financial reporting was effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting

terms. In accordance with our By-Laws, a director elected to fill a vacancy shall be elected for
the unexpired term of his predecessor in office, and a director chosen to fill a position resulting
from an increase in the number of directors shall hold office until the annual meeting of
stockholders of the Corporation at which term of the class of directors for which he has been
chosen expires. Dr.&nbsp;Bugg&#146;s, Dr.&nbsp;Gordon&#146;s, Mr.&nbsp;Higgins&#146;s, and Dr.&nbsp;Seidenberg&#146;s terms expire at the

their successors or to their earlier death, resignation or removal). At each annual stockholder
meeting, the successors to the directors whose terms expire are elected to serve from the time of
their election and qualification until the third annual meeting of stockholders following their
election and until a successor has been duly elected and qualified. The provisions of our
Certificate of Incorporation governing the staggered director election procedure can be amended
only by a shareholder&#146;s vote of at least 75% of the eligible voting securities. There are no family
