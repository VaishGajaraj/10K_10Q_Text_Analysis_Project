<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Overview</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a biotechnology company that designs, optimizes and develops
novel drugs that block key enzymes involved in cancer, viral infections and autoimmune diseases.
BioCryst integrates the disciplines of biology, crystallography, medicinal chemistry and computer
modeling to discover and develop small molecule pharmaceuticals through the process known as
structure-based drug design.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our business strategy is to maximize sustainable value by moving our product candidate
portfolio through clinical development, registration and ultimately to the market. We believe this
is best achieved by retaining full product rights to our product candidates within specialty
markets, while relying on collaborative agreements with third parties for product candidates within
larger markets or outside our areas of expertise.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of our most advanced product candidates is peramivir, an inhibitor of influenza
neuraminidase. In May&nbsp;2009, we announced preliminary results from the Phase II study of
intramuscular (&#147;i.m.&#148;) peramivir for the treatment of seasonal influenza. This Phase II study was a
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in influenza seasons in the Southern
Hemisphere (Australia, New Zealand and South Africa) in 2008 and the Northern Hemisphere (United
States) in 2008 to 2009. While the study demonstrated a numerical trend in its primary endpoint of
improvement in the median time to alleviation of symptoms (&#147;TTAS&#148;) in subjects with confirmed,
acute, uncomplicated influenza infection versus placebo, the difference between the two study
groups was not statistically significant.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not planning additional development of i.m. peramivir at this time; instead, our
current efforts are focused on development of the i.v. formulation.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September&nbsp;2009 we announced the initiation of two Phase III clinical trials of i.v.
peramivir for the treatment of hospitalized patients with serious influenza. The combined
enrollment target for these studies is approximately 700 patients, and approximately 300 study
locations are targeted to participate in these studies globally. These studies are intended to
support U.S. regulatory approval of i.v. peramivir as a treatment for influenza.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the XI International Symposium on Respiratory Viral Infections in Bangkok, Thailand in
February&nbsp;2009, we presented the full data set from our Phase II clinical trial in hospitalized
patients with acute influenza using an i.v. formulation of peramivir to compare the efficacy and
safety of i.v. peramivir to orally administered oseltamivir. In October&nbsp;2008 we reported results of
an exploratory Phase II trial of i.v. peramivir in subjects hospitalized for acute serious or
potentially life-threatening influenza.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January&nbsp;2007, the United States Department of Health and Human Services (&#147;HHS&#148;), awarded us
a $102.6&nbsp;million, four-year contract for the advanced development of peramivir. In September&nbsp;2009,
we received an award of $77.2&nbsp;million toward completion of the Phase III development of i.v.
peramivir pursuant to a contract modification with HHS. This additional funding brings the total
award from HHS for the development of peramivir to

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">$179.9
million and extends the contract term by 12&nbsp;months to five years. Any funding above the
$179.9&nbsp;million may be our responsibility.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September&nbsp;2009, we received a request for proposal (&#147;RFP&#148;) from HHS for the supply of i.v.
peramivir for the treatment of critically ill influenza patients under an Emergency Use
Authorization (&#147;EUA&#148;). On November&nbsp;4, 2009 we received an initial order for 10,000 courses of i.v.
peramivir (600 mg once-daily for five days) for an aggregate purchase price of $22.5&nbsp;million. We
shipped the entire order from existing i.v. peramivir inventory to HHS on November&nbsp;4, 2009. Under
the Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract issued to us on November&nbsp;3, 2009, HHS may
place additional orders for peramivir up to a total of 40,000 courses at the same unit price as the
first order. We are also required to maintain the ability to manufacture additional treatment
courses dependent on the volume and size of anti-viral orders received from HHS. In addition,
separate from the RFP process, we have donated and transferred to HHS an initial supply sufficient
for 1,200 courses of i.v. peramivir 600 mg once-daily for five days.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minimum and maximum quantities of i.v. peramivir that may be ordered by HHS under the RFP
are 1,000 and 40,000 treatment courses. We also are required to maintain the ability to manufacture
additional courses for treatment or prophylaxis, dependent on the volume and size of orders
received from HHS. Based on the RFP, we initiated manufacture of approximately 130,000 courses of
i.v. peramivir at a cost of approximately $10&nbsp;million, so that we would have additional inventory
available in advance of potential orders.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October&nbsp;2009, the FDA, in response to a request from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, issued an EUA permitting the use of i.v. peramivir in hospitalized adult and
pediatric patients with confirmed or suspected 2009 H1N1 influenza infection who have not responded
to oral or inhaled antivirals or in whom oral or inhaled antiviral therapy is not feasible, and in
adult patients for whom therapy with an i.v. drug is judged clinically appropriate due to other
circumstances.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March&nbsp;2007, we entered into a collaboration with Shionogi &#038; Co., Ltd. (&#147;Shionogi&#148;) for the
development and commercialization of peramivir in Japan. This exclusive license agreement for Japan
included an upfront payment of $14&nbsp;million and future clinical event milestone payments of up to
$21&nbsp;million. In October&nbsp;2008, the Company and Shionogi amended the license agreement to expand the
territory in the agreement to include Taiwan and to provide rights for Shionogi to perform a Phase
III clinical trial in Hong Kong.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shionogi previously completed a Phase II study of i.v. peramivir administered via a single
dose infusion in the outpatient setting for treatment of seasonal influenza. Shionogi presented the
data at the 2008 Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy (&#147;ICAAC&#148;) /
Infectious Diseases Society of America (&#147;IDSA&#148;) annual meeting in Washington, D.C.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July&nbsp;2009, Shionogi announced positive results in two Phase III clinical trials of i.v.
peramivir. The studies were sponsored by Shionogi and conducted in Japan, Taiwan and South Korea
during the 2008-2009 influenza season. Shionogi and Green Cross Corporation (&#147;Green Cross&#148;), the
license holder of peramivir in Korea pursuant to a June&nbsp;2006 license agreement with us,
co-conducted the portion of the studies in Korea. Doses of i.v. peramivir of 300 mg and 600 mg,
administered in single and multiple doses were found to be generally safe and well-tolerated in
these trials. Shionogi presented the data at the 2009 ICAAC / IDSA annual meeting in San Francisco,
California. Shionogi filed an NDA in Japan for i.v. peramivir in 2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January&nbsp;2010, Shionogi received marketing and manufacturing approval for i.v. peramivir in
Japan. The filing of this application triggered a $7.0&nbsp;million milestone payment to us under our
current license agreement, and we received a third and final regulatory milestone payment of $7.0
million in January&nbsp;2010 as a result of the application&#146;s approval. We may receive future commercial
event milestone payments of up to $95&nbsp;million from Shionogi. Shionogi has commercially launched
peramivir under the commercial name RAPIACTA in Japan. Shionogi has received the indications of
single dose administration of 300 mg i.v. peramivir for adult uncomplicated seasonal influenza
infection, as well as single and multiple dose administration of 600 mg i.v. peramivir for the
patients at high-risk for complications associated with influenza. Shionogi is authorized to supply
peramivir as either a 300 mg i.v. bag or a 150 mg vial for i.v. drip infusion. Shionogi
has completed clinical studies for pediatric patients and has filed an additional application for
pediatric use of RAPIACTA in Japan.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, in January&nbsp;2010, we announced that Green Cross filed a New Drug Application in
South Korea in January&nbsp;2010 to seek regulatory approval for i.v. peramivir to treat patients with
influenza.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to Shionogi and Green Cross, we have entered into several agreements with
companies outside the U.S. to represent us and peramivir primarily for stockpiling opportunities.
For example, on December&nbsp;23, 2009, we entered into an agreement with Merck Serono, S.A., through
its affiliate, Ares Trading S.A., to exclusively represent us and peramivir for stockpiling
opportunities in Europe, Russia, Canada and Singapore. Also in December&nbsp;2009, we entered into an
agreement with Hikma Pharmaceuticals, PLC to represent us and peramivir for stockpiling
opportunities in the Middle East and North Africa, excluding Israel. In January, 2010 we entered
into an agreement with moksha8 Pharmaceuticals, Inc. to exclusively represent us and peramivir for
influenza stockpiling opportunities in Brazil and Mexico.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, we have a binding letter of intent with NT Pharma, Co., Ltd. to exclusively
represent us and peramivir for influenza stockpiling opportunities in China. We also have a
binding letter of intent with Neopharm Scientific, Ltd. to exclusively represent us and peramivir
for influenza stockpiling opportunities in Israel.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another one of our most advanced drug candidates, forodesine, is a transition-state analog
inhibitor of the enzyme purine nucleoside phosphorylase (&#147;PNP&#148;). Forodesine has been granted Orphan
Drug status by the FDA for three indications: T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, including Cutaneous
T-cell Lymphoma (&#147;CTCL&#148;); Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (&#147;CLL&#148;) and related leukemias including
T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, adult T-cell leukemia, and hairy cell leukemia; and for treatment
of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (&#147;B-ALL&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An oral formulation of the compound is currently under a pivotal trial for patients with CTCL.
The trial is being conducted under a special protocol assessment (&#147;SPA&#148;) negotiated with the United
States Food and Drug Administration (&#147;FDA&#148;) and, if successful, will serve as a basis for a new
drug application (&#147;NDA&#148;) to the FDA using the oral formulation in patients with relapsed CTCL. In
January&nbsp;2010, we announced that we had achieved our protocol-specified objective of enrolling 100
late-stage patients (Stage IIB to IVA) in this pivotal study. We expect to report top-line data
from this study in the second half of 2010.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long-term data from our Phase II study of forodesine in patients with CTCL was presented at
the 45th Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. This poster presentation
reviewed the safety and efficacy of forodesine for CTCL patients of stage Ib to stage IV who have
failed standard therapies and received forodesine treatment for greater than 12&nbsp;months.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, our exploratory Phase II study for forodesine in subjects with CLL is continuing
to progress and has enrolled over half of its targeted number of patients. In December
2008, we announced interim data from the study in patients with CLL and data from a healthy subject
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study. Subsequently, we amended the Phase II study to increase
the dose of forodesine to 200mg twice daily and enrollment is ongoing. We expect to report
top-line results from this study in the second half 2010.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&nbsp;2007, we presented data related to the Phase I/II clinical study of forodesine in
subjects with refractory CTCL and a poster detailing the in vitro activity of forodesine as a
single agent and the synergistic in vitro activity of forodesine in combination with bendamustine
in primary cells from 29 patients with CLL. These data were presented at the 2007 American Society
of Hematology meeting.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since February&nbsp;2006, we have had an exclusive licensing agreement with Mundipharma
International Holdings Limited (&#147;Mundipharma&#148;) to develop and commercialize forodesine in markets
across the European Union (&#147;EU&#148;), Asia and Australia for use in oncology. We have retained full
development and commercialization rights to forodesine in the rest of the world, including North
America.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our other drug candidate in clinical trials is our second generation PNP inhibitor, BCX-4208.
In November&nbsp;2005, we entered into an exclusive worldwide development and commercialization
agreement with Roche. In 2007 Roche initiated a Phase II clinical trial with oral doses of
BCX-4208/R3421, which was designed to evaluate the drug candidate in patients with moderate to
severe plaque psoriasis. The assessment of the study endpoints has been completed. Consistent with
interim findings we reported in May&nbsp;2008, the Phase II clinical study of BCX-4208, a potent,
rationally designed, orally available PNP inhibitor, met its primary objectives of safety and
tolerability. In addition, BCX-4208 displayed dose-dependent reductions in peripheral blood
lymphocyte counts, including subsets measuring B cells (CD20), total T cells (CD3), T helper cells
(CD4) and T suppressor/cytotoxic cells (CD8).

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Further, plasma levels of BCX-4208 increased with dose, and plasma uric acid levels showed
dose-related reductions with BCX-4208. In addition, consistent with interim results we previously
reported, no evidence of clinical efficacy, a secondary objective, was observed in psoriasis
patients with doses and duration of administration tested. The dosing period was six weeks with
the two lowest doses tested in our single and multiple ascending dose trials.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Phase IIa trial, BCX-4208 was generally safe and well-tolerated at doses up to 120 mg
daily. Most adverse events reported were considered mild or moderate, and low in frequency. No
opportunistic infections were observed. In addition, detailed laboratory and clinical monitoring
did not indicate any patterns suggestive of off-target adverse findings.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also in May&nbsp;2008, we received notice that Roche was exercising the &#147;no cause&#148; termination
right under the license agreement for BCX-4208. As a result, we regained worldwide rights to
BCX-4208.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We recently initiated a clinical study of BCX-4208 for the treatment of gout, which is caused
by elevated levels of uric acid in blood. We believe that BCX-4208 is a good candidate to control
gout because data from a prior Phase II clinical trial of BCX-4208 for psoriasis indicated a dose
related to reduction in uric acid that was sustained for the duration of drug exposure. Our gout
clinical trial is a Phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the
efficacy and safety of BCX-4208 in subjects with gout. The trial contains two parts: Part&nbsp;1 will
study multiple doses of BCX-4208 against a placebo and Part&nbsp;2 will study dose escalation. The
trial&#146;s primary objective is to determine the effect of different doses of orally administered
BCX-4208 on serum uric acid levels in patients with gout. The trial is expected to enroll up to 120
subjects and we expect to have initial data from Part&nbsp;1 in mid-2010.

by which we design a drug candidate through detailed analysis of the enzyme target, which the
drug candidate must inhibit in order to stop the progression of the disease or disorder. We
believe that structure-based drug design is a powerful tool for efficient development of
small-molecule drug candidates that have the potential to be safe, effective and relatively
inexpensive to manufacture. Our structure-based drug design technologies typically allow us to
design and synthesize multiple drug candidates that inhibit the same enzyme target. We believe
this strategy can lead to broad patent protection and enhance the competitive advantages of
our compounds.</TD>

a number of therapeutic areas. These compounds are currently in pre-clinical development and

additional PNP inhibitors. We will continue to evaluate and test these compounds to determine
which should be taken forward into clinical testing.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>T-cell Related Diseases</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Overview</I>. The human immune system employs specialized cells, including T-cells, to control
infection by recognizing and attacking disease-causing viruses, bacteria and parasites. T-cells are
an essential part of the body&#146;s immune system that serve a dual purpose to both orchestrate and
participate in the body&#146;s immune response. For the most part, this system works flawlessly to
protect the body. However, when T-cells multiply uncontrollably, T-cell proliferative diseases,
such as T-cell cancers, can occur.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The link between T-cell proliferation and the purine nucleoside phosphorylase, or PNP, enzyme
was first discovered approximately twenty-five years ago when a patient, who was genetically
deficient in PNP, exhibited limited T-cell activity, but reasonably normal activity of other immune
functions. In other patients lacking PNP activity, the T-cell population was selectively depleted;
however, B-cell function tended to be normal. Based on these findings and the results of cell
culture studies, inhibiting PNP appears to produce primarily suppression of T-cells without
significantly impairing the function of other non-lymphoid cells.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia</I>. Acute lymphocytic leukemia (&#147;ALL&#148;) is a type of blood cancer.
Other names for ALL are acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute lymphoid leukemia. ALL is the most
common form of leukemia in children. ALL results from an acquired injury to the DNA of a single
cell in the bone marrow.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>T-cell Lymphoma</I>. Lymphoma is a general term for a group of cancers that originate in the
lymphatic system. T-cell lymphoma results when a T-lymphocyte (a type of white blood cell)
undergoes a malignant change and begins to multiply, eventually crowding out healthy cells and
creating tumors, which enlarge the lymph nodes and invade other sites in the body. CTCL is a
primary skin neoplasm and accounts for nearly 50% of all T-cell malignancies.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>T-cell Mediated Autoimmune Diseases. </I>There are more than 80 clinically distinct autoimmune
diseases such as psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and Crohn&#146;s disease, which
appear to have activated T-cells as a major part of their pathogenesis. These diseases occur when
the immune system attacks the body&#146;s own cells rather than invading microorganisms. Therefore,
inhibition and/or elimination of activated T-cells could have a beneficial effect on these
diseases.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Transplant Rejection. </I>The greatest threat to transplant patients is rejection of the
transplanted organ by the body&#146;s own immune system. For this reason, transplant recipients must
take drugs to suppress the immune response and prevent rejection usually for the rest of their
lives. A regimen combining several drugs is usually given and this treatment has to be continued
indefinitely. For kidney transplant recipients, rejection of the new kidney by the patient&#146;s immune
system can lead to loss of the transplanted organ and a return to dialysis. For heart, lung and
liver transplant patients, loss of the transplanted organ presents an immediate threat to life.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>B-cell Related Cancers</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Overview</I>. There are two types of lymphocytes in the broadest sense &#151; T-cells and B-cells.
Although PNP inhibitors were developed specifically to block the T-cells, recent work indicates
that the same biochemical event &#151; the intracellular accumulation of deoxyguanosine triphosphate
(&#147;dGTP&#148;) also occurs in malignant B-cells. Furthermore, work of Dr.&nbsp;Varsha Gandhi at MD Anderson
Cancer Center has shown that PNP inhibitors, when acting <I>in vitro </I>on B-cells from patients with CLL
induce accumulation of dGTP with resultant apoptosis (cell death).

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These studies open the possibility of treating CLL, B-ALL and B-cell non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
(&#147;NHL&#148;) with forodesine. Importantly, B-cell malignancies are considerably more prevalent than are
the T-cell leukemias and lymphomas.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>PNP Inhibition</I>. PNP is an enzyme that plays an important role in T-cell proliferation, because
it is necessary to maintain normal DNA synthesis in human T-cells. Selective inhibition of PNP
causes certain nucleosides, including deoxyguanosine, to accumulate. As the concentration of
deoxyguanosine increases within T-cells, it is converted by specific enzymes to dGTP. A high
concentration of dGTP in T-cells causes an imbalance in the intra-cellular trinucleotide pool and
thus causes cell death.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June&nbsp;2000, we licensed a series of potent PNP inhibitors from AECOM and IRL. The lead drug
candidate from this collaboration, forodesine, is a more potent inhibitor of human lymphocyte
proliferation than other previously known PNP inhibitors. Clinical data in our past and ongoing
clinical trials, plus extensive preclinical studies indicate that forodesine can modulate T-cell
activities. Forodesine is an investigational PNP inhibitor for the potential treatment of T-cell
leukemias and T and B cell lymphomas. In February&nbsp;2006, we licensed forodesine to Mundipharma to
develop and commercialize in markets across Europe, Asia and Australia for use in oncology.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2002, we exercised the option to add a new compound, BCX-4208, to the series of
inhibitors of PNP licensed from AECOM and IRL. Preclinical results indicated that BCX-4208 was a
more potent inhibitor than forodesine. We completed a Phase I single ascending dose clinical trial
and a Phase Ib multi-dose clinical trial, both in healthy volunteers. In November&nbsp;2005, we licensed
BCX-4208 to Roche for the world wide development and commercialization in autoimmune diseases and
transplant rejection. We announced termination of the Roche license in 2008 and have regained world
wide rights to BCX-4208.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first clinical trial with an intravenous formulation of forodesine, which began in 2002,
was a Phase I clinical trial that enrolled T-ALL patients at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in
Houston, Texas. Simultaneously, there were preclinical studies being conducted at the M.D. Anderson
Cancer Center which indicated that forodesine induces the same biochemical changes in various other
types of leukemia cells that are responsible for the inhibition of T-leukemia cells. The results of
these preclinical studies led us to expand beyond the single starting trial in T-ALL by initiating
additional clinical trials for refractory patients with B-ALL, CTCL, CLL, and other hematologic
malignancies. Based on the encouraging results of these initial studies, we are working with our
partner, Mundipharma, to develop a strategy for the simultaneous development of forodesine in
multiple indications and in potential combination therapies.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Forodesine Clinical Development</I>. Following the completion of a Phase I/II clinical trial in
patients with refractory CTCL, in October&nbsp;2007, we initiated a pivotal trial with an oral
formulation of forodesine for treatment of patients with CTCL. This trial is being conducted under
a SPA agreement negotiated with the FDA and will serve as a basis for a new drug application to the
FDA using the oral formulations in patients with relapsed CTCL. This Phase II clinical study has
enrolled all of the targeted patients. We expect to report top line data on this study in the
second half of 2010.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, 144 patients are enrolled in the CTCL study. Eligible patients are those with CTCL
of stages IB through IVA who have disease that is persistent, progressive or recurrent during or
after treatment with at least three systemic therapies. The study is a multinational,
non-randomized, open-label, single-arm trial that is evaluating 200 mg once-daily oral forodesine
treatment. The study will examine the rate of objective responses in patients enrolled at sites in
North America, Europe and Australia. The study&#146;s primary endpoint is objective response rate,
defined as either complete response or partial cutaneous response that is sustained for at least 28
days.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on preclinical studies conducted at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center which indicated that
forodesine induces the same biochemical changes in various other types of leukemia cells that are
responsible for the inhibition of T-leukemia cells, we initiated two small clinical studies late in
2005 in B-cell leukemias, which are more prevalent than T-cell leukemias.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we initiated a Phase II trial with oral forodesine in patients with CLL in an advanced
stage and refractory to fludarabine, a current standard therapy. Our initial trial has been
amended so that any potential subject who had fludarabine treatment in the past is now eligible.
This trial is on-going. In December&nbsp;2008, we announced interim data from the ongoing forodesine
Phase II program in patients with CLL and data from a healthy subject pharmacokinetic and
pharmacodynamic study. The interim analysis was conducted on data from an exploratory Phase II
single-arm, open-label program in patients with CLL whose previous treatment had failed. While this
analysis showed that no partial or complete responses were observed, five out of 13 patients
administered 200 mg of forodesine once-daily had substantial reductions in malignant lymphocytes,
and at the time of the analysis, seven patients were still on study. Forodesine was generally safe
and well-tolerated at the 200 mg once-daily dose. Also, in a parallel, healthy subject,
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study, we compared the effect of seven days of 200 mg
forodesine dosed once-daily with seven days of 200 mg forodesine dosed twice-daily. The study
demonstrated substantially increased drug exposure and pharmacodynamic effect in subjects
administered forodesine 200 mg twice-daily. Drug exposure, as measured by area under the
(plasma-concentration/time) curve (AUC), increased by 63&nbsp;percent (P&#060;0.001) for twice-daily
dosing compared to once-daily dosing. Serum uric acid levels were reduced at steady state compared
to baseline by 50.0&nbsp;percent for twice-daily dosing compared to 23.5&nbsp;percent for once-daily dosing
(p&#060;0.001), indicating increased PNP enzyme inhibition with twice-daily dosing. Subsequently, we
amended the study to increase the dosing regimen of oral forodesine to 200 mg twice-daily.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This study for forodesine in subjects with CLL has enrolled 20 of the targeted 26 patients,
with 15 patients currently still on treatment. The primary purpose of the study is to evaluate the
effectiveness and safety of oral forodesine administered as monotherapy at a dose of 200 mg
twice-daily in relapsed CLL patients. Previous clinical trial data indicated that forodesine
demonstrated clinical activity in CLL patients at a dose of 200 mg once-daily, and was generally
safe and well-tolerated. The current trial is testing the benefit and safety of increasing
forodesine drug exposure with twice-daily dosing.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We initiated a Phase I/II clinical trial of forodesine to determine the safety of repeat doses
of an i.v. formulation of the drug in patients with B-ALL. This trial is completed. Once the data
are thoroughly analyzed, we will review the results with Mundipharma to determine the best clinical
development strategy going forward.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January&nbsp;2007, we initiated a Phase IIb multicenter, open-label, non-randomized repeat-dose
registration study to evaluate an intravenous treatment of forodesine followed by an oral treatment
of forodesine in patients with relapsed or refractory T-ALL. This study was being conducted under
an SPA negotiated with the FDA and was designed to determine the rate of complete remission

the i.v. formulation, that we were voluntarily placing this Phase IIb clinical trial on hold
pending internal review and discussions with our partner, Mundipharma. In December&nbsp;2007, we

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2004, we began clinical development of BCX-4208, another PNP inhibitor, as a drug
candidate for the treatment of T-cell mediated autoimmune diseases, including psoriasis, and
transplant rejection. Although BCX- 4208 and forodesine are both investigational PNP inhibitors,
BCX-4208 differs from forodesine in significant ways.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">For example, BCX-4208 is more potent, and has the ability to suppress PNP for longer periods
of time. Thus, BCX-4208 has potential advantages over forodesine for the treatment of diseases
requiring long-term, chronic administration of a PNP inhibitor.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November&nbsp;2005, we and Roche entered into an exclusive license agreement for the worldwide
development and commercialization of BCX-4208 for the prevention of acute rejection in
transplantation and for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. This collaboration provided
substantial strategic and economic benefit to us and also all the essential elements for the rapid,
comprehensive and competitive development of BCX-4208. The two companies established a joint
committee to set the clinical development strategy and the future development program for BCX-4208.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the third quarter of 2007, Roche initiated a Phase IIa clinical trial to evaluate
BCX-4208/R3421 in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. In the Phase IIa trial,
BCX-4208 was generally safe and well-tolerated at doses up to 120 mg daily for six weeks. Most
adverse events reported were considered mild or moderate, and low in frequency. No opportunistic
infections were observed. In addition, detailed laboratory and clinical monitoring did not indicate
any patterns suggestive of off-target adverse findings. In addition, consistent with interim
results previously reported by the Company, no evidence of clinical efficacy, a secondary
objective, was observed in psoriasis patients with doses and duration of administration tested.
Also in May&nbsp;2008, we announced that we received notice that Roche was exercising the &#147;no cause&#148;
termination right under the license agreement for BCX-4208.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, we regained worldwide rights to BCX-4208 and are currently pursuing BCX-4208
development in gout. We believe that BCX-4208 is a good candidate to control gout because data
from a prior Phase II clinical trial of BCX-4208 for psoriasis indicated a dose related reduction
in uric acid that was sustained for the duration of drug exposure.

healthy volunteers, early in 2005 and during the third quarter of 2005, we initiated a Phase Ib
multi dose trial in healthy volunteers to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics
of multiple oral doses of BCX-4208.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We recently initiated a clinical study of BCX-4208 for the treatment of gout, which is caused
by elevated levels of uric acid in blood. Our gout clinical trial is a Phase II, randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of BCX-4208 in subjects
with gout. The trial contains two parts: Part&nbsp;1 will study multiple doses of BCX-4208 against a
placebo and Part&nbsp;2 will study dose escalation. The trial&#146;s primary objective is to determine the
effect of different doses of orally administered BCX-4208 on serum uric acid levels in patients
with gout. The trial is expected to enroll up to 120 subjects.

characterized by symptoms including fever, cough, sore throat, fatigue, headache, and/or chills.
According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (&#147;CDC&#148;), an estimated 5% to 20% of
the American population suffers from influenza annually, there are an estimated 200,000 influenza
associated hospitalizations, and influenza is responsible for approximately 36,000 deaths annually.
Influenza is particularly dangerous to the elderly, young children and people with certain health
conditions. Outbreaks of seasonal flu tend to follow predictable patterns usually occurring in the
winter. New vaccines are developed annually based on known flu strains and are usually available
for the annual flu season. There are also antiviral treatments available for the treatment of
people infected with influenza.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Pandemic Influenza</I>. Pandemic influenza is a global disease outbreak that occurs when a new
influenza virus emerges and people have had no previous exposure. This situation occurs very rarely
(only three times in the 20th century). In May&nbsp;2009, the World Health Organization (&#147;WHO&#148;)
declared an influenza pandemic caused by a novel influenza virus. According to the WHO, the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">to the CDC, H1N1 flu was the most widespread in the United States in late October and
early November&nbsp;2009. October&nbsp;2009 saw the highest rate of flu illness of any flu season since
surveillance began. Children ages 5-17 were most likely to be hospitalized from the H1N1 flu
virus. The majority of people who were hospitalized had an underlying condition, with asthma being
the most common. Furthermore, the CDC Influenza Division also reported that H1N1 viruses from over
100 countries have been characterized and virtually all of them are similar to the strain of H1N1
included in the 2009 H1N1 flu vaccine. According to the CDC, the H1N1 virus has not changed
significantly since it was first recognized in spring 2009 and remains responsive to antiviral
treatment.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Avian Influenza</I>. According to information from the CDC, avian influenza, or bird flu is an
infection caused by viruses which occur naturally among birds. This form of flu is very contagious
among birds and can lead to serious illness and sometimes death. While there are many different
subtypes of the influenza A virus, only two subtypes are known to be currently circulating among
humans. Avian influenza A viruses are found chiefly in birds, but there have been confirmed cases
of infection in humans, generally as a result of contact with infected birds. Thus far, person to
person spread of this virus is considered extremely rare, but as influenza A viruses constantly
change, they could mutate over time to have the ability to spread rapidly among humans.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Influenza Prevention and Treatment</I>. The development of effective therapeutics has challenged
medical researchers due to the seasonal variation in viral strains and the highly infectious nature
of influenza. Patients, therefore, have limited treatment options. Amantadine and rimantadine,
drugs in the adamantine class, have been used for treatment of influenza A but are ineffective
against influenza B. In addition, these drugs cause some adverse side effects, and the virus tends
to develop resistance to these drugs. The CDC has recommended against the use of amantadine and
rimantadine for the treatment or prophylaxis of influenza in the United States until susceptibility
to these antiviral medications has been re-established among circulating influenza A viruses.
Osteltamivir and zanamivir, drugs in the neuraminidase inhibitor class, have been used for the
treatment of influenza. Recently, the prevalence of resistance to oseltamivir in subtype H1N1 of
influenza A has increased, and the CDC has recommended the use of zanamivir or a combination of
oseltamivir and rimatadine when influenza A (&#147;H1N1&#148;) virus infection or exposure is suspected.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vaccines are available against the disease but have limitations: people require advance
vaccination; vaccines are limited by their specificity to particular strains of the virus; and
vaccines offer little protection if the strain of influenza that circulates is different from that
present in the vaccine. In addition, many people decline the required injections. Different strains
can arise when surface antigens on the virus (the portion of the virus that causes an immune
reaction in humans) undergo minor genetic mutations each year as the virus replicates (antigenic
drift). Because of this mutability, the immunity acquired in response to infection by a particular
strain of the virus does not provide adequate protection against viruses that subsequently arise.
The production of a new vaccine each year is not only complex and expensive, but also an
inefficient method of global disease control.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Inhibiting Influenza Neuraminidase. </I>Research during the past two decades has seen dramatic
advances in understanding the molecular structure and function of the influenza virus. Considerable
attention has been focused on the enzyme neuraminidase, which is located on the surface of the
virus. Neuraminidase assists in the release and spread of the flu virus by breaking the chemical
strands that hold the new viruses to the cell surface, allowing the replicated virus to spread and
infect other cells. This process progresses until the host&#146;s immune response can produce enough
antibodies to bring the infection under control. Inhibiting the neuraminidase enzyme keeps new
viruses attached to the cell surface, thereby preventing the spread of the virus and the further
infection of other cells. The subsequent quantities of virus in the bloodstream are not enough to
cause disease but are sufficient to induce the body to mount an immune response.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to our neuraminidase inhibitor drug candidate, peramivir, both Roche, in
collaboration with Gilead Sciences, and GlaxoSmithKline (&#147;GSK&#148;) have neuraminidase inhibitors on
the market. Roche&#146;s neuraminidase inhibitor is a twice-a-day, orally active neuraminidase
inhibitor, while GSK&#146;s neuraminidase inhibitor is administered by dry powder inhaler twice a day.
Both drugs are approved for marketing in the United States and other countries for treatment of
influenza and are to be administered for 5&nbsp;days. Both companies are have i.v. formulations in
clinical trial development. Roche&#146;s neuraminidase inhibitor is also approved for prophylaxis of
influenza. In addition to these companies with neuraminidase inhibitors, there are other companies
working to develop additional antiviral drugs to be used against various strains of influenza.

collaboration with our scientists, began determining the molecular structure of the influenza
neuraminidase enzyme from several different strains of influenza, using X-ray crystallography.
Subsequently, our scientists and UAB scientists developed numerous new inhibitors of these enzymes
using structure-based drug design. We licensed the influenza neuraminidase program from UAB in 1994
and proceeded to complete the studies of the enzyme&#146;s molecular structure needed to advance the
development of neuraminidase inhibitors. The structure of the active site of influenza
neuraminidase is similar among different viral strains. Because of this similarity, we believe that
our neuraminidase inhibitors may be effective in the treatment and prevention of influenza,
regardless of changes in the virus.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Previous development of peramivir in an oral formulation was conducted through a worldwide
license agreement between the Company and the R.W. Johnson Pharmaceutical Research Institute and
Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical Inc. (both Johnson &#038; Johnson companies). Johnson &#038; Johnson made the
business decision to terminate this agreement in 2001 and returned all rights to us. In June&nbsp;2002,
we completed an ongoing Phase III clinical trial that had been started by Johnson &#038; Johnson and
subsequently terminated development of our oral peramivir program as a result of missing the
primary endpoint in the pivotal trial.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preclinical studies comparing peramivir with other anti-influenza drugs have demonstrated that
peramivir has broad-spectrum potency against multiple strains of influenza in the nanomolar or
sub-nanomolar range, including the avian strain H5N1. We are currently focusing on injectable
formulations of peramivir to achieve high blood levels that may be effective against most strains
of influenza, including strains that may be resistant to oseltamivir (Tamiflu). Our IND for i.v.
peramivir became effective in December&nbsp;2005 and for i.m. in December&nbsp;2006. We received fast track
designation from the FDA in January&nbsp;2006 and initiated a Phase I clinical trial with i.v. peramivir

statistically significant differences for its primary endpoint of time to alleviation of symptoms,
the preliminary analysis of the virologic data indicated that peramivir demonstrated statistically
significant reductions in influenza virus shedding in both peramivir treatment groups compared to
placebo, with greater reductions in the 300 mg dose. With this information and the additional
pharmacokinetic information we have obtained subsequent to the trial, we initiated a Phase II
placebo-controlled trial of 600 mg i.m. peramivir for the treatment of seasonal influenza. In May

the study was to evaluate a novel composite endpoint, time to clinical stability, which is
comprised of normalization of temperature, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, systolic blood

mortality, clinical relapse and time to resumption of usual activities. As reported in October
2008, there were no statistically significant differences in any of the efficacy endpoints between
the three treatment arms, and peramivir was generally safe and well-tolerated at those dose levels.
Evaluation of time to clinical stability, the primary endpoint, showed a median of 23.7 hours for
peramivir 200mg, 37.0 hours for peramivir 400 mg and 28.1 hours for oseltamivir (p=.306). This
exploratory endpoint was driven by resolution of fever. Viral shedding (time weighted change from
baseline in viral titer) was reduced by a median of -2.0 logs for peramivir 200mg, -2.1 logs for
peramivir 400mg, and -1.9 logs for oseltamivir (p=.908). There was no mortality in the primary

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also in September&nbsp;2009, we received an RFP from HHS for the supply of i.v. peramivir for the
treatment of critically ill influenza patients under an EUA. On November&nbsp;4, 2009 the Company
received an initial order for 10,000 courses of i.v. peramivir (600 mg once-daily for five days)
for an aggregate purchase price of $22.5&nbsp;million and shipped the entire order from existing i.v.
peramivir inventory that same day. HHS may place additional orders for peramivir up to a total of
40,000 courses at the same unit price as the first order. In addition to the U.S. Government order
that came from the request for proposal (&#147;RFP&#148;) negotiations, we have donated and transferred to
HHS an initial supply sufficient for 1,200 courses of i.v. peramivir 600 mg once-daily for five
days. This transfer was made under the development contract with HHS and is separate from the RFP
process.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October&nbsp;2009, the FDA, in response to a request from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, issued an EUA for i.v. peramivir in certain adult and pediatric patients under
specific conditions with confirmed or suspected 2009 H1N1influenza infection who are admitted to a
hospital.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the contract with HHS, we have established collaborative relationships with
Shionogi and Green Cross for the development and commercialization in Japan and Taiwan by Shionogi
and in Korea by Green Cross. The Shionogi agreement was established in February&nbsp;2007, which
resulted in an upfront payment of $14&nbsp;million and future clinical event milestone payments of up to
$21&nbsp;million. The Shionogi agreement was amended in 2008 to expand the territory in the agreement to
include Taiwan and to provide rights for Shionogi to perform its Phase III clinical trial in Hong
Kong. Shionogi recently announced positive results in two Phase III studies of i.v. peramivir
administered via a single dose and multiple dose injections in the outpatient setting for treatment
of seasonal influenza during the 2008-2009 influenza season. This trial met its primary endpoint of
improvement in the median time to alleviation of symptoms in subjects with confirmed, acute,
uncomplicated influenza infection, compared to placebo alone.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to Shionogi and Green Cross, we have entered into several agreements with
companies outside the U.S. to represent us and peramivir primarily for stockpiling opportunities.
For example, on December&nbsp;23, 2009, we entered into an agreement with Merck Serono, S.A., through
its affiliate, Ares Trading S.A., to exclusively represent us and peramivir for stockpiling
opportunities in Europe, Russia, Canada and Singapore. Also in December&nbsp;2009, we entered into an

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Structure-based drug design is a drug discovery approach by which we design synthetic
compounds from detailed structural knowledge of the active sites of enzyme targets associated with
particular diseases. Enzymes are proteins that act as catalysts for many vital biological
reactions. Our goal generally is to design a compound that will fit in the active site of an enzyme
(the active site of an enzyme is the area into which a chemical or biological molecule fits to
initiate a biochemical reaction) and thereby interfere with the progression of disease.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our structure-based drug design involves the application of both traditional biology and
medicinal chemistry and an array of advanced technologies. We use X-ray crystallography, computer
modeling of molecular structures and advanced chemistry techniques to focus on the
three-dimensional molecular structure and active site characteristics of the enzymes that control
cellular biology.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that structure-based drug design technologies are superior to drug screening
techniques. By identifying the target enzyme in advance and by discovering the chemical and
molecular structure of the enzyme, we believe it is possible to design a better drug to interact
with the enzyme. In addition, the structural data obtained by X-ray crystallographic analysis allow
additional analysis and compound modification at each stage of the biological evaluation. This
capability makes structure-based drug design a powerful tool for efficient development of drugs
that are highly specific for particular enzyme target sites.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Research and Development</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We initiated our research and development program in 1986, with drug synthesis beginning in
1987. We have assembled a scientific research staff with expertise in a broad base of advanced
research technologies including protein biochemistry, X-ray crystallography, chemistry and
pharmacology. Our research facilities include protein biochemistry and organic synthesis
laboratories, testing facilities, X-ray crystallography, computer and graphics equipment and
facilities to make drug candidates on a small scale for early stage clinical trials. Beginning in
June&nbsp;2006, we began building an internal clinical development and regulatory team, based in North
Carolina to manage the development strategy for our later stage products. During the years ended
December&nbsp;31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, our research and development expenses were $72.3&nbsp;million, $73.3
million, and $94.1&nbsp;million, respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Collaboration and In-License Relationships</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We seek to enter into collaborations with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies
when we feel it is advantageous to leverage these companies&#146; resources to develop and commercialize
our drug candidates on a global basis. This allows us to remain focused on our strength of early
stage discovery and development of drug candidates. To date, we have entered into two major
collaborations for the development and commercialization of our lead PNP inhibitors and two
collaborations for the development and commercialization of peramivir in certain countries outside
the U.S. In addition, in January&nbsp;2007, we announced that HHS had awarded us a $102.6&nbsp;million,
four-year contract for the advanced development of peramivir for U.S. licensure. The total award
under this contract is now $179.9&nbsp;million, and the term has been extended to five years.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important component of our strategy is to augment our internal discovery programs
through the selective in-licensing of potential drug development targets or early stage compounds
for these specific targets. For example, our PNP inhibitors were in-licensed from AECOM and IRL in
June&nbsp;2000.

agreement with Mundipharma for the development and commercialization of our lead PNP inhibitor,
forodesine, for use in oncology. Under the terms of the agreement, Mundipharma obtained rights to
forodesine in markets across Europe, Asia, and Australasia in exchange for a $10.0&nbsp;million up-front
payment. In addition, Mundipharma contributed $10.0&nbsp;million of the documented out of pocket
development costs incurred by us in respect of the current and planned trials as of the effective
date of the agreement and Mundipharma will conduct additional clinical trials at their own cost up
to a maximum of $15.0&nbsp;million. The license provides for possibility of future event payments
totaling $155.0&nbsp;million for achieving specified development, regulatory and commercial events
(including certain sales level amounts following a product&#146;s launch) for certain indications. In
addition, the agreement provides that we will receive royalties (ranging from single digits to mid
teens) based on a percentage of net product sales, which varies depending upon when certain
indications receive NDA approval in a major market country and can vary by country depending on the
patent coverage or sales of generic compounds in a particular country. Generally, all payments
under the agreement are nonrefundable and non-creditable, but they are subject to audit. We
licensed forodesine and other PNP inhibitors from AECOM and IRL and will owe sublicense payments to
these third parties on the upfront payment, event payments, and royalties received by us from
Mundipharma.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For five years, Mundipharma will have a right of first negotiation on existing backup PNP
inhibitors we develop through Phase IIb in oncology, but any new PNP inhibitors will be exempt from
this agreement and we will retain all rights to such compounds. We retained the rights to
forodesine in the U.S. and Mundipharma is obligated by the terms of the agreement to use
commercially reasonable efforts to develop the licensed product in the territory specified by the
agreement. The agreement will continue for the commercial life of the licensed products, but may be
terminated by either party following an uncured material breach by the other party or in the event
the pre-existing third party license with AECOM and IRL expires. It may be terminated by
Mundipharma upon 60&nbsp;days written notice without cause or under certain other conditions as
specified in the agreement and all rights, data, materials, products and other information would be
transferred back to us at no cost. In the event we terminate the agreement for material default or
insolvency, we could have to pay Mundipharma 50% of the costs of any independent data owned by
Mundipharma in accordance with the terms of the agreement.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Shionogi. </I>In March&nbsp;2007, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Shionogi to
develop and commercialize the Company&#146;s lead influenza neuraminidase inhibitor, peramivir, in Japan
for the treatment of seasonal and potentially life-threatening human influenza. Under the terms of
the agreement, Shionogi obtained rights to injectable formulations of peramivir in Japan in
exchange for a $14&nbsp;million up-front payment. The license provides for potential future milestone
event payments (up to $21&nbsp;million) and commercial event milestone payments (up to $95&nbsp;million) in
addition to double digit (between 10 and 20% range) royalty payments on product sales of peramivir.
In December&nbsp;2007, the Company received a $7&nbsp;million milestone payment from Shionogi for their
initiation of a Phase II clinical trial with i.v. peramivir. Generally, all payments under the
agreement are nonrefundable and non-creditable, but they are subject to audit. Shionogi will be
responsible for all development, regulatory and marketing costs in Japan. The term of the agreement
is from February&nbsp;28, 2007 until terminated by either party in accordance with the license
agreement. Either party may terminate in the event of an uncured breach. Shionogi has the right of
without cause termination. In the event of termination all license and rights granted to Shionogi
shall terminate and shall revert back to the Company. The Company developed peramivir under a
license from UAB and will owe sublicense payments to them on the upfront payment and any future
event payments and/or royalties received by the Company from Shionogi. In October&nbsp;2008, we and
Shionogi amended the license agreement to expand the territory covered by the agreement to include
Taiwan and to provide rights for Shionogi to perform a Phase III Clinical Trial in Hong Kong.
Shionogi announced positive results in two Phase III studies in July&nbsp;2009 and received marketing
and manufacturing approval for i.v. peramivir in Japan in January&nbsp;2010. This marketing approval
triggered a third and final regulatory milestone payment to us of $7.0&nbsp;million in January&nbsp;2010.

commercialize peramivir in Korea. Under the terms of the agreement, Green Cross will be responsible
for all development, regulatory, and commercialization costs in Korea. We received a one-time
license fee of $250,000. Total future milestone payments would be equally modest. The license also
provides that we will share in profits resulting from the sale of peramivir in Korea, including the
sale of peramivir to the Korean government for stockpiling purposes. Furthermore, Green Cross will
pay us a premium over its cost to supply peramivir for development and any future marketing of

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This contract is a milestone-driven, cost-plus-fixed-fee contract. HHS will make periodic
assessments of our progress, and the continuation of the contract is based on our performance, the
timeliness and quality of deliverables, and other factors. The government has rights under certain
contract clauses to terminate this contract. The contract is terminable by the government at any
time for breach or without cause.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HHS has indicated that antiviral drugs are an important element of their pandemic influenza
preparedness efforts and that their strategy includes not only stockpiling of existing antiviral
drugs but also seeking out new antiviral medications to further broaden their capabilities to treat
and prevent all forms of influenza. Peramivir is in the same class of neuraminidase inhibitors as
oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza). We are committed to working with HHS for the
development of these parenteral formulations of peramivir which could be especially useful in
hospital settings or pandemic situations due to the ability to achieve high levels of the drug

and factual questions. Our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary position for our
technology will depend on our success in obtaining effective patent claims and enforcing those
claims once granted. We do not know whether any of our patent applications or those patent
applications that we license will result in the issuance of any patents. Our issued patents and
those that may issue in the future, or those licensed to us, may be challenged, invalidated,
rendered unenforceable or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from
marketing related products or the length of term of patent protection that we may have for our

competitive advantages against competitors with similar compounds or technology. Furthermore, our
competitors may independently develop similar technologies or duplicate any technology developed by
us in a manner that does not infringe our patents or other intellectual property. Because of the
extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it
is possible that, before any of our drug candidates or those developed by our partners can be
commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following
commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of the patent.

We believe that this is best achieved by retaining full product rights to certain drug candidates
within specialty markets, while relying on collaborative arrangements with third parties for drug

greater financial and other resources, larger research and development staffs, and more extensive
marketing and manufacturing organizations than we do. In addition, some of them have considerable
experience in preclinical testing, clinical trials and other regulatory approval procedures. There
are also academic institutions, governmental agencies and other research organizations that are
conducting research in areas in which we are working. They may also market commercial products,
either on their own or through collaborative efforts.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We expect to encounter significant competition for any of the pharmaceutical products we plan
to develop. Companies that complete clinical trials, obtain required regulatory approvals and
commence commercial sales of their products before their competitors may achieve a significant
competitive advantage. Such is the case with Eisai&#146;s Targretin for CTCL and the current
neuraminidase inhibitors marketed by GSK and Roche for influenza. In addition, several
pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms, including major pharmaceutical companies, have announced
efforts in the field of structure-based drug design and in the therapeutic areas of cancer,
infectious disease, autoimmune, and inflammatory disorders, as well as other therapeutic areas
where we are focusing our drug discovery efforts.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to compete successfully, we must develop proprietary positions in patented drugs for
therapeutic markets that have not been satisfactorily addressed by conventional research strategies
and, in the process, expand our expertise in structure-based drug design. Our products, even if
successfully tested and developed, may not be adopted by physicians over other products and may not
offer economically feasible alternatives to other therapies.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regulatory review and approval process is lengthy, expensive and uncertain. Before
obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any products, we or our partners must
demonstrate that our product candidates are safe and effective for use in humans. The approval
process takes many years, substantial expenses may be incurred and significant time may be devoted
to clinical development.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before testing potential candidates in humans, we carry out laboratory and animal studies to
determine safety and biological activity. After completing preclinical trials, we must file an IND,
including a proposal to begin clinical trials, with the FDA. We have filed thirteen INDs to date
and plan to file, or rely on future partners to file, additional INDs in the future as our
potential drug candidates advance to that stage of development. Thirty days after filing an IND, a
Phase I human clinical trial can start, unless the FDA places a hold on the study.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Phase I trials are designed to determine safety in a small group of patients or healthy
volunteers. We also assess tolerances and the metabolic and pharmacologic actions of our drug
candidates at different doses. After we complete the initial trials, we conduct Phase II trials to
assess safety and efficacy and establish the optimal dose in patients. If Phase II trials are
successful, we or our partners conduct Phase III trials to verify the results in a larger patient
population. Phase III trials are required for FDA approval to market a drug. A Phase III trial may
require hundreds or even thousands of patients and is the most expensive to conduct. The goal in
Phase III is to collect enough safety and efficacy data to obtain FDA approval of a drug for
treatment of a particular disease. For some clinical indications that are especially serious and
for which there are no effective treatments, such as refractory cancers, conditional approval can
be obtained following Phase II trials.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initiation and completion of the clinical trial phases are dependent on several factors
including things that are beyond our control. For example, the clinical trials cannot begin at a
particular site until that site receives approval from its Institutional Review Board (&#147;IRB&#148;),
which reviews the protocol and related documents. This process can take from several weeks to
several months. In addition, clinical trials are dependent on patient enrollment, but the rate at
which patients enroll in the study depends on:

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After completion of the clinical trials of a product, we or our partners must submit a NDA to
the FDA for marketing approval before commercialization of the product. The FDA may not grant
approval on a timely basis, if at all. The FDA, as a result of the Food and Drug Administration
Modernization Act of 1997, has six months to review and act upon license applications for priority
therapeutics that are for life-threatening or unmet medical needs. Standard reviews can take
between one and two years, and can even take longer if significant questions arise during the
review process. The FDA may withdraw any required approvals, once obtained.

regulations. GMP regulations include requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance
as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Manufacturing facilities are
subject to inspection by the FDA. Such facilities must be approved before we can use them in
commercial manufacturing of our potential products. We or our contract manufacturers may not be

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since our inception in 1986, we have not been profitable. We expect to incur additional losses
for the foreseeable future, and our losses could increase as our research and development efforts
progress. To become profitable, we must successfully manufacture and develop drug product
candidates, receive regulatory approval, and successfully commercialize or enter into profitable
agreements with other parties. It could be several years, if ever, before we receive royalties from
any current or future license agreements or revenues directly from product sales.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing our product
candidates and their potential for commercialization, we are unable to predict the extent of any
future losses. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase
profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. If we are unable to achieve and sustain
profitability, the market value of our common stock will likely decline.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To receive the regulatory approvals necessary for the sale of our product candidates, we or
our partners must demonstrate through preclinical studies and clinical trials that each product
candidate is safe and effective. The clinical trial process is complex and uncertain. Because of
the cost and duration of clinical trials, we may decide to discontinue development of product
candidates that are unlikely to show good results in the trials, unlikely to help advance a product
to the point of a meaningful collaboration, or unlikely to have a reasonable commercial potential.
We may suffer significant setbacks in pivotal clinical trials, even after earlier clinical trials
show promising results. Clinical trials may not be adequately designed or executed, which could
affect the potential outcome and analysis of study results. Any of our product candidates may
produce undesirable side effects in humans. These side effects could cause us or regulatory
authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials of a product candidate. These side effects
could also result in the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities refusing to approve the product
candidate for any targeted indications. We, our partners, the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities
may suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time if we or they believe the trial participants
face unacceptable health risks. Clinical trials may fail to demonstrate that our product candidates
are safe or effective and have acceptable commercial viability.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As our clinical programs continue to grow and patient enrollment increases, our costs will
increase. Our current and planned clinical trials plus the related development, manufacturing,
regulatory approval process requirements, and additional personnel resources and testing required
for supporting the development of our product candidates will consume significant capital
resources. Our expenses, revenues and burn rate could vary significantly depending on many factors,
including our ability to raise additional capital, the development progress of our collaborative
agreements for our product candidates, the amount of funding we receive from HHS for peramivir, the
amount of funding or assistance, if any, we receive from other governmental agencies or other new
partnerships with third parties for the development of our product candidates, the amount or
profitability of any orders for peramivir by any government agency or other party, the progress and
results of our current and proposed clinical trials for our most advanced drug products, the
progress made in the manufacturing of our lead products and the progression of our other programs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We expect that we will be required to raise additional capital to complete the development and
commercialization of our current product candidates and we may seek to raise capital at any time we
deem market conditions to be favorable. Additional funding, whether through additional sales of
securities or collaborative or other arrangements with corporate partners or from other sources,
including governmental agencies, in general and from any HHS contract specifically, may not be
available when needed or on terms acceptable to us. The issuance of preferred or common stock or
convertible securities, with terms and prices significantly more favorable than those of the
currently outstanding common stock, could have the effect of diluting or adversely affecting the
holdings or rights of our existing stockholders. In addition, collaborative arrangements may
require us to transfer certain material rights to such corporate partners. Insufficient funds may
require us to delay, scale-back or eliminate certain of our research and development programs.

incurred costs or other actions taken under the contract, this would have a significant negative
impact on our revenues, cash flows and the development of peramivir.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our projections of revenues and incoming cash flows are substantially dependent upon HHS
reimbursement for the costs related to our peramivir program. If HHS were to eliminate, reduce or
delay the funding for this program or disallow some of our incurred costs, we would have to obtain
additional funding for development of this drug candidate or significantly reduce or stop the
development effort. Further, HHS may challenge actions that we have taken or may take under our
contract, which could negatively impact our operating results and cash flows.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contracting with HHS, we are subject to various U.S. government contract requirements,
including general clauses for a cost-reimbursement research and development contract, which may
limit our reimbursement or if we are found to be in violation could result in contract termination.
U.S. government contracts typically contain extraordinary provisions which would not typically be
found in commercial contracts. For instance, government contracts permit unilateral modification by
the government, interpretation of relevant regulations (i.e., federal acquisition regulation
clauses), and the ability to terminate without cause. As such, we may be at a disadvantage as
compared to other commercial contracts. In addition, U.S. government contracts are subject to audit

As part of any such audit or review, the U.S. government may review the adequacy of, and our
compliance with, our internal control systems and policies, including those relating to our
purchasing, property, estimating, compensation and management information systems. Based on the
results of its audits, the U.S. government may adjust our contract-related costs and fees,

illegal activity, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions,
including termination of our contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and
suspension or prohibition from doing business with the U.S. government. We could also suffer
serious harm to our reputation if allegations of impropriety were made against us. In addition,
under U.S. government purchasing regulations, some of our costs may not be reimbursable or allowed

export laws of the U.S. Neither the FDA nor foreign regulatory agencies have approved any of our

our product candidates could take a significantly longer time to gain regulatory approval than we

our management&#146;s credibility, our company&#146;s value and our operating results may suffer. Even if the

competition for any of the pharmaceutical products we plan to develop. Companies that complete
clinical trials, obtain required regulatory approvals and commence commercial sales of their
products before their competitors may achieve a significant competitive advantage. Such is the case
with Eisai&#146;s Targretin for CTCL and the current neuraminidase inhibitors marketed by Glaxo Smith
Kline and Roche for influenza. With respect to the neuraminidase inhibitors, these companies may
develop i.v. formulations that could compete with peramivir. Further, several pharmaceutical and
biotechnology firms, including major pharmaceutical companies and specialized structure-based drug
design companies, have announced efforts in the field of structure-based drug design and in the

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our success will depend in part on our ability and the abilities of our partners to obtain,
protect and enforce viable intellectual property rights including but not limited to trade name,
trade mark and patent protection for our company and its products, methods, processes and other
technologies we may license or develop, to preserve our trade secrets, and to operate without
infringing the proprietary rights of third parties both domestically and abroad. The patent
position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies is generally highly uncertain, involves
complex legal and factual questions and has recently been the subject of much litigation. Neither
the United States Patent and Trademark Office (&#147;USPTO&#148;), the Patent Cooperation Treaty offices, nor
the courts of the United States and other jurisdictions have consistent policies nor predictable
rulings regarding the breadth of claims allowed or the degree of protection afforded under many
biotechnology and pharmaceutical patents. Further, we do not have worldwide patent protection for
our product candidates and our intellectual property rights may not be legally protected or
enforceable in all countries throughout the world. The validity, scope, enforceability and
commercial value of these rights, therefore, is highly uncertain.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our success depends in part on avoiding the infringement of other parties&#146; patents and other
intellectual property rights as well as avoiding the breach of any licenses relating to our
technologies and products. In the U.S., patent applications filed in recent years are confidential
for 18&nbsp;months, while older applications are not published until the patent issues. As a result,
avoiding patent infringement may be difficult and we may inadvertently infringe third-party patents
or proprietary rights. These third parties could bring claims against us, our partners or our
licensors that even if resolved in our favor, could cause us to incur substantial expenses and, if
resolved against us, could additionally cause us to pay substantial damages. Further, if a patent
infringement suit were brought against us, our partners or our licensors, we or they could be
forced to stop or delay research, development, manufacturing or sales of any infringing product in
the country or countries covered by the patent we infringe, unless we can obtain a license from the
patent holder. Such a license may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all, particularly if
the third party is developing or marketing a product competitive with the infringing product. Even
if we, our partners or our licensors were able to obtain a license, the rights may be nonexclusive,
which would give our competitors access to the same intellectual property.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we or our partners are unable or fail to adequately, initiate, protect, defend or enforce
our intellectual property rights in any area of commercial interest or in any part of the world
where we wish to seek regulatory approval for our products, methods, processes and other
technologies, the value of the drug product candidates to produce revenue would diminish.
Additionally, if our products, methods, processes, and other technologies or our commercial use of
such products, processes, and other technologies, including but not limited to any trade name,
trademark or commercial strategy infringe the proprietary rights of other parties, we could incur
substantial costs. The USPTO and the patent offices of other jurisdictions have issued to us a
number of patents for our various inventions and we have in-licensed several patents from various
institutions. We have filed additional patent applications and provisional patent applications with
the USPTO. We have filed a number of corresponding foreign patent applications and intend to file
additional foreign and U.S. patent applications, as appropriate. We have also filed certain
trademark and trade name applications worldwide. We cannot assure you as to:

related to intellectual property rights, including proceedings before the USPTO or other foreign
patent office. Any judgment adverse to us in any litigation or other proceeding arising in

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our success is also dependent upon the skills, knowledge and experience, none of which is
patentable, of our scientific and technical personnel. To help protect our rights, we require all
employees, consultants, advisors and partners to enter into confidentiality agreements that
prohibit the disclosure of confidential information to anyone outside of our company and require
disclosure and assignment to us of their ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions. These
agreements may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary
information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure or the lawful development by others
of such information, and if any of our proprietary information is disclosed, our business will

the amount of approximately $11.0&nbsp;million. Clinical trial and product liability insurance is
becoming increasingly expensive. As a result, we may be unable to obtain sufficient insurance or
increase our existing coverage at a reasonable cost to protect us against losses that could have a
material adverse effect on our business. An individual may bring a product liability claim against
us if one of our products or product candidates causes, or is claimed to have caused, an injury or

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January&nbsp;2007, HHS awarded us a $102.6&nbsp;million, four-year contract for the advanced
development of peramivir. In September&nbsp;2009, we received an award of $77.2&nbsp;million toward
completion of the Phase III development of i.v. peramivir pursuant to a contract modification with
HHS. This additional funding brings the total award from HHS for the development of peramivir to
$179.9&nbsp;million and extends the contract term by 12&nbsp;months to five years. Any funding above the
$179.9&nbsp;million may be our responsibility.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have determined that there is an excess of up to $5.0&nbsp;million of peramivir active
pharmaceutical ingredient (&#147;API&#148;) manufactured under the contract with HHS. This excess API is
beyond the amount necessary to support U.S. regulatory approval. HHS has acknowledged that at
least half of the Company&#146;s estimate is excess. We are evaluating whether additional quantities of
peramivir API are needed by the Company, and if so, the acquisition process to obtain the API from
HHS.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September&nbsp;2009, we received a RFP from HHS for the supply of i.v. peramivir for the
treatment of critically ill influenza patients under an Emergency Use Authorization (&#147;EUA&#148;). On
November&nbsp;4, 2009 we received an initial order for 10,000 courses of i.v. peramivir (600 mg
once-daily for five days) for an aggregate purchase price of $22.5&nbsp;million. We shipped the entire
order from existing i.v. peramivir inventory to HHS on November&nbsp;4, 2009. Under the Indefinite
Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract issued to us on November&nbsp;3, 2009, HHS may place additional
orders for peramivir up to a total of 40,000 courses at the same unit price as the first order. We
are also required to maintain the ability to manufacture additional treatment courses dependent on
the volume and size of anti-viral orders received from HHS. In addition, separate from the RFP
process, we have donated and transferred to HHS an initial supply sufficient for 1,200 courses of
i.v. peramivir 600 mg once-daily for five days.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minimum and maximum quantities of i.v. peramivir that may be ordered by HHS under the RFP
are 1,000 and 40,000 treatment courses. We also are required to maintain the ability to manufacture
additional courses for treatment or prophylaxis, dependent on the volume and size of orders
received from HHS. Based on the RFP, we initiated manufacture of approximately 130,000 courses of
i.v. peramivir at a cost of approximately $10&nbsp;million, so that we would have additional inventory
available in advance of potential orders. In addition, we have sufficient quantities of API of
i.v. peramivir available to produce up to 350,000 additional courses.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October&nbsp;2009, the FDA, in response to a request from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, issued an EUA for permitting the use of i.v. peramivir in hospitalized adult and
pediatric patients with confirmed or suspected 2009 H1N1 influenza infection who have not responded
to oral or inhaled antivirals or in whom oral or inhaled antiviral therapy is not feasible, and in
adult patients for whom therapy with an i.v. drug is judged clinically appropriate due to other
circumstances.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the contract with HHS, in February&nbsp;2007, we established a collaborative
relationship with Shionogi for the development and commercialization of peramivir in Japan. We
received an upfront payment of $14&nbsp;million and the agreement provided for additional future
clinical event milestone payments of up to $21&nbsp;million. In October&nbsp;2008, we and Shionogi amended
the license agreement to expand the territory in the agreement to include Taiwan and to provide
rights for Shionogi to perform a Phase III clinical trial in Hong Kong.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July&nbsp;2009, Shionogi announced positive results in two Phase III clinical trials of i.v.
peramivir. The studies were sponsored by Shionogi and conducted during the 2008-2009 influenza
season. Shionogi and Green Cross Corporation (&#147;Green Cross&#148;), the license holder of peramivir in
Korea pursuant to a June&nbsp;2006 license agreement with us, co-conducted the portion of the studies in
Korea. Doses of i.v. peramivir of 300 mg and 600 mg, administered in single and multiple doses,
were found to be generally safe and well-tolerated in these trials. Shionogi presented the data at
the 2009 ICAAC / IDSA annual meeting in San Francisco, California.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shionogi previously completed a Phase II study of i.v. peramivir administered via a single
dose infusion in the outpatient setting for treatment of seasonal influenza. Shionogi presented the
data at the 2008 ICAAC / IDSA annual meeting in Washington, D.C.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January&nbsp;2010, Shionogi received marketing and manufacturing approval for i.v. peramivir in
Japan. The filing of this application triggered a $7.0&nbsp;million milestone payment to us under our
current license agreement, and we received a third and final regulatory milestone payment of $7.0
million in January&nbsp;2010 as a result of the application&#146;s approval. We may receive future
commercial event milestone payments of up to $95&nbsp;million from Shionogi. Shionogi has commercially
launched peramivir under the commercial name RAPIACTA in Japan. Shionogi has received the
indications of single dose administration of 300 mg i.v. peramivir for adult uncomplicated seasonal
influenza infection, as well as single and multiple dose administration of 600 mg i.v. peramivir
for the patients at high-risk for complications associated with influenza. Shionogi is authorized
to supply peramivir as either a 300 mg i.v. bag or a 150 mg vial for i.v. drip infusion.
Shionogi also announced that it has completed clinical studies for pediatric patients and has filed
an additional application for pediatric use of RAPIACTA in Japan.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, in January&nbsp;2010, Green Cross filed a New Drug Application in South Korea in
January&nbsp;2010 to seek regulatory approval for i.v. peramivir to treat patients with influenza.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to Shionogi and Green Cross, we have entered into several agreements with
companies outside the U.S. to represent us and peramivir primarily for stockpiling opportunities.
For example, on December&nbsp;23, 2009, we entered into an agreement with Merck Serono, S.A., through
its affiliate, Ares Trading S.A., to exclusively represent us and peramivir for stockpiling
opportunities in Europe, Russia, Canada and Singapore. Also in December&nbsp;2009, we entered into an
agreement with Hikma Pharmaceuticals, PLC to represent us and peramivir for stockpiling
opportunities in the Middle East and North Africa, excluding Israel. In January, 2010 we entered
into an agreement with moksha8 Pharmaceuticals, Inc. to exclusively represent us and peramivir for
influenza stockpiling opportunities in Brazil and Mexico.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Intramuscular peramivir. </I>We completed a double-blind placebo-controlled Phase II clinical
trial with i.m. peramivir testing two different dose levels of peramivir (150 mg and 300 mg) versus
placebo in adults with acute uncomplicated influenza. While the trial did not demonstrate
statistically significant differences for its primary endpoint of time to alleviation of symptoms,
the preliminary analysis of the virologic data indicated that peramivir demonstrated statistically
significant reductions in influenza virus shedding in both peramivir treatment groups compared to
placebo, with greater reductions in the 300 mg dose. With this information and the additional
pharmacokinetic information we have obtained subsequent to the trial, we initiated a Phase II
placebo-controlled trial of 600 mg i.m. peramivir for the treatment of seasonal influenza. In May
2009, we announced preliminary results from the Phase II study of i.m. peramivir for the treatment
of seasonal influenza. This Phase II study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial
conducted in influenza seasons in the Southern Hemisphere (Australia, New Zealand and South Africa)
in 2008 and the Northern Hemisphere (United States) in 2008 to 2009. While the study demonstrated a
numerical trend in its primary endpoint of improvement in the median time to alleviation of
symptoms (&#147;TTAS&#148;) in subjects with confirmed, acute, uncomplicated influenza infection versus
placebo, the difference between the two study groups was not statistically significant. We are not
planning additional development of i.m. peramivir at this time.

systolic blood pressure and heart rate. This type of endpoint has previously been used in pneumonia
studies, but not in influenza. Secondary objectives of the study included evaluation of viral

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the third quarter of 2007, Roche initiated a Phase IIa clinical trial to evaluate oral
doses of BCX-4208/R3421 in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. The efficacy
assessment of the study has been completed. Consistent with interim findings reported by us in May
2008, the Phase II clinical study of BCX-4208, a potent, rationally designed, orally available PNP
inhibitor, met its primary objectives of safety and tolerability. In addition, BCX-4208 displayed
dose-dependent reductions in peripheral blood lymphocyte counts, including subsets measuring B
cells (CD20), total T cells (CD3), T helper cells (CD4) and T suppressor/cytotoxic cells (CD8).
Further, plasma levels of BCX-4208 increased with dose, and plasma uric acid levels showed
dose-related reductions with BCX-4208. In addition, consistent with interim results previously
reported by us, no evidence of clinical efficacy, a secondary objective, was observed in psoriasis
patients with doses and duration of administration tested.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Phase IIa trial, BCX-4208 was generally safe and well-tolerated at doses up to 120 mg
daily for six (6)&nbsp;weeks. Most adverse events reported were considered mild or moderate, and low in
frequency. No opportunistic infections were observed. In addition, detailed laboratory and clinical
monitoring did not indicate any patterns suggestive of off-target adverse findings.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total revenues increased to $74.6&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 as compared to
$56.6&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008. This increase was driven by $22.9&nbsp;million in
product sales, primarily the $22.5&nbsp;million order of 10,000 courses of i.v. peramivir from HHS, as
well as a $7.0&nbsp;million milestone payment from our partner, Shionogi, related to its filing of an
NDA to seek regulatory approval for i.v. peramivir in Japan. In addition, revenue from the
contract with HHS for the development of peramivir increased by $16.3&nbsp;million during the current
year as two global Phase III studies were initiated. These increases were offset by lower
amortization of deferred revenue from our collaborative arrangements. Specifically, $27.8&nbsp;million
of previously deferred revenue was recognized during the prior year as Roche terminated its
collaboration with us in 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cost of product sales for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 were approximately $4.5&nbsp;million.
Included in cost of product sales is a $4.0&nbsp;million provision for peramivir finished goods
inventory. We expense costs related to the production of inventories as research and development
expenses in the period incurred until such time it is believed that future economic benefit is
expected to be recognized, which generally is reliant upon receipt of regulatory approval. Upon
regulatory approval, we capitalize subsequent costs related to the production of inventories. We
determined that the FDA&#146;s granting of the EUA for peramivir in October&nbsp;2009 was objective and
persuasive evidence that supported capitalization of peramivir inventories manufactured after the
issuance of the EUA. As a result, we recorded manufacturing costs of $4.0&nbsp;million for peramivir
finished goods inventory. However, in preparing our December&nbsp;31, 2009 financial statements, we
evaluated whether the costs capitalized as inventory would be recoverable in a future period.
Given the lack of objective, reliable evidence to support future demand for peramivir, we concluded
that there was no certainty that future sales would materialize and revenues would exceed the costs
incurred. Therefore, the capitalized inventory was fully reserved.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining amounts included in cost of product sales for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009
relate to components, secondary packaging, and royalties and commissions paid to third parties as a
result of the peramivir product sales. No costs for the manufacturing of the peramivir finished
goods were included in cost of product sales, as the manufacturing was completed prior to the
issuance of the EUA.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until we sell the inventory for which costs were previously expensed, our cost of product
sales will reflect only incremental costs incurred subsequent to the issuance of the EUA in October
2009. As such, if we sell that portion of our existing inventory, there will be a period of time
where revenue could be recognized with little or no corresponding cost. Therefore, we anticipate
that the gross margin on future product sales, if any, will fluctuate and not be comparable from
quarter to quarter.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research and development expenses decreased to $72.3&nbsp;million for 2009 from $73.3&nbsp;million for
the prior year due to reductions of $1.3&nbsp;million in clinical development costs, $3.8&nbsp;million in
manufacturing costs, and $0.4&nbsp;million in toxicology costs for the forodesine program, as well as
lower costs of $2.0&nbsp;million related to our pre-clinical compounds and $1.4&nbsp;million in general
operating and personnel related costs. In addition, $8.6&nbsp;million of previously deferred expense
was recognized during the prior year as Roche terminated its collaboration with us in 2008. These
decreases were offset by higher clinical development costs of $7.5&nbsp;million for peramivir and $1.5
million for BCX-4208, as well as an increase of $6.3&nbsp;million in manufacturing and $1.5&nbsp;million in
consulting fees for the peramivir program.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General and administrative expenses increased to $11.5&nbsp;million for 2009 from $10.4&nbsp;million for

ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, compared to $71.2&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007. This
decrease was partially driven by a reduction of $33.7&nbsp;million in revenue from the contract with HHS
for the development of peramivir. During the second quarter of 2008, we recorded a $4.9&nbsp;million
charge to revenues for amounts that were denied reimbursement by HHS related to costs incurred in
the Phase III program of i.m. peramivir for outpatient influenza. We initiated this program and
voluntarily discontinued it following a decision to pursue higher doses in the ongoing Phase II
study. Reimbursement of these costs is under discussion with HHS. Further contributing to the
decrease in collaborative and other R&#038;D revenues from 2007 to 2008 was the receipt of a $7.0
million milestone payment from Shionogi in 2007. This was offset by the recognition of $26.5

compared to $94.1&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007. The decrease in R&#038;D expenses was
due to a reduction in the clinical development costs of $16.3&nbsp;million and toxicology costs of $1.6
million associated with the peramivir program, a reduction in manufacturing costs of $10.3&nbsp;million
and $6.4&nbsp;million associated with the peramivir and forodesine programs, respectively, and a
reduction in costs incurred on our pre-clinical compounds of $0.9&nbsp;million. These reductions were
offset by an increase in our clinical development costs of $2.6&nbsp;million for forodesine, the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the year, our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balance has increased from
$63.3&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2008 to $94.3&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2009. Excluding the
$45.7&nbsp;million registered offering and the $22.5&nbsp;million received from HHS for peramivir
stockpiling, our net cash burn for 2009 was $37.2&nbsp;million, or $3.1&nbsp;million per month. During the
third quarter of 2009, we had announced that our net cash use for 2009 would be near the top end of
the previous guidance range of $30.0 to $38.0&nbsp;million. For 2010, we expect that cash use will be
between $25.0 and $30.0&nbsp;million. Our cash use will vary depending on clinical outcomes and could
vary significantly from our expectations depending on the timing of Company expenses and the
related reimbursement from our collaborators.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As our clinical programs continue to progress and patient enrollment increases, our costs will
increase. Our current and planned clinical trials plus the related development, manufacturing,
regulatory approval process requirements and additional personnel resources and testing required
for the continuing development of our drug candidates will consume significant capital resources
and will increase our expenses. Our expenses, revenues and burn rate could vary significantly
depending on many factors, including our ability to raise additional capital, the development
progress of our collaborative agreements for our drug candidates, the amount and timing of funding
we receive from HHS for peramivir, the amount of funding or assistance, if any, we receive from
other governmental agencies or other new partnerships with third parties for the development of our
drug candidates, the progress and results of our current and proposed clinical trials for our most
advanced drug products, the progress made in the manufacturing of our lead products and the
progression of our other programs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the funds available at December&nbsp;31, 2009 and future amounts that are expected to be
received from HHS, Shionogi, and our other collaborators, we believe these resources will be
sufficient to fund our operations for at least

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have established various accounting policies that govern the application of accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States, which were utilized in the preparation of our
financial statements. Certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by
management that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities.
Management considers such accounting policies to be critical accounting policies. The judgments and
assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors, which are
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Because of the nature of the judgments and
assumptions made by management, actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates,
which could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results
of operations.

understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and affect the more significant
judgments and estimates that we use in the preparation of our financial statements.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the process of preparing financial statements, we are required to estimate accrued
expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with
our applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating
the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not
yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost. The majority of our service providers
invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as
of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to
us. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make
adjustments if necessary. To date, there have been no material changes to our estimates. Examples
of estimated accrued expenses include:

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We base our expenses related to clinical trials on our estimates of the services received and
efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and clinical research
organizations that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf. The financial terms of these
agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven
payment flows. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful
enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones. In accruing service fees,
we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be
expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort
varies from our estimate, we will adjust the accrual accordingly. To date, there have been no
material changes to our estimates. If we do not identify costs that we have begun to incur or if we
underestimate or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of these services, our
actual expenses could differ from our estimates.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Revenue Recognition</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the fourth quarter of 2009, our revenues have generally been limited to license fees,
event payments, research and development fees, government contracts, and interest income. Revenue
from license fees, event payments, and research and development fees are recognized as revenue when
the earnings process is complete and we have no further continuing performance obligations or we
have completed the performance obligations under the terms of the agreement. Fees received under
licensing agreements that are related to future performance are deferred and recognized as earned
over an estimated period determined by management based on the terms of the agreement and the
products licensed. In the event a license agreement contains multiple deliverables, we evaluate
whether the deliverables are separate or combined units of accounting. Revisions to revenue or
profit estimates as a result of changes in the estimated revenue period are recognized
prospectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reimbursements received for direct out-of-pocket expenses related to research and development
costs are recorded as revenue in the income statement rather than as a reduction in expenses. Event
payments are recognized as revenue upon the achievement of specified events if (1)&nbsp;the event is
substantive in nature and the achievement of the event was not reasonably assured at the inception
of the agreement and (2)&nbsp;the fees are non-refundable and non-creditable. Any event payments
received prior to satisfying these criteria are recorded as deferred revenue. Under our contract
with HHS, revenue is recognized as reimbursable direct and indirect costs are incurred.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the fourth quarter of 2009, we recognized revenues related to product sales of
peramivir. Sales are recognized when products are shipped, title and risk of loss have passed, and
collectability is reasonably assured. We did not provide a right of product return in conjunction
with the sales of peramivir during 2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Research and Development Expenses</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our research and development costs are charged to expense when incurred. Advance payments for
goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are
deferred and capitalized. Such amounts are recognized as expense when the related goods are
delivered or the related services are performed. Research and development expenses include, among
other items, personnel costs, including salaries and benefits, manufacturing costs, clinical,
regulatory, and toxicology services performed by contract research organizations (&#147;CROs&#148;),
materials and supplies, and overhead allocations consisting of various administrative and
facilities related costs. Most of our manufacturing and clinical and preclinical studies are
performed by third-party CROs. Costs for studies performed by CROs are accrued by us over the
service periods specified in the contracts and estimates are adjusted, if required, based upon our
on-going review of the level of services actually performed.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, we have license agreements with third parties, such as AECOM, IRL, and UAB,
which require fees related to sublicense agreements or maintenance fees. We expense sublicense
payments as incurred unless they are related to revenues that have been deferred, in which case the
expenses are deferred and recognized over the related revenue recognition period. We expense
maintenance payments as incurred.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2009, we had deferred collaboration expenses of approximately $3.0&nbsp;million.
These deferred expenses were sub-license payments, paid to our academic partners upon receipt of
consideration from various commercial partners. These deferred expenses would not have been
incurred without receipt of such payments from our commercial partners and are being expensed in
proportion to the related revenue being recognized. We believe that this accounting treatment
appropriately matches expenses with the associated revenue.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We group our R&#038;D expenses into two major categories: direct external expenses and all other
R&#038;D expenses. Direct external expenses consist of costs of outside parties to conduct laboratory
studies, to develop manufacturing processes and manufacture the product candidate, to conduct and
manage clinical trials and similar costs related to our clinical and preclinical studies. These
costs are accumulated and tracked by program. All other R&#038;D expenses consist of costs to compensate
personnel, to purchase lab supplies and services, to maintain our facility, equipment and overhead
and similar costs of our research and development efforts. These costs apply to work on our
clinical and preclinical candidates as well as our discovery research efforts. These costs have not
been charged directly to each program historically because the number of product candidates and
projects in research and development may vary from period to period and because we utilize internal
resources across multiple projects at the same time.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, due to the risks inherent in the clinical trial process and given the stages of
our various product development programs, we are unable to estimate with any certainty the costs we
will incur in the continued development of our drug candidates for potential commercialization.
While we are currently focused on advancing each of our development programs, our future R&#038;D
expenses will depend on the determinations we make as to the scientific and clinical success of
each drug candidate, as well as ongoing assessments as to each drug candidate&#146;s commercial
potential. As such, we are unable to predict how we will allocate available resources among our
product development programs in the future. In addition, we cannot forecast with any degree of
certainty the development progress of our existing partnerships for our drug candidates, which drug
candidates will be subject to future collaborations, when such arrangements will be secured, if at
all, and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital
requirements.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The successful development of our drug candidates is uncertain and subject to a number of
risks. We cannot be certain that any of our drug candidates will prove to be safe and effective or
will meet all of the applicable regulatory requirements needed to receive and maintain marketing
approval. Data from preclinical studies and clinical trials are susceptible to varying
interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory clearance. We, the FDA, or other
regulatory authorities may suspend clinical trials at any time if we or they believe that the
subjects participating in such trials are being exposed to unacceptable risks or if such regulatory
agencies find deficiencies in the conduct of the trials or other problems with our products under
development. Delays or rejections may be encountered based on additional governmental regulation,

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective of our investment policy is to ensure the safety and preservation of
invested funds, as well as maintaining liquidity sufficient to meet cash flow requirements. We
place our excess cash with high credit quality financial institutions, commercial companies, and
government agencies in order to limit the amount of credit exposure. Some of the securities we
invest in may have market risk. This means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the
principal amount of the investment to fluctuate. To minimize this risk, we schedule our investments
to have maturities that coincide with our expected cash flow needs, thus avoiding the need to
redeem an investment prior to its maturity date. Accordingly, we do not believe that we have
material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments. Generally, our investments
are not collateralized. We have not realized any significant losses from our investments.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;) is a biotechnology company that designs,
optimizes, and develops novel small-molecule pharmaceuticals that block key enzymes involved in
infectious diseases, cancer, and inflammatory diseases. The Company has progressed two novel
compounds into late-stage pivotal clinical trials; peramivir, an anti-viral for influenza, and
forodesine, a purine nucleoside phosphorylase (&#147;PNP&#148;) inhibitor for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma
(&#147;CTCL&#148;). Utilizing crystallography and structure-based drug design, the Company continues to
discover additional compounds and to progress others through pre-clinical and early development to
address the unmet medical needs of patients and physicians.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Basis of Presentation</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States. Such financial statements reflect all adjustments that
are, in management&#146;s opinion, necessary to present fairly, in all material respects, the Company&#146;s
financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. There were no adjustments other than
normal recurring adjustments.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Cash and Cash Equivalents</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company generally considers cash equivalents to be all cash held in commercial checking
accounts, money market accounts or investments in debt instruments with maturities of three months
or less at the time of purchase.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Restricted Cash</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2009, the Company initiated a new corporate card program. As a result, the Company was
required to place $625,000 into an interest bearing money market account to serve as collateral for
the program.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Marketable Securities</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective of the Company&#146;s investment policy is to ensure the safety and preservation of
invested funds, as well as maintaining liquidity sufficient to meet cash flow requirements. The
Company places its excess cash with high credit quality financial institutions, commercial
companies, and government agencies in order to limit the amount of credit exposure. Some of the
securities the Company invests in may have market risk. This means that a change in prevailing
interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate. To minimize this
risk, the Company schedules its investments with maturities that coincide with expected cash flow
needs, thus avoiding the need to redeem an investment prior to its maturity date. Accordingly, the
Company does not believe that it has a material exposure to interest rate risk arising from its
investments. Generally, the Company&#146;s investments are not collateralized. The Company has not
realized any significant losses from its investments.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company classifies all of its marketable securities as available-for-sale. Unrealized
gains and losses on securities available-for-sale are recognized in other comprehensive income,
unless an unrealized loss is considered to be other than temporary, in which case the unrealized
loss is charged to operations. The Company periodically reviews its securities available-for-sale
for other than temporary declines in fair value below cost basis and whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. At December
31, 2009, the Company believes that the costs of its securities are recoverable in all material
respects.

$5,828,384 related to indirect cost rate adjustments for 2007, 2008, and 2009. These adjustments
are calculated as the difference between the actual indirect costs incurred against the contract
during a calendar year and the indirect costs that are invoiced at a provisional billing rate
during the calendar year. Because these adjustment amounts represent actual costs incurred in
performance of the contract and the costs are allowable, reasonable, and allocable to the contract,
the Company has recorded revenue accordingly. The Company&#146;s calculations of its indirect cost
rates are subject to an audit by the federal government. The Company does not anticipate receiving
payment for these indirect cost rate adjustments until those audits have been completed.

supplies (vials, stoppers, and seals) that are unused and have an alternative future use should
sales of peramivir fail to materialize. The raw materials on hand as of December&nbsp;31, 2009 are
related to bulk peramivir active pharmaceutical ingredient (&#147;API&#148;) manufactured for Shionogi &#038; Co.,
Ltd. (&#147;Shionogi&#148;) and shipped by the Company subsequent to year-end.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company expenses costs related to the production of inventories as research and
development expenses in the period incurred until such time it is believed that future economic
benefit is expected to be recognized, which generally is reliant upon receipt of regulatory
approval. Upon regulatory approval, the Company capitalizes subsequent costs related to the
production of inventories.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company determined that the FDA&#146;s granting of the Emergency Use Authorization (&#147;EUA&#148;) for
peramivir in October&nbsp;2009 was objective and persuasive evidence that supported capitalization of
peramivir inventories manufactured after the issuance of the EUA. As a result, the Company
recorded manufacturing costs of $3,968,406 for peramivir finished goods inventory. Prior to the
issuance of the EUA, all costs associated with the manufacturing of peramivir were expensed as
research and development expenses.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In preparing the Company&#146;s December&nbsp;31, 2009 financial statements, the Company evaluated
whether the costs capitalized as inventory would be recoverable in a future period. Given the lack
of objective, reliable evidence to support future demand for peramivir, management concluded that
there was no certainty that future sales will materialize and revenues will exceed the costs
incurred. Therefore, the capitalized inventory was fully reserved. This reserve was charged to
cost of products sold within the Company&#146;s Statements of Operations.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furniture and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line
method with estimated useful lives of five and seven years. Laboratory equipment, office equipment,
and software are depreciated over a life of five years. Furniture and fixtures are depreciated over
a life of seven years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over their estimated useful lives or
the remaining lease term, whichever is less.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the Company periodically reviews
its furniture and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Determination of recoverability is based
on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its
eventual disposition. In the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to
recover the carrying amount of the assets, the assets are written down to their estimated fair
values. Furniture and equipment to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or
fair value less cost to sell.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company&#146;s revenues have generally been limited to
license fees, event payments, research and development fees, government contracts, and interest
income. Revenue from license fees, event payments, and research and development fees are recognized
as revenue when the earnings process is complete and the Company has no further continuing
performance obligations or the Company has completed the performance obligations under the terms of
the agreement. Fees received under licensing agreements that are related to future performance are
deferred and recognized over an estimated period determined by management based on the terms of the
agreement and the products licensed. In the event a license agreement contains multiple
deliverables, the Company evaluates whether the deliverables are separate or combined units of
accounting. Revisions to revenue or profit estimates as a result of changes in the estimated
revenue period are recognized prospectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reimbursements received for direct out-of-pocket expenses related to research and development
costs are recorded as revenue in the income statement rather than as a reduction in expenses. Event
payments are recognized as revenue upon the achievement of specified events if (1)&nbsp;the event is
substantive in nature and the achievement of the event was not reasonably assured at the inception
of the agreement and (2)&nbsp;the fees are non-refundable and non-creditable. Any event payments
received prior to satisfying these criteria are recorded as deferred revenue. Under the Company&#146;s
contract with HHS, revenue is recognized as reimbursable direct and indirect costs are incurred.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company recognized revenues related to product sales of
peramivir. Sales are recognized when products are shipped, title and risk of loss have passed, and
collectability is reasonably assured. The Company did not provide a right of product return in
conjunction with the sales of peramivir during 2009.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Research and Development Expenses</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s research and development costs are charged to expense when incurred. Advance
payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development
activities are deferred and capitalized. Such amounts are recognized as expense when the related
goods are delivered or the related services are performed. Research and development expenses
include, among other items, personnel costs, including salaries and benefits, manufacturing costs,
clinical, regulatory, and toxicology services performed by CROs, materials and supplies, and
overhead allocations consisting of various administrative and facilities related costs. Most of the
Company&#146;s manufacturing and clinical and preclinical studies are performed by third-party CROs.
Costs for studies performed by CROs are accrued by the Company over the service periods specified
in the contracts and estimates are adjusted, if required, based upon the Company&#146;s on-going review
of the level of services actually performed.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, the Company has license agreements with third parties, such as Albert Einstein
College of Medicine of Yeshiva University (&#147;AECOM&#148;), Industrial Research, Ltd. (&#147;IRL&#148;), and the
University of Alabama at Birmingham (&#147;UAB&#148;), which require fees related to sublicense agreements or
maintenance fees. The Company expenses sublicense payments as incurred unless they are related to
revenues that have been deferred, in which case the expenses are deferred and recognized over the
related revenue recognition period. The Company expenses maintenance payments as incurred.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2009, the Company had deferred collaboration expenses of approximately
$3,000,462. These deferred expenses were sub-license payments, paid to the Company&#146;s academic
partners upon receipt of consideration from various commercial partners. These deferred expenses
would not have been incurred without receipt of such payments from the Company&#146;s commercial
partners and are being expensed in proportion to the related revenue being recognized. The Company
believes that this accounting treatment appropriately matches expenses with the associated revenue.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Stock-Based Compensation</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All share-based payments, including grants of stock option awards and restricted stock awards,
are recognized in the Company&#146;s income statement based on their fair values. Stock-based
compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is
recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Net Loss Per Share</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Net loss per share is based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during the period. Diluted loss per share is equivalent to basic net loss per share for all periods
presented herein because common equivalent shares from unexercised stock options, outstanding
warrants, and common shares expected to be issued under the Company&#146;s employee stock purchase plan
were anti-dilutive.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Use of Estimates</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the amounts reported in the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of the Company&#146;s deferred tax assets relate to net operating loss and research
and development carryforwards that can only be realized if the Company is profitable in future
periods. It is uncertain whether the Company will realize any tax benefit related to these
carryforwards. Accordingly, the Company has provided a full valuation allowance against the net deferred
tax assets due to uncertainties as to their ultimate realization. The valuation allowance will
remain at the full amount of the deferred tax assets until it is more likely than not that the
related tax benefits will be realized. The Company&#146;s valuation allowance increased by $9,139,633
in 2009, $8,476,111 in 2008, and $16,143,862 in 2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2009, the Company had net federal operating loss carryforwards of
$187,427,790, net state operating loss carryforwards of $224,656,598, and research and development
credit carryforwards of $32,115,994, all of which expire at various dates from 2010 through 2029.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s net federal and state operating loss carryforwards include $3,913,479 of
excess tax benefits related to a deduction from the exercise of
stock options. The tax benefit of these deductions has not been
recognized in deferred tax assets. If utilized,
the benefits from these deductions will be recorded as adjustments
to income tax expense and additional paid-in capital.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company recognizes the impact of a tax position in its financial statements if it is more likely than not that
the position will be sustained on audit based on the technical merits of the position.  The Company has concluded
that it has one uncertain tax position pertaining to its research and development credit carryforwards.  The Company
 has not yet conducted an in-depth study of its research and development credits.  This study could result in an
increase or decrease to the Company&#146;s research and development credits. Until studies are conducted of the
Company&#146;s research and development credits, no amounts are being recorded as an unrecognized tax benefits,
separate from the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets.  Any future changes to the Company&#146;s
unrecognized tax benefits would be offset by an adjustment to the valuation allowance and there would be no impact
on the Company&#146;s financial statements.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, utilization of the Company&#146;s net operating loss carryforwards could be subject to a substantial
annual limitation due to ownership change limitations described in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and
similar state provisions. The annual limitations could result in the expiration of net operating loss carryforwards
before utilization. The Company has not performed a Section 382 change in control study since 2007 in order to
determine if there is an annual limitation on the amount of net operating loss carryforward that can be deducted in
any single year.  However, it is not anticipated that any such analysis would have an impact on the Company&#146;s
financial statements as a result of offsetting changes in the valuation allowance.</div>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November&nbsp;2009, the Company entered into an Underwriting Agreement with Morgan Stanley in
connection with a registered offering of 5,000,000 shares of its common stock at a public offering
price of $9.75 per share, resulting in proceeds net of offering costs of $45,740,190. The common
stock was issued pursuant to a prospectus supplement filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission pursuant to Rule&nbsp;424(b)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (&#147;the Securities
Act&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In August&nbsp;2007, the Company entered into a Stock and Warrant Purchase Agreement with a group
of existing stockholders for the private placement of 8,315,513 shares of the Company&#146;s common
stock at a purchase price of $7.80 per share and warrants to purchase 3,159,895 shares of the
Company&#146;s common stock at a purchase price of $0.125 per warrant. The proceeds from the sale, net
of offering costs, were $65,118,092. The exercise price of the warrants is $10.25 per share. All
of the warrants remain outstanding as of December&nbsp;31, 2009 and will expire in August&nbsp;2012. The
participants in the transaction included funds managed by Baker Brothers Investments, Kleiner
Perkins Caufield &#038; Byers, EHS Holdings, OrbiMed Advisors, Texas Pacific Group Ventures, and
Stephens Investment Management, all of whom were shareholders of the Company at the time of the
offering. Subsequent to the offering, the Company registered the shares and warrants under the
Securities Act for resale.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In May&nbsp;2007, the stockholders approved an amendment to the Company&#146;s third restated
certificate of incorporation to increase the number of shares of common stock authorized to issue
from 45,000,000 to 95,000,000. All shares of the Company&#146;s common stock, including the additional
shares authorized by the amendment, are equal in rank and have the same voting, dividend, and
liquidation rights.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June&nbsp;2002, the Company&#146;s Board of Directors adopted a stockholder rights plan and, pursuant
thereto, issued preferred stock purchase rights (&#147;Rights&#148;) to the holders of the Company&#146;s common
stock. The Rights have certain anti-takeover effects. If triggered, the Rights would cause
substantial dilution to a person or group of persons who acquires more than 15% (19.9% for William
W. Featheringill, a Director who owned more than 15% at the time the Rights were put in place) of
the Company&#146;s common stock on terms not approved by the Board of Directors. In August&nbsp;2007, this
plan was amended for a transaction involving funds managed by or affiliated with Baker Brother
Investments such that they could purchase up to 25% without triggering the Rights. The rights are
not exercisable until the distribution date, as defined in the Rights Agreement by and between the
Company and American Stock Transfer &#038; Trust Company, as Rights Agent. The Rights will expire at the
close of business on June&nbsp;24, 2012, unless that final expiration date is extended or unless the
rights are earlier redeemed or exchanged by the Company.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company one one-thousandth of a
share of Series&nbsp;B Junior Participating Preferred Stock (&#147;Series&nbsp;B&#148;), par value $0.001 per share, at
a purchase price of $26.00, subject to adjustment. Shares of Series&nbsp;B purchasable upon exercise of
the Rights will not be redeemable. Each share of Series&nbsp;B will be entitled to a dividend of 1,000
times the dividend declared per share of common stock. In the event of liquidation, each share of
Series&nbsp;B will be entitled to a payment of 1,000 times the payment made per share of common stock.
Each share of Series&nbsp;B will have 1,000 votes, voting together with the common stock. Finally, in
the event of any merger, consolidation, or other transaction in which shares of common stock are
exchanged, each share of Series&nbsp;B will be entitled to receive 1,000 times the amount received per
share of common stock. Effective in November&nbsp;2008, the Company increased the authorized shares
available under these rights to 95,000 to match the authorized common shares of 95,000,000 at that
time. In addition, the Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to 4,905,000 shares of
undesignated preferred stock and to determine the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions
of those shares without further vote or action by the Company&#146;s stockholders.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B><I>Stock Incentive Plan</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2009, the Company had two stock-based employee compensation plans, the
Stock Incentive Plan (&#147;Incentive Plan&#148;), which was amended and restated in February&nbsp;2009 and
approved by the Company&#146;s stockholders in April&nbsp;2009, and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan
(&#147;ESPP&#148;), which was amended and restated in February&nbsp;2008 and approved by the Company&#146;s
stockholders in May&nbsp;2008. In addition, during 2007, the Company made an inducement grant outside of
the Incentive Plan and ESPP to recruit a new employee to a key position within the Company.
Stock-based compensation expense of $5,524,883 ($5,140,487 of expense related to the Incentive
Plan, $234,692 of expense related to the ESPP, and $149,704 of expense related to the inducement
grant) was recognized during 2009, while $5,860,654 ($5,545,458 of expense related to the Incentive
Plan, $165,492 of expense related to the ESPP, and $149,704 of expense related to the inducement
grant) was recognized during 2008 and $5,691,028 ($5,428,505 of expense related to the Incentive
Plan, $150,245 of expense related to the ESPP, and $112,278 of expense related to the inducement
grant) was recognized during 2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Incentive Plan, the Company grants stock option awards and restricted stock awards
to its employees, directors, and consultants. Stock option awards are granted with an exercise
price equal to the market price of the Company&#146;s stock at the date of grant. Stock option awards
granted to employees generally vest 25% after one year and monthly thereafter on a pro rata basis
over the next three years until fully vested after four years. Stock option awards granted to
non-employee directors of the Company generally vest over one year. All stock option awards have
contractual terms of 10&nbsp;years. The vesting exercise provisions of all awards granted under the
Incentive Plan are subject to acceleration in the event of certain stockholder-approved
transactions, or upon the occurrence of a change in control as defined in the Incentive Plan.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For stock option awards granted under the Incentive Plan during 2009, 2008, and 2007, the fair
value was estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model and the
assumptions noted in the table below. The weighted average grant date fair value of these awards
granted during 2009, 2008, and 2007 was $1.52, $2.16 and $6.16, respectively. The fair value of the
stock option awards is amortized to expense over the vesting periods using a straight-line expense
attribution method. The following explanations describe the assumptions used by the Company to
value the stock option awards granted during 2009, 2008, and 2007. The expected life is based on
the average of the assumption that all outstanding stock option awards will be exercised at full
vesting and the assumption that all outstanding stock option awards will be exercised at the
midpoint of the current date (if already vested) or at full vesting (if not yet vested) and the
full contractual term. The expected volatility represents an

of seasonal and potentially life-threatening human influenza. Under the terms of the agreement,
Shionogi obtained rights to injectable formulations of peramivir in Japan in exchange for a $14.0
million up-front payment. The license provides for potential future milestone event payments (up to
$21.0&nbsp;million) and commercial event milestone payments (up to $95.0&nbsp;million) in addition to double
digit (between 10 and 20% range) royalty payments on product sales of peramivir. Generally, all
payments under the agreement are nonrefundable and non-creditable, but they are subject to audit.
Shionogi will be responsible for all development, regulatory, and marketing costs in Japan. The

specified by the agreement. The agreement will continue for the commercial life of the licensed
products, but may be terminated by either party following an uncured material breach by the other
party or in the event the pre-existing third party license with AECOM and IRL expires. It may be
terminated by Mundipharma upon 60&nbsp;days written notice without cause or under certain other
conditions as specified in the agreement and all rights, data, materials, products and other

to collaborative arrangements on January&nbsp;1, 2009. This guidance defines collaborative arrangements
and establishes reporting requirements for transactions between participants in collaborative
arrangements. This guidance has been applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented for
significant collaborative arrangements existing as of the effective date. See Notes 1 and 10 for
additional information.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company adopted the provisions of the FASB Staff Position (&#147;FSP&#148;) relating to investments
on January&nbsp;1, 2009. This FSP amends the other-than-temporary recognition guidance for debt
securities and requires additional interim and annual disclosures of other-than-temporary
impairments on debt and equity securities. Pursuant to the new guidance, an other-than-temporary
impairment has occurred if a company does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of
the security. In this situation, if the company does not intend to sell the impaired security, and
it is not more likely than not it will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its
amortized cost basis, the amount of the other-than-temporary impairment recognized in earnings is
limited to the portion attributed

recorded in other comprehensive income (loss). This FSP has been applied to existing and new

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2009, the Company adopted the provisions of the FASB Statement on subsequent events. This
Statement provides authoritative accounting literature and disclosure requirements for material
events occurring subsequent to the balance sheet date and prior to the issuance of the financial
statements. The implementation of this Statement had no effect on the Company&#146;s financial
statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2009, the FASB ratified EITF guidance related to revenue recognition that amends the
previous guidance on arrangements with multiple deliverables. This guidance provides principles and
application guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist, how the arrangements should be
separated, and how the consideration should be allocated. It also clarifies the method to allocate
revenue in an arrangement using the estimated selling price. This guidance is effective for the
Company on January&nbsp;1, 2011. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this guidance on its
