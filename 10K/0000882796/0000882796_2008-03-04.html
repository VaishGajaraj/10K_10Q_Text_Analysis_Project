</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Overview</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a biotechnology company that designs, optimizes and develops
novel drugs that block key enzymes involved in cancer, viral infections and autoimmune diseases.
BioCryst integrates the necessary disciplines of biology, crystallography, medicinal chemistry and
computer modeling to effectively use structure-based drug design to discover and develop small
molecule pharmaceuticals.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our lead product candidate, forodesine HCl, is a transition-state analog inhibitor of the
target enzyme purine nucleoside phosphorylase (&#147;PNP&#148;). An oral formulation of the compound is
currently in a Phase IIb trial, which is planned to be a pivotal trial, for patients with Cutaneous
T-cell Lymphoma (&#147;CTCL&#148;). The trial is being conducted under a special protocol assessment (&#147;SPA&#148;)
negotiated with the United States Food and Drug Administration (&#147;FDA&#148;). Additionally, forodesine
HCl is currently being studied in a Phase II trial with an oral formulation in Chronic Lymphocytic
Leukemia (&#147;CLL&#148;). Forodesine HCl has been granted Orphan Drug status by the FDA for three
indications: T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, including CTCL; CLL and related leukemias including
T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, adult T-cell leukemia, and hairy cell leukemia; and for treatment
of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (&#147;B-ALL&#148;). In December&nbsp;2007, we announced the presentation
of data related to the Phase I/II clinical study of forodesine HCl in subjects with refractory CTCL
and a poster detailing the in vitro activity of forodesine HCl and the synergistic in vitro
activity of forodesine HCl with bendamustine in primary cells from 29 patients with CLL. These data
were presented at the 2007 American Society of Hematology meeting. Also, use of forodesine HCl is
being explored, alone and in combination with other commonly used cancer treatments, for use in
other cancers. Since February&nbsp;2006, we have had an exclusive licensing agreement with Mundipharma
International Holdings Limited (&#147;Mundipharma&#148;) to develop and commercialize forodesine HCl in
markets across the European Union (the &#147;EU&#148;), Asia and Australia for use in oncology.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our second most advanced drug candidate is peramivir, an inhibitor of influenza neuraminidase.
Peramivir is in development for the treatment of influenza with two parenteral formulations,
intramuscular (&#147;i.m.&#148;) and intravenous (&#147;i.v.&#148;). We recently completed a double-blind
placebo-controlled Phase II clinical trial with i.m. peramivir testing two different dose levels of
peramivir (150mg and 300mg) versus placebo in adults with acute uncomplicated influenza. While the
trial did not demonstrate statistically significant differences for its primary endpoint of time to
alleviation of symptoms, the preliminary analysis of the virologic data indicated that peramivir
demonstrated statistically significant reductions in influenza virus shedding in both peramivir
treatment groups compared to placebo, with greater reductions in the 300mg dose. With this
information and the additional pharmacokinetic information we have obtained subsequent to the
trial, we are planning to initiate another Phase II clinical trial later in 2008 to evaluate the
300mg dose of peramivir as well as a higher dose of peramivir versus placebo. In addition, in July
2007, we announced the initiation of a Phase II clinical trial in hospitalized patients using an
i.v. formulation of peramivir to compare the efficacy and safety of i.v. peramivir to orally
administered oseltamivir in patients who require hospitalization due to acute influenza.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January&nbsp;2007, we announced the United States Department of Health and Human Services
(&#147;HHS&#148;) had awarded the Company a $102.6&nbsp;million, four-year contract for the advanced development
of peramivir. In January&nbsp;2008, we announced that the development costs of our peramivir program to
anticipated product approval would cost in excess of the $102.6&nbsp;million contract since the
development plan for peramivir had changed from that outlined in the original proposal to HHS. HHS
has indicated that they will fund certain elements of our revised program, including the ongoing
Phase II i.v. study evaluating peramivir in hospitalized subjects, the planning and conduct of the
planned Phase II study of i.m. peramivir and the manufacturing and toxicology components of the
program. Each of these elements has specific HHS funding limits and any costs outside the amounts
approved by HHS may be the responsibility of the Company. The original contract of $102.6&nbsp;million
and the four year term remain unchanged.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
March&nbsp;2007, we announced our collaboration with Shionogi &#038;
Co., Ltd. (&#147;Shionogi&#148;) for the development
and commercialization of peramivir in Japan. This exclusive license agreement for Japan included an
upfront payment of $14&nbsp;million and future clinical event milestone payments of up to $21&nbsp;million.
In December&nbsp;2007, we received a $7&nbsp;million milestone payment for their initiation of a Phase II
clinical trial with the i.v. formulation of peramivir for the treatment of seasonal influenza.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our other drug candidate in clinical trials is our second generation PNP inhibitor, BCX-4208.
Since November&nbsp;2005, this program has been funded through an exclusive worldwide licensing
agreement with F.Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd and Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. (&#147;Roche&#148;) to develop and
commercialize BCX-4208/R3421 for the prevention of acute rejection in transplantation and for the
treatment of autoimmune diseases. In July&nbsp;2007, we announced that Roche had initiated a Phase II
clinical trial with oral doses of BCX-4208/R3421, which is designed to evaluate the drug candidate
in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our business strategy is to increase the value of our drug candidate portfolio. We believe
this is best achieved by retaining full product rights to our drug candidates within specialty
markets, while relying on collaborative arrangements with third parties for drug candidates within
larger markets or outside our area of expertise. Potential third party alliances could include
preclinical development, clinical development, regulatory approval, marketing, sales and
distribution of our drug candidates.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We use structure-based drug design technologies to develop innovative, small-molecule
pharmaceuticals to treat a variety of diseases and disorders. We focus our drug discovery efforts
on building potent, selective inhibitors of enzymes associated with targeted diseases. Enzymes are
proteins that cause or enable biological reactions necessary for the progression of the disease or
disorder. The specific enzymes on which we focus are called enzyme targets. We aim to design
compounds that will inhibit an enzyme target by fitting the active site of a particular enzyme.
Inhibition means interfering with the functioning of an enzyme target, thereby stopping or slowing
the progression of the disease or disorder. The principal elements of our strategy are:

to eliminate unpromising candidates from consideration sooner without incurring substantial
clinical costs. In addition, we select drug candidates on the basis of their potential for
relatively efficient Phase I and Phase II clinical trials that require fewer patients to
initially indicate safety and efficacy. We will consider, however, more complex candidates
with longer development cycles if we believe that they offer promising commercial
opportunities.</TD>

this respective research to significantly reduce the time, cost and risks involved in drug
development. Our collaborative relationships with such organizations may lead to the licensing
of one or more drug targets or compounds. Upon licensing a drug target or promising compound
from one of these institutions, the scientists from the institution typically become working

believe partnerships are a good source of development payments, license fees, future event
payments and royalties. They also reduce the costs and risks, and increase the effectiveness,
of late-stage product development, regulatory approval, manufacturing and marketing. We
believe that focusing on discovery and early-stage drug development while benefiting from our

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Overview</I>. The human immune system employs specialized cells, including T-cells, to control
infection by recognizing and attacking disease-causing viruses, bacteria and parasites. T-cells are
an essential part of the body&#146;s immune system that serve a dual purpose to both orchestrate and
participate in the body&#146;s immune response. For the most part, this system works flawlessly to
protect the body. However, when T-cells multiply uncontrollably, T-cell proliferative diseases,
such as T-cell cancers, can occur.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The link between T-cell proliferation and the purine nucleoside phosphorylase, or PNP, enzyme
was first discovered approximately twenty-five years ago when a patient, who was genetically
deficient in PNP, exhibited limited T-cell activity, but reasonably normal activity of other immune
functions. In other patients lacking PNP activity, the T-cell population was selectively depleted;
however, B-cell function tended to be normal. Based on these findings and the results of cell
culture studies, inhibiting PNP appears to produce primarily suppression of T-cells without
significantly impairing the function of other non-lymphoid cells.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia</I>. The most common form of leukemia in children is acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (&#147;ALL&#148;). According to the American Cancer Society, 5,200 new cases (adult
and children combined) will be diagnosed in the United States in 2007 (T-cell and B-cell). ALL
results from an acquired injury to the DNA of a single cell in the bone marrow.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>T-cell Lymphoma</I>. Lymphoma is a general term for a group of cancers that originate in the
lymphatic system. About 63,190 Americans will be diagnosed with a non-Hodgkin lymphoma in 2007 and

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">these will be considered T-cell lymphomas. T-cell lymphoma results when a
T-lymphocyte (a type of white blood cell) undergoes a malignant change and begins to multiply,
eventually crowding out healthy cells and creating
tumors, which enlarge the lymph nodes and invade other sites in the body. CTCL is a primary
skin neoplasm and accounts for nearly 50% of all T-cell malignancies.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>T-cell Mediated Autoimmune Diseases. </I>There are more than 80 clinically distinct autoimmune
diseases such as psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and Crohn&#146;s disease, which
appear to have activated T-cells as a major part of their pathogenesis. These diseases occur when
the immune system attacks the body&#146;s own cells rather than invading microorganisms. Therefore,
inhibition and/or elimination of activated T-cells could have a beneficial effect on these
diseases.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Transplant Rejection. </I>The greatest threat to transplant patients is rejection of the
transplanted organ by the body&#146;s own immune system. For this reason, transplant recipients must
take drugs to suppress the immune response and prevent rejection usually for the rest of their
lives. A regimen combining several drugs is usually given and this treatment has to be continued
indefinitely. For kidney transplant recipients, rejection of the new kidney by the patient&#146;s immune
system can lead to loss of the transplanted organ and a return to dialysis. For heart, lung and
liver transplant patients, loss of the transplanted organ presents an immediate threat to life.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>B-cell Related Cancers</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Overview</I>. There are two types of lymphocytes in the broadest sense &#151; T-cells and B-cells.
Although PNP inhibitors were developed specifically to block the T-cells, recent work indicates
that the same biochemical event &#151; the intracellular accumulation of deoxyguanosine triphosphate
(&#147;dGTP&#148;) also occurs in malignant B-cells. Furthermore, work of Dr.&nbsp;Varsha Gandhi at MD Anderson
Cancer Center has shown that PNP inhibitors, when acting <I>in vitro </I>on B-cells from patients with CLL
induce accumulation of dGTP with resultant apoptosis (cell death).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These studies open the possibility of treating CLL, B-ALL and B-cell non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
(&#147;NHL&#148;)&nbsp;with forodesine HCl. Importantly, B-cell malignancies are considerably more prevalent than
are the T-cell leukemias and lymphomas.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Our PNP Inhibitor(s)</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>PNP Inhibition</I>. PNP is an enzyme that plays an important role in T-cell proliferation, because
it is necessary to maintain normal DNA synthesis in human T-cells. Selective inhibition of PNP
causes certain nucleosides, including deoxyguanosine, to accumulate. As the concentration of
deoxyguanosine increases within T-cells, it is converted by specific enzymes to dGTP. A high
concentration of dGTP in T-cells causes an imbalance in the intra-cellular trinucleotide pool and
thus causes cell death.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June&nbsp;2000, we licensed a series of potent PNP inhibitors from AECOM and IRL. The lead drug
candidate from this collaboration, forodesine HCl, is a more potent inhibitor of human lymphocyte
proliferation than other previously known PNP inhibitors. Clinical data in our past and ongoing
clinical trials, plus extensive preclinical studies indicate that forodesine HCl can modulate
T-cell activities. Forodesine HCl is an investigational PNP inhibitor for the potential treatment
of T-cell leukemias and lymphomas. In February&nbsp;2006, we licensed forodesine HCl to Mundipharma to
develop and commercialize in markets across Europe, Asia and Australia for use in oncology.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2002, we exercised the option to add a new compound, BCX-4208, to the series of
inhibitors of PNP licensed from AECOM and IRL. Preclinical results indicated that BCX-4208 was a
more potent inhibitor than forodesine HCl. We completed a Phase I single ascending dose clinical
trial and a Phase Ib multi-dose clinical trial, both in healthy volunteers. In November&nbsp;2005, we
licensed BCX-4208 to Roche for the world wide development and commercialization in autoimmune
diseases and transplant rejection.

2002, was a Phase I clinical trial that enrolled T-ALL patients at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center
in Houston, Texas. Simultaneously, there were preclinical studies being conducted at the M.D.
Anderson Cancer Center which indicated that forodesine HCl induces the same biochemical changes in
various other types of leukemia cells that are responsible for the inhibition of T-leukemia cells.
The results of these preclinical studies led us to expand beyond the single starting trial in T-ALL
by initiating additional clinical trials for refractory patients with B-ALL, CTCL, CLL, and other
hematologic malignancies. Based on the encouraging results of these initial studies, we are
working with our partner, Mundipharma, to develop a strategy for the simultaneous development of
forodesine HCl in multiple indications and in potential combination therapies.

October&nbsp;2007, we initiated a planned pivotal trial with an oral formulation of forodesine HCl for
treatment of patients with CTCL. This trial is being conducted under an SPA agreement negotiated
with the FDA and will serve as a basis for a new drug application to the FDA using the oral
formulations in patients with relapsed CTCL.

forodesine HCl induces the same biochemical changes in various other types of leukemia cells that
are responsible for the inhibition of T-leukemia cells, we initiated two small clinical studies
late in 2005 in B-cell leukemias, which are more prevalent than T-cell leukemias. First, we
initiated a Phase II trial with oral forodesine HCl in patients with CLL in an advanced stage and
refractory to fludarabine, a current standard therapy. Our initial trial has been amended so that
any potential subject who had fludarabine treatment in the past is now eligible. This trial is
on-going.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We initiated a Phase I/II clinical trial of forodesine HCl to determine the safety of repeat

data are thoroughly analyzed, we will review the results with Mundipharma to determine the best
clinical development strategy going forward.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January&nbsp;2007, we
initiated a Phase IIb multicenter, open-label, non-randomized repeat-dose registration study to
evaluate an intravenous treatment of forodesine HCl followed by an oral treatment of forodesine HCl
in patients with relapsed or refractory T-ALL. This study was being
conducted under an SPA negotiated with the FDA and was designed to determine the rate of
complete remission achieved with forodesine HCl. In March&nbsp;2007, we announced that as a result of a
stability issue with the i.v. formulation, that we were voluntarily placing this Phase IIb clinical
trial on hold pending internal review and discussions with our partner, Mundipharma. In December
2007, we announced the formal termination of this study.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February&nbsp;2006, we and Mundipharma entered into an exclusive license agreement to develop
and commercialize forodesine HCl in markets across Europe, Asia and Australia for use in oncology.
The agreement covers a number of markets in Asia and Australasia including Japan, Australia, New
Zealand, China and India. This collaboration should help maximize the global development,

BCX-4208 differs from forodesine HCl in significant ways. For example, BCX-4208 is more potent, and
has the ability to suppress PNP for longer periods of time. Thus, BCX-4208 has potential advantages
over forodesine HCl for the treatment of diseases requiring long-term, chronic administration of a
PNP inhibitor. Psoriasis is a chronic and often painful and debilitating disease

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Seasonal Influenza. </I>Seasonal influenza, commonly known as the flu, is a viral infection
characterized by symptoms including fever, cough, sore throat, fatigue, headache, and/or chills.
According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (&#147;CDC&#148;), an estimated 5% to 20% of
the American population suffers from influenza annually, there are an estimated 200,000 influenza
associated hospitalizations, and influenza is responsible for approximately 36,000 deaths annually.
Influenza is particularly dangerous to the elderly, young children and people with certain health
conditions. Outbreaks of seasonal flu tend to follow predictable patterns usually occurring in the
winter. New vaccines are developed annually based on known flu strains and are usually available
for the annual flu season. There are also antiviral treatments available for the treatment of
people infected with influenza.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Avian Influenza</I>. According to information from the CDC, avian influenza, or bird flu is an
infection caused by viruses which occur naturally among birds. This form of flu is very contagious
among birds and can lead to serious illness and sometimes death. There are two main forms of
disease that infect domestic poultry, one a low pathogenic form and the other a highly pathogenic
form. The latter form can cause disease that affects multiple internal organs and with a mortality
rate between 90-100% in these birds within 2&nbsp;days.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While there are many different subtypes of the influenza A virus, only two subtypes are known
to be currently circulating among humans. Avian influenza A viruses are found chiefly in birds, but
there have been confirmed cases of infection in humans, generally as a result of contact with
infected birds. These infections have led to symptoms ranging from those of normal flu to more
severe and life threatening conditions. Influenza A (&#147;H5N1&#148;) is a subtype of an influenza virus
that is highly contagious among birds and can be very deadly to them. Of the avian influenza
viruses that have crossed the species barrier to infect humans, the H5N1 virus has caused the
largest number of detected cases of severe disease and death in humans. Thus far, person to person
spread of this virus is considered extremely rare, but as influenza A viruses constantly change,
they could mutate over time to have the ability to spread rapidly among humans.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Pandemic Influenza</I>. Pandemic influenza is a global disease outbreak that occurs when a new
influenza virus emerges so that people have had no previous exposure. This situation occurs very
rarely and only occurred three times in the 20<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">th</SUP> century.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Influenza Prevention and Treatment</I>. The development of effective therapeutics has challenged
medical researchers due to the seasonal variation in viral strains and the highly infectious nature
of influenza. Patients, therefore, have limited treatment options. Amantadine and rimantadine are
used for treatment of influenza A but are ineffective against influenza B. In addition, these drugs
cause some adverse side effects, and the virus tends to develop resistance to these drugs. The CDC
has recommended against the use of amantadine and rimantadine for
the treatment or prophylaxis of influenza in the United States until susceptibility to these
antiviral medications has been re-established among circulating influenza A viruses.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vaccines are available against the disease but have limitations: people require advance
vaccination; vaccines are limited by their specificity to particular strains of the virus; and
vaccines offer little protection if the strain of influenza that circulates is different from that
present in the vaccine. In addition, many people decline the required injections because of fear
and/or discomfort. The ability of the virus to change its structure to avoid the body&#146;s natural
defenses is a serious obstacle to developing an effective vaccine against influenza. Different
strains can arise when surface antigens on the virus (the portion of the virus that causes an
immune reaction in humans) undergo minor genetic mutations each year as the virus replicates.
Because of this mutability, the immunity acquired in response to infection by a particular strain
of the virus does not provide adequate protection against viruses that subsequently arise. The
production of a new vaccine each year is not only complex and expensive, but also an inefficient
method of global disease control.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Inhibiting Influenza Neuraminidase. </I>Research during the past two decades has seen dramatic
advances in understanding the molecular structure and function of the influenza virus. Considerable
attention has been focused on the enzyme neuraminidase, which is located on the surface of the
virus. Neuraminidase assists in the release and spread of the flu virus by breaking the chemical
strands that hold the new viruses to the cell surface, allowing the replicated virus to spread and
infect other cells. This process progresses until the host&#146;s immune response can produce enough
antibodies to bring the infection under control. Inhibiting the neuraminidase enzyme keeps new
viruses attached to the cell surface, thereby preventing the spread of the virus and the further
infection of other cells. The subsequent quantities of virus in the bloodstream are not enough to
cause disease but are sufficient to induce the body to mount an immune response.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to our neuraminidase inhibitor drug candidate, peramivir, both Roche, in
collaboration with Gilead Sciences, and GlaxoSmithKline (&#147;GSK&#148;) have neuraminidase inhibitors on
the market. Roche&#146;s neuraminidase inhibitor is a twice-a-day, orally active neuraminidase
inhibitor, while GSK&#146;s neuraminidase inhibitor is administered by dry powder inhaler twice a day.
Both drugs are approved for marketing in the United States and other countries for treatment of
influenza and are to be administered for 5&nbsp;days. Roche&#146;s neuraminidase inhibitor is also approved
for prophylaxis use for prevention of influenza. In addition to these companies with neuraminidase
inhibitors, there are other companies working to develop additional antiviral drugs to be used
against various strains of influenza.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some studies in laboratories suggest that some of these neuraminidase inhibitor drugs should
work in treating avian influenza infections in humans, but additional studies are needed to
demonstrate the effectiveness of these drugs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Government Stockpiling. </I>With the concern of avian influenza and the possible threat of a
pandemic, many governments throughout the world have been stockpiling antiviral drugs, such as
Roche&#146;s neuraminidase inhibitor,
oseltamivir. There is interest in many of these governments, including the U.S. government to
find additional vaccines and antivirals to address a potential pandemic situation.

and proceeded to complete the studies of the enzyme&#146;s molecular structure needed to advance the
development of neuraminidase inhibitors. The structure of the active site of influenza
neuraminidase is similar among different viral strains. Because of this similarity, we believe that
our neuraminidase inhibitors may be effective in the treatment and prevention of influenza,
regardless of changes in the virus.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Previous development of peramivir in an oral formulation was conducted through a worldwide
license agreement between the Company and the R.W. Johnson Pharmaceutical Research Institute and
Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical Inc. (both Johnson &#038; Johnson companies). Johnson &#038; Johnson made the
business decision to terminate this agreement in 2001 and returned all rights to us. In June&nbsp;2002,
we completed an ongoing Phase III clinical trial that had been started by Johnson &#038; Johnson and
subsequently terminated development of our oral peramivir program as a result of missing the
primary endpoint in the pivotal trial.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Current status of peramivir. </I>Due to the recent international concern about a potential
influenza pandemic that could be initiated by avian strains of the virus, peramivir has received
considerable attention, since it is positioned to be one of very few advanced antiviral
alternatives to oral oseltamivir, or Tamiflu, for addressing a potential pandemic. As a result, we
filed an IND in 2005 and re-initiated the clinical development of peramivir during 2006.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Current Development Strategy</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preclinical studies comparing peramivir with other anti-influenza drugs have demonstrated that
peramivir has outstanding broad-spectrum potency against multiple strains of influenza, including
the avian strain H5N1. In addition, peramivir retains activity against nearly all
oseltamivir-resistant strains of influenza that have been identified to date. We are currently
focusing on injectable formulations of peramivir that may achieve high blood levels that should be
effective against most strains of influenza, including strains that may be resistant to oseltmivir
(Tamiflu). Our investigational new drug application (&#147;IND&#148;) for i.v. peramivir became effective in
December&nbsp;2005 and for i.m. in December&nbsp;2006. We received fast track designation from the FDA in
January&nbsp;2006 and initiated a Phase I clinical trial with i.v. peramivir in March&nbsp;2006. During
2006, we conducted multiple Phase I clinical trials in healthy volunteers in preparation for the
Phase II trials to be initiated during the 2006-2007 influenza season, which began with the
initiation of a Phase II study with the i.m. formulation in January&nbsp;2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Intramuscular peramivir. </I>In September&nbsp;2007, we announced the results of our Phase II study
with i.m. peramivir injection. The study was a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled clinical
trial designed to test whether peramivir, when administered acutely in high doses intramuscularly,
could reduce the duration of symptoms during seasonal influenza. During the study, 344 patients who
had a positive rapid antigen test indicating influenza were randomized to receive i.m. injections
of either placebo or one of two dose levels of peramivir (150mg and 300mg) as a single dose
administered within 48 hours of symptom onset. The primary endpoint of the study was the time to
alleviation of symptoms in the patients confirmed with influenza infection, of which there were
313. The results indicated that in these 313 subjects, a single dose of peramivir demonstrated a
treatment improvement over placebo, but the improvement was not statistically significant.
Following the release of these results, we completed additional analysis of the clinical data and
performed a preliminary analysis of the virologic data from this trial. We also conducted further
pharmacokinetic (&#147;PK&#148;)&nbsp;studies in healthy volunteers.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preliminary analysis of the virologic data from this Phase II i.m. trial indicated that i.m.
peramivir demonstrated statistically significant reductions in influenza virus shedding in both
active treatment groups when compared to placebo, with greater reductions in the 300mg group.
Additionally, PK studies have been completed, which indicate that needle length impacts adequate
and consistent systemic exposure to i.m. peramivir. Based on these clinical results and virologic
data, we believe that a single i.m. dose of 300mg peramivir can be a potentially clinically
effective dose. However, given the dose-response observed between the 150mg and 300mg doses in the
Phase II trial, we believe it is prudent to evaluate whether doses higher than 300mg provide
additional efficacy. As a result, we are planning to initiate a Phase II clinical trial that will
evaluate the 300mg dose and a higher dose of peramivir later this year.

out-patient settings. In addition to the progress made clinically in both programs, we have also
made significant progress in the manufacturing and toxicology work required to advance both

injection of peramivir is effective at preventing death in mice from
infections with virulent strains of influenza. If this finding can be confirmed in clinical
trials, we believe the injectable formulations of peramivir will have considerable potential for
treating patients with seasonal influenza infections, in addition to providing an effective
mechanism for treating large numbers of patients rapidly in the event of a flu pandemic.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Congress approved an appropriation of $3.8&nbsp;billion for 2006 to support the development of
various countermeasures for a flu pandemic. The appropriation included funding for the development
of new antiviral agents. In January&nbsp;2007, we announced that HHS had awarded the Company a $102.6
million, four-year contract for the advanced development of peramivir for U.S. licensure. In
January&nbsp;2008, we announced that the development cost of our peramivir program to anticipated
product approval would cost in excess of the $102.6&nbsp;million contract since the development plan for
peramivir had changed from that outlined in the original proposal to HHS. HHS has indicated that
they will fund certain elements of our revised program, including the ongoing Phase II i.v. study
evaluating peramivir in hospitalized subjects, the planning and conduct of the planned Phase II
study of i.m. peramivir, and the manufacturing and toxicology components of the program. Each of
these elements has specific HHS funding limits and any costs outside the approved amounts by HHS
may be the responsibility of the Company. The original contract of $102.6&nbsp;million and the four year
term remain unchanged.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the contract with HHS, we have established collaborative relationships with
Shionogi and Green Cross for the development and commercialization in Japan and Korea,
respectively. The Shionogi agreement was established in February&nbsp;2007, which resulted in an upfront
payment of $14&nbsp;million. In December&nbsp;2007, we received a $7 milestone payment from Shionogi for
their initiation of a Phase II clinical trial with i.v. peramivir.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Structure-based drug design is a drug discovery approach by which we design synthetic
compounds from detailed structural knowledge of the active sites of enzyme targets associated with
particular diseases. Enzymes are proteins that act as catalysts for many vital biological
reactions. Our goal generally is to design a compound that will fit in the active site of an enzyme
(the active site of an enzyme is the area into which a chemical or biological molecule fits to
initiate a biochemical reaction) and thereby interfere with the progression of disease.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our structure-based drug design involves the application of both traditional biology and
medicinal chemistry and an array of advanced technologies. We use X-ray crystallography, computer
modeling of molecular structures and advanced chemistry techniques to focus on the
three-dimensional molecular structure and active site characteristics of the enzymes that control
cellular biology.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that structure-based drug design technologies are superior to drug screening
techniques. By identifying the target enzyme in advance and by discovering the chemical and
molecular structure of the enzyme, we believe it is possible to design a better drug to interact
with the enzyme. In addition, the structural data obtained by X-ray crystallographic analysis allow
additional analysis and compound modification at each stage of the biological evaluation. This
capability makes structure-based drug design a powerful tool for efficient development of drugs
that are highly specific for particular enzyme target sites.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We currently have agreements with UAB for influenza neuraminidase and complement inhibitors.
Under the terms of these agreements, UAB performed specific research for us in return for research

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January&nbsp;2007, we announced that HHS had awarded the Company a $102.6&nbsp;million, four-year
contract for the advanced development of peramivir. In January&nbsp;2008, we announced the development
cost of our peramivir program to product approval would cost in excess of the $102.6&nbsp;million
contract since the development plan for peramivir has changed from that outlined in the original
proposal to HHS. HHS has indicated that they will fund certain elements of our revised program,
including the ongoing Phase II i.v. study in hospitalized subjects, planning and conduct of the
planned Phase II i.m. study, manufacturing and toxicology. Each of these elements has specific HHS
funding limits and costs outside the approved amounts by HHS may be the responsibility of the
Company. The original contract of $102.6&nbsp;million and the four year term remain unchanged. HHS has
indicated that antiviral drugs are an important element of their pandemic influenza preparedness
efforts and that their strategy includes not only stockpiling of existing antiviral drugs but also
seeking out new antiviral medications to further broaden their capabilities to treat and prevent
all forms of influenza. Peramivir is in the same class of neuraminidase inhibitors as oseltamivir
(Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza), all of which are antiviral drugs, but the method of delivery for
peramivir will be parenteral (i.m. and i.v.) as compared to the oral Tamiflu or inhaled Relenza. We
are committed to working with HHS for the development of these parenteral formulations of peramivir
which could be especially useful in hospital settings or pandemic situations due to the ability to
achieve high levels of the drug rapidly throughout the body.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This contract is a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract, which is milestone-driven. HHS will make
periodic assessments of progress and the continuation of the contract is based on our performance,
timeliness and quality of deliverables, and other factors. The government has rights under certain
contract clauses to terminate this contract.

operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of other parties, both in the United States
and in other countries. We own or have rights to certain proprietary information, proprietary

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal
and factual questions. Our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary position for our
technology will depend on our success in obtaining effective patent claims and enforcing those
claims once granted. We do not know whether any of our patent applications or those patent
applications that we license will result in the issuance of any patents. Our issued patents and
those that may issue in the future, or those licensed to us, may be challenged, invalidated,
rendered unenforceable or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from
marketing related products or the length of term of patent protection that we may have for our
products. In addition, the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with
competitive advantages against competitors with similar compounds or technology. Furthermore, our
competitors may independently develop similar technologies or duplicate any technology developed by
us in a manner that does not infringe our patents or other intellectual property. Because of the
extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it
is possible that, before any of our drug candidates or those developed by our partners can be
commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following
commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of the patent.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of February&nbsp;20, 2008, we have been issued 29 U.S. patents that expire between 2009 and 2025
and that relate to our PNP, serine protease and neuraminidase inhibitor compounds. We have licensed
six different class of compounds representing new composition of matter patents from AECOM and IRL
for our PNP inhibitors, plus additional manufacturing patents related to these PNP inhibitors and
one patent from Emory related to hepatitis C. Additionally, we have 15 PCT or U.S. patent
applications pending related to PNP, neuraminidase, RNA viral polymerase, paramyxovirus
neuraminidase, and serine protease inhibitors. Our pending applications may not result in issued
patents, and our patents may not provide us with sufficient protection against competitive products
or otherwise be commercially viable.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our success is also dependent upon the skills, knowledge and experience of our scientific and
technical personnel, none of which is patentable. To help protect our rights, we require all
employees, consultants, advisors and partners to enter into confidentiality agreements, which
prohibit the disclosure of confidential information to anyone outside of our company and, where
possible, requires disclosure and assignment to us of their ideas, developments, discoveries and
inventions. These agreements may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets, know-how or
other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure or the lawful
development by others of such information.

of various cancers. Although our general strategy is to rely on major marketing companies for
worldwide commercialization of most products we may develop, we believe that we can manage the
highly specialized oncology market for forodesine HCl within the U.S. However, in general, we lack
experience in marketing, distributing and selling pharmaceutical products. Our general strategy is
to rely on partners, licensees or arrangements with others to provide for the marketing,

neuraminidase inhibitors marketed by GSK and Roche for influenza. In addition, several
pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms, including major pharmaceutical companies and specialized
structure-based drug design companies, have announced efforts in the field of structure-based drug
design and in the fields of PNP, HCV, influenza, and other therapeutic areas where we are focusing
our drug discovery efforts.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to compete successfully, we must develop proprietary positions in patented drugs for
therapeutic markets that have not been satisfactorily addressed by conventional research strategies
and, in the process, expand our expertise in structure-based drug design. Our products, even if
successfully tested and developed, may not be adopted by physicians over other products and may not
offer economically feasible alternatives to other therapies.

safety, efficacy, record-keeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and
distribution of pharmaceutical products. In foreign countries, our products are also subject to
extensive regulation by foreign governments. These government regulations will be a significant
factor in the production and marketing of any pharmaceutical products that we develop. Failure to

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Phase I trials are designed to determine safety in a small group of patients or healthy
volunteers. We also assess tolerances and the metabolic and pharmacologic actions of our drug
candidates at different doses. After we complete the initial trials, we conduct Phase II trials to
assess safety and efficacy and establish the optimal dose in patients. If Phase II trials are
successful, we or our partners conduct Phase III trials to verify the results in a larger patient
population. Phase III trials are required for FDA approval to market a drug. A Phase III trial may
require hundreds or even thousands of patients and is the most expensive to conduct. The goal in
Phase III is to collect enough safety and efficacy data to obtain FDA approval of a drug for
treatment of a particular disease. For some clinical indications that are especially serious and
for which there are no effective treatments, such as refractory cancers, conditional approval can
be obtained following Phase II trials.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initiation and completion of the clinical trial phases are dependent on several factors
including things that are beyond our control. For example, the clinical trials cannot begin at a
particular site until that site receives approval from its Institutional Review Board (&#147;IRB&#148;),
which reviews the protocol and related documents. This process can take from several weeks to
several months. In addition, clinical trials are dependent on patient enrollment, but the rate at
which patients enroll in the study depends on:

Modernization Act of 1997, has six months to review and act upon license applications for priority
therapeutics that are for life-threatening or unmet medical needs. Standard reviews can take
between one and two years, and can even take longer if significant questions arise during the

as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Manufacturing facilities are
subject to inspection by the FDA. Such facilities must be approved before we can use them in
commercial manufacturing of our potential products. We or our contract manufacturers may not be

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>An investment in our stock involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the
following risks, along with all of the other information included in our other filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, before deciding to buy our common stock. Additional risks and
uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also impair
our business operations. If we are unable to prevent events that have a negative effect from
occurring, then our business may suffer. Negative events are likely to decrease our revenue,
increase our costs, make our financial results poorer and/or decrease our financial strength, and
may cause our stock price to decline. In that case, you may lose all or a part of your investment
in our common stock.</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Risks Relating to Our Business</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B><I>We have incurred substantial losses since our inception in 1986, expect to continue to incur such
losses, and may never be profitable.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since our inception in 1986, we have not been profitable. We expect to incur additional losses
for the foreseeable future, and our losses could increase as our research and development efforts
progress. As of December&nbsp;31, 2007, our accumulated deficit was approximately $224.5&nbsp;million. To
become profitable, we must successfully manufacture and develop drug product candidates, receive
regulatory approval, and successfully commercialize or enter into profitable agreements with other
parties. It could be several years, if ever, before we receive royalties from any current or
future license agreements or revenues directly from product sales.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing our product
candidates and their potential for commercialization, we are unable to predict the extent of any
future losses or when we will become profitable, if at all. Even if we do achieve profitability, we
may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. If we are
unable to achieve and sustain profitability, the market value of our common stock would likely
decline.
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B><I>Our success depends upon our ability to advance our products through the various stages of
development, especially through the clinical trial process.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To receive the regulatory approvals necessary for the sale of our product candidates, we or
our partners must demonstrate through preclinical studies and clinical trials that each product
candidate is safe and effective. The clinical trial process is complex and uncertain. Because of
the cost and duration of clinical trials, we may decide to discontinue development of product
candidates that are unlikely to show good results in the trials, unlikely to help advance a product
to the point of a meaningful collaboration, or unlikely to have a reasonable commercial potential.
We may suffer significant setbacks in pivotal clinical trials, even after earlier clinical trials
show promising results. Clinical trials may not be adequately designed or executed, which could
affect the potential outcome and analysis of study results. Any of our product candidates may
produce undesirable side effects in humans. These side effects could cause us or regulatory
authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials of a product candidate. These side effects
could also result in the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities refusing to approve the product
candidate for any targeted indications. We, our partners, the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities
may suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time if we or they believe the trial participants
face unacceptable health risks. Clinical trials may fail to demonstrate that our product candidates
are safe or effective and have acceptable commercial viability.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Progression of our drug products through the clinical development process is dependent upon
our trials indicating our drugs have adequate safety profiles and show positive therapeutic effects
in the patients being treated by achieving pre-determined endpoints according to the trial

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As our clinical programs continue to grow and patient enrollment increases, our costs will
increase. Our current and planned clinical trials plus the related development, manufacturing,
regulatory approval process requirements, and additional personnel resources and testing required
for supporting the development of our drug candidates will consume significant capital resources.
Our expenses, revenues and burn rate could vary significantly depending on many factors, including
our ability to raise additional capital, the development progress of our collaborative agreements
for our drug candidates, the amount of funding we receive from HHS for peramivir, the amount of
funding or assistance, if any, we receive from other governmental agencies or other new
partnerships with third parties for the development of our drug candidates, the progress and
results of our current and proposed clinical trials for our most advanced drug products, the
progress made in the manufacturing of our lead products and the progression of our other programs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We expect that we will be required to raise additional capital to complete the development and
commercialization of our current product candidates. Additional funding, whether through additional
sales of securities or collaborative or other arrangements with corporate partners or from other
sources, including governmental agencies, in general and from the HHS contract specifically, may
not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to us. The issuance of preferred or common
stock or convertible securities, with terms and prices significantly more favorable than those of
the currently outstanding common stock, could have the effect of diluting or adversely affecting
the holdings or rights of our existing stockholders. In addition, collaborative arrangements may
require us to transfer certain material rights to such corporate partners. Insufficient funds may
require us to delay, scale-back or eliminate certain of our research and development programs.

position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies is generally highly uncertain, involves
complex legal and factual questions and has recently been the subject of much litigation. Neither
the United States Patent and Trademark Office (&#147;USPTO&#148;), the Patent Cooperation Treaty offices, nor
the courts of the United States and other jurisdictions have consistent policies nor predictable
rulings regarding the breadth of claims allowed or the degree of protection afforded under many
biotechnology and pharmaceutical patents. The validity, scope, enforceability and commercial value
of these rights, therefore, is highly uncertain.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our success depends in part on avoiding the infringement of other parties&#146; patents and other
intellectual property rights as well as avoiding the breach of any licenses relating to our
technologies and products. In the U.S., patent applications filed in recent years are confidential
for 18&nbsp;months, while older applications are not published until the patent issues. As a result,
avoiding patent infringement may be difficult and we may inadvertently infringe third-party patents
or proprietary rights. These third parties could bring claims against us, our partners or our
licensors that even if resolved in our favor, could cause us to incur substantial expenses and, if
resolved against us, could additionally cause us to pay substantial damages. Further, if a patent
infringement suit were brought against us, our partners or our licensors, we or they could be
forced to stop or delay research, development, manufacturing or sales of any infringing product in
the country or countries covered by the patent we infringe, unless we can obtain a license from the
patent holder. Such a license may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all, particularly if
the third party is developing or marketing a product competitive with the infringing product. Even
if we, our partners or our licensors were able to obtain a license, the rights may be nonexclusive,
which would give our competitors access to the same intellectual property.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we or our partners are unable or fail to adequately, initiate, protect, defend or enforce
our intellectual property rights in any area of commercial interest or in any part of the world
where we wish to seek regulatory approval for our products, methods, processes and other
technologies, the value of the drug product candidates to

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the completion of a Phase I/II clinical trial of forodesine HCl in patients with
refractory CTCL, in October&nbsp;2007 we initiated a planned pivotal trial with an oral formulation of
forodesine HCl for treatment of patients with CTCL. This trial is being conducted under an SPA
agreement negotiated with the FDA and will serve as a basis for a new drug application to the FDA
using the oral formulations in patients with relapsed CTCL. In February&nbsp;2007, we announced that the
Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products of the European Medicines Agency had granted orphan drug
designation to forodesine HCl for the treatment of CTCL.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the December&nbsp;2007 meeting of the American Society of Hematology (&#147;ASH&#148;) Madeline Duvic,
M.D., Deputy Chair, Dermatology, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center presented
interim data from the Phase I/II clinical study of oral forodesine HCl in the treatment of subjects
with refractory CTCL. The overall response rate for these subjects was 39%, including 2 subjects
with complete response (6%) and 12 subjects with partial response (33%). These data indicated that
in addition to a good
safety profile, forodesine HCl demonstrated clinical activity as a single oral agent in
patients with advanced refractory CTCL.
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January&nbsp;2007, we initiated a Phase IIb multicenter, open-label, non-randomized repeat-dose
registration study to evaluate an intravenous treatment of forodesine HCl followed by an oral
treatment of forodesine HCl in patients with relapsed or refractory T-ALL. This study was being
conducted under an SPA negotiated with the FDA and was designed to
determine the rate of complete remission achieved with forodesine HCl. In March&nbsp;2007, we announced
that as a result of a stability issue with the i.v. formulation, that we were voluntarily placing
this Phase IIb clinical trial on hold pending internal review and discussions with the our partner,
Mundipharma. In December&nbsp;2007, we announced the formal termination of this study.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January&nbsp;2007, we announced that HHS had awarded the Company a $102.6&nbsp;million, four-year
contract for the advanced development of peramivir. In January&nbsp;2008, we announced the development
cost of our peramivir program to product approval would cost in excess of the $102.6&nbsp;million
contract since the development plan for peramivir has changed from that outlined in the original
proposal to HHS. HHS has indicated that it will fund certain elements of our revised program,
including the ongoing Phase II i.v. study evaluating peramivir in hospitalized subjects, the
planning and conduct of the planned Phase II study of i.m. peramivir in subjects with uncomplicated
influenza and the manufacturing and toxicology components of the program. Each of these elements
has specific HHS funding limits and any costs outside the approved amounts by HHS may be the
responsibility of the Company. The original contract of $102.6&nbsp;million and the four year term
remain unchanged.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the contract with HHS, in February&nbsp;2007, we established a collaborative
relationship with Shionogi for the development and commercialization of peramivir in Japan. This
agreement resulted in an upfront payment of $14&nbsp;million. In December&nbsp;2007, we received a $7
milestone payment from Shionogi for their initiation of a Phase II clinical trial with i.v.
peramivir.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Intramuscular peramivir </I>In September&nbsp;2007, we announced the results of our Phase II study with
i.m. peramivir injection. The study was a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled clinical
trial designed to test whether peramivir, when administered acutely in high doses intramuscularly,
could reduce the duration of symptoms during seasonal influenza. During the study, 344 patients who
had a positive rapid antigen test indicating influenza were randomized to receive i.m. injections
of either placebo or one of two dose levels of peramivir (150mg and 300mg) as a single dose
administered within 48 hours of symptom onset. The primary endpoint of the study was the time to
alleviation of symptoms in the patients confirmed with influenza infection, of which there were
313. The results indicated that in the 313 subjects, a single dose of peramivir demonstrated a
treatment improvement over placebo, but the improvement was not statistically significant.
Following the release of these results, we completed additional analysis of the clinical data and
performed a preliminary analysis of the virologic data from this trial. We also conducted further
pharmacokinetic (PK)&nbsp;studies in healthy volunteers.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preliminary analysis of the virologic data from this Phase II i.m. trial indicated that i.m.
peramivir demonstrated statistically significant reductions in influenza virus shedding in both
active treatment groups when compared to placebo, with greater reductions in the 300mg group.
Additionally, PK studies have been completed, which indicate that needle length impacts adequate
and consistent systemic exposure to i.m. peramivir. Based on these clinical results and virologic
data, we believe that a single i.m. dose of 300mg peramivir can be a potentially clinically
effective dose. However, given the dose-response observed between the 150mg and 300mg doses in the
Phase II trial, we believe it is prudent to evaluate whether doses higher than 300mg provide
additional efficacy. As a result, we are planning to initiate a Phase II clinical trial that will
evaluate the 300mg dose and a higher dose of peramivir later this year.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
January, 2008 we announced that we would not continue to
pursue the peramivir i.m. Phase&nbsp;III pivotal program in the current
flu season and would work toward the initiation of a Phase&nbsp;II
clinical trial later this year that would evaluate a 300mg dose and a
higher dose of peramivir compared to placebo. The decision to
terminate the Phase&nbsp;III program was made by us after
further evaluation of the Phase&nbsp;II study data, additional pk studies, the
potential availability of an alternative formulation and additional
discussions with FDA and HHS. At the time of termination of the
program
we had enrolled 82 subjects in the Northern Hemisphere. We plan to gather and
analyze the data from these enrolled subjects to assist in the design
of future studies.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Intravenous peramivir </I>In July&nbsp;2007, we announced the initiation of a Phase II clinical trial
of i.v. peramivir to compare the efficacy and safety of i.v. peramivir to orally administered
oseltamivir in patients who require hospitalization due to acute influenza. This trial was
initiated in the Southern Hemisphere and is currently ongoing in the Northern Hemisphere.

compared to $6.2&nbsp;million for 2006. The increase for 2007 was primarily due to revenue from HHS
related to our contract for the development of peramivir. In addition, we received a $7.0&nbsp;million
milestone payment from Shionogi in December&nbsp;2007 for their initiation of a Phase II clinical trial
and there was an increase of $3.1&nbsp;million in amortization of deferred revenue compared to 2006 on
the continuing amortization of the upfront payments from the Roche, Shionogi and Mundipharma
agreements. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease of $1.5&nbsp;million in
reimbursement from Mundipharma for our clinical trial costs compared to 2006.

expanded peramivir and forodesine HCl programs, increases in personnel and related costs to support
the advanced development of our pipeline, and increases in consulting and toxicology. Included in
R&#038;D expenses for 2007 is approximately $2.3&nbsp;million of pre-contract costs directly related to the
Phase 2 trials for both the i.v. and i.m. peramivir products. These costs were
incurred during 2006 in anticipation of a contract award from HHS and were required to meet the
delivery schedule of the proposed contract. In accordance with the provisions of Federal
Acquisition Regulation&nbsp;31.205-32, the costs were included in the Company&#146;s request for proposal and
were eligible for reimbursement from HHS. The $2.3&nbsp;million of costs incurred prior to the contract

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March&nbsp;2007, we announced a collaborative agreement with Shionogi for rights to peramivir in
Japan. This agreement required an upfront payment of $14&nbsp;million that was received in April&nbsp;2007.
In December&nbsp;2007, we received a $7&nbsp;million milestone payment from Shionogi for their initiation of
a Phase II clinical trial with i.v. peramivir.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January&nbsp;2007, we announced that HHS had awarded the Company a $102.6&nbsp;million, four-year
contract for the advanced development of peramivir. The contract is a standard cost plus fixed fee
contract, which we expect will continue to have a significant positive impact on our financial
position and cash flow. We bill our incurred costs to HHS on a monthly basis. Any significant
delays in payment, rejection of significant costs by HHS or cancellation of this contract by HHS
would have a significant negative effect on our financial position. In January&nbsp;2008, we announced
that the development costs of our peramivir program to anticipated product approval would cost in
excess of the $102.6&nbsp;million contract since the development plan for peramivir had changed from
that outlined in the original proposal to HHS. HHS has indicated that they will fund certain
elements of our revised program, including the ongoing Phase II i.v. study evaluating peramivir in
hospitalized subjects, the planning and conduct of the planned Phase II study of i.m. peramivir and
the manufacturing and toxicology components of the program. Each of these elements has specific HHS
funding limits and any costs outside the approved amounts by HHS may be the responsibility of the
Company. The original contract of $102.6&nbsp;million and the four year term remain unchanged.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February&nbsp;2006, we licensed forodesine HCl to Mundipharma for the development and
commercialization of this drug in Europe, Asia and Australasia. In addition to the upfront payment
of $10&nbsp;million, which was received in February&nbsp;2006, Mundipharma is paying 50% of the clinical
development costs we are incurring for forodesine HCl on existing and planned clinical trials, but
their portion shall not exceed $10&nbsp;million. In addition, Mundipharma will conduct additional
clinical trials at their own cost up to a maximum of $15&nbsp;million. The agreement also provides for
future event payments and royalties to be made by Mundipharma upon the achievement of certain
clinical, regulatory and sales events. In January&nbsp;2007, we initiated our pivotal study with
forodesine HCl in T-cell leukemia patients under an SPA negotiated with the FDA, which triggered a
$5&nbsp;million event payment from Mundipharma. Subsequently, in March&nbsp;2007, the Company made a decision
to put this trial on voluntary hold to investigate particulates that were found in some batches of
i.v. formulation. In December&nbsp;2007, we announced the termination of our development in T-ALL with
forodesine HCl. In July&nbsp;2007, we

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">announced the Company had received an SPA for a pivotal trial of
forodesine HCl in CTCL patients. The trial is a multicenter, multinational, open-label, single-arm,
repeat dose pivotal trial which began enrollment during October&nbsp;2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The collaboration with Roche for the worldwide development and commercialization of BCX-4208
in November&nbsp;2005 provided an upfront payment of $30&nbsp;million, which was received in 2006. Roche has
taken over the development and is paying all costs associated with this program. The agreement also
provides for future event payments and royalties to be made by Roche upon the achievement of
certain clinical, regulatory and sales events.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the year, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance has increased from
$46.2&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2006 to $85.0&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2007, primarily due to
cash received from collaborations and the $65.3&nbsp;million received from the private placement of
common stock and warrants in August&nbsp;2007, which were offset by the monthly cash burn from
operations. As a result of these
items and the reimbursement from our contract with HHS, our net cash burn rate for 2007 was
approximately $2.2&nbsp;million per month. We caution that our revenues, our expenses and our cash flows
will vary significantly from quarter to quarter throughout 2008 due to the nature of the trials in
influenza and the reimbursement from HHS. We are projecting our 2008
net cash use to be
$25-$30&nbsp;million, partially due to the reduction of our receivable balance from HHS at
December&nbsp;31, 2007. This burn rate could vary significantly
depending on the timing of Company expenses and the related
reimbursement from HHS.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As our clinical programs continue to progress and patient enrollment increases, our costs will
increase. Our current and planned clinical trials plus the related development, manufacturing,
regulatory approval process requirements and additional personnel resources and testing required
for the continuing development of our drug candidates will consume significant capital resources
and will increase our expenses. Our expenses, revenues and burn rate could vary significantly
depending on many factors, including our ability to raise additional capital, the development
progress of our collaborative agreements for our drug candidates, the amount and timing of funding
we receive from HHS for peramivir, the amount of funding or assistance, if any, we receive from
other governmental agencies or other new partnerships with third parties for the development of our
drug candidates, the progress and results of our current and proposed clinical trials for our most
advanced drug products, the progress made in the manufacturing of our lead products and the
progression of our other programs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2007, we had $85.0&nbsp;million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable
securities, which included the $65.3&nbsp;million from the private placement of unregistered common
stock and warrants to certain existing stockholders, which closed on August&nbsp;9, 2007. With our
currently available funds and the amounts to be received from HHS, Shionogi and our other
collaborators, we believe these resources will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least
the next twelve months. However, this is a forward looking statement, and there may be changes that
would consume available resources significantly before such time.

many factors, including:

above are certain contractual obligations that existed at
December&nbsp;31, 2007 that were subsequently cancelled during 2008.
The total amount of these obligations outstanding at
December&nbsp;31, 2007 was approximately $19&nbsp;million. We are in
the process of negotiating final payments for services performed under
these contracts.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the above, we have committed to make potential future &#147;sublicense&#148; payments to
third-parties as part of in-licensing and development programs. Payments under these agreements
generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental, regulatory and/or
commercial milestones. Because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor
reasonably estimable, such contingencies have not been recorded on our balance sheet.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Critical Accounting Policies</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have established various accounting policies that govern the application of accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States, which were utilized in the preparation of our
financial statements. Certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by
management that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities.
Management considers such accounting policies to be critical accounting policies. The judgments and
assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors, which are
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Because of the nature of the judgments and
assumptions made by management, actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates,
which could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results
of operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to our financial
statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007, we
believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully
understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and affect the more significant
judgments and estimates that we use in the preparation of our financial statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Revenue Recognition</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our revenues have generally been limited to license fees, event payments, research and
development fees, government contracts, and interest income. Revenue is recognized in accordance
with Staff Accounting Bulletin No.&nbsp;104, <I>Revenue Recognition </I> and Emerging Issues
Task Force Issue 00-21, <I>Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables </I>(&#147;EITF Issue 00-21&#148;).
License fees, event payments, and research and development fees are recognized as revenue when the
earnings process is complete and we have no further continuing performance obligations or we have
completed the performance obligations under the terms of the agreement. Fees received under
licensing agreements that are related to future performance are deferred and recognized as earned
over an estimated period determined by management based on the terms of the agreement and the
products licensed. For example, in the Roche and Mundipharma licenses agreements, we deferred the
upfront payments over the remaining life of the patents which are 2023 and 2017, respectively. In
the event a license agreement contains multiple deliverables, we evaluate whether the deliverables
are separate or combined units of accounting in accordance with EITF Issue 00-21. Revisions to
revenue or profit estimates as a result of changes in the estimated revenue period are recognized
prospectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the guidance of EITF Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 99-19, <I>Reporting Revenue Gross as
a Principal Versus Net as an Agent </I> and Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 01-14,
<I>Income Statement Characterization of Reimbursements Received for &#147;Out-of-Pocket&#148; Expenses</I>, reimbursements received for direct out-of-pocket expenses related to research and
development costs are recorded as revenue in the income statement rather than as a reduction
in expenses. For example, the amounts received from our collaboration with Mundipharma for the
reimbursement of clinical trial costs and the costs received from HHS for reimbursement will be
recorded as revenue in the period the related costs were recorded.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Event payments are recognized as revenue upon the achievement of specified events if (1)&nbsp;the
event is substantive in nature and the achievement of the event was not reasonably assured at the
inception of the

payments received prior to satisfying these criteria are recorded as deferred revenue.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Royalty revenue is recognized based on estimates of royalties earned during the applicable
period and adjusted for differences between the estimated and actual royalties in the following
period. If royalties can not be reasonably estimated, revenue is recognized upon receipt of
royalty statements from the licensee. We have not received any royalties from the sale of licensed
pharmaceutical products.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Research and Development Expenses</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;2, <I>Accounting for Research
and Development Costs</I>, we expense research and development costs as incurred.
Research and development expenses include, among other items, personnel costs, including salaries
and benefits, manufacturing costs, clinical, regulatory, and toxicology services performed by
contract research organizations (&#147;CRO&#146;s&#148;), materials and supplies, and overhead allocations
consisting of various administrative and facilities related costs. Most of our manufacturing and
clinical and preclinical studies are performed by third-party CRO&#146;s. Costs for studies performed by
CRO&#146;s are accrued by us over the service periods specified in the contracts and estimates are
adjusted, if required, based upon ours on-going review of the level of services actually performed.
To date, there have been no material changes to our estimates.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally,
we have license agreements with third parties, such as AECOM, IRL,
and UAB, which require maintenance fees or fees related to sublicense
agreements. These fees are generally expensed as incurred unless they are related to revenues that
have been deferred, in which case the expenses are deferred and recognized over the related revenue
recognition period.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We group our R&#038;D expenses into two major categories: direct external expenses and all other
R&#038;D expenses. Direct external expenses consist of costs of outside parties to conduct laboratory
studies, to develop manufacturing processes and manufacture the product candidate, to conduct and
manage clinical trials and similar costs related to our clinical and preclinical studies. These
costs are accumulated and tracked by program. All other R&#038;D expenses consist of costs to compensate
personnel, to purchase lab supplies and services, to maintain our facility, equipment and overhead
and similar costs of our research and development efforts. These costs apply to work on our
clinical and preclinical candidates as well as our discovery research efforts. These costs have not
been charged directly to each program historically because the number of product candidates and
projects in research and development may vary from period to period and because we utilize internal
resources across multiple projects at the same time.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, due to the risks inherent in the clinical trial process and given the stages of
our various product development programs, we are unable to estimate with any certainty the costs we
will incur in the continued development of our drug candidates for potential commercialization.
While we are currently focused on advancing each of our development programs, our future R&#038;D
expenses will depend on the determinations we make as to the scientific and clinical success of
each drug candidate, as well as ongoing assessments as to each drug candidate&#146;s commercial
potential. As such, we are unable to predict how we will allocate available resources among our
product development programs in the future. In addition, we cannot forecast with any degree of
certainty the development progress of our existing partnerships for our drug candidates, which drug
candidates will be subject to future collaborations, when such arrangements will be secured, if at
all, and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital
requirements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The successful development of our drug candidates is uncertain and subject to a number of
risks. We cannot be certain that any of our drug candidates will prove to be safe and effective or
will meet all of the applicable regulatory requirements needed to receive and maintain marketing
approval. Data from preclinical studies and clinical trials are susceptible to varying
interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory clearance. We, the FDA, or other
regulatory authorities may suspend clinical trials at any time if we or they believe that the
subjects participating in such trials are being exposed to unacceptable risks or if such regulatory
agencies find deficiencies in the conduct of the trials or other problems with our products under
development. Delays or rejections may be encountered based on additional governmental regulation,
legislation, administrative action or changes in FDA or other regulatory policy during development
or the review process. Other risks associated with our product development programs are described
in Risk Factors in Part&nbsp;I, Item&nbsp;1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as updated from time to time
in our subsequent periodic reports and current reports filed with the SEC. Due to these
uncertainties, accurate and meaningful estimates of the ultimate cost to bring a product to market,
the timing of completion of any of our product development programs and the period in which
material net cash inflows from any of our product development programs will commence are
unavailable.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the process of preparing financial statements, we are required to estimate accrued
expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with
our applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating
the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not
yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost. The majority of our service providers
invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as
of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances

</TABLE>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We base our expenses related to clinical trials on our estimates of the services received and
efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and clinical research
organizations that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf. The financial terms of these
agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven
payment flows. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful
enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones. In accruing service fees,
we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be
expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort
varies from our estimate, we will adjust the accrual accordingly. To date, there have been no
material changes to our estimates. If we do not identify costs that we have begun to incur or if we
underestimate or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of these services, our
actual expenses could differ from our estimates.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2007, we have two stock-based employee compensation plans, the Stock Incentive
Plan and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Prior to January&nbsp;1, 2006, we accounted for these plans
under the recognition and measurement provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.&nbsp;25,
<I>Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees</I>, and other related Interpretations, as permitted by
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;123, <I>Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation</I>
(&#147;Statement No.&nbsp;123&#148;). No stock-based compensation cost related to our employees was recognized in
the Statements of Operations for any period ending prior to January&nbsp;1, 2006, as all options granted
to our employees had exercise prices equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on
the date of grant. Effective January&nbsp;1, 2006, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;123 (revised 2004), <I>Share-Based Payment </I>(&#147;Statement
No.&nbsp;123R&#148;), using the modified prospective transition method. Results for prior periods have not
been restated.
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the fair value recognition provisions of Statement No.&nbsp;123R, stock-based compensation cost is
estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over
the requisite service period of the award. Consistent with the valuation method we used for
disclosure-only purposes under the provisions of Statement No.&nbsp;123, we use the Black-Scholes option
pricing model to estimate fair value under Statement No.&nbsp;123R. Determining the appropriate fair
value model and the related assumptions for the model requires judgment, including estimating the
life of an award, the stock price volatility, and the expected term. Compensation cost is
recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;), a Delaware corporation, is a biotechnology
company that designs, optimizes, and develops novel drugs that block key enzymes involved in
cancer, cardiovascular diseases, autoimmune diseases, and viral infections. The Company integrates
the necessary disciplines of biology, crystallography, medicinal chemistry, and computer modeling
to effectively use structure-based drug design to discover and develop small molecule
pharmaceuticals. The Company has multiple research projects in different stages of development
from early discovery to a pivotal Phase II trial of the Company&#146;s most advanced drug candidate,
forodesine HCl. While the prospects for a project may increase as the project advances to the next
stage of development, a project can be terminated at any stage of development. Until the Company
generates revenues from either a research project or an approved product, the Company&#146;s ability to
continue research projects is dependent upon its ability to raise funds through the sale of equity
securities or through collaborative arrangements with government agencies or third-party partners.

estimated useful lives or the remaining lease term, whichever is less. In accordance with Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;144, <I>Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets</I>, the Company periodically reviews its furniture and equipment for
impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets
may not be recoverable. Determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted
future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. In the event
that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the
assets, the assets are written down to their estimated fair values. Furniture and equipment to be
disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company records all expenses in the period incurred. In addition to recording expenses for
invoices received, the Company estimates the cost of services provided by third parties or
materials purchased for which no invoices have been received as of each balance sheet date. Accrued

when the earnings process is complete and the Company has no further continuing performance
obligations or the Company has completed the performance obligations under the terms of the
agreement. Fees received under licensing agreements that are related to future performance are
deferred and recognized over an estimated period determined by management based on the terms of the
agreements and the products licensed. In the event a license agreement contains multiple
deliverables, the Company evaluates whether the deliverables are separate or combined units of
accounting in accordance with EITF Issue 00-21. Revisions to revenue or profit estimates as a
result of changes in the estimated revenue period are recognized prospectively.

salaries and benefits, manufacturing costs, clinical, regulatory, and toxicology services performed
by contract research organizations (&#147;CRO&#146;s&#148;), materials and supplies, and overhead allocations
consisting of various administrative and facilities related costs. Most of the Company&#146;s
manufacturing and clinical and preclinical studies are performed by third-party CRO&#146;s. Costs for
studies performed by CRO&#146;s are accrued by the Company over the service periods specified in the
contracts and estimates are adjusted, if required, based upon the Company&#146;s on-going review of the
level of services actually performed.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2007, there was approximately $13,740,154 of total unrecognized
compensation cost related to non-vested employee stock option awards and restricted stock awards
granted by the Company. That cost is expected to be recognized as follows: $5,255,676 in 2008,
$4,542,234 in 2009, $3,341,547 in 2010, and $600,697 in 2011.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Statement 123R also requires that the benefits from tax deductions in excess of recognized
compensation cost should be reported as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash
flow. The Company has never recognized any benefits from such tax deductions, as the Company has
always maintained a loss position.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Net Loss Per Share</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company computes net loss per share in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No.&nbsp;128, <I>Earnings Per Share</I>. Net loss per share is based upon the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per share is equivalent to basic net
loss per share for all periods presented herein because common equivalent shares from unexercised
stock options and common shares expected to be issued under the Company&#146;s employee stock purchase
plan were anti-dilutive.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
amounts reported in the financial statements. Examples include accrued clinical and preclinical
expenses. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company invests its excess cash principally in U.S. marketable securities from a
diversified portfolio of institutions with strong credit ratings and in U.S. government and agency
bills and notes and, by policy, limits the amount of credit exposure at any one institution. These
investments are generally not collateralized and mature within less than three years. The Company
has not realized any losses from such investments. At December&nbsp;31, 2007, $14,358,885 was invested
in the Merrill Lynch Premier Institutional Fund, a money market mutual fund that invests in near
cash securities with weighted average maturities of less than 90&nbsp;days. The Merrill Lynch Premier
Institutional Fund is not insured.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rent expense for operating leases was $575,538, $566,524, and $560,322 in 2007, 2006, and
2005, respectively. The commitment for operating leases is primarily related to building leases in
Birmingham, Alabama and Cary, North Carolina. The lease for the building in Birmingham, Alabama
expires June&nbsp;30, 2015. This lease, as amended effective August&nbsp;7, 2007 for an increase in occupied
space and lease term, currently requires monthly rents of $39,100 in December&nbsp;2007 and escalates
annually to a minimum of $48,072 per month in the final year. The Company has an option to renew
the Birmingham, Alabama lease for an additional five years at the current market rate on the date
of termination. The lease for the building in Cary, North Carolina expires February&nbsp;28, 2010. This
lease, as amended effective August&nbsp;9, 2007 for an increase in occupied space, requires monthly
rents of $7,652 in December&nbsp;2007 and escalates annually to a minimum of $8,118 per month in the
final year. The Company has an option to twice renew the Cary, North Carolina lease for an
additional three years at the current market rate prior to lease termination.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2007, the Company has an unused letter of credit of $1.8&nbsp;million. This
letter of credit was originally obtained for a customs bond that was required in order to import
certain compound into the country that was manufactured abroad. The Company does not anticipate
drawing any funds against this letter of credit in the future, but it could remain in force for up
to one year or until customs closes the file on the particular receipt of goods for which the bond
was required.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Note 6 &#151; Income Taxes</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective
January&nbsp;1, 2007, the Company adopted the provisions of  FIN No.&nbsp;48, which clarifies the accounting for
uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise&#146;s financial statements in accordance with
Statement No.&nbsp;109 and prescribes a recognition threshold and
measurement process for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or
expected to be taken in a tax return. The Company has concluded that there were no significant uncertain tax positions requiring
recognition in its financial statements. Tax years 2004-2006 remain open to examination by the
major taxing jurisdictions to which the Company is subject. Additionally, years prior to 2004 are
also open to examination to the extent of loss and credit carryforwards from those years.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the current period, the Company utilized a portion of its net operating loss (&#147;NOL&#148;)
carryforwards. Accordingly, there was a decrease in the deferred tax assets and a corresponding
decrease in the valuation allowance related to the NOL carryforwards. As of December&nbsp;31, 2007, the majority of the deferred tax
assets relate to NOL carryforwards that can only be realized if the Company is profitable in future
periods and it is uncertain whether the Company will realize any tax benefit related to the NOL
carryforwards. Accordingly, the Company has provided a valuation allowance against the net deferred
tax assets due to uncertainties as to their ultimate realization. The valuation allowance will
remain at the full amount of the deferred tax asset until it is more likely than not that the
related tax benefits will be realized.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has significant net operating loss and business credit carryovers which are
subject to a valuation allowance due to the uncertain nature of the realization of the losses. The
Internal Revenue Code imposes certain limitations on the utilization of net operating loss
carryovers and other tax attributes after certain ownership changes.
During the year, the Company performed a detailed analysis and
determined that there was  no
resulting limitation to the Company&#146;s net operating loss and credit carryforwards.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company will recognize interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits
as components of its income tax provision. The Company did not have any interest and penalties
accrued upon the adoption of FIN No.&nbsp;48 and as of December&nbsp;31, 2007, the Company does not have any
interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On August&nbsp;6, 2007, the Company entered into a Stock and Warrant Purchase Agreement with a
group of existing stockholders for the private placement of 8,315,513 shares of the Company&#146;s
common stock at a purchase price of $7.80 per share and warrants to purchase 3,159,895 shares of
the Company&#146;s common stock at a purchase price of $0.125 per warrant. The aggregate proceeds from
the sale were approximately $65.3&nbsp;million. The exercise price of the warrants is $10.25 per share.
The participants in the transaction include funds managed by Baker Brothers Investments, Kleiner
Perkins Caufield &#038; Byers, EHS Holdings, OrbiMed Advisors, Texas Pacific Group Ventures, and
Stephens Investment Management, all of whom are current shareholders in the Company. The Company
has registered 8,140,000 of the shares under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, but the
remaining 175,513 and the warrants included in the private placement have not been registered and
may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from
registration requirements. The Company has agreed to register the remaining shares, the warrants,
and the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants for resale. If registration
is not completed within the period specified in the Stock and Warrant Purchase Agreement, the
Company will be subject to pay liquidated damages of $164,000 to the group of institutional
investors, which represents 12% of the transaction value related to the remaining

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June&nbsp;2002, our board of directors adopted a stockholder rights plan and, pursuant thereto,
issued preferred stock purchase rights (&#147;Rights&#148;) to the holders of our common stock. The Rights
have certain anti-takeover effects. If triggered, the Rights would cause substantial dilution to a
person or group of persons who acquires more than 15% (19.9% for William W. Featheringill, a
Director who owned approximately 10.1% as of August&nbsp;15, 2007, but owned more than 15% at the time
the Rights were put in place) of our common stock on terms not approved by the board of directors.
In August&nbsp;2007, this plan was amended for a transaction involving funds managed by or affiliated
with Baker Brother Investments such that they could purchase up to 25% without triggering the
Rights. After closing of our August&nbsp;2007 private placement, such group owns approximately 19.0%

a purchase price of $26.00, subject to adjustment. Shares of Series&nbsp;B purchasable upon exercise of
the Rights will not be redeemable. Each share of Series&nbsp;B will be entitled to a dividend of 1,000
times the dividend declared per share of common stock. In the event of liquidation, each share of
Series&nbsp;B will be entitled to a payment of 1,000 times the payment made per share of common stock.
Each share of Series&nbsp;B will have 1,000 votes, voting together with the common stock. Finally, in
the event of any merger, consolidation, or other transaction in which shares of common stock are
exchanged, each share of Series&nbsp;B will be entitled to receive 1,000 times the amount received per
share of common stock. Effective in December&nbsp;2005, we increased the authorized shares available
under these rights to 45,000 to match the authorized common shares of 45,000,000 at that time. In

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November&nbsp;1991, the Board of Directors adopted the 1991 Stock Option Plan (&#147;1991 Plan&#148;) for
key employees and consultants of the Company and reserved 500,000 shares of common stock for
issuance. The 1991 Plan was approved by the stockholders in December&nbsp;1991. The original term for
awards granted under the 1991 Plan was for ten years and included provisions for issuance of both
incentive stock options and non-statutory options. Under the 1991 Plan, stock option awards are
granted with an exercise price equal to the market price of the Company&#146;s stock at the date of
grant. Stock option awards granted to employees and consultants generally vest 25% after one year
and monthly thereafter on a pro rata basis over the next three years until fully vested after four
years. The vesting exercise provisions of all awards granted under the 1991 Plan are subject to
acceleration in the event of certain stockholder-approved transactions, or upon the occurrence of a
change in control as defined in the 1991 Plan.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February&nbsp;1993, the 1991 Plan was amended and restated to effect the following changes: (i)
divide the 1991 Plan into two separate incentive programs: the Discretionary Option Grant Program
and the Automatic Option Grant Program (for outside Directors), (ii)&nbsp;increase the number of shares
of the Company&#146;s common stock available for issuance by 500,000 shares and (iii)&nbsp;expand the level
of benefits available. The Board amended the 1991 Plan in December&nbsp;1993 to increase the number of
shares issuable by 500,000 shares and subsequently amended and restated the 1991 Plan in its
entirety in February&nbsp;1994. In March&nbsp;1995, the Board authorized another 500,000 shares for issuance
under the 1991 Plan. The 1991 Plan was subsequently amended and restated in March&nbsp;1997, which
increased the number of shares issuable by 1,000,000 shares. The 1991 Plan (as so amended and
restated) was further amended in March&nbsp;1999 to increase the share reserve by 400,000 shares. The
Board amended and restated the 1991 Plan in its entirety in March&nbsp;2000, increasing the reserved
shares by 1,200,000 and extending the term of the 1991 Plan for ten years from the date of the
amendment. This restatement was approved by the Company&#146;s stockholders in May&nbsp;2000. The 1991 Plan
was amended in March&nbsp;2004 to increase the number of shares reserved for issuance by 1,000,000 and
to amend the automatic option grant program related to initial grants, vesting, and option terms.
The automatic option grant program grants options to purchase 10,000 shares to new non-employee
Board members, prorated from their initial appointment to the next Annual Meeting, and an
additional 10,000 shares annually over such period of continued service (all of which vest
one-twelfth per month). Directors receiving options under the automatic option grant program will
have the full term of the original option to exercise all options vested at the time of their
cessation from service. This amendment was approved by the Company&#146;s stockholders in May&nbsp;2004.

fair value of the award was estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing
model and the assumptions noted in the table below. The weighted average grant date fair value of
the stock option awards granted under the Incentive Plan during 2007, 2006, and 2005 was $6.16,
$8.64, and $3.48, respectively. The fair value of the stock option awards is amortized to expense
over the vesting periods using a straight-line expense attribution method.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following explanations describe the assumptions used by the Company to value the stock
option awards granted during 2007. The expected life is based on the average of the assumption that
all outstanding stock option awards will be exercised at full vesting and the assumption that all
outstanding stock option awards will be exercised at the midpoint of the valuation date and the
full contractual term. The expected volatility represents an average of the implied volatility on
the Company&#146;s publicly traded options, the volatility over the most recent period corresponding
with the expected life, and the Company&#146;s long-term reversion volatility. The Company has assumed
no expected dividend yield, as dividends have never been paid to stock or option holders and will
not be for the foreseeable future. The weighted average risk-free interest rate is the implied
yield currently available on zero-coupon government issues with a remaining term equal to the
expected term.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March&nbsp;2007, the Company&#146;s Board of Directors approved a stock inducement grant of 110,000
stock option awards and 10,000 restricted stock awards to recruit a new employee to a key position
within the Company. The stock option awards were granted in April&nbsp;2007 with an exercise price equal
to the market price of the Company&#146;s stock at the date of grant. The awards vest 25% after one year
and monthly thereafter on a pro rata basis over the next three years until fully vested after four
years. The stock option awards have contractual terms of 10&nbsp;years. The vesting exercise provisions
of both the stock option awards and the restricted stock awards granted under the inducement grant
are subject to acceleration in the event of certain stockholder-approved transactions, or upon the
occurrence of a change in control as defined in the respective agreements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the stock option awards granted under the inducement grant, the fair value was estimated
on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model and the following assumptions:
expected life of 5.7&nbsp;years, expected volatility of 72.9%, expected dividend yield of 0.0%, and
risk-free interest rate of 4.6%. The weighted average grant date fair value of these stock option
awards was $5.25. The fair value of the stock option awards is amortized to expense over the
vesting periods using a straight-line expense attribution method. The expected life is based on the
average of the assumption that all outstanding stock option awards will be exercised at full
vesting and the assumption that all outstanding stock option awards will be exercised at the
midpoint of the valuation date and the full contractual term. The expected volatility represents an
average of the implied volatility on the Company&#146;s publicly traded stock options, the volatility
over the most recent period corresponding with the expected life, and the Company&#146;s long-term
reversion volatility. The Company has assumed no expected dividend yield, as dividends have never
been paid to stock or option holders and will not be for the foreseeable future. The weighted
average risk-free interest rate is the implied yield currently available on zero-coupon government
issues with a remaining term equal to the expected term.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exercise price of the stock option awards and the grant date fair value of the restricted
stock awards granted under the inducement grant was $8.20. None of these restricted stock awards
have vested as of December&nbsp;31, 2007.

401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code covering all employees. Employee contributions may be made to
the 401(k) Plan up to limits established by the Internal Revenue Service. Company matching

commercial events (including certain sales level amounts following a product&#146;s launch) for certain
indications. In addition, the Company will receive royalties based on a percentage of net product
sales. Generally, all payments under the agreement are nonrefundable and non-creditable, but they
are subject to audit. The Company developed peramivir under a license from UAB and will owe
sublicense payments to them on the upfront payment and any future event payments and/or royalties
received by the Company from Shionogi. The Company retains all rights to commercialize peramivir in
North America, Europe, and other countries outside of Korea and Japan. In
accordance with SAB No.&nbsp;104 and EITF Issue 00-21, the Company deferred the $14&nbsp;million
up-front payment that was received from Shionogi. This deferred revenue began to be amortized to
revenue in April&nbsp;2007 and will continue through
December&nbsp;2018. In December&nbsp;2007, the Company
received a $7&nbsp;million milestone payment from Shionogi for their initiation of a Phase II clinical
trial with i.v. peramivir.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (&#147;HHS&#148;). </I>In January&nbsp;2007, the Company was awarded
a four-year contract from HHS to develop its influenza neuraminidase inhibitor, peramivir, for the
treatment of seasonal and life-threatening influenza, including avian flu. The contract commits
$102.6&nbsp;million to support manufacturing, process validation, clinical studies and other product
approval requirements for peramivir. The contract with HHS is defined as a standard
cost-plus-fixed-fee contract. That is, the Company is entitled to receive reimbursement for all
costs incurred in accordance with the contract provisions that are related to the development of
peramivir plus a fixed fee, or profit.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January&nbsp;2008, we announced that the development cost of our peramivir program to
anticipated product approval would cost in excess of the $102.6&nbsp;million contract since the
development plan for peramivir had changed from that outlined in the original proposal to HHS. HHS
has indicated that they will fund certain elements of our revised program, including the ongoing
Phase II i.v. study evaluating peramivir in hospitalized subjects, the planning and conduct of the
planned Phase II study of i.m. peramivir, and the manufacturing and toxicology components of the
program. Each of these elements has specific HHS funding limits and any costs outside the approved
amounts by HHS may be the responsibility of the Company. The original contract of $102.6&nbsp;million
and the four year term remain unchanged.

with Green Cross to develop and commercialize peramivir in Korea. Under the terms of the agreement,
Green Cross will be responsible for all development, regulatory, and commercialization costs in
Korea. The Company received a one-time license fee and may also receive future event payments as
well as royalties on product sales of peramivir. In addition, the Company will share in any profits
resulting from the sale of peramivir to the Korean government for stockpiling purposes.
Furthermore, Green Cross will pay the Company a premium over its cost to supply peramivir for
development and any future marketing of peramivir products in Korea. In accordance with SAB No.&nbsp;104
and EITF Issue 00-21, the Company deferred the up-front payment that was received from Green Cross.
This deferred revenue began to be amortized to revenue August&nbsp;2006 and will continue through
November&nbsp;2009.

entered into an exclusive, royalty bearing right and license agreement with Mundipharma for the
development and commercialization of the Company&#146;s lead PNP inhibitor, forodesine HCl, for use in
oncology. Under the terms of the agreement, Mundipharma obtained rights to forodesine HCl in
markets across Europe, Asia, and Australasia in exchange for a $10&nbsp;million up-front payment.
Mundipharma will share 50% of the documented out of pocket development costs incurred by the
Company in respect of the current and planned trials as of the effective date of the agreement
provided that Mundipharma&#146;s maximum contribution to these trials shall be $10&nbsp;million. In addition,
Mundipharma will conduct additional clinical trials at their own cost up to a maximum of $15
million. The license provides for future event payments for achieving specified development,
regulatory and commercial events (including certain sales level amounts following a product&#146;s
launch) for certain indications. In addition, the Company will receive royalties based on a
percentage of net product sales, which varies depending upon when certain indications receive NDA
approval in a major market country and can vary by country depending on the patent coverage or
sales of generic compounds in a particular country. Generally, all payments under the agreement are
nonrefundable and non-creditable, but they are subject to audit. The Company licensed forodesine
HCl and other PNP inhibitors from AECOM and IRL and will owe sublicense payments to these third
parties on the upfront payment, event payments, and royalties received by the Company from
Mundipharma.

inhibitors the Company develops through Phase IIb in oncology, but any new PNP inhibitors will be
exempt from this agreement and the Company will retain all rights to such compounds. The Company
retained the rights to forodesine HCl in the U.S. and Mundipharma is obligated by the terms of the
agreement to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop the licensed product in the territory
specified by the agreement. The agreement will continue for the commercial life of the licensed
products, but may be terminated by either party following an uncured material breach by the other
party or in the event the pre-existing third party license with AECOM and IRL expires. It may be
terminated by Mundipharma upon 60&nbsp;days written notice without cause or under certain
other conditions as specified in the agreement and all rights, data, materials, products and
other information would be transferred back to the Company at no cost. In the event the Company
terminates the agreement for material default or insolvency, the Company could have to pay
Mundipharma 50% of the costs of any independent data owned by Mundipharma in accordance with the

99-19 and EITF Issue 01-14, the costs reimbursed by Mundipharma for the current and planned trials
of forodesine HCl are recorded as revenue when the expense is incurred up to the $10&nbsp;million limit
stipulated in the agreement.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company is currently in dispute with Mundipharma regarding the
contractual obligations of the parties with respect to certain costs
related to the manufacturing and development of forodesine HCL.
Notwithstanding, the Company does not believe that it is responsible
for any of the disputed amounts. The Company is engaged in ongoing discussion
to resolve this dispute. The maximum potential exposure to the
Company is estimated to be approximately $5&nbsp;million
(approximately 3.4&nbsp;million euro). Because of the preliminary
nature of the discussions, no amounts have been accrued as of
December&nbsp;31, 2007.

entered into an exclusive license with Roche for the development and commercialization of the
Company&#146;s second generation PNP inhibitor, BCX-4208, for the prevention of acute rejection in
transplantation and for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. Under the terms of the agreement,
Roche obtained worldwide rights to BCX-4208 in exchange for a $25&nbsp;million up-front payment and a $5
million payment as reimbursement for a limited supply of material during the first 24&nbsp;months of the
collaboration. According to the terms of the license, there could also be event payments for
achieving specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones (including sales level
milestones following a product&#146;s launch) for certain indications. In addition, the Company will
receive royalties based on a percentage of net product sales, which varies depending upon when
certain indications receive NDA approval in a major market country and can vary by country
depending on the patent coverage or sales of generic compounds in a particular country. The Company
licensed this compound and other PNP inhibitors from AECOM and IRL and will owe sublicense payments

several indications. Roche has certain obligations under the terms of the agreement to use
commercially reasonable efforts to develop, manufacture and commercialize the licensed product. The
agreement may be terminated by either party following an uncured material breach by the other party

if any. In addition, the Company agreed to pay an annual license fee that is non-refundable, but is
creditable against actual royalties and other payments due to AECOM and IRL. This agreement may be
terminated by the Company at any time by giving 60&nbsp;days advance notice or in the event of material
uncured breach by AECOM and IRL.

have initial 25-year terms, are automatically renewable for five-year terms throughout the life of
the last patent and are terminable by the Company upon three months notice and by UAB under certain
circumstances. There is currently no activity between the Company and UAB on these agreements, but
when the Company licenses this technology, such as in the case of the Shionogi and Green Cross
agreements, or commercialize products related to these programs, we will owe sublicense fees or
royalties on amounts we receive.

Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;157, <I>Fair Value Measurements </I>(&#147;Statement No.&nbsp;157&#148;). The standard
provides enhanced guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities and also responds
to investors&#146; requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets
and liabilities at fair value, the information used to measure fair value, and the effect of fair
value measurements on earnings. While the standard applies whenever other standards require (or
permit) assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value, it does not expand the use of fair
value in any new circumstances. Statement No.&nbsp;157 is effective for financial statements issued for
fiscal years beginning after November&nbsp;15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
Management of the Company is evaluating the impact of this standard, but does not anticipate that
it will have a significant impact on its financial statements.

Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial </I>Liabilities (&#147;Statement No.&nbsp;159&#148;). Statement
No.&nbsp;159 allows companies to voluntarily choose, at specified election dates, to measure any
financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value (the &#147;fair value option&#148;). The election is
made on an instrument-by-instrument basis and is irrevocable. If the fair value option is elected
for an instrument, all unrealized gains or losses in fair value for that instrument shall be
reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. Statement No.&nbsp;159 is effective for fiscal
years that begin after November&nbsp;15, 2007. Management of the Company is evaluating the impact of

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June&nbsp;2007, the Emerging Issues Task Force (&#147;EITF&#148;) reached a final consensus on Emerging
Issues Task Force Issue 07-3, Accounting for Nonrefundable <I>Advance Payments for Goods or Services
Received for Use in Future Research and Development Activities </I>(&#147;EITF Issue 07-3&#148;). The EITF
concluded that nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be received in the future
for use in research and development activities should be deferred and capitalized. The capitalized
amounts should be expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed. If a
company&#146;s expectations change, such that it does not expect the goods will be delivered or the
services rendered, the capitalized nonrefundable advance payments should be charged to expense.
EITF Issue 07-3 is effective for new contracts entered into during the fiscal years beginning after
December&nbsp;15, 2007, including interim periods within those fiscal years. This consensus may not be
applied to earlier periods and early adoption is not permitted. Currently, the Company charges
nonrefundable advance payments for future research and development activities to expense as
payments are made. Therefore, the adoption of this standard will have an impact on the Company&#146;s
financial statements when adopted.

disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
