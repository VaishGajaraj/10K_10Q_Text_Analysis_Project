<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Overview</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a biotechnology company that designs, optimizes and develops
novel drugs that block key enzymes involved in cancer, viral infections and autoimmune diseases.
BioCryst integrates the necessary disciplines of biology, crystallography, medicinal chemistry and
computer modeling to effectively use structure-based drug design to discover and develop small
molecule pharmaceuticals.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of our most advanced product candidates, forodesine HCl, is a transition-state analog
inhibitor of the target enzyme purine nucleoside phosphorylase (&#147;PNP&#148;). An oral formulation of the
compound is currently in a Phase IIb trial, which is planned to be a pivotal trial, for patients
with Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma (&#147;CTCL&#148;). The trial is being conducted under a special protocol
assessment (&#147;SPA&#148;) negotiated with the United States Food and Drug Administration (&#147;FDA&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, forodesine HCl is currently being studied in a Phase II trial with an oral
formulation in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (&#147;CLL&#148;). Forodesine HCl has been granted Orphan Drug
status by the FDA for three indications: T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, including CTCL; CLL and
related leukemias including T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, adult T-cell leukemia, and hairy cell
leukemia; and for treatment of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (&#147;B-ALL&#148;). In December&nbsp;2007, we
announced the presentation of data related to the Phase I/II clinical study of forodesine HCl in
subjects with refractory CTCL and a poster detailing the in vitro activity of forodesine HCl as a
single agent and the synergistic in vitro activity of forodesine HCl in combination with
bendamustine in primary cells from 29 patients with CLL. These data were presented at the 2007
American Society of Hematology meeting. In December&nbsp;2008, we announced interim data from the
ongoing forodesine HCl Phase II program in patients with CLL and data from a healthy subject
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study. The CLL study will continue with an amendment to study a
new dosing regimen of oral forodesine, 200 mg twice-daily. An interim analysis was conducted on
data from an exploratory Phase II single-arm, open-label program in patients with CLL whose
previous treatment had failed. While this analysis showed that no partial or complete responses
were observed, five out of 13 patients administered 200 mg of forodesine HCl once-daily had
substantial reductions in malignant lymphocytes, and at the time of the analysis, seven patients
were still on study. Forodesine HCl was generally safe and well-tolerated at the 200 mg once-daily
dose. In a parallel, healthy subject, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study, we compared the
effect of seven days of 200 mg forodesine HCl dosed once-daily with seven days of 200 mg forodesine
HCl dosed twice-daily. The study demonstrated substantially increased drug exposure and
pharmacodynamic effect in subjects administered forodesine HCl 200 mg twice-daily. Drug exposure,
as measured by area under the (plasma-concentration/time) curve (&#147;AUC&#148;), increased by 63&nbsp;percent
(P&#060;0.001) for twice-daily dosing compared to once-daily dosing. Serum uric acid levels were
reduced at steady state compared to baseline by 50.0&nbsp;percent for twice-daily dosing compared to
23.5&nbsp;percent for once-daily dosing (p&#060;0.001), indicating increased PNP enzyme inhibition with
twice-daily dosing. Also, use of forodesine HCl is being explored in various cancer settings, and
combination studies are being planned. Since February&nbsp;2006, we have had an exclusive licensing
agreement with Mundipharma International Holdings Limited (&#147;Mundipharma&#148;) to develop and

the rest of the world, including North America.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another one of our most advanced drug candidates is peramivir, an inhibitor of influenza
neuraminidase. Peramivir is in development for the treatment of influenza with two parenteral
formulations, intramuscular (&#147;i.m.&#148;) and intravenous (&#147;i.v.&#148;). We completed a double-blind
placebo-controlled Phase II clinical trial with i.m. peramivir testing two different dose levels of
peramivir (150 mg and 300 mg) versus placebo in adults with acute uncomplicated influenza. While
the trial did not demonstrate statistically significant differences for its primary endpoint of
time to alleviation of symptoms, the preliminary analysis of the virologic data indicated that
peramivir demonstrated statistically significant reductions in influenza virus shedding in both
peramivir treatment groups compared to placebo, with greater reductions in the 300 mg dose. With
this information and the additional pharmacokinetic information we have obtained subsequent to the
trial, we initiated a Phase II placebo-controlled trial of 600 mg i.m. peramivir for the treatment
of seasonal influenza. This trial is ongoing and uses a new, more concentrated 150 mg/ml
formulation of peramivir. We expect to have data from this trial sometime in the second quarter of
2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, in July&nbsp;2007, we announced the initiation of a Phase II clinical trial in
hospitalized patients using an i.v. formulation of peramivir to compare the efficacy and safety of
i.v. peramivir to orally administered oseltamivir in patients who require hospitalization due to
acute influenza. In October&nbsp;2008 we reported results of an exploratory Phase II trial of i.v.
peramivir in subjects hospitalized for acute serious or potentially life-threatening influenza. The
Phase II trial compared the efficacy and safety of five days of therapy with either 200 mg i.v.
peramivir per day, 400 mg i.v. peramivir per day or 75 mg oral oseltamivir twice a day for five
days, in subjects who required hospitalization related to influenza. The primary objective of the
study was to evaluate a novel composite endpoint, time to clinical stability, which is comprised of
normalization of temperature, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure and
heart rate. Secondary objectives of the study included evaluation of viral shedding, mortality,
clinical relapse and time to resumption of usual activities. As reported in October&nbsp;2008, there
were no statistically significant differences in any of the efficacy endpoints between the three
treatment arms, and peramivir was generally safe and well-tolerated at those dose levels.
Evaluation of time to clinical stability, the primary endpoint, showed a median of 23.7 hours for
peramivir 200mg, 37.0 hours for peramivir 400 mg and 28.1 hours for oseltamivir (p=.306). This
exploratory endpoint was driven by resolution of fever. Viral shedding (time weighted change from
baseline in viral titer) was reduced by a median of -2.0 logs for peramivir 200mg, -2.1 logs for
peramivir 400mg, and -1.9 logs for oseltamivir (p=.908). There was no mortality in the primary
efficacy population, and there were no clinical relapses. Patients were discharged from the
hospital after a median of 4.0&nbsp;days for peramivir 200 mg, 3,8&nbsp;days for peramivir 400 mg, and 4.0
days for oseltamivir (p=0.994). The median number of days required for resumption of usual
activities was 8.8&nbsp;days for peramivir 200 mg, 9.0&nbsp;days for peramivir 400 mg, and 13.7&nbsp;days for
oseltamivir (p=0.276). BioCryst presented details of this study at the XI International Symposium
on Respiratory Viral Infections, held in Bangkok, Thailand in February&nbsp;2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January&nbsp;2007, we announced the United States Department of Health and Human Services
(&#147;HHS&#148;), had awarded us a $102.6&nbsp;million, four-year contract for the advanced development of
peramivir. In January&nbsp;2008, we announced that the development plan for peramivir had changed and
that we would no longer pursue the Phase III i.m. program in peramivir for the current influenza
season, but would move forward in evaluating higher doses than used in previous studies. Also in
January, we announced that the program would cost in excess of the $102.6&nbsp;million contract and that
any funding above the $102.6&nbsp;million may be the responsibility of the Company. Since then, HHS and
the Company have been working in collaboration through various contract modifications to maximize
resources by stopping work on some projects (e.g. the Phase III i.m. program) and capping
expenditures on other projects in order to maximize remaining funds. HHS and the Company executed
a contract modification that fully funds the Company through the completion of both the phase II
studies in outpatients treated with intramuscular peramivir, the phase II study in hospitalized
patients with intravenous peramivir, and certain manufacturing and toxicology components of the
program. The modification also allows the Company and HHS to agree on additional development
activities for peramivir within the confirmed $102.6&nbsp;million funding. All temporary restraints,
effected through a stop work order, have now been removed. Following completion of the phase II
studies, we expect to continue the dialogue with HHS regarding additional funding beyond the $102.6
million for peramivir development through U.S. licensure. The original contract of $102.6&nbsp;million
and the four year term remain unchanged.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March&nbsp;2007, we announced our collaboration with Shionogi &#038; Co., Ltd. (&#147;Shionogi&#148;) for the
development and commercialization of peramivir in Japan. This exclusive license agreement for Japan
included an upfront payment of $14&nbsp;million and future clinical event milestone payments of up to
$21&nbsp;million. Shionogi recently completed a Phase II study of intravenous (i.v.) peramivir
administered via a single dose infusion in the outpatient setting for treatment of seasonal
influenza. This trial met its primary endpoint of improvement in the median time to alleviation of
symptoms in subjects with confirmed, acute, uncomplicated influenza infection, compared to placebo
alone. Time to alleviation of symptoms was 81.8 hours for placebo, 59.1 hours for 300 mg
peramivir, and 59.9 hours for 600 mg peramivir. This result was highly statistically significant
(p=0.0046) for both the 300 mg dose (p=0.0046) and the 600 mg dose. Further, safety assessments
confirmed that i.v. peramivir was generally safe and well-tolerated. Shionogi presented the data at
the recent Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy (ICAAC)/ Infectious
Diseases Society of America (IDSA)&nbsp;annual meeting in Washington, D.C. Based on the results from
this Phase II study, Shionogi has initiated a Phase III program with i.v. peramivir in the
outpatient setting. The Phase III study is a 1,050 subject study and would typically require two
seasons to complete. In the event of a very strong flu season it is possible to complete a study
of this magnitude in one flu season. Although it has been a strong flu season in Asia, it is not
clear at this time if Shionogi will finish in one season or two. It is our understanding that
Shionogi plans to complete its studies within this influenza season. In October&nbsp;2008, the Company
and Shionogi amended the license agreement to expand the territory in the agreement to include
Taiwan and to provide rights for Shionogi to perform a Phase III clinical trial in Hong Kong.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our other drug candidate in clinical trials is our second generation PNP inhibitor, BCX-4208.
In November&nbsp;2005, we announced that we were entering into an exclusive worldwide development and
commercialization agreement with Roche. In the third quarter of 2007, we announced that Roche had
initiated a Phase II clinical trial with oral doses of BCX-4208/R3421, which is designed to
evaluate the drug candidate in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. The efficacy
assessment of the study has been completed. Consistent with interim findings we reported in May
2008, the Phase II clinical study of BCX-4208, a potent, rationally designed, orally available PNP
inhibitor, met its primary objectives of safety and tolerability. In addition, BCX-4208 displayed
dose-dependent reductions in peripheral blood lymphocyte counts, including subsets measuring B
cells (CD20), total T cells (CD3), T helper cells (CD4) and T suppressor/cytotoxic cells (CD8).
Further, plasma levels of BCX-4208 increased with dose, and plasma uric acid levels showed
dose-related reductions with BCX-4208. In addition, consistent with interim results we previously
reported, no evidence of clinical efficacy, a secondary objective, was observed in psoriasis
patients with doses and duration of administration tested.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Phase IIa trial, BCX-4208 was generally safe and well-tolerated at doses up to 120 mg
daily. Most adverse events reported were considered mild or moderate, and low in frequency. No
opportunistic infections were observed. In addition, detailed laboratory and clinical monitoring
did not indicate any patterns suggestive of off-target adverse findings.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also in May&nbsp;2008, we announced that we received notice that Roche was exercising the &#147;no
cause&#148; termination right under the license agreement for BCX-4208. As a result, we regained
worldwide rights to BCX-4208.

this respective research to significantly reduce the time, cost and risks involved in drug
development. Our collaborative relationships with such organizations may lead to the licensing
of one or more drug targets or compounds. Upon licensing a drug target or promising compound
from one of these institutions, the scientists from the institution typically become working
partners as members of our structure-based drug design teams. We believe this makes us a more
attractive development partner to these scientists since they can continue to have some
involvement in the continuing development of the program. In addition, we collaborate with
outside experts in a number of areas, including crystallography, molecular modeling,
combinatorial chemistry, biology, pharmacology, oncology, cardiology, immunology and
infectious diseases. These collaborations enable us to complement our internal capabilities

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Overview</I>. The human immune system employs specialized cells, including T-cells, to control
infection by recognizing and attacking disease-causing viruses, bacteria and parasites. T-cells are
an essential part of the body&#146;s immune system that serve a dual purpose to both orchestrate and
participate in the body&#146;s immune response. For the most part, this system works flawlessly to
protect the body. However, when T-cells multiply uncontrollably, T-cell proliferative diseases,
such as T-cell cancers, can occur.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The link between T-cell proliferation and the purine nucleoside phosphorylase, or PNP, enzyme
was first discovered approximately twenty-five years ago when a patient, who was genetically
deficient in PNP, exhibited limited T-cell activity, but reasonably normal activity of other immune
functions. In other patients lacking PNP activity, the T-cell population was selectively depleted;
however, B-cell function tended to be normal. Based on these findings and the results of cell
culture studies, inhibiting PNP appears to produce primarily suppression of T-cells without
significantly impairing the function of other non-lymphoid cells.

diseases such as psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and Crohn&#146;s disease, which
appear to have activated T-cells as a major part of their pathogenesis. These diseases occur when
the immune system attacks the body&#146;s own cells rather than invading microorganisms. Therefore,
inhibition and/or elimination of activated T-cells could have a beneficial effect on these
diseases.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Transplant Rejection. </I>The greatest threat to transplant patients is rejection of the
transplanted organ by the body&#146;s own immune system. For this reason, transplant recipients must
take drugs to suppress the immune response and prevent rejection usually for the rest of their
lives. A regimen combining several drugs is usually given and this treatment has to be continued
indefinitely. For kidney transplant recipients, rejection of the new kidney by the patient&#146;s immune
system can lead to loss of the transplanted organ and a return to dialysis. For heart, lung and
liver transplant patients, loss of the transplanted organ presents an immediate threat to life.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Overview</I>. There are two types of lymphocytes in the broadest sense &#151; T-cells and B-cells.
Although PNP inhibitors were developed specifically to block the T-cells, recent work indicates
that the same biochemical event &#151; the intracellular accumulation of deoxyguanosine triphosphate
(&#147;dGTP&#148;) also occurs in malignant B-cells. Furthermore, work of Dr.&nbsp;Varsha Gandhi at MD Anderson
Cancer Center has shown that PNP inhibitors, when acting <I>in vitro </I>on B-cells from patients with CLL
induce accumulation of dGTP with resultant apoptosis (cell death).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These studies open the possibility of treating CLL, B-ALL and B-cell non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
(&#147;NHL&#148;) with forodesine HCl. Importantly, B-cell malignancies are considerably more prevalent than
are the T-cell leukemias and lymphomas.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>PNP Inhibition</I>. PNP is an enzyme that plays an important role in T-cell proliferation, because
it is necessary to maintain normal DNA synthesis in human T-cells. Selective inhibition of PNP
causes certain nucleosides, including deoxyguanosine, to accumulate. As the concentration of
deoxyguanosine increases within T-cells, it is converted by specific enzymes to dGTP. A high
concentration of dGTP in T-cells causes an imbalance in the intra-cellular trinucleotide pool and
thus causes cell death.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June&nbsp;2000, we licensed a series of potent PNP inhibitors from AECOM and IRL. The lead drug
candidate from this collaboration, forodesine HCl, is a more potent inhibitor of human lymphocyte
proliferation than other previously known PNP inhibitors. Clinical data in our past and ongoing
clinical trials, plus extensive preclinical studies indicate that forodesine HCl can modulate
T-cell activities. Forodesine HCl is an investigational PNP inhibitor for the potential treatment
of T-cell leukemias and lymphomas. In February&nbsp;2006, we licensed forodesine HCl to Mundipharma to
develop and commercialize in markets across Europe, Asia and Australia for use in oncology.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2002, we exercised the option to add a new compound, BCX-4208, to the series of
inhibitors of PNP licensed from AECOM and IRL. Preclinical results indicated that BCX-4208 was a
more potent inhibitor than forodesine HCl. We completed a Phase I single ascending dose clinical
trial and a Phase Ib multi-dose clinical trial, both in healthy volunteers. In November&nbsp;2005, we
licensed BCX-4208 to Roche for the world wide development and commercialization in autoimmune
diseases and transplant rejection. We announced termination of the Roche license in 2008 and have
regained world wide rights to BCX-4208.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first clinical trial with an intravenous formulation of forodesine HCl, which began in
2002, was a Phase I clinical trial that enrolled T-ALL patients at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center
in Houston, Texas. Simultaneously, there were preclinical studies being conducted at the M.D.
Anderson Cancer Center which indicated that forodesine HCl induces the same biochemical changes in
various other types of leukemia cells that are responsible for the inhibition of T-leukemia cells.
The results of these preclinical studies led us to expand beyond the single starting trial in T-ALL
by initiating additional clinical trials for refractory patients with B-ALL, CTCL, CLL, and other
hematologic malignancies. Based on the encouraging results of these initial studies, we are working
with our partner, Mundipharma, to develop a strategy for the simultaneous development of forodesine
HCl in multiple indications and in potential combination therapies.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Forodesine HCl Clinical Development</I>. Following the completion of a Phase I/II clinical trial
in patients with refractory CTCL, in October&nbsp;2007, we initiated a planned pivotal trial with an
oral formulation of forodesine HCl for treatment of patients with CTCL. This trial is being
conducted under a SPA agreement negotiated with the FDA and will serve as a basis for a new drug
application to the FDA using the oral formulations in patients with relapsed CTCL. This Phase II
clinical study has enrolled more than half of the targeted patients.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on preclinical studies conducted at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center which indicated that
forodesine HCl induces the same biochemical changes in various other types of leukemia cells that
are responsible for the inhibition of T-leukemia cells, we initiated two small clinical studies
late in 2005 in B-cell leukemias, which are more prevalent than T-cell leukemias. First, we
initiated a Phase II trial with oral forodesine HCl in patients with CLL in an advanced stage and
refractory to fludarabine, a current standard therapy. Our initial trial has been amended so that
any potential subject who had fludarabine treatment in the past is now eligible. This trial is
on-going. In December&nbsp;2008, we announced interim data from the ongoing forodesine HCl Phase II
program in patients with CLL and data from a healthy subject pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
study. The CLL study will continue with an amendment to study a new dosing regimen of oral
forodesine, 200 mg twice-daily. An interim analysis was conducted on data from an exploratory Phase
II single-arm, open-label program in patients with CLL whose previous treatment had failed. While
this analysis showed that no partial or complete responses were observed, five out of 13 patients
administered 200 mg of forodesine HCl once-daily had substantial reductions in malignant
lymphocytes, and at the time of the analysis, seven patients were still on study. Forodesine HCl
was generally safe and well-tolerated at the 200 mg once-daily dose. In a parallel, healthy
subject, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study, we compared the effect of seven days of 200 mg
forodesine HCl dosed once-daily with seven days of 200 mg forodesine HCl dosed twice-daily. The
study demonstrated substantially increased drug exposure and pharmacodynamic effect in subjects
administered forodesine HCl 200 mg twice-daily. Drug exposure, as measured by area under the
(plasma-concentration/time) curve (AUC), increased by 63&nbsp;percent (P&#060;0.001) for twice-daily
dosing compared to once-daily dosing. Serum uric acid levels were reduced at steady state compared
to baseline by 50.0&nbsp;percent for twice-daily dosing compared to 23.5&nbsp;percent for once-daily dosing
(p&#060;0.001), indicating increased PNP enzyme inhibition with twice-daily dosing.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We initiated a Phase I/II clinical trial of forodesine HCl to determine the safety of repeat
doses of an i.v. formulation of the drug in patients with B-ALL. This trial is completed. Once the
data are thoroughly analyzed, we will review the results with Mundipharma to determine the best
clinical development strategy going forward.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January&nbsp;2007, we initiated a Phase IIb multicenter, open-label, non-randomized repeat-dose
registration study to evaluate an intravenous treatment of forodesine HCl followed by an oral
treatment of forodesine HCl in patients with relapsed or refractory T-ALL. This study was being
conducted under an SPA negotiated with the FDA and was designed to determine the rate of complete
remission achieved with forodesine HCl. In March&nbsp;2007, we announced that as a result of a stability
issue with the i.v. formulation, that we were voluntarily placing this Phase IIb clinical trial on
hold pending internal review and discussions with our partner, Mundipharma. In December&nbsp;2007, we
announced the formal termination of this study.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February&nbsp;2006, we and Mundipharma entered into an exclusive license agreement to develop
and commercialize forodesine HCl in markets across Europe, Asia and Australia for use in oncology.
The agreement covers a number of markets in Asia and Australasia including Japan, Australia, New
Zealand, China and India. This collaboration should help maximize the global development,
commercialization, and market potential of forodesine HCl in a variety of serious medical
conditions potentially including T-cell leukemia, CTCL, CLL, T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma and B-cell
non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2004, we began clinical development of BCX-4208, another PNP inhibitor, as a drug
candidate for the treatment of T-cell mediated autoimmune diseases, including psoriasis, and
transplant rejection. Although BCX- 4208 and forodesine HCl are both investigational PNP
inhibitors, BCX-4208 differs from forodesine HCl in significant ways. For example, BCX-4208 is more
potent, and has the ability to suppress PNP for longer periods of time. Thus, BCX-4208 has
potential advantages over forodesine HCl for the treatment of diseases requiring long-term, chronic
administration of a PNP inhibitor. Psoriasis is a chronic and often painful and debilitating
disease which affects an estimated 2-3&nbsp;percent of the world&#146;s population, accounting for nearly 125
million persons worldwide. The National Institute of Health estimates that 5.8-7.5&nbsp;million
Americans have psoriasis.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We completed our initial Phase I study, a single dose pharmacokinetic trial in healthy
volunteers, early in 2005 and during the third quarter of 2005, we initiated a Phase Ib multi dose
trial in healthy volunteers to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of multiple
oral doses of BCX-4208. In November&nbsp;2005, we and Roche announced an exclusive license agreement for
the worldwide development and commercialization of BCX-4208 for the prevention of acute rejection
in transplantation and for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. This collaboration provided
substantial strategic and economic benefit to us and also all the essential elements for the rapid,
comprehensive and competitive development of BCX-4208. The two companies established a joint
committee to set the clinical development strategy and the future development program for BCX-4208.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the third quarter of 2007, we announced that Roche had initiated a Phase IIa clinical
trial to evaluate BCX-4208/R3421 in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. The efficacy
assessment of the study has been completed. Consistent with interim findings reported by the
Company in May&nbsp;2008, the Phase II clinical study of BCX-4208, a potent, rationally designed, orally
available PNP inhibitor, met its primary objectives of safety and tolerability. In addition,
BCX-4208 displayed dose-dependent reductions in peripheral blood lymphocyte counts, including
subsets measuring B cells (CD20), total T cells (CD3), T helper cells (CD4) and T
suppressor/cytotoxic cells (CD8). Further, plasma levels of BCX-4208 increased with dose, and
plasma uric acid levels showed dose-related reductions with BCX-4208. In addition, consistent with
interim results previously reported by the Company, no evidence of clinical efficacy, a secondary
objective, was observed in psoriasis patients with doses and duration of administration tested.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Phase IIa trial, BCX-4208 was generally safe and well-tolerated at doses up to 120 mg
daily for six weeks. Most adverse events reported were considered mild or moderate, and low in
frequency. No opportunistic infections were observed. In addition, detailed laboratory and
clinical monitoring did not indicate any patterns suggestive of off-target adverse findings.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also in May&nbsp;2008, we announced that we received notice that Roche was exercising the &#147;no

worldwide rights to BCX-4208.

associated hospitalizations, and influenza is responsible for approximately 36,000 deaths annually.
Influenza is particularly dangerous to the elderly, young children and people with certain health
conditions. Outbreaks of seasonal flu tend to follow predictable patterns usually occurring in the
winter. New vaccines are developed annually based on known flu strains and are usually available
for the annual flu season. There are also antiviral treatments available for the treatment of
people infected with influenza.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Avian Influenza</I>. According to information from the CDC, avian influenza, or bird flu is an
infection caused by viruses which occur naturally among birds. This form of flu is very contagious
among birds and can lead to serious illness and sometimes death. There are two main forms of
disease that infect domestic poultry, one a low pathogenic form and the other a highly pathogenic
form. The latter form can cause disease that affects multiple internal organs and with a mortality
rate between 90-100% in these birds within 2&nbsp;days.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While there are many different subtypes of the influenza A virus, only two subtypes are known
to be currently circulating among humans. Avian influenza A viruses are found chiefly in birds, but
there have been confirmed cases of infection in humans, generally as a result of contact with
infected birds. These infections have led to symptoms ranging from those of normal flu to more
severe and life threatening conditions. Influenza A (&#147;H5N1&#148;) is a subtype of an influenza virus
that is highly contagious among birds and can be deadly to them. Of the avian influenza viruses
that have crossed the species barrier to infect humans, the H5N1 virus has caused the largest
number of detected cases of severe disease and death in humans. Thus far, person to person spread
of this virus is considered extremely rare, but as influenza A viruses constantly change, they
could mutate over time to have the ability to spread rapidly among humans.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Pandemic Influenza</I>. Pandemic influenza is a global disease outbreak that occurs when a new
influenza virus emerges so that people have had no previous exposure. This situation occurs very
rarely and only occurred three times in the 20th century.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Influenza Prevention and Treatment</I>. The development of effective therapeutics has challenged
medical researchers due to the seasonal variation in viral strains and the highly infectious nature
of influenza. Patients, therefore, have limited treatment options. Amantadine and rimantadine,
drugs in the adamantine class, have been used for treatment of influenza A but are ineffective
against influenza B. In addition, these drugs cause some adverse side effects, and the virus tends
to develop resistance to these drugs. The CDC has recommended against the use of amantadine and
rimantadine for the treatment or prophylaxis of influenza in the United States until susceptibility
to these antiviral medications has been re-established among circulating influenza A viruses.
Osteltamivir and zanamivir, drugs in the neuraminidase inhibitor class, have been used for the
treatment of influenza. Recently, the prevalence of resistance to oseltamivir in subtype H1N1 of
influenza A has increased, and the CDC has recommended the use of zanamivir or a combination of
oseltamivir and rimatadine when influenza A (H1N1) virus infection or exposure is suspected.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vaccines are available against the disease but have limitations: people require advance
vaccination; vaccines are limited by their specificity to particular strains of the virus; and
vaccines offer little protection if the strain of influenza that circulates is different from that
present in the vaccine. In addition, many people decline the required injections. Different
strains can arise when surface antigens on the virus (the portion of the virus that causes an
immune reaction in humans) undergo minor genetic mutations each year as the virus replicates
(antigenic drift). Because of this mutability, the immunity acquired in response to infection by a
particular strain of the virus does not provide adequate protection against viruses that
subsequently arise. The production of a new vaccine each year is not only complex and expensive,
but also an inefficient method of global disease control.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Inhibiting Influenza Neuraminidase. </I>Research during the past two decades has seen dramatic
advances in understanding the molecular structure and function of the influenza virus. Considerable
attention has been focused on the enzyme neuraminidase, which is located on the surface of the
virus. Neuraminidase assists in the release and spread of the flu virus by breaking the chemical
strands that hold the new viruses to the cell surface, allowing the replicated virus to spread and
infect other cells. This process progresses until the host&#146;s immune response can produce enough
antibodies to bring the infection under control. Inhibiting the neuraminidase enzyme keeps new
viruses attached to the cell surface, thereby preventing the spread of the virus and the further
infection of other cells. The subsequent quantities of virus in the bloodstream are not enough to
cause disease but are sufficient to induce the body to mount an immune response.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to our neuraminidase inhibitor drug candidate, peramivir, both Roche, in
collaboration with Gilead Sciences, and GlaxoSmithKline (&#147;GSK&#148;) have neuraminidase inhibitors on
the market. Roche&#146;s neuraminidase inhibitor is a twice-a-day, orally active neuraminidase
inhibitor, while GSK&#146;s neuraminidase inhibitor is administered by dry powder inhaler twice a day.
Both drugs are approved for marketing in the United States and other countries for treatment of
influenza and are to be administered for 5&nbsp;days. Roche&#146;s neuraminidase inhibitor is

Roche&#146;s neuraminidase inhibitor, oseltamivir. There is interest in many of these governments,
including the U.S. government to find additional vaccines and antivirals to address a potential

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Background. </I>In 1987, scientists at The University of Alabama at Birmingham (&#147;UAB&#148;), in
collaboration with our scientists, began determining the molecular structure of the influenza
neuraminidase enzyme from several different strains of influenza, using X-ray crystallography.
Subsequently, our scientists and UAB scientists developed numerous new inhibitors of these enzymes
using structure-based drug design. We licensed the influenza neuraminidase program from UAB in 1994
and proceeded to complete the studies of the enzyme&#146;s molecular structure needed to advance the
development of neuraminidase inhibitors. The structure of the active site of influenza
neuraminidase is similar among different viral strains. Because of this similarity, we believe that
our neuraminidase inhibitors may be effective in the treatment and prevention of influenza,
regardless of changes in the virus.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Previous development of peramivir in an oral formulation was conducted through a worldwide
license agreement between the Company and the R.W. Johnson Pharmaceutical Research Institute and
Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical Inc. (both Johnson &#038; Johnson companies). Johnson &#038; Johnson made the
business decision to terminate this agreement in 2001 and returned all rights to us. In June&nbsp;2002,
we completed an ongoing Phase III clinical trial that had been started by Johnson &#038; Johnson and
subsequently terminated development of our oral peramivir program as a result of missing the
primary endpoint in the pivotal trial.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Current status of peramivir. </I>Due to the recent international concern about a potential
influenza pandemic that could be initiated by avian strains of the virus, peramivir has received
considerable attention, since it is positioned to be one of very few advanced antiviral
alternatives to oral oseltamivir, or Tamiflu, for addressing a potential pandemic. As a result, we
filed an IND in 2005 and re-initiated the clinical development of peramivir during 2006.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Current Development Strategy</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preclinical studies comparing peramivir with other anti-influenza drugs have demonstrated that
peramivir has broad-spectrum potency against multiple strains of influenza in the nanomolar or
sub-nanomolar range , including the avian strain H5N1. We are currently focusing on injectable
formulations of peramivir to achieve high blood levels that may be effective against most strains
of influenza, including strains that may be resistant to oseltmivir (Tamiflu). Our investigational
new drug application (&#147;IND&#148;) for i.v. peramivir became effective in December&nbsp;2005 and for i.m. in
December&nbsp;2006. We received fast track designation from the FDA in January&nbsp;2006 and initiated a
Phase I clinical trial with i.v. peramivir in March&nbsp;2006. During 2006, we conducted multiple Phase
I clinical trials in healthy volunteers in preparation for the Phase II trials to be initiated
during the 2006-2007 influenza season, which began with the initiation of a Phase II study with the
i.m. formulation in January&nbsp;2007.

trial with i.m. peramivir testing two different dose levels of peramivir (150 mg and 300 mg) versus
placebo in adults with acute uncomplicated influenza. While the trial did not demonstrate
statistically significant differences for its primary endpoint of time to alleviation of symptoms,
the preliminary analysis of the virologic data indicated that peramivir demonstrated statistically
significant reductions in influenza virus shedding in both peramivir treatment groups compared to

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Intravenous peramivir. </I>In July&nbsp;2007, we announced the initiation of a Phase II clinical trial
of i.v. peramivir to compare the efficacy and safety of i.v. peramivir to orally administered
oseltamivir in patients who require hospitalization due to acute influenza. This trial was
initiated in the Southern Hemisphere and is currently ongoing in the Northern Hemisphere. On
October&nbsp;27, 2008 the Company announced results of this exploratory Phase II trial. The study
compared the efficacy and safety of five days of therapy with either 200 mg i.v. peramivir per day,
400 mg i.v. peramivir per day or 75 mg oral oseltamivir twice a day, in patients who required
hospitalization related to influenza. The results were presented at the XI International Symposium
on Respiratory Viral Infections in Bangkok, Thailand in February&nbsp;2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Summary. </I>Our plan is to continue developing both injectable formulations in the in-patient and
out-patient settings. In addition to the progress made clinically in both programs, we have also
made significant progress in the manufacturing and toxicology work required to advance both
programs forward toward product approval. Preclinical studies have indicated that a single
injection of peramivir is effective at preventing death in mice from infections with virulent
strains of influenza. If this finding can be confirmed in clinical trials, we believe the
injectable formulations of peramivir will have considerable potential for treating patients with
seasonal influenza infections, in addition to providing an effective mechanism for treating large
numbers of patients rapidly in the event of a flu pandemic.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Congress approved an appropriation of $3.8&nbsp;billion for 2006 to support the development of
various countermeasures for a flu pandemic. The appropriation included funding for the development
of new antiviral agents. In January&nbsp;2007, we announced that HHS had awarded the Company a $102.6
million, four-year contract for the advanced development of peramivir for U.S. licensure. In
January&nbsp;2008, we announced that the development plan for peramivir had changed and that we would no
longer pursue the Phase III i.m. program in peramivir for the current influenza season, but would
move forward in evaluating higher doses than used in previous studies. Also in January, we
announced that the program would cost in excess of the $102.6&nbsp;million contract and that any funding
above the $102.6&nbsp;million may be the responsibility of the Company. Since then, HHS and the Company
have been working in collaboration through various contract modifications to maximize resources by
stopping work on some projects (e.g. the Phase III i.m. program) and capping expenditures on other
projects in order to maximize remaining funds. HHS and the Company executed a contract
modification that fully funds the Company through the completion of both the phase II studies in
outpatients treated with intramuscular peramivir, the phase II study in hospitalized patients with
intravenous peramivir, and certain manufacturing and toxicology components of the program. The
modification also allows the Company and HHS to agree on additional development activities for
peramivir within the confirmed $102.6&nbsp;million funding. All temporary restraints, effected through
a stop work order, have now been removed. Following completion of the phase II studies, we expect
to continue the dialogue with HHS regarding additional funding beyond the $102.6&nbsp;million for
peramivir development through U.S. licensure. The original contract of $102.6&nbsp;million and the four
year term remain unchanged.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the contract with HHS, we have established collaborative relationships with
Shionogi and Green Cross for the development and commercialization in Japan and Taiwan by Shionogi
and in Korea by Green Cross. The Shionogi agreement was established in February&nbsp;2007, which
resulted in an upfront payment of $14&nbsp;million and future clinical event milestone payments of up to
$21&nbsp;million. The Shionogi agreement was amended in 2008 to expand the territory in the agreement
to include Taiwan and to provide rights for Shionogi to perform its Phase III clinical trial in
Hong Kong. Shionogi recently completed a Phase II study of intravenous (i.v.) peramivir
administered via a single dose injection in the outpatient setting for treatment of seasonal
influenza. This trial met its primary endpoint of improvement in the median time to alleviation of
symptoms in subjects with confirmed, acute, uncomplicated influenza infection, compared to placebo
alone. Shionogi commenced a phase III program in East Asia, including Japan, in December&nbsp;2008.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Structure-based drug design is a drug discovery approach by which we design synthetic
compounds from detailed structural knowledge of the active sites of enzyme targets associated with
particular diseases. Enzymes are

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">proteins that act as catalysts for many vital biological reactions. Our goal generally is to
design a compound that will fit in the active site of an enzyme (the active site of an enzyme is
the area into which a chemical or biological molecule fits to initiate a biochemical reaction) and
thereby interfere with the progression of disease.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our structure-based drug design involves the application of both traditional biology and
medicinal chemistry and an array of advanced technologies. We use X-ray crystallography, computer
modeling of molecular structures and advanced chemistry techniques to focus on the
three-dimensional molecular structure and active site characteristics of the enzymes that control
cellular biology.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that structure-based drug design technologies are superior to drug screening
techniques. By identifying the target enzyme in advance and by discovering the chemical and
molecular structure of the enzyme, we believe it is possible to design a better drug to interact
with the enzyme. In addition, the structural data obtained by X-ray crystallographic analysis allow
additional analysis and compound modification at each stage of the biological evaluation. This
capability makes structure-based drug design a powerful tool for efficient development of drugs
that are highly specific for particular enzyme target sites.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We initiated our research and development program in 1986, with drug synthesis beginning in
1987. We have assembled a scientific research staff with expertise in a broad base of advanced
research technologies including protein biochemistry, X-ray crystallography, chemistry and
pharmacology. Our research facilities include protein biochemistry and organic synthesis
laboratories, testing facilities, X-ray crystallography, computer and graphics equipment and
facilities to make drug candidates on a small scale for early stage clinical trials. Beginning in
June&nbsp;2006, we began building an internal clinical development and regulatory team, based in Cary,
North Carolina to manage the development strategy for our later stage products. During the years
ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, we spent $73.3, $94.1, and $47.1&nbsp;million, respectively, on
research and development.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We seek to enter into collaborations with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies
when we feel it is advantageous to leverage these companies&#146; resources to develop and commercialize
our drug candidates on a global basis. This allows us to remain focused on our strength of early
stage discovery and development of drug candidates. To date, we have entered into two major
collaborations for the development and commercialization of our lead PNP inhibitors and two
collaborations for the development and commercialization of peramivir in certain countries outside
the U.S. In addition, in January&nbsp;2007, we announced that HHS had awarded the Company a $102.6
million, four-year contract for the advanced development of peramivir for U.S. licensure.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important component of our strategy is to augment our internal discovery programs
through the selective in-licensing of potential drug development targets or early stage compounds
for these specific targets. For example, our PNP inhibitors were in-licensed from AECOM and IRL in
June&nbsp;2000.

possibility of future event payments totaling $155&nbsp;million for achieving specified development,
regulatory and commercial events (including certain sales level amounts following a product&#146;s
launch) for certain indications. In addition, the agreement provides that we will receive royalties

event payments (up to $21&nbsp;million) and commercial event milestone payments (up to $95&nbsp;million) in
addition to double digit (between 10 and 20% range) royalty payments on product sales of peramivir.
In December&nbsp;2007, the Company received a $7&nbsp;million milestone payment from Shionogi for their
initiation of a Phase II clinical trial with i.v. peramivir. Generally, all payments under the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Competition</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive. Many companies,
including biotechnology, chemical and pharmaceutical companies, are actively engaged in activities
similar to ours, including research and development of drugs for the treatment of cancer,
infectious, autoimmune, and inflammatory disorders. Many of these companies have substantially
greater financial and other resources, larger research and development staffs, and more extensive
marketing and manufacturing organizations than we do. In addition, some of them have considerable
experience in preclinical testing, clinical trials and other regulatory approval procedures. There
are also academic institutions, governmental agencies and other research organizations that are
conducting research in areas in which we are working. They may also market commercial products,
either on their own or through collaborative efforts.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We expect to encounter significant competition for any of the pharmaceutical products we plan
to develop. Companies that complete clinical trials, obtain required regulatory approvals and
commence commercial sales of their products before their competitors may achieve a significant
competitive advantage. Such is the case with Eisai&#146;s Targretin for CTCL and the current
neuraminidase inhibitors marketed by GSK and Roche for influenza. In addition, several
pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms, including major pharmaceutical companies, have announced
efforts in the field of structure-based drug design and in the therapeutic areas of cancer,
infectious disease, autoimmune, and inflammatory disorders, as well as other therapeutic areas
where we are focusing our drug discovery efforts.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to compete successfully, we must develop proprietary positions in patented drugs for
therapeutic markets that have not been satisfactorily addressed by conventional research strategies
and, in the process, expand our expertise in structure-based drug design. Our products, even if
successfully tested and developed, may not be adopted by physicians over other products and may not
offer economically feasible alternatives to other therapies.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Government Regulation</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FDA regulates the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries in the U.S., and our drug
candidates are subject to extensive and rigorous domestic government regulations prior to
commercialization. The FDA regulates, among other things, the development, testing, manufacture,
safety, efficacy, record-keeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and
distribution of pharmaceutical products. In foreign countries, our products are also subject to
extensive regulation by foreign governments. These government regulations will be a significant
factor in the production and marketing of any pharmaceutical products that we develop. Failure to
comply with applicable FDA and other regulatory requirements at any stage during the regulatory
process may subject us to sanctions, including:

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regulatory review and approval process is lengthy, expensive and uncertain. Before
obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any products, we or our partners must
demonstrate that our product candidates are safe and effective for use in humans. The approval
process takes many years, substantial expenses may be incurred and significant time may be devoted
to clinical development.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before testing potential candidates in humans, we carry out laboratory and animal studies to
determine safety and biological activity. After completing preclinical trials, we must file an IND,
including a proposal to begin clinical trials, with the FDA. We have filed thirteen INDs to date
and plan to file, or rely on future partners to file, additional INDs in the future as our
potential drug candidates advance to that stage of development. Thirty days after filing an IND, a
Phase I human clinical trial can start, unless the FDA places a hold on the study.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Phase I trials are designed to determine safety in a small group of patients or healthy
volunteers. We also assess tolerances and the metabolic and pharmacologic actions of our drug
candidates at different doses. After we complete the initial trials, we conduct Phase II trials to
assess safety and efficacy and establish the optimal dose in patients. If Phase II trials are
successful, we or our partners conduct Phase III trials to verify the results in a larger patient
population. Phase III trials are required for FDA approval to market a drug. A Phase III trial may
require hundreds or even thousands of patients and is the most expensive to conduct. The goal in
Phase III is to collect enough safety and efficacy data to obtain FDA approval of a drug for
treatment of a particular disease. For some clinical indications that are especially serious and
for which there are no effective treatments, such as refractory cancers, conditional approval can
be obtained following Phase II trials.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initiation and completion of the clinical trial phases are dependent on several factors
including things that are beyond our control. For example, the clinical trials cannot begin at a
particular site until that site receives approval from its Institutional Review Board (&#147;IRB&#148;),
which reviews the protocol and related documents. This process can take from several weeks to
several months. In addition, clinical trials are dependent on patient enrollment, but the rate at
which patients enroll in the study depends on:

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After completion of the clinical trials of a product, we or our partners must submit a NDA to
the FDA for marketing approval before commercialization of the product. The FDA may not grant
approval on a timely basis, if at all. The FDA, as a result of the Food and Drug Administration
Modernization Act of 1997, has six months to review and act upon license applications for priority
therapeutics that are for life-threatening or unmet medical needs. Standard reviews can take
between one and two years, and can even take longer if significant questions arise during the
review process. The FDA may withdraw any required approvals, once obtained.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to clinical development regulations, we and our contract manufacturers and

regulations. GMP regulations include requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance
as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Manufacturing facilities are
subject to inspection by the FDA. Such facilities must be approved before we can use them in
commercial manufacturing of our potential products. We or our contract manufacturers may not be

following risks, along with all of the other information included in our other filings with the

uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also impair
our business operations. If we are unable to prevent events that have a negative effect from
occurring, then our business may suffer. Negative events are likely to decrease our revenue,
increase our costs, make our financial results poorer and/or decrease our financial strength, and
may cause our stock price to decline. In that case, you may lose all or a part of your investment

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B><I>We have incurred substantial losses since our inception in 1986, expect to continue to incur such
losses, and may never be profitable.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since our inception in 1986, we have not been profitable. We expect to incur additional losses
for the foreseeable future, and our losses could increase as our research and development efforts
progress. To become profitable, we must successfully manufacture and develop drug product
candidates, receive regulatory approval, and successfully commercialize or enter into profitable
agreements with other parties. It could be several years, if ever, before we receive royalties from
any current or future license agreements or revenues directly from product sales.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing our product
candidates and their potential for commercialization, we are unable to predict the extent of any
future losses. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase
profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. If we are unable to achieve and sustain
profitability, the market value of our common stock will likely decline.

development, especially through the clinical trial process.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To receive the regulatory approvals necessary for the sale of our product candidates, we or
our partners must demonstrate through preclinical studies and clinical trials that each product
candidate is safe and effective. The clinical trial process is complex and uncertain. Because of
the cost and duration of clinical trials, we may decide to discontinue development of product
candidates that are unlikely to show good results in the trials, unlikely to help advance a product
to the point of a meaningful collaboration, or unlikely to have a reasonable commercial potential.
We may suffer significant setbacks in pivotal clinical trials, even after earlier clinical trials
show promising results. Clinical trials may not be adequately designed or executed, which could
affect the potential outcome and analysis of study results. Any of our product candidates may
produce undesirable side effects in humans. These side effects could cause us or regulatory
authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials of a product candidate. These side effects
could also result in the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities refusing to approve the product
candidate for any targeted indications. We, our partners, the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities
may suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time if we or they believe the trial participants
face unacceptable health risks. Clinical trials may fail to demonstrate that our product candidates
are safe or effective and have acceptable commercial viability.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Our later stage clinical trials may not adequately show our drugs are safe or effective.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Progression of our drug products through the clinical development process is dependent upon
our trials indicating our drugs have adequate safety profiles and show positive therapeutic effects
in the patients being treated by achieving pre-determined endpoints according to the trial
protocols. Failure to achieve either of these could result in delays in our trials or even require
the performance of additional unplanned trials. This could result in delays in the development of
our drug candidates and could result in significant unexpected costs.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B><I>If we fail to obtain additional financing, we may be unable to complete the development and
commercialization of our product candidates or continue our research and development programs.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As our clinical programs continue to grow and patient enrollment increases, our costs will
increase. Our current and planned clinical trials plus the related development, manufacturing,
regulatory approval process requirements, and additional personnel resources and testing required
for supporting the development of our drug candidates will consume significant capital resources.
Our expenses, revenues and burn rate could vary significantly depending on many factors, including
our ability to raise additional capital, the development progress of our collaborative agreements
for our drug candidates, the amount of funding we receive from HHS for peramivir, the amount of
funding or assistance, if any, we receive from other governmental agencies or other new
partnerships with third parties for the development of our drug candidates, the progress and
results of our current and proposed clinical trials for our most advanced drug products, the
progress made in the manufacturing of our lead products and the progression of our other programs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We expect that we will be required to raise additional capital to complete the development and
commercialization of our current product candidates. Additional funding, whether through additional
sales of securities or collaborative or other arrangements with corporate partners or from other
sources, including governmental agencies, in general and from the HHS contract specifically, may
not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to us. The issuance of preferred or common
stock or convertible securities, with terms and prices significantly more favorable than those of
the currently outstanding common stock, could have the effect of diluting or adversely affecting
the holdings or rights of our existing stockholders. In addition, collaborative arrangements may
require us to transfer certain material rights to such corporate partners. Insufficient funds may
require us to delay, scale-back or eliminate certain of our research and development programs.
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B><I>If HHS were to eliminate, reduce or delay funding from our contract or dispute some of our incurred
costs, this would have a significant negative impact on our revenues, cash flows and the
development of peramivir.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our projections of revenues and incoming cash flows are substantially dependent upon HHS
reimbursement for the costs related to our peramivir program. If HHS were to eliminate, reduce or
delay the funding for this program or disallow some of our incurred costs, we would have to obtain
additional funding for development of this drug candidate or significantly reduce or stop the
development effort.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, in January&nbsp;2008, we announced that the development plan for peramivir had changed
and that we would no longer pursue the Phase III i.m. program in peramivir for the current
influenza season, but would move forward in evaluating higher doses than used in previous studies.
Also in January, we announced that the program would cost in excess of the $102.6&nbsp;million contract
and that any funding above the $102.6&nbsp;million may be the responsibility of the Company. Since
then, HHS and the Company have been working in collaboration through various contract modifications
to maximize resources by stopping work on some projects (e.g. the Phase III i.m. program) and
capping expenditures on other projects in order to maximize remaining funds. HHS and the Company
executed a contract modification that fully funds the Company through the completion of both the
phase II studies in

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">outpatients treated with intramuscular peramivir, the phase II study in hospitalized patients
with intravenous peramivir, and certain manufacturing and toxicology components of the program.
The modification also allows the Company and HHS to agree on additional development activities for
peramivir within the confirmed $102.6&nbsp;million funding. All temporary restraints, effected through
a stop work order, have now been removed. Following completion of the phase II studies, the
Company expects to continue the dialogue with HHS regarding additional funding beyond the $102.6
million for peramivir development through U.S. licensure. The original contract of $102.6&nbsp;million
and the four year term remain unchanged. In July&nbsp;2008, HHS indicated that it does not intend to
reimburse us all of the costs incurred related to the terminated Phase III studies. We continue to
pursue reimbursement of these costs. During the second quarter of 2008, we recorded a $4.9&nbsp;million
reserve against revenue for amounts we previously expected to receive from HHS related to the costs
incurred in this program. Approximately $4.6&nbsp;million of the reserve relates to revenues recognized
in the first quarter of 2008, while approximately $0.3&nbsp;million of the reserve relates to revenues
recognized in 2007.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contracting with HHS, we are subject to various U.S. government contract requirements,
including general clauses for a cost-reimbursement research and development contract, which may
limit our reimbursement or if we are found to be in violation could result in contract termination.
U.S. government contracts typically contain unfavorable termination provisions and are subject to
audit and modification by the government at its sole discretion. The U.S. government may terminate
its contract with us either for its convenience or if we default by failing to perform in

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our success will depend in part on our ability and the abilities of our partners to obtain,
protect and enforce viable intellectual property rights including but not limited to trade name,
trade mark and patent protection for our company and its products, methods, processes and other
technologies we may license or develop, to preserve our trade secrets, and to operate without
infringing the proprietary rights of third parties both domestically and abroad. The patent
position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies is generally highly uncertain, involves
complex legal and factual questions and has recently been the subject of much litigation. Neither
the United States Patent and Trademark Office (&#147;USPTO&#148;), the Patent Cooperation Treaty offices, nor
the courts of the United States and other jurisdictions have consistent policies nor predictable
rulings regarding the breadth of claims allowed or the degree of protection afforded under many
biotechnology and pharmaceutical patents. The validity, scope, enforceability and commercial value
of these rights, therefore, is highly uncertain.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our success depends in part on avoiding the infringement of other parties&#146; patents and other
intellectual property rights as well as avoiding the breach of any licenses relating to our
technologies and products. In the U.S., patent applications filed in recent years are confidential
for 18&nbsp;months, while older applications are not published until the patent issues. As a result,
avoiding patent infringement may be difficult and we may inadvertently infringe third-party patents
or proprietary rights. These third parties could bring claims against us, our partners or our
licensors that even if resolved in our favor, could cause us to incur substantial expenses and, if
resolved against us, could additionally cause us to pay substantial damages. Further, if a patent
infringement suit were brought against us, our partners or our licensors, we or they could be
forced to stop or delay research, development, manufacturing or sales of any infringing product in
the country or countries covered by the patent we infringe, unless we can obtain a license from the
patent holder. Such a license may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all, particularly if
the third party is developing or marketing a product competitive with the infringing product. Even
if we, our partners or our licensors were able to obtain a license, the rights may be nonexclusive,
which would give our competitors access to the same intellectual property.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we or our partners are unable or fail to adequately, initiate, protect, defend or enforce
our intellectual property rights in any area of commercial interest or in any part of the world
where we wish to seek regulatory approval for our products, methods, processes and other
technologies, the value of the drug product candidates to produce revenue would diminish.
Additionally, if our products, methods, processes, and other technologies or our commercial use of
such products, processes, and other technologies, including but not limited to any tradename,
trademark or commercial strategy infringe the proprietary rights of other parties, we could incur
substantial costs. The USPTO and the patent offices of other jurisdictions have issued to us a

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the completion of a Phase I/II clinical trial of forodesine HCl in patients with
refractory CTCL, in October&nbsp;2007 we initiated a planned pivotal trial with an oral formulation of
forodesine HCl for treatment of patients with CTCL. This trial is being conducted under an SPA
agreement negotiated with the FDA and will serve as a basis for a new drug application to the FDA
using the oral formulations in patients with relapsed CTCL. In February&nbsp;2007, we announced that the
Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products of the European Medicines Agency had granted orphan drug
designation to forodesine HCl for the treatment of CTCL. The trial continues to enroll subjects
with CTCL stages IIB through IVA who have failed three systemic therapies. Enrollment in the study
slowed over the summer of 2008 below our projections. We have taken action to accelerate
enrollment and early indications are that these actions are having a positive effect. We have
enrolled more than half of the targeted 130 patients in this study and will continue to monitor
enrollment going forward.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the December&nbsp;2007 meeting of the American Society of Hematology (&#147;ASH&#148;), Madeline Duvic,
M.D., Deputy Chair, Dermatology, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, presented
interim data from the Phase I/II clinical study of oral forodesine HCl in the treatment of subjects
with refractory CTCL. The overall response rate for these subjects was 39%, including 2 subjects
with complete response (6%) and 12 subjects with partial response (33%). These data indicated that
in addition to a good safety profile, forodesine HCl demonstrated clinical activity as a single
oral agent in patients with advanced refractory CTCL.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&nbsp;2008, we announced interim data from the ongoing forodesine HCl Phase II program
in patients with CLL and data from a healthy subject pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study. The
CLL study will continue with an amendment to study a new dosing regimen of oral forodesine, 200 mg
twice-daily. An interim analysis was conducted on data from an exploratory Phase II single-arm,
open-label program in patients with CLL whose previous treatment had failed. While this analysis
showed that no partial or complete responses were observed, five out of 13 patients administered
200 mg of forodesine HCl once-daily had substantial reductions in malignant lymphocytes, and at the
time of the analysis, seven patients were still on study. Forodesine HCl was generally safe and
well-tolerated at the 200 mg once-daily dose. In a parallel, healthy subject, pharmacokinetic and
pharmacodynamic study, we compared the effect of seven days of 200 mg forodesine HCl dosed
once-daily with seven days of 200 mg forodesine HCl dosed twice-daily. The study demonstrated
substantially increased drug exposure and pharmacodynamic effect in subjects administered
forodesine HCl 200 mg twice-daily. Drug exposure, as measured by area under the
(plasma-concentration/time) curve (&#147;AUC&#148;), increased by 63&nbsp;percent (P&#060;0.001) for twice-daily
dosing compared to once-daily dosing. Serum uric acid levels were reduced at steady state compared
to baseline by 50.0&nbsp;percent for twice-daily dosing compared to 23.5&nbsp;percent for once-daily dosing
(p&#060;0.001), indicating increased PNP enzyme inhibition with twice-daily dosing.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January&nbsp;2007, we initiated a Phase IIb multicenter, open-label, non-randomized repeat-dose
registration study to evaluate an intravenous treatment of forodesine HCl followed by an oral
treatment of forodesine HCl in patients with relapsed or refractory T-ALL. This study was being
conducted under an SPA negotiated with the FDA and was designed to determine the rate of complete
remission achieved with forodesine HCl. In March&nbsp;2007, we announced that as a result of a stability
issue with the i.v. formulation, that we were voluntarily placing this Phase IIb clinical trial on
hold pending internal review and discussions with the our partner, Mundipharma. In December&nbsp;2007,
we announced the formal termination of this study.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Peramivir</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January&nbsp;2007, we announced that HHS had awarded the Company a $102.6&nbsp;million, four-year
contract for the advanced development of peramivir. In January&nbsp;2008, we announced that the
development plan for peramivir had changed and that we would no longer pursue the Phase III i.m.
program in peramivir for the current influenza season, but would move forward in evaluating higher
doses than used in previous studies. Also in January, we announced that the program would cost in
excess of the $102.6&nbsp;million contract and that any funding above the $102.6&nbsp;million may be the
responsibility of the Company. Since then, HHS and the Company have been working in collaboration
through various contract modifications to maximize resources by stopping work on some projects
(e.g. the Phase III i.m. program) and capping expenditures on other projects in order to maximize
remaining funds. HHS and the Company executed a contract modification that fully funds the Company
through the completion of both the phase II studies in outpatients treated with intramuscular
peramivir, the phase II study in hospitalized patients with intravenous peramivir, and certain
manufacturing and toxicology components of the program. The modification also allows the Company
and HHS to agree on additional development activities for peramivir within the confirmed $102.6
million funding. All temporary restraints, effected through a stop work order, have now been
removed. Following completion of the phase II studies, we expect to continue the dialogue with HHS
regarding additional funding beyond the $102.6&nbsp;million for peramivir development through U.S.
licensure. The original contract of $102.6&nbsp;million and the four year term remain unchanged.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the contract with HHS, in February&nbsp;2007, we established a collaborative
relationship with Shionogi for the development and commercialization of peramivir in Japan. We
received an upfront payment of $14&nbsp;million and the agreement provided for additional future
clinical event milestone payments of up to $21&nbsp;million. Shionogi recently completed a Phase II
study of intravenous (i.v.) peramivir administered via a single dose infusion in the outpatient
setting for treatment of seasonal influenza. This trial met its primary endpoint of improvement in
the median time to alleviation of symptoms in subjects with confirmed, acute, uncomplicated
influenza infection, compared to placebo alone. Time to alleviation of symptoms was 81.8 hours for
placebo, 59.1 hours for 300 mg peramivir, and 59.9 hours for 600 mg peramivir. This result was
highly statistically significant (p=0.0046) for both the 300 mg dose (p=0.0046) and the 600 mg
dose. Further, safety assessments confirmed that i.v. peramivir was generally safe and
well-tolerated. Shionogi presented the data at the recent Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial
Agents and Chemotherapy (ICAAC)/ Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA)&nbsp;annual meeting in
Washington, D.C. Based on the results from this Phase II study, Shionogi has initiated a Phase III
program with i.v. peramivir in the outpatient setting. The Phase III
study is a 1,050 subject
study and would typically require two seasons to complete. In the event of a very strong flu
season it is possible to complete a study of this magnitude in one flu season. Although it has
been a strong flu season in Asia, it is not clear at this time if Shionogi will finish in one
season or two. It is our understanding that Shionogi plans to complete its studies within this
influenza season. In October&nbsp;2008, the Company and Shionogi amended the license agreement to expand
the territory in the agreement to include Taiwan and to provide rights for Shionogi to perform a
Phase III clinical trial in Hong Kong.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Intramuscular peramivir. </I>We completed a double-blind placebo-controlled Phase II clinical
trial with i.m. peramivir testing two different dose levels of peramivir (150 mg and 300 mg) versus
placebo in adults with acute uncomplicated influenza. While the trial did not demonstrate
statistically significant differences for its primary endpoint of time to alleviation of symptoms,
the preliminary analysis of the virologic data indicated that peramivir demonstrated statistically
significant reductions in influenza virus shedding in both peramivir treatment groups compared to
placebo, with greater reductions in the 300 mg dose group. With this information and the additional
pharmacokinetic information we have obtained subsequent to the trial, we initiated a Phase II
placebo-controlled trial of 600 mg i.m. peramivir for the treatment of seasonal influenza. This
trial uses a new, more concentrated 150 mg/ml formulation of peramivir. This trial is ongoing in
the Northern Hemisphere and we expect results sometime in the second quarter of 2009.

of i.v. peramivir to compare the efficacy and safety of i.v. peramivir to orally administered
oseltamivir in patients who require hospitalization due to acute influenza.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary objective of the study was to evaluate time to clinical stability, which is a
composite endpoint comprised of normalization of temperature, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate,
systolic blood pressure and heart rate. This type of endpoint has previously been used in pneumonia
studies, but not in influenza. Secondary objectives of the study included evaluation of viral
shedding, mortality, clinical relapse and time to resumption of usual activities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled, Phase II Study
enrolled 137 patients, who tested positive by rapid antigen test (RAT)&nbsp;for influenza and had one or
more criteria for hospitalization, namely: age &#062; 60&nbsp;years, chronic lung disease, congestive
heart failure, diabetes mellitus, low oxygen saturation, low blood pressure, or severity of illness
requiring supportive care. Of the 137 patients randomized, 122 age 19 to 101&nbsp;years had influenza
confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)&nbsp;testing and were included in the intent-to-treat
infected (ITTI)&nbsp;patient population; 41 patients received oseltamivir 75 mg orally twice-daily, 41
patients received 200 mg i.v. peramivir once-daily and 40 patients received 400 mg i.v. peramivir
once-daily. As reported in October&nbsp;2008, there were no statistically significant differences in
any of the efficacy endpoints between the three treatment arms, and peramivir was generally safe
and well-tolerated at those dose levels. Evaluation of time to clinical stability, the primary
endpoint, showed a median of 23.7 hours for peramivir 200mg, 37.0 hours for peramivir 400 mg and
28.1 hours for oseltamivir (p=.306). This exploratory endpoint was driven by resolution of fever.
Viral shedding (time weighted change from baseline in viral titer) was reduced by a median of -2.0
logs for peramivir 200mg, -2.1 logs for peramivir 400mg, and -1.9 logs for oseltamivir (p=.908).
There was no mortality in the primary efficacy population, and there were no clinical relapses.
Patients were discharged from the hospital after a median of 4.0&nbsp;days for peramivir 200 mg, 3,8
days for peramivir 400 mg, and 4.0&nbsp;days for oseltamivir (p=0.994). The median number of days
required for resumption of usual activities was 8.8&nbsp;days for peramivir 200 mg, 9.0&nbsp;days for
peramivir 400 mg, and 13.7&nbsp;days for oseltamivir (p=0.276). The Company presented the results at the
XI International Symposium on Respiratory Viral Infection being held in Bangkok, Thailand in
February&nbsp;2009.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the third quarter of 2007, we announced that Roche had initiated a Phase IIa clinical
trial to evaluate oral doses of BCX-4208/R3421 in patients with moderate to severe plaque
psoriasis. The efficacy assessment of the study has been completed. Consistent with interim
findings reported by the Company in May&nbsp;2008, the Phase II clinical study of BCX-4208, a potent,
rationally designed, orally available PNP inhibitor, met its primary objectives of safety and
tolerability. In addition, BCX-4208 displayed dose-dependent reductions in peripheral blood
lymphocyte counts, including subsets measuring B cells (CD20), total T cells (CD3), T helper cells
(CD4) and T suppressor/cytotoxic cells (CD8). Further, plasma levels of BCX-4208 increased with
dose, and plasma uric acid levels showed dose-related reductions with BCX-4208. In addition,
consistent with interim results previously reported by the Company, no evidence of clinical
efficacy, a secondary objective, was observed in psoriasis patients with doses and duration of
administration tested.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Phase IIa trial, BCX-4208 was generally safe and well-tolerated at doses up to 120 mg
daily for six (6)&nbsp;weeks. Most adverse events reported were considered mild or moderate, and low in
frequency. No opportunistic infections were observed. In addition, detailed laboratory and
clinical monitoring did not indicate any patterns suggestive of off-target adverse findings.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also in May&nbsp;2008, we announced that we received notice that Roche was exercising the &#147;no

III program of intramuscular (i.m.) peramivir for outpatient influenza. The Company initiated this
program and voluntarily discontinued it following a decision to pursue higher doses in the ongoing
Phase II study. Reimbursement of these costs is under discussion with HHS. Further contributing to
the decrease in collaborative and other R&#038;D revenues from 2007 to 2008 was the prior year receipt
of a $7.0&nbsp;million milestone payment from Shionogi. This was offset by the recognition of $26.5
million of previously deferred revenue related to the termination of the Company&#146;s collaboration
with Roche in the fourth quarter of 2008.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research and development expenses were $73.3&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008,
compared to $94.1&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007. The decrease in R&#038;D expenses was
due to a reduction in the clinical development costs of $16.3&nbsp;million and toxicology costs of $1.6
million associated with the peramivir program, a reduction in manufacturing costs of $10.3&nbsp;million
and $6.4&nbsp;million associated with the peramivir and Forodesine HCl programs, respectively, and a
reduction in costs incurred on the Company&#146;s pre-clinical compounds of $0.9&nbsp;million. These
reductions were offset by an increase in the Company&#146;s clinical development costs of $2.6&nbsp;million
for Forodesine HCl, the recognition of $8.2&nbsp;million of previously deferred expense related to the

and there was an increase of $3.1&nbsp;million in amortization of deferred revenue compared to 2006 on
the continuing amortization of the upfront payments from the Roche, Shionogi and Mundipharma
agreements. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease of $1.5&nbsp;million in
reimbursement from Mundipharma for our clinical trial costs compared to 2006.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research and development expenses for 2007 were $94.1&nbsp;million, a 100.0% increase from 2006
expenses of $47.1&nbsp;million, primarily attributable to the clinical and manufacturing costs of our
expanded peramivir and forodesine HCl programs, increases in personnel and related costs to support
the advanced development of our pipeline, and increases in consulting and toxicology. Included in
R&#038;D expenses for 2007 is approximately $2.3&nbsp;million of pre-contract costs directly related to the
Phase II trials for both the i.v. and i.m. peramivir products. These costs were incurred during
2006 in anticipation of a contract award from HHS and were required to meet the delivery schedule
of the proposed contract. In accordance with the provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulation
31.205-32, the costs were included in the Company&#146;s request for proposal and were eligible for
reimbursement from HHS. The $2.3&nbsp;million of costs incurred prior to the contract award date were
deferred and included in other current assets on the Company&#146;s balance sheet at December&nbsp;31, 2006.
In the first quarter of 2007, the $2.3&nbsp;million in costs were billed and expensed. Concurrently,

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, we have attempted to contain costs and reduce cash flow requirements by renting
scientific equipment and facilities, contracting with other parties to conduct certain research and
development and using consultants. We expect to incur additional expenses, potentially resulting in
significant losses, as we continue to pursue our research and development activities, undertake
additional preclinical studies and clinical trials of compounds which have been or may be
discovered and as we increase the manufacturing of our compounds for clinical trials and for the
continuation of the validation process. We also expect to incur substantial expenses related to the
filing, prosecution, maintenance, defense and enforcement of patent and other intellectual property
claims and additional regulatory costs as our clinical products advance through later stages of
development.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We invest our excess cash principally in U.S. marketable securities from a diversified
portfolio of institutions with strong credit ratings and by policy, limit the amount of credit
exposure at any one institution. These investments are generally not collateralized and mature
within two years. We have not realized any significant losses from such investments.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On August&nbsp;7, 2007, we amended our lease for our current Birmingham facilities, consisting of
50,150 square feet, through June&nbsp;30, 2015. We have an option to renew the lease for an additional
five years at the current market rate in effect on June&nbsp;30, 2015. The lease requires us to pay
monthly rent currently at $40,273 per month in December&nbsp;2008 and escalates annually to a minimum of
$48,072 per month in the final year, plus our pro rata share of operating expenses and real estate
taxes in excess of base year amounts. In addition, the most recent lease amendment provided an
allowance of $300,000 for our use in making certain improvements to the premises.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In August&nbsp;2006, we opened an office in Cary, North Carolina for the establishment of our
clinical and regulatory operation. We currently have 5,565 square feet under lease through February
28, 2010. This lease currently requires us to pay $7,881 per month and escalates annually to $8,118
per month in the final year.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2008, we incurred capital costs of approximately $1.2&nbsp;million, while we incurred
capital costs of approximately $3.3&nbsp;million in 2007. Included in 2007 capital costs were amounts
related to a renovation of our facility to build additional laboratory space. The cost of this
expansion was partially funded by a $300,000 tenant allowance in our 2007 lease amendment.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2008, we had long-term operating lease obligations, which provide for
aggregate minimum payments of $641,323 in 2009, $575,246 in 2010, and $551,744 in 2011. These

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March&nbsp;2007, we announced a collaborative agreement with Shionogi for rights to peramivir in
Japan. This agreement required an upfront payment of $14&nbsp;million that was received in April&nbsp;2007.
In December&nbsp;2007, we received a $7&nbsp;million milestone payment from Shionogi for their initiation of
a Phase II clinical trial with i.v. peramivir. In October&nbsp;2008, the Company and Shionogi amended
the license agreement to expand the territory covered by the agreement to include Taiwan and to
provide rights for Shionogi to perform a Phase III Clinical Trial in Hong Kong. Shionogi initiated
a Phase III study in December&nbsp;2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January&nbsp;2007, we announced that HHS had awarded the Company a $102.6&nbsp;million, four-year
contract for the advanced development of peramivir. The contract is a standard cost plus fixed fee
contract, which we expect will continue to have a significant positive impact on our financial
position and cash flow. We bill our incurred costs to HHS on a monthly basis. Any significant
delays in payment, rejection of significant costs by HHS or cancellation of this contract by HHS
would have a significant negative effect on our financial position. In January&nbsp;2008, we announced
that the development plan for peramivir had changed and that we would no longer pursue the Phase
III i.m. program in peramivir for the current influenza season, but would move forward in
evaluating higher doses than used in previous studies. Also in January, we announced that the
program would cost in excess of the $102.6&nbsp;million contract and that any funding above the $102.6
million may be the responsibility of the Company. Since then, HHS and the Company have been
working in collaboration through various contract modifications to maximize resources by stopping
work on some projects (e.g. the Phase III i.m. program) and capping expenditures on other projects
in order to maximize remaining funds. HHS and the Company executed a contract modification that
fully funds the Company through the completion of both the phase II studies in outpatients treated
with intramuscular peramivir, the phase II study in hospitalized patients with intravenous
peramivir, and certain manufacturing and toxicology components of the program. The modification
also allows the Company and HHS to agree on additional development activities for peramivir within
the confirmed $102.6&nbsp;million funding. All temporary restraints, effected through a stop work
order, have now been removed. Following completion of the phase II studies, we expect to continue
the dialogue with HHS regarding additional funding beyond the $102.6&nbsp;million for peramivir
development through U.S. licensure. The original contract of $102.6&nbsp;million and the four year term
remain unchanged.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February&nbsp;2006, we licensed forodesine HCl to Mundipharma for the development and
commercialization of this drug in Europe, Asia and Australasia. In addition to the upfront payment
of $10&nbsp;million, which was received in February&nbsp;2006, Mundipharma is paying 50% of the clinical
development costs we are incurring for forodesine HCl on existing and planned clinical trials, but
their portion shall not exceed $10&nbsp;million. In addition, Mundipharma will conduct additional
clinical trials at their own cost up to a maximum of $15&nbsp;million. The agreement also provides for
future event payments and royalties to be made by Mundipharma upon the achievement of certain
clinical, regulatory and sales events. In January&nbsp;2007, we initiated our pivotal study with
forodesine HCl in T-cell leukemia patients under an SPA negotiated with the FDA, which triggered a
$5&nbsp;million event payment from Mundipharma. Subsequently, in March&nbsp;2007, the Company made a decision
to put this trial on voluntary hold to investigate particulates that were found in some batches of
i.v. formulation. In December&nbsp;2007, we announced the termination of our development in T-ALL with
forodesine HCl. In July&nbsp;2007, we announced the Company had received an SPA for a pivotal trial of
forodesine HCl in CTCL patients. The trial is a multicenter, multinational, open-label, single-arm,
repeat dose pivotal trial which began enrollment during October&nbsp;2007. The trial continues to
enroll subjects with CTCL stages IIB through IVA who have failed three systemic therapies.
Enrollment in the study slowed over the summer of 2008 below our projections. We have taken action
to accelerate enrollment and early indications are that these actions are having a positive effect.
We will continue to monitor enrollment going forward.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the year, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance has decreased from
$85.0&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2007 to $63.3&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2008. This decrease was
primarily due to cash used for operations, partially offset by reimbursement from collaborators. As
a result, our net cash burn rate for 2008 was approximately $1.8&nbsp;million per month. We caution that
our revenues, our expenses, and our cash flows will vary significantly from quarter to quarter
throughout 2009 due to the nature of the trials in influenza and the reimbursement from HHS. We are
projecting our 2009 net cash use to be $30 to $38&nbsp;million, dependent on the achievement of certain
milestones. Our actual burn rate could vary significantly from the projection above depending on
the timing of Company expenses and the related reimbursement from our collaborators.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As our clinical programs continue to progress and patient enrollment increases, our costs will
increase. Our current and planned clinical trials plus the related development, manufacturing,
regulatory approval process requirements and additional personnel resources and testing required
for the continuing development of our drug candidates will consume significant capital resources
and will increase our expenses. Our expenses, revenues and burn rate could vary significantly
depending on many factors, including our ability to raise additional capital, the development
progress of our collaborative agreements for our drug candidates, the amount and timing of funding
we receive from HHS for peramivir, the amount of funding or assistance, if any, we receive from
other governmental agencies or other new partnerships with third parties for the development of our
drug candidates, the progress and results of our current and proposed clinical trials for our most
advanced drug products, the progress made in the manufacturing of our lead products and the
progression of our other programs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2008, we had $63.3&nbsp;million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable
securities. With our currently available funds and the amounts to be received from HHS, Shionogi
and our other collaborators, we believe these resources will be sufficient to fund our operations
for at least the next twelve months. However, this is a forward looking statement, and there may be
changes that would consume available resources significantly before such time.

principles generally accepted in the United States, which were utilized in the preparation of our
financial statements. Certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by
management that have a material impact on the carrying

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">value of certain assets and liabilities. Management considers such accounting policies to be
critical accounting policies. The judgments and assumptions used by management are based on
historical experience and other factors, which are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances. Because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made by management, actual
results could differ from these judgments and estimates, which could have a material impact on the
carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to our financial
statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, we
believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully
understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and affect the more significant
judgments and estimates that we use in the preparation of our financial statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Revenue Recognition</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our revenues have generally been limited to license fees, event payments, research and
development fees, government contracts, and interest income. Revenue is recognized in accordance
with Staff Accounting Bulletin No.&nbsp;104, <I>Revenue Recognition </I>and Emerging Issues Task Force Issue
00-21, <I>Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables </I>(&#147;EITF Issue 00-21&#148;). License fees, event
payments, and research and development fees are recognized as revenue when the earnings process is
complete and we have no further continuing performance obligations or we have completed the
performance obligations under the terms of the agreement. Fees received under licensing agreements
that are related to future performance are deferred and recognized as earned over an estimated
period determined by management based on the terms of the agreement and the products licensed. For
example, in the Mundipharma license agreement, we deferred the upfront payment over the remaining
life of the patent, which is 2017. In the event a license agreement contains multiple
deliverables, we evaluate whether the deliverables are separate or combined units of accounting in
accordance with EITF Issue 00-21. Revisions to revenue or profit estimates as a result of changes
in the estimated revenue period are recognized prospectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the guidance of EITF Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 99-19, <I>Reporting Revenue Gross as
a Principal Versus Net as an Agent </I>and Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 01-14, <I>Income Statement
Characterization of Reimbursements Received for &#147;Out-of-Pocket&#148; Expenses</I>, reimbursements received
for direct out-of-pocket expenses related to research and development costs are recorded as revenue
in the income statement rather than as a reduction in expenses. For example, the amounts received
from our collaboration with Mundipharma for the reimbursement of clinical trial costs and the costs
received from HHS for reimbursement will be recorded as revenue in the period the related costs
were recorded.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Event payments are recognized as revenue upon the achievement of specified events if (1)&nbsp;the
event is substantive in nature and the achievement of the event was not reasonably assured at the
inception of the agreement and (2)&nbsp;the fees are non-refundable and non-creditable. Any event
payments received prior to satisfying these criteria are recorded as deferred revenue.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Royalty revenue is recognized based on estimates of royalties earned during the applicable
period and adjusted for differences between the estimated and actual royalties in the following
period. If royalties can not be reasonably estimated, revenue is recognized upon receipt of royalty
statements from the licensee. We have not received any royalties from the sale of licensed
pharmaceutical products.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Research and Development Expenses</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;2, <I>Accounting for Research
and Development Costs</I>, we expense research and development costs as incurred. Prior to January&nbsp;1,
2008, we also expensed nonrefundable advance payments for goods and services received in connection
with research and development activities. Effective January&nbsp;1, 2008, we adopted the consensus in
Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 07-3, <I>Accounting for Nonrefundable Advance Payments for Goods and
Services Received for Use in Future Research and Development Activities </I>(&#147;EITF Issue 07-3&#148;). EITF
07-3 requires that these payments be deferred and recognized as an expense as the related goods are
delivered or the related services are performed. We applied the new guidance to all advance
payments made during 2008 for contracts executed after the effective date of this consensus.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research and development expenses include, among other items, personnel costs, including
salaries and benefits, manufacturing costs, clinical, regulatory, and toxicology services performed
by contract research organizations (&#147;CRO&#146;s&#148;), materials and supplies, and overhead allocations
consisting of various administrative and facilities related costs. Most of our manufacturing and
clinical and preclinical studies are performed by third-party CRO&#146;s. Costs for studies performed by
CRO&#146;s are accrued by us over the service periods specified in the contracts and estimates are
adjusted, if required, based upon our on-going review of the level of services actually performed.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, we have license agreements with third parties, such as AECOM, IRL, and UAB,
which require fees related to sublicense agreements or maintenance fees. We expense sublicense
payments as incurred unless they are related to revenues that have been deferred, in which case the
expenses are deferred and recognized over the related revenue recognition period. We expense
maintenance payments as incurred.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our accounting for deferred sublicense payments related to revenues that have been deferred is
based on the guidance in SAB No.&nbsp;104, which states that the incremental direct costs incurred
related to the acquisition or origination of a contract in a transaction that results in the
deferral of revenue may either be expensed as incurred or accounted for in accordance with
paragraph 4 of Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) Technical Bulletin 90-1, <I>Accounting
for Separately Priced Extended Warranty and Product Maintenance Costs </I>(&#147;FTB 90-1&#148;). Sublicense
payments are paid to our academic partners upon receipt of consideration from various commercial
partners. These deferred expenses would not have been incurred without receipt of such payments
from our commercial partners and are being expensed in proportion to the related revenue being
recognized. We believe that this accounting treatment appropriately matches expenses with the
associated revenue.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We group our R&#038;D expenses into two major categories: direct external expenses and all other
R&#038;D expenses. Direct external expenses consist of costs of outside parties to conduct laboratory
studies, to develop manufacturing processes and manufacture the product candidate, to conduct and
manage clinical trials and similar costs related to our clinical and preclinical studies. These
costs are accumulated and tracked by program. All other R&#038;D expenses consist of costs to compensate
personnel, to purchase lab supplies and services, to maintain our facility, equipment and overhead
and similar costs of our research and development efforts. These costs apply to work on our
clinical and preclinical candidates as well as our discovery research efforts. These costs have not
been charged directly to each program historically because the number of product candidates and
projects in research and development may vary from period to period and because we utilize internal
resources across multiple projects at the same time.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, due to the risks inherent in the clinical trial process and given the stages of
our various product development programs, we are unable to estimate with any certainty the costs we
will incur in the continued development of our drug candidates for potential commercialization.
While we are currently focused on advancing each of our development programs, our future R&#038;D
expenses will depend on the determinations we make as to the scientific and clinical success of
each drug candidate, as well as ongoing assessments as to each drug candidate&#146;s commercial
potential. As such, we are unable to predict how we will allocate available resources among our
product

certainty the development progress of our existing partnerships for our drug candidates, which drug
candidates will be subject to future collaborations, when such arrangements will be secured, if at

requirements.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The successful development of our drug candidates is uncertain and subject to a number of
risks. We cannot be certain that any of our drug candidates will prove to be safe and effective or
will meet all of the applicable regulatory requirements needed to receive and maintain marketing
approval. Data from preclinical studies and clinical trials are susceptible to varying
interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory clearance. We, the FDA, or other
regulatory authorities may suspend clinical trials at any time if we or they believe that the
subjects participating in such trials are being exposed to unacceptable risks or if such regulatory
agencies find deficiencies in the conduct of the trials or other problems with our products under
development. Delays or rejections may be encountered based on additional governmental regulation,
legislation, administrative action or changes in FDA or other regulatory policy during development
or the review process. Other risks associated with our product development programs are described
in Risk Factors in Part&nbsp;I, Item&nbsp;1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as updated from time to time
in our subsequent periodic reports and current reports filed with the SEC. Due to these
uncertainties, accurate and meaningful estimates of the ultimate cost to bring a product to market,
the timing of completion of any of our product development programs and the period in which
material net cash inflows from any of our product development programs will commence are
unavailable.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the process of preparing financial statements, we are required to estimate accrued
expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with
our applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating
the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not
yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost. The majority of our service providers
invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as
of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to
us. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make
adjustments if necessary. To date, there have been no material changes to our estimates. Examples
of estimated accrued expenses include:

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We base our expenses related to clinical trials on our estimates of the services received and
efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and clinical research
organizations that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf. The financial terms of these
agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven
payment flows. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful
enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones. In accruing service fees,
we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be
expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort
varies from our estimate, we will adjust the accrual accordingly. To date, there have been no
material changes to our estimates. If we do not identify costs that we have begun to incur or if we
underestimate or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of these services, our
actual expenses could differ from our estimates.

expense over the requisite service period of the award. Consistent with the valuation method we
used for disclosure-only purposes under the provisions of Statement No.&nbsp;123, we use the
Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate fair value under Statement No.&nbsp;123R. Determining the
appropriate fair value model and the related assumptions for the model requires judgment, including
estimating the life of an award, the stock price volatility, and the expected term. Compensation
cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing
the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing our risk. We invest our
excess cash principally in U.S. marketable securities from a diversified portfolio of institutions
with strong credit ratings and by policy, limit the amount of credit exposure at any one
institution. Some of the securities we invest in may have market risk. This means that a change in
prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate. To
minimize this risk, we schedule our investments to have maturities that coincide with our expected
cash flow needs, thus avoiding the need to redeem an investment prior to its maturity date.
Accordingly, we believe we have no material exposure to market risk arising from our investments.
Therefore, no quantitative tabular disclosure is provided.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;), a Delaware corporation, is a biotechnology
company that designs, optimizes, and develops novel drugs that block key enzymes involved in
cancer, cardiovascular diseases, autoimmune diseases, and viral infections. The Company integrates
the necessary disciplines of biology, crystallography, medicinal chemistry, and computer modeling
to effectively use structure-based drug design to discover and develop small molecule
pharmaceuticals. The Company has multiple research projects in different stages of development from
early discovery to a pivotal Phase II trial of the Company&#146;s most advanced drug candidate,
forodesine HCl. While the prospects for a project may increase as the project advances to the next
stage of development, a project can be terminated at any stage of development. Until the Company
generates revenues from either a research project or an approved product, the Company&#146;s ability to
continue research projects is dependent upon its ability to raise funds through the sale of equity
securities or through collaborative arrangements with government agencies or third-party partners.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company generally considers cash equivalents to be all cash held in money market accounts
or investments in debt instruments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase
in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;95, <I>Statement of Cash Flows</I>.
</DIV>

Investments in Debt and Equity Securities</I>, the Company is required to classify securities as
trading, available-for-sale, or held-to-maturity. The appropriateness of each classification is
assessed at the time of purchase and at each reporting date. Unrealized gains and losses on
securities available-for-sale are recognized in other comprehensive income, unless an unrealized
loss is considered to be other than temporary, in which case the unrealized loss is charged to
operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective January&nbsp;1, 2008, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
157, <I>Fair Value Measurements </I>(&#147;Statement No.&nbsp;157&#148;), for financial assets and liabilities and any
other assets and liabilities carried at fair value. This pronouncement defines fair value,
establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value
measurements. While this standard applies whenever other standards require (or permit) assets or
liabilities to be measured at fair value, it does not expand the use of fair value in any new
circumstances. The adoption of Statement No.&nbsp;157 did not have a significant impact on the Company&#146;s
financial statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective January&nbsp;1, 2008, the Company also adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No.&nbsp;159, <I>The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Liabilities </I>(&#147;Statement No.
159&#148;), but did not elect to apply fair value accounting to any financial instruments that were not
already accounted for at fair value under existing guidance. As a result, the adoption of Statement
No.&nbsp;159 did not have a significant impact on the Company&#146;s financial statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2007, the Company had $53,853,181 of marketable securities, of which
$43,770,636 was classified as available-for-sale and $10,082,545 was classified as
held-to-maturity. Securities available-for-sale consisted primarily of U.S. Agency securities
carried at estimated fair values. At December&nbsp;31, 2007, the amortized cost of securities
available-for-sale was $42,918,200. At December&nbsp;31, 2007, gross unrealized gains on securities
available-for-sale were $378,057. There were no gross unrealized losses on securities
available-for-sale at December&nbsp;31, 2007. Securities held-to-maturity consisted primarily of U.S.
Agency securities carried at amortized cost. The estimated fair value of securities
held-to-maturity at December&nbsp;31, 2007 was $10,096,160 based on independent quoted market prices.
At December&nbsp;31, 2007, gross unrecognized holding gains on securities held-to-maturity were $16,131,

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2008, in an effort to minimize investment risk in light of the current economic
environment, the Company sold two securities previously classified as held-to-maturity. The

related to the voluntarily terminated Phase III studies of the peramivir intramuscular (&#147;i.m.&#148;)
program. The Company is in discussions with HHS regarding the reimbursement of these costs and

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furniture and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line
method with estimated useful lives of five and seven years. Laboratory equipment, office equipment,
and software are depreciated over a life of five years. Furniture and fixtures are depreciated over
a life of seven years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over their estimated useful lives or
the remaining lease term, whichever is less. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No.&nbsp;144, <I>Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets</I>, the Company
periodically reviews its furniture and equipment for impairment when events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable.
Determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting
from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. In the event that such cash flows are not
expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the assets, the assets are written down
to their estimated fair values. Furniture and equipment to be disposed of are reported at the lower
of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company records all expenses in the period incurred. In addition to recording expenses for
invoices received, the Company estimates the cost of services provided by third parties or
materials purchased for which no invoices have been received as of each balance sheet date. Accrued
expenses as of December&nbsp;31, 2008 and 2007 consisted primarily of development and clinical trial
expenses payable to contract research organizations in connection with the Company&#146;s research and
development programs.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The liability method is used in accounting for income taxes in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;109, <I>Accounting for Income Taxes </I>(&#147;Statement No.&nbsp;109&#148;). Under
this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between
financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax
rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective January&nbsp;1, 2007, the Company adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting
Standards Board Interpretation No.&nbsp;48, <I>&#147;Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an
interpretation of FASB Statement No.&nbsp;109&#148; </I>(&#147;FIN No.&nbsp;48&#148;). FIN No.&nbsp;48 clarifies the accounting for
uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise&#146;s financial statements in accordance with
Statement No.&nbsp;109, and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for financial
statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax
return.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s revenues have generally been limited to license fees, event payments, research
and development fees, government contracts, and interest income. Revenue is recognized in
accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No.&nbsp;104, <I>Revenue Recognition </I>(&#147;SAB No.&nbsp;104&#148;) and Emerging
Issues Task Force Issue 00-21, <I>Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables </I>(&#147;EITF Issue
00-21&#148;). License fees, event payments, and research and development fees are recognized as revenue
when the earnings process is complete and the Company has no further continuing performance
obligations or the Company has completed the performance obligations under the terms of the
agreement. Fees received under licensing agreements that are related to future performance are
deferred and recognized over an estimated period determined by management based on the terms of the
agreements and the products licensed. In the event a license agreement contains multiple
deliverables, the Company evaluates whether the deliverables are separate or combined units of
accounting in accordance with EITF Issue 00-21. Revisions to revenue or profit estimates as a
result of changes in the estimated revenue period are recognized prospectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the guidance of Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 99-19, <I>Reporting Revenue Gross as a
Principal Versus Net as an Agent </I>(&#147;EITF Issue 99-19&#148;) and Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 01-14,
<I>Income Statement Characterization of Reimbursements Received for &#147;Out-of-Pocket&#148; Expenses </I>(&#147;EITF
Issue 01-14&#148;), reimbursements received for direct out-of-pocket expenses related to research and
development costs are recorded as revenue in the income statement rather than as a reduction in
expenses.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Event payments are recognized as revenue upon the achievement of specified events if (1)&nbsp;the
event is substantive in nature and the achievement of the event was not reasonably assured at the
inception of the agreement and (2)&nbsp;the fees are non-refundable and non-creditable. Any event
payments received prior to satisfying these criteria are recorded as deferred revenue.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Royalty revenue is recognized based on estimates of royalties earned during the applicable
period and adjusted for differences between the estimated and actual royalties in the following

provision for costs and fees of $4,918,849 (or $0.13 per share), of which $4,567,604 relates to
revenues recognized in the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2008 and $351,245 relates to revenues
recognized in 2007. These costs and fees are uncertain of recovery and related to the voluntarily

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;2, <I>Accounting for Research
and Development Costs</I>, the Company expenses research and development costs as incurred. Prior to
January&nbsp;1, 2008, the Company also expensed nonrefundable advance payments for goods and services
received in connection with research and development activities. Effective January&nbsp;1, 2008, the
Company adopted the consensus in Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 07-3, <I>Accounting for
Nonrefundable Advance Payments for Goods and Services Received for Use in Future Research and
Development Activities </I>(&#147;EITF Issue 07-3&#148;). EITF 07-3 requires that these payments be deferred and
recognized as an expense as the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed.
The Company applied the new guidance to all advance payments made during 2008 for contracts
executed after the effective date of this consensus. As a result, approximately $295,000 (or $0.01
per share) of advanced payments have been capitalized at December&nbsp;31, 2008 that would have been
expensed under the Company&#146;s former accounting policy.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research and development expenses include, among other items, personnel costs, including
salaries and benefits, manufacturing costs, clinical, regulatory, and toxicology services performed
by contract research organizations (&#147;CRO&#146;s&#148;), materials and supplies, and overhead allocations
consisting of various administrative and facilities related costs. Most of the Company&#146;s
manufacturing and clinical and preclinical studies are performed by third-party CRO&#146;s. Costs for
studies performed by CRO&#146;s are accrued by the Company over the service periods specified in the
contracts and estimates are adjusted, if required, based upon the Company&#146;s on-going review of the
level of services actually performed.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, the Company has license agreements with third parties, such as Albert Einstein
College of Medicine of Yeshiva University (&#147;AECOM&#148;), Industrial Research, Ltd. (&#147;IRL&#148;), and the
University of Alabama at Birmingham (&#147;UAB&#148;), which require fees related to sublicense agreements or
maintenance fees. The Company expenses sublicense payments as incurred unless they are related to
revenues that have been deferred, in which case the expenses are deferred and recognized over the
related revenue recognition period. The Company expenses maintenance payments as incurred.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s accounting for deferred sublicense payments related to revenues that have been
deferred is based on the guidance in SAB No.&nbsp;104, which states that the incremental direct costs
incurred related to the acquisition or origination of a contract in a transaction that results in
the deferral of revenue may either be expensed as incurred or accounted for in accordance with
paragraph 4 of Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) Technical Bulletin 90-1, <I>Accounting
for Separately Priced Extended Warranty and Product Maintenance Costs </I>(&#147;FTB 90-1&#148;). At December
31, 2008, the Company had deferred collaboration expenses of $3,377,434. These deferred expenses
were sub-license payments, paid to the Company&#146;s academic partners upon receipt of consideration
from various commercial partners. These deferred expenses would not have been incurred without
receipt of such payments from the Company&#146;s commercial partners and are being expensed in
proportion to the

<I>Share-Based Payment </I>(&#147;Statement No.&nbsp;123R&#148;), all share-based payments, including grants of stock
option awards and restricted stock awards, are recognized in the Company&#146;s income statement based
on their fair values. Statement No.&nbsp;123R was adopted by the Company on January&nbsp;1, 2006 using the
&#147;modified prospective&#148; transition method. Under the fair value recognition provisions of Statement
No.&nbsp;123R, stock-based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of
the award and is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period
of the award.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2008, the Company had two stock-based employee compensation plans, the
Stock Incentive Plan (&#147;Incentive Plan&#148;) and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (&#147;ESPP&#148;). In addition,
during 2007, the Company made an inducement grant outside of the Incentive Plan and ESPP to recruit
a new employee to a key position within the Company. Prior to January&nbsp;1, 2006, the Company
accounted for all share-based payments under the recognition and measurement provisions of
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.&nbsp;25, <I>Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees </I>(&#147;APB Opinion
No.&nbsp;25&#148;), and other related interpretations, as permitted by Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No.&nbsp;123, <I>Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation</I>. No stock-based compensation cost
related to the Company&#146;s employees was recognized in the Statements of Operations for any period
ending prior to January&nbsp;1, 2006. Stock-based compensation expense of $5,860,654 ($5,545,458 of
expense related to the Incentive Plan, $165,492 of expense related to the ESPP, and $149,704 of
expense related to the inducement grant) was recognized during 2008, while $5,691,028 ($5,428,505
of expense related to the Incentive Plan, $150,245 of expense related to the ESPP, and $112,278 of
expense related to the inducement grant) was recognized during 2007 and $3,338,761 ($3,243,751 of
expense related to the Plan and $95,010 of expense related to the ESPP) was recognized during 2006.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2008, there was approximately $9,155,261 of total unrecognized compensation
cost related to non-vested employee stock option awards and restricted stock awards granted by the
Company. That cost is expected to be recognized as follows: $4,676,499 in 2009, $3,430,204 in 2010,
$958,675 in 2011, and $89,883 in 2012.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Statement 123R also requires that the benefits from tax deductions in excess of recognized
compensation cost should be reported as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash
flow. The Company has never recognized any benefits from such tax deductions, as the Company has
always maintained a loss position.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company computes net loss per share in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No.&nbsp;128, <I>Earnings Per Share</I>. Net loss per share is based upon the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per share is equivalent to basic net
loss per share for all periods presented herein because common equivalent shares from unexercised
stock options, outstanding warrants, and common shares expected to be issued under the Company&#146;s

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Note 6 &#151; Income Taxes</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective January&nbsp;1, 2007, the Company adopted the provisions of FIN No.&nbsp;48, which clarifies
the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise&#146;s financial statements
in accordance with Statement No.&nbsp;109 and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process
for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken
in a tax return. The Company has concluded that there were no significant uncertain tax positions
requiring recognition in its financial statements. Tax years 2005-2007 remain open to examination
by the major taxing jurisdictions to which the Company is subject. Additionally, years prior to
2005 are also open to examination to the extent of loss and credit carryforwards from those years.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2008, the majority of the deferred tax assets relate to Net Operating Loss
(&#147;NOL&#148;) carryforwards that can only be realized if the Company is profitable in future periods and
it is uncertain whether the Company will realize any tax benefit related to the NOL carryforwards.
Accordingly, the Company has provided a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets due
to uncertainties as to their ultimate realization. The valuation allowance will remain at the full
amount of the deferred tax asset until it is more likely than not that the related tax benefits
will be realized.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company will recognize interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits
as components of its income tax provision. The Company did not have any interest and penalties
accrued upon the adoption of FIN No.&nbsp;48 and as of December&nbsp;31, 2008, the Company does not have any
interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision for income taxes differs from the amounts computed by applying the statutory
federal income tax rate to income before income taxes. The sources and tax effects of the
differences are as follows:

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2008, the Company had net operating loss and research and development
credit carryforwards of approximately $175,589,000 and $32,973,000 respectively, which expire at
various dates from 2009 through 2027.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Note 7 &#151; Stockholders&#146; Equity</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On August&nbsp;6, 2007, the Company entered into a Stock and Warrant Purchase Agreement with a
group of existing stockholders for the private placement of 8,315,513 shares of the Company&#146;s
common stock at a purchase price of $7.80 per share and warrants to purchase 3,159,895 shares of
the Company&#146;s common stock at a purchase price of $0.125 per warrant. The aggregate proceeds from
the sale were approximately $65.3&nbsp;million. The exercise price of the warrants is $10.25 per share.
The participants in the transaction include funds managed by Baker Brothers Investments, Kleiner
Perkins Caufield &#038; Byers, EHS Holdings, OrbiMed Advisors, Texas Pacific Group Ventures, and
Stephens Investment Management, all of whom are current shareholders in the Company. The Company
has registered the shares and warrants under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (&#147;the
Securities Act&#148;), for resale.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On May&nbsp;16, 2007, the stockholders approved an amendment to the Company&#146;s third restated
certificate of incorporation to increase the number of shares of common stock authorized to issue
from 45,000,000 to 95,000,000. All shares of the Company&#146;s common stock, including the additional
shares authorized by the amendment, are equal in rank and have the same voting, dividend, and
liquidation rights.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June&nbsp;2002, the Company&#146;s Board of Directors adopted a stockholder rights plan and, pursuant
thereto, issued preferred stock purchase rights (&#147;Rights&#148;) to the holders of our common stock. The
Rights have certain anti-takeover effects. If triggered, the Rights would cause substantial
dilution to a person or group of persons who acquires more than 15% (19.9% for William W.
Featheringill, a Director who owned approximately 10.1% as of August&nbsp;15, 2007, but owned more than
15% at the time the Rights were put in place) of our common stock on terms not approved by the
board of directors. In August&nbsp;2007, this plan was amended for a transaction involving funds managed
by or affiliated with Baker Brother Investments such that they could purchase up to 25% without
triggering the Rights. After closing of our August&nbsp;2007 private placement, such group owns
approximately 19.0% of our stock. The rights are not exercisable until the distribution date, as
defined in the Rights Agreement by and between the Company and American Stock Transfer &#038; Trust
Company, as Rights Agent. The Rights will expire at the close of business on June&nbsp;24, 2012, unless
that final expiration date is extended or unless the rights are earlier redeemed or exchanged by
the Company.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company one one-thousandth of a
share of Series&nbsp;B Junior Participating Preferred Stock (&#147;Series&nbsp;B&#148;), par value $0.001 per share, at
a purchase price of $26.00, subject to adjustment. Shares of Series&nbsp;B purchasable upon exercise of
the Rights will not be redeemable. Each share of Series&nbsp;B will be entitled to a dividend of 1,000
times the dividend declared per share of common stock. In the event of liquidation, each share of
Series&nbsp;B will be entitled to a payment of 1,000 times the payment made per share of common stock.
Each share of Series&nbsp;B will have 1,000 votes, voting together with the common stock. Finally, in
the event of any merger, consolidation, or other transaction in which shares of common stock are
exchanged, each share of Series&nbsp;B will be entitled to receive 1,000 times the amount received per
share of common stock. Effective in December&nbsp;2005, the Company increased the authorized shares
available under these rights to 45,000 to match the authorized common shares of 45,000,000 at that
time. In addition, the Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to 4,955,000 shares of
undesignated preferred stock and to determine the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions
of those shares without further vote or action by the Company&#146;s stockholders.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For stock option awards granted under the Incentive Plan during 2008, 2007, and 2006, the fair
value was estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model and the
assumptions noted in the table below. The weighted average grant date fair value of these awards
granted during 2008, 2007, and 2006 was $2.16, $6.16 and $8.64, respectively. The fair value of the
stock option awards is amortized to expense over the vesting periods using a straight-line expense
attribution method. The following explanations describe the assumptions used by the Company to
value the stock option awards granted during 2008. The expected life is based on the average of the
assumption that all outstanding stock option awards will be exercised at full vesting and the
assumption that all outstanding stock option awards will be exercised at the midpoint of the
current date (if already vested) or at full vesting (if not yet vested) and the full contractual
term. The expected volatility represents an average of the implied volatility on the Company&#146;s
publicly traded options, the volatility over the most recent period corresponding with the expected
life, and the Company&#146;s long-term reversion volatility. The Company has assumed no expected
dividend yield, as dividends have never been paid to stock or option holders and will not be for
the foreseeable future. The weighted average risk-free interest rate is the implied yield currently
available on zero-coupon government issues with a remaining term equal to the expected term.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March&nbsp;2007, the Company&#146;s Board of Directors approved a stock inducement grant of 110,000
stock option awards and 10,000 restricted stock awards to recruit a new employee to a key position
within the Company. The stock option awards were granted in April&nbsp;2007 with an exercise price equal
to the market price of the Company&#146;s stock at the date of grant. The awards vest 25% after one year
and monthly thereafter on a pro rata basis over the next three years until fully vested after four
years. The stock option awards have contractual terms of 10&nbsp;years. The vesting exercise provisions
of both the stock option awards and the restricted stock awards granted under the inducement grant
are subject to acceleration in the event of certain stockholder-approved transactions, or upon the
occurrence of a change in control as defined in the respective agreements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the stock option awards granted under the inducement grant, the fair value was estimated
on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model and the following assumptions:
expected life of 5.7&nbsp;years, expected volatility of 72.9%, expected dividend yield of 0.0%, and
risk-free interest rate of 4.6%. The weighted average grant date fair value of these stock option
awards was $5.25. The fair value of the stock option awards is amortized to expense over the
vesting periods using a straight-line expense attribution method. The expected life is based on the
average of the assumption that all outstanding stock option awards will be exercised at full
vesting and the assumption that all outstanding stock option awards will be exercised at the
midpoint of the current date (if already vested) or at full vesting (if not yet vested) and the
full contractual term. The expected volatility represents an average of the implied volatility on
the Company&#146;s publicly traded stock options, the volatility over the most recent period
corresponding with the expected life, and the Company&#146;s long-term reversion volatility. The Company
has assumed no expected dividend yield, as dividends have never been paid to stock or option
holders and will not be for the foreseeable future. The weighted average risk-free interest rate is
the implied yield currently available on zero-coupon government issues with a remaining term equal
to the expected term.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exercise price of the stock option awards and the grant date fair value of the restricted
stock awards granted under the inducement grant was $8.20. As of December&nbsp;31, 2008, 4,166 of these
restricted stock awards have vested.

license agreement with Shionogi to develop and commercialize the Company&#146;s lead influenza
neuraminidase inhibitor, peramivir, in Japan for the treatment of seasonal and potentially
life-threatening human influenza. Under the terms of the agreement, Shionogi obtained rights to
injectable formulations of peramivir in Japan in exchange for a $14&nbsp;million up-front payment. The
license provides for potential future milestone event payments (up to $21&nbsp;million) and commercial
event milestone payments (up to $95&nbsp;million) in addition to double digit (between 10 and 20% range)
royalty payments on product sales of peramivir. Generally, all payments under the agreement are
nonrefundable and non-creditable, but they are subject to audit. Shionogi will be responsible for
all development, regulatory and marketing costs in Japan. The term of the agreement is from
February&nbsp;28, 2007 until terminated by either party in accordance with the license agreement. Either
party may terminate in the event of an uncured breach. Shionogi has the right of without cause
termination. In the event of termination all license and rights granted to Shionogi shall terminate
and shall revert back to the Company. The Company developed peramivir under a license from UAB and
will owe sublicense payments to them on the upfront payment and any future event payments and/or

phase III trial. BioCryst retains all rights to commercialize peramivir in North America, Europe,
and other countries outside of Japan, Taiwan, and Korea. In accordance with SAB No.&nbsp;104 and EITF
Issue 00-21, the Company deferred the $14&nbsp;million up-front payment that was received from Shionogi.
This deferred revenue began to be amortized to revenue in April&nbsp;2007 and will continue through
December&nbsp;2018. In December&nbsp;2007, the Company received a $7&nbsp;million milestone payment from Shionogi
for their initiation of a Phase II clinical trial with i.v. peramivir.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (&#147;HHS&#148;). </I>In January&nbsp;2007, the Company was awarded
a four-year contract from HHS to develop its influenza neuraminidase inhibitor, peramivir, for the
treatment of seasonal and life-threatening influenza, including avian flu. The contract commits
$102.6&nbsp;million to support manufacturing, process validation, clinical studies, and other product
approval requirements for peramivir. The contract with HHS is defined as a standard
cost-plus-fixed-fee contract. That is, the Company is entitled to receive reimbursement for all
costs incurred in accordance with the contract provisions that are related to the development of
peramivir plus a fixed fee, or profit. HHS will make periodic assessments of progress and the
continuation of the contract is based on the Company&#146;s performance, timeliness and quality of
deliverables, and other factors. The government has rights under certain contract clauses to
terminate this contract. The contract is terminable by the government at any time for breach or
without cause.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January&nbsp;2008, the Company announced that the development plan for peramivir had changed and
that it would no longer pursue the Phase III i.m. program in peramivir for the current influenza
season, but would move forward in evaluating higher doses than used in previous studies. Also in
January&nbsp;2008, the Company announced that the program would cost in excess of the $102.6&nbsp;million
contract and that any funding above the $102.6&nbsp;million may be the responsibility of the Company.
Since then, HHS and the Company have been working in collaboration through various contract
modifications to maximize resources by stopping work on some projects (e.g. the Phase III i.m.
program) and capping expenditures on other projects in order to maximize remaining funds. HHS and
the Company executed a contract modification that fully funds the Company through the completion of
both the phase II studies in outpatients treated with intramuscular peramivir, the phase II study
in hospitalized patients with intravenous peramivir, and certain manufacturing and toxicology
components of the program. The modification also allows the Company and HHS to agree on additional
development activities for peramivir within the confirmed $102.6&nbsp;million funding. All temporary
restraints, effected through a stop work order, have now been removed. Following completion of the
phase II studies, we expect to continue the dialogue with HHS regarding additional funding beyond
the $102.6&nbsp;million for peramivir development through U.S. licensure. The original contract of
$102.6&nbsp;million and the four year term remain unchanged.

with Green Cross to develop and commercialize peramivir in Korea. Under the terms of the agreement,
Green Cross will be responsible for all development, regulatory, and commercialization costs in
Korea. The Company received a one-time license fee of $250,000. The agreement also provides for
relatively insignificant future milestone payments. The license also provides that the Company
will share in profits resulting from the sale of peramivir in Korea, including the sale of
peramivir to the Korean government for stockpiling purposes. Furthermore, Green Cross will pay the
Company a premium over its cost to supply peramivir for development and any future marketing of
peramivir products in Korea. Both parties have the right to terminate in the event of an uncured
material breach. In the event of termination all rights, data, materials, products and other
information would be transferred to the Company. In accordance with SAB No.&nbsp;104 and EITF Issue
00-21, the Company deferred the up-front payment that was received from Green Cross. This deferred
revenue began to be amortized to revenue August&nbsp;2006 and will continue through November&nbsp;2009.

and commercial events (including certain sales level amounts following a product&#146;s launch) for
certain indications. In addition, the agreement provides that the Company will receive royalties
(ranging from single digits to mid teens) based on a percentage of net product sales, which varies
depending upon when certain indications receive NDA approval in a major market country and can vary
by country depending on the patent coverage or sales of generic compounds in a particular country.
Generally, all payments under the agreement are nonrefundable and non-creditable, but they are
subject to audit. The Company licensed forodesine HCl and other PNP inhibitors from AECOM and IRL
and will owe sublicense payments to these third parties on the upfront payment, event payments, and
royalties received by the Company from Mundipharma.

inhibitors the Company develops through Phase IIb in oncology, but any new PNP inhibitors will be
exempt from this agreement and the Company will retain all rights to such compounds. The Company
retained the rights to forodesine HCl in the U.S. and Mundipharma is obligated by the terms of the
agreement to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop the licensed product in the territory
specified by the agreement. The agreement will continue for the commercial life of the licensed
products, but may be terminated by either party following an uncured material breach by the other
party or in the event the pre-existing third party license with AECOM and IRL expires. It may be
terminated by Mundipharma upon 60&nbsp;days written notice without cause or under certain other
conditions as specified in the agreement and all rights, data, materials, products and other
information would be transferred back to the Company at no cost. In the event the Company
terminates the agreement for material default or insolvency, the Company could have to pay
Mundipharma 50% of the costs of any independent data owned by Mundipharma in accordance with the
terms of the agreement.

up-front payment that was received from Mundipharma in February&nbsp;2006. This deferred revenue began
to be amortized to revenue February&nbsp;2006 and will end in October&nbsp;2017, which is the date of
expiration for the last-to-expire patent covered by the agreement. In accordance with EITF Issue
99-19 and EITF Issue 01-14, the costs reimbursed by Mundipharma for the current and planned trials
of forodesine HCl are recorded as revenue when the expense is incurred up to the $10&nbsp;million limit
stipulated in the agreement.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is currently in dispute with Mundipharma regarding the contractual obligations of
the parties with respect to certain costs related to the manufacturing and development of
forodesine HCL. Notwithstanding, the Company does not believe that it is responsible for any of the
disputed amounts. The Company is engaged in ongoing discussion to resolve this dispute. The maximum
potential exposure to the Company is estimated to be approximately $2.5&nbsp;million. Because of the
preliminary nature of the discussions, no amounts have been accrued as of December&nbsp;31, 2008.

Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk,

that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial

company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (3)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

believes that its disclosure controls and procedures will ensure that information required to be
disclosed in the reports filed or submitted by it under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities
and Exchange Commission, and include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
