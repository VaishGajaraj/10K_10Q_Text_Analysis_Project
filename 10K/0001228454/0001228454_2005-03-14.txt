ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
-------------------------------

BCB Bancorp, Inc.
-----------------

      BCB Bancorp, Inc. is a New Jersey corporation, which on May 1, 2003 became
the holding company parent of Bayonne  Community  Bank. Our executive  office is
located at 104-110 Avenue C, Bayonne,  New Jersey 07002. Our telephone number is
(201)  823-0700.  At  December  31, 2004 we had $378.3  million in  consolidated
assets,   $337.2   million  in  deposits  and  $26.0  million  in   consolidated
stockholders' equity.

Recent Events
-------------

      During the fiscal year ended  December  31, 2004,  the Company  engaged in
several  transactions  primarily to augment  income,  expand services and reduce
income tax exposure in a concerted effort to increase shareholder value.

      In June 2004, the Company  participated  in the issuance of a Pooled Trust
Preferred Security in the amount of $4.1 million. The Company's participation in
the issuance of this  security was  facilitated  by a favorable  ruling from the
Federal  Reserve  Bank  regarding  the Tier 1 Capital  treatment of Pooled Trust
Preferred Securities. The primary purpose for the Company's participation in the
issuance of this instrument was an effort to augment  capital  thereby  allowing
additional balance sheet growth without diluting present shareholder  percentage
ownership.

      The Company established an investment  subsidiary during December 2004 for
the purpose of investing and  reinvesting  in securities  such as bonds,  notes,
mortgages and debentures.  The subsidiary  commenced operations in January 2005.
Only those  securities  that are  authorized to be purchased by the Bank will be
purchased by the investment subsidiary.  The primary benefit of the formation of
the investment  subsidiary is to affect a tax reduction  strategy whereby income
realized by the investment subsidiary is taxed at a lower rate than other income
generated by the company.

      The Company,  through its subsidiary,  Bayonne Community Bank, has entered
into an agreement with Summit  Lending of Hawaii to establish a retail  mortgage
division  for the  purposes of  originating  and  subsequently  brokering to the
secondary market, mortgage product on one-to four-family residences in the State
of New Jersey.  In so doing the Bank,  hence the Company,  has the  potential to
enhance  non-interest  income  through the receipt of fees for the sale of these
loans to various approved  investors.  As a corollary to this  transaction,  the
Company also avoids the  incursion of interest  rate risk on long-term  mortgage
product in the present lower rate,  long term interest rate  environment.  It is
anticipated  that this  division  will begin its  operation in earnest some time
during the second half of 2005.

Bayonne Community Bank
----------------------

      Bayonne  Community  Bank was chartered as a New Jersey bank on October 27,
2000,  and we opened for business on November 1, 2000. We operate  through three
branches in Bayonne,  New Jersey and through  our  executive  office  located at
104-110  Avenue C,  Bayonne,  New Jersey 07002.  Our  telephone  number is (201)
823-0700.  Our deposit  accounts  are insured by the

<PAGE>

Federal  Deposit  Insurance  Corporation and we are a member of the Federal Home
Loan Bank System.

      We are a  community-oriented  financial  institution.  Our  business is to
offer FDIC-insured deposit products and invest funds held in deposit accounts at
the  bank,  together  with  funds  generated  from  operations,   in  investment
securities and loans. We offer our customers:

      o     loans,  including one- to four-family  mortgage  loans,  home equity
            loans,  construction loans,  commercial and multi-family real estate
            loans, consumer loans and commercial business loans. In recent years
            the primary  growth in our loan  portfolio has been in loans secured
            by commercial real estate and multi-family properties;

      o     FDIC-insured deposit products,  including savings and club accounts,
            non-interest bearing accounts,  money market accounts,  certificates
            of deposit and individual retirement accounts; and

      o     retail and commercial  banking  services  including wire  transfers,
            money  orders,  traveler's  checks,  safe  deposit  boxes,  a  night
            depository, federal payroll tax deposits, bond coupon redemption and
            automated teller services.

Market Strategy
---------------

      Our objective is to create a financial  institution  focused on delivering
products and services  matched to the  customers'  needs. A primary focus of our
market  strategy is to originate  loans secured by commercial  and  multi-family
properties.  Such loans  provide  higher  returns than loans  secured by one- to
four-family real estate.  As a result of our underwriting  practices,  including
debt service requirements for multi-family loans we believe such loans offer the
Bank an  opportunity  to  obtain  higher  returns  while  the  revenue  from the
underlying  units  diversify our risk. We believe that  customers are drawn to a
locally owned and managed  institution  that  demonstrates an active interest in
its customers and their business and personal financial needs.

      The  banking  industry  in our market has  experienced  and  continues  to
experience,  substantial  consolidation  in  recent  years.  Many of the  area's
locally  owned or managed  financial  institutions  have been acquired by larger
regional bank holding companies. Management believes that this consolidation has
been and will continue to be accompanied  by increasing  fees for bank services,
the dissolution of local boards of directors,  management and personnel  changes
and,  in the  perception  of  management,  a decline  in the  level of  customer
service. With recent changes in regulations and the banking industry,  this type
of consolidation is expected to continue.

Our Market Area
---------------

      We are  located in the City of Bayonne,  Hudson  County,  New Jersey.  The
Bank's  locations  are easily  accessible  to  provide  convenient  services  to
businesses and individuals throughout our market area.

      Our market area  includes  the  municipality  of Bayonne  and  portions of
Jersey City. Our market area is  well-served  by a network of arterial  roadways
including Route 440 and the New Jersey Turnpike.


                                       2
<PAGE>

      Our  market  area  has a  high  level  of  commercial  business  activity.
Businesses are concentrated in the service sector and retail trade areas.  Major
employers  in our market area  include  Bayonne  Medical  Center and the Bayonne
Board of Education.

Competition
-----------

      The  banking  business  in New Jersey is  extremely  competitive.  We will
compete  for  deposits  and loans with  existing  New  Jersey  and  out-of-state
financial  institutions  that have longer  operating  histories,  larger capital
reserves and more  established  customer bases.  Our competition  includes large
financial  service  companies  and other  entities in  addition  to  traditional
banking  institutions  such as savings  and loan  associations,  savings  banks,
commercial banks and credit unions.

      Our larger  competitors  have a greater  ability  to finance  wide-ranging
advertising  campaigns  through their greater capital  resources.  Our marketing
efforts   depend   heavily  upon  referrals  from  officers  and  directors  and
stockholders,   selective   advertising   in  local   media  and   direct   mail
solicitations.  We compete  for  business  principally  on the basis of personal
service  to  customers,  customer  access  to our  officers  and  directors  and
competitive interest rates and fees.

      In the  financial  services  industry  in  recent  years,  intense  market
demands, technological and regulatory changes and economic pressures have eroded
industry  classifications that were once clearly defined. Banks have been forced
to diversify  their  services,  increase  rates paid on deposits and become more
cost effective,  as a result of competition  with one another and with new types
of financial service companies,  including non-banking competitors.  Some of the
results of these market dynamics in the financial  services industry have been a
number of new bank and non-bank  competitors,  increased  merger  activity,  and
increased   customer   awareness  of  product  and  service   differences  among
competitors. These factors could affect our business prospects.

      One- to Four-Family Lending. Our one- to four-family  residential mortgage
loans are secured by property  located in the State of New Jersey.  We generally
originate one- to four-family residential mortgage loans in amounts up to 80% of
the lesser of the appraised  value or selling  price of the  mortgaged  property
without requiring mortgage insurance. We will originate loans with loan to value
ratios up to 90% provided the borrowers  obtain private mortgage  insurance.  We
originate both fixed rate and adjustable rate loans.  One- to four-family  loans
may have terms of up to 30 years.  The majority of one- to four-family  loans we
originate for retention in our portfolio have terms no greater than 15 years. We
offer  adjustable  rate loans with fixed rate periods of up to five years,  with
principal and interest  calculated using a maximum 30 year amortization  period.
We offer these  loans with a fixed rate for the first five years with  repricing
following every year after the initial period.  Adjustable rate loans may adjust
up to 200 basis points  annually and 600 basis points over the term of the loan.
In  August  2003,  the Bank  began to broker  for a third  party  lender  one-to
four-family  residential loans, which were primarily fixed rate loans with terms
of 30 years.  The Bank's loan brokerage  activities  permitted the Bank to offer
customers  longer-term  fixed rate loans it would not otherwise  originate while
providing a source of fee income.  During 2004,  the Bank brokered $12.0 million
in one-to four-family loans and received $136,000 in fee income from the sale of
such loans.


                                       5

      All of our one- to  four-family  mortgages  include "due on sale" clauses,
which are provisions  giving us the right to declare a loan immediately  payable
if the borrower  sells or  otherwise  transfers an interest in the property to a
third party.

      Property appraisals on real estate securing our single-family  residential
loans are made by state certified and licensed  independent  appraisers approved
by  the  Board  of  Directors.  Appraisals  are  performed  in  accordance  with
applicable  regulations and policies. At our discretion,  we obtain either title
insurance  policies or attorneys'  certificates  of title, on all first mortgage
real estate loans originated. We also require fire and casualty insurance on all
properties securing our one-to four-family loans. In some instances, we charge a
fee equal to a percentage of the loan amount commonly referred to as points.

      Construction  Loans. We offer loans to finance the construction of various
types of commercial and  residential  property.  We originated  $13.1 million of
such loans  during the year  ended  December  31,  2004.  Construction  loans to
builders  generally are offered with terms of up to eighteen months and interest
rates are tied to prime rate plus a margin. These loans generally are offered as
adjustable  rate loans.  We will originate  residential  construction  loans for
individual borrowers and builders,  provided all necessary plans and permits are
in order.  Construction loan funds are disbursed as the project  progresses.  At
December  31,  2004,  our largest  construction  loan was our interest in a loan
participation where our interest was in the amount of $2.0 million of which $1.8
million was disbursed. This construction loan has been made for the construction
of  residential  properties.  At December 31, 2004 this loan was  performing  in
accordance with its terms.

      Construction  financing is generally considered to involve a higher degree
of risk of loss than long-term financing on improved, occupied real estate. Risk
of loss on a  construction  loan is  dependent  largely upon the accuracy of the
initial  estimate of the  property's  value at  completion of  construction  and
development and the estimated cost (including interest) of construction.  During
the  construction  phase,  a number of factors  could  result in delays and cost
overruns. If the estimate of construction costs proves to be inaccurate,  we may
be required to advance  funds beyond the amount  originally  committed to permit
completion of the project.  Additionally,  if the estimate of value proves to be
inaccurate,  we may be confronted, at or prior to the maturity of the loan, with
a project having a value which is insufficient to assure full repayment.

      Commercial  and  Multi-family   Real  Estate  Loans.  Our  commercial  and
multi-family  real  estate  loans are  secured by  commercial  real  estate (for
example,  shopping centers, medical buildings,  retail offices) and multi-family
residential  units,  consisting  of five  or  more  units.  Permanent  loans  on
commercial and multi-family properties are generally originated in amounts up to
75% of the appraised value of the property. Our commercial real estate loans are
secured  by  improved  property  such  as  office   buildings,   retail  stores,
warehouses, church buildings and other non-residential buildings. Commercial and
multi-family real estate loans are generally made at rates that adjust above the
five year U.S.  Treasury  interest  rate,  with terms of up to 25 years,  or are
balloon loans with fixed interest rates which generally  mature in three to five
years with principal  amortization  for a period of up to 30 years.  Our largest
commercial  loan had a principal  balance of $2.6  million at December 31, 2004,
and was secured by three professional


                                       6
<PAGE>

office buildings.  Our largest multi-family loan had a principal balance of $2.2
million at December 31, 2004.  Both loans were  performing  in  accordance  with
their terms on that date.

      Loans secured by  commercial  and  multi-family  real estate are generally
larger and involve a greater degree of risk than one- to four-family residential
mortgage  loans.  The borrower's  creditworthiness  and the feasibility and cash
flow  potential  of  the  project  is  of  primary  concern  in  commercial  and
multi-family  real  estate  lending.  Loans  secured  by income  properties  are
generally  larger and involve  greater  risks than  residential  mortgage  loans
because  payments on loans secured by income  properties are often  dependent on
the successful operation or management of the properties. As a result, repayment
of such loans may be subject to a greater  extent than  residential  real estate
loans to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy.  We intend
to continue  emphasizing  the  origination  of loans secured by commercial  real
estate and multi-family properties.

      Commercial  Business Loans. Our commercial business loans are underwritten
on the basis of the  borrower's  ability to service such debt from  income.  Our
underwriting  standards for  commercial  business  loans include a review of the
applicant's tax returns, financial statements,  credit history and an assessment
of the  applicant's  ability to meet  existing  obligations  and payments on the
proposed  loan  based  on  cash  flow  generated  by the  applicant's  business.
Commercial  business loans are generally  made to small and mid-sized  companies
located within the state of New Jersey. In most cases, we require  collateral of
equipment, accounts receivable, inventory, chattel or other assets before making
a commercial business loan. Our largest commercial business loan at December 31,
2004 had a principal  balance of $819,000 and was secured by school buses.  This
loan was guaranteed by the Bayonne Board of Education.

      Commercial  business  loans  generally have higher rates and shorter terms
than one- to  four-family  residential  loans,  but they may also involve higher
average  balances and a higher risk of default since their  repayment  generally
depends on the successful operation of the borrower's business.

      Consumer.  We make various types of secured and unsecured  consumer  loans
including home equity lines of credit and loans that are  collateralized  by new
and used automobiles.  Consumer loans generally have terms of three years to ten
years.

      Consumer  loans are  advantageous  to us  because of their  interest  rate
sensitivity,  but they also involve more credit risk than  residential  mortgage
loans because of the higher potential for default,  the nature of the collateral
and the difficulty in disposing of the collateral.

</TABLE>

      Loan Approval  Authority and  Underwriting.  We establish  various lending
limits for executive  management  and also maintain a loan  committee.  The loan
committee  is  comprised  of the  Chairman  of the  Board,  the  President,  the
Executive Loan Officer and five non-employee  members of the Board of Directors.
The  President  or the  Executive  Loan  Officer,  together  with one other loan
officer,  have  authority  to approve  applications  for real estate loans up to
$500,000,  other secured loans up to $500,000 and unsecured loans up to $25,000.
The loan  committee  considers all  applications  in excess of the above lending
limits and the entire board of directors ratifies all such loans.

      Upon receipt of a completed loan application from a prospective  borrower,
a credit report is ordered. Income and certain other information is verified. If
necessary,  additional financial  information may be requested.  An appraisal is
required for the  underwriting of all one- to four-family  loans. We may rely on
an estimate of value of real estate  performed by our Executive


                                       8
<PAGE>

Loan  Officer  for home  equity  loans or lines  of  credit  of up to  $250,000.
Appraisals are processed by independent fee appraisers.

      An attorney's certificate of title is required on all real estate mortgage
loans.  Borrowers also must obtain fire and casualty insurance.  Flood insurance
is also required on loans secured by property that is located in a flood zone.

      Loan Commitments.  Written commitments are given to prospective  borrowers
on all approved real estate loans.  Generally, we honor commitments for up to 60
days from the date of  issuance.  At December  31, 2004,  our  outstanding  loan
commitments totaled $38.8 million.

Non-performing and Problem Assets
---------------------------------

      Loan Delinquencies. We send a notice of nonpayment to borrowers when their
mortgage loan becomes 15 days past due. If such payment is not received by month
end, an additional notice of nonpayment is sent to the borrower.  After 60 days,
if payment is still delinquent, a notice of right to cure default is sent to the
borrower giving 30 additional days to bring the loan current before  foreclosure
is commenced.  If the loan continues in a delinquent status for 90 days past due
and no repayment plan is in effect, foreclosure proceedings will be initiated.

      Loans are  reviewed and are placed on a  non-accrual  status when the loan
becomes more than 120 days delinquent or when, in our opinion, the collection of
additional interest is doubtful.  Interest accrued and unpaid at the time a loan
is placed on nonaccrual  status is charged against interest  income.  Subsequent
interest  payments,  if any,  are either  applied to the  outstanding  principal
balance or recorded as  interest  income,  depending  on the  assessment  of the
ultimate  collectability  of the  loan.  At  December  31,  2004,  we had  three
non-performing  loans.  The Bank had three other loans which were  delinquent 90
days or more. These loans were not classified as non-performing as the borrowers
have  periodically  made  principal  and interest  payments on their  respective
loans.

      A loan is  considered  impaired  when it is probable the borrower will not
repay  the  loan  according  to the  original  contractual  terms  of  the  loan
agreement.  We have determined  that first mortgage loans on one-to  four-family
properties  and all consumer  loans  represent  large groups of  smaller-balance
homogeneous  loans  that  are  collectively  evaluated.  Additionally,  we  have
determined that an insignificant delay (less than 90 days) will not cause a loan
to be classified as impaired and a loan is not impaired during a period of delay
in payment,  if we expect to collect all amounts due including  interest accrued
at the  contractual  interest  rate for the  period of delay.  We  independently
evaluate all loans identified as impaired. We estimate credit losses on impaired
loans based on the present value of expected cash flows or the fair value of the
underlying  collateral  if the  loan  repayment  is  derived  from  the  sale or
operation of such  collateral.  Impaired loans,  or portions of such loans,  are
charged off when we  determine  that a realized  loss has  occurred.  Until such
time,  an allowance for loan losses is maintained  for  estimated  losses.  Cash
receipts on  impaired  loans are applied  first to accrued  interest  receivable
unless  otherwise  required by the loan terms,  except when an impaired  loan is
also a nonaccrual  loan,  in which case the portion of the  receipts  related to
interest is  recognized  as income.  At December 31,  2004,  we did not have any
loans deemed to be impaired.

      The table below sets forth the amounts and  categories  of  non-performing
assets in the Bank's loan portfolio. Loans are placed on non-accrual status when
the  collection of principal  and/or  interest  become  doubtful.  For all years
presented, Bayonne Community Bank has had no troubled debt restructurings (which
involve  forgiving  a portion of interest  or  principal  on any loans or making
loans at a rate  materially less than that of market rates).  Foreclosed  assets
include assets acquired in settlement of loans.

      Classified  Assets.  Our policies provide for a classification  system for
problem assets. Under this classification  system, problem assets are classified
as  "substandard,"  or  "loss."  An asset  is  considered  substandard  if it is
inadequately  protected  by its  current  net worth and paying  capacity  of the
borrower or of the collateral pledged, if any.  Substandard assets include those
characterized by the "distinct  possibility"  that "some loss" will be sustained
if the  deficiencies  are not  corrected.  Assets  classified  as loss are those
considered  "uncollectible"  and of such little value that their  continuance as
assets  without the  establishment  of a specific loss reserve is not warranted.
Assets may be designated "special mention" because of potential  weaknesses that
do not currently warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories.

      When we classify  problem  assets as either  substandard  we may establish
general  allowances  for loan losses in an amount deemed  prudent by management.
General  allowances  represent loss  allowances  which have been  established to
recognize  the inherent  risk  associated  with lending  activities,  but which,
unlike  specific  allowances,  have not been  allocated  to  particular  problem
assets.  When we  classify  problem  assets as loss,  we  establish  a  specific
allowance for losses equal to 100% of that portion of the asset so classified or
charge off such amount.  A portion of general  loss  allowances  established  to
cover possible  losses  related to assets  classified as substandard or doubtful
may be  included in  determining  our  regulatory  capital.  Specific  valuation
allowances for loan losses  generally do not qualify as regulatory  capital.  At
December 31, 2004, we had $2.5 million in assets  classified as substandard  and
$854,000  in assets  classified  as special  mention.  The loans  classified  as
substandard  represent  primarily  commercial loans secured either by commercial
real estate ($1.7 million) or heavy equipment ($700,000).  These loans have been
classified  substandard  primarily because either


                                       12

updated  financial  information has not been timely provided,  or the collateral
underlying the loan is in the process of being revalued.

      Allowances  for Loan  Losses.  A  provision  for loan losses is charged to
operations  based on management's  evaluation of the losses that may be incurred
in our loan portfolio. The evaluation,  including a review of all loans on which
full  collectability  of interest and principal  may not be reasonably  assured,
considers:  (i)  known  and  inherent  risks  in  our  portfolio,  (ii)  adverse
situations that may affect the borrower's  ability to repay, (iii) the estimated
value of any underlying collateral, and (iv) current economic conditions.

      We  monitor  our  allowance  for loan  losses  and make  additions  to the
allowance as economic conditions dictate. Although we maintain our allowance for
loan losses at a level that we consider  adequate for the inherent  risk of loss
in our  loan  portfolio,  future  losses  could  exceed  estimated  amounts  and
additional  provisions  for loan losses  could be  required.  In  addition,  our
determination  of the  amount of the  allowance  for loan  losses is  subject to
review by the New  Jersey  Department  of  Banking,  as part of its  examination
process.  After a review of the  information  available,  our  regulators  might
require the establishment of an additional  allowance.  Any increase in the loan
loss  allowance  required  by  regulators  would have a  negative  impact on our
earnings.

      Allocation  of  the  Allowance  for  Loan  Losses.   The  following  table
illustrates the allocation of the allowance for loan losses for each category of
loan.  The  allocation  of the  allowance  to each  category is not  necessarily
indicative of future loss in any  particular  category and does not restrict our
use of the allowance to absorb losses in other loan categories.

Investment Activities
---------------------

      Investment  Securities.  We are  required  under  federal  regulations  to
maintain a minimum  amount of liquid  assets that may be  invested in  specified
short-term securities and certain other investments.  The level of liquid assets
varies depending upon several factors,  including:  (i) the yields on investment
alternatives,  (ii) our  judgment  as to the  attractiveness  of the yields then
available in relation to other opportunities,  (iii) expectation of future yield
levels,  and (iv) our  projections as to the  short-term  demand for funds to be
used in loan origination and other activities.  Investment securities, including
mortgage-backed  securities,  are classified at the time of purchase, based upon
management's  intentions  and  abilities,  as  securities  held to  maturity  or
securities  available  for sale.  Debt  securities  acquired with the intent and
ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and are stated at
cost and adjusted for  amortization of premium and accretion of discount,  which
are  computed  using the level yield method and  recognized  as  adjustments  of
interest income.  All other debt securities are classified as available for sale
to serve principally as a source of liquidity.

      Current  regulatory  and  accounting   guidelines   regarding   investment
securities require us to categorize securities as "held to maturity," "available
for sale" or  "trading."  As of  December  31,  2004,  we had $117.0  million of
securities  classified  as "held to maturity,"  and no securities  classified as
available for sale or trading. Securities classified as "available for sale" are
reported  for  financial  reporting  purposes at the fair market  value with net
changes  in the


                                       15
<PAGE>

market  value  from  period  to  period  included  as a  separate  component  of
stockholders'  equity, net of income taxes. At December 31, 2004, our securities
classified as held-to-maturity had a market value of $117.1 million.  Changes in
the market value of classified as securities  held-to-maturity do not affect our
income.  Management  has the intent and we have the  ability to hold  securities
classified as held to maturity.

      At December  31,  2004,  our  investment  policy  allowed  investments  in
instruments such as: (i) U.S. Treasury obligations;  (ii) U.S. federal agency or
federally sponsored agency obligations;  (iii) mortgage-backed  securities;  and
(iv)  certificates of deposit.  The board of directors may authorize  additional
investments.  At December 31, 2004 our U.S. Government agency securities totaled
$78.0  million,  all of which  were  classified  as held to  maturity  and which
primarily  consisted  of  callable  securities  issued  by  federally  sponsored
agencies.

      As a source of liquidity and to supplement our lending activities, we have
invested in residential mortgage-backed  securities.  Mortgage-backed securities
generally yield less than the loans that underlie such securities because of the
cost of payment  guarantees  or credit  enhancements  that reduce  credit  risk.
Mortgage-backed  securities can serve as collateral for borrowings and,  through
repayments,  as a source of liquidity.  Mortgage-backed  securities  represent a
participation  interest in a pool of  single-family  or other type of mortgages.
Principal  and  interest  payments  are passed  from the  mortgage  originators,
through intermediaries  (generally  government-sponsored  enterprises) that pool
and  repackage  the  participation  interests  in the  form  of  securities,  to
investors,  like us. The government-sponsored  enterprises guarantee the payment
of principal and interest to investors and include  Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae, and
Fannie Mae.

      Mortgage-backed  securities  typically  are issued with  stated  principal
amounts. The securities are backed by pools of mortgage loans that have interest
rates that are within a set range and have varying  maturities.  The  underlying
pool of  mortgages  can be  composed  of either  fixed rate or  adjustable  rate
mortgage loans. Mortgage-backed securities are generally referred to as mortgage
participation certificates or pass-through certificates.  The interest rate risk
characteristics  of the  underlying  pool  of  mortgages  (i.e.,  fixed  rate or
adjustable  rate) and the  prepayment  risk,  are  passed on to the  certificate
holder. The life of a mortgage-backed pass-through security is equal to the life
of the underlying  mortgages.  Expected  maturities will differ from contractual
maturities due to scheduled  repayments and because borrowers may have the right
to call or prepay obligations with or without prepayment penalties.

Sources of Funds
----------------

      Our  major  external  source  of funds for  lending  and other  investment
purposes  are  deposits.  Funds are also derived from the receipt of payments on
loans and  prepayment  of loans and  maturities  of  investment  securities  and
mortgage-backed  securities and borrowings.  Scheduled loan principal repayments
are a relatively stable source of funds,  while deposit inflows and outflows and
loan  prepayments  are  significantly  influenced by general  interest rates and
market conditions.

      Deposits.  Consumer and commercial deposits are attracted principally from
within our primary  market area  through the  offering of a selection of deposit
instruments  including  demand,  NOW,  savings and club  accounts,  money market
accounts, and term certificate accounts. Deposit account terms vary according to
the minimum balance required,  the time period the funds must remain on deposit,
and the interest rate.

      The interest  rates paid by us on deposits are set at the direction of our
senior  management.  Interest  rates  are  determined  based  on  our  liquidity
requirements,  interest rates paid by our competitors,  and our growth goals and
applicable  regulatory  restrictions and requirements.  At December 31, 2004, we
had no brokered deposits.

      Deposit  Accounts.  The  following  table sets forth the dollar  amount of
savings  deposits in the various types of deposit  programs we offered as of the
dates indicated.

      Borrowings. Our advances from the FHLB of New York are secured by a pledge
of our  stock in the FHLB of New  York,  and  investment  securities.  Each FHLB
credit program has its own interest rate, which may be fixed or adjustable,  and
range of maturities.  If the need arises, we may also access the Federal Reserve
Bank  discount  window to  supplement  our supply of lendable  funds and to meet
deposit  withdrawal  requirements.  During the years ended December 31, 2004 and
2003, we had average  short-term  borrowings,  consisting of FHLB  advances,  of
$23.4 million and $2.9 million,  respectively,  with a weighted  average cost of
1.54% and 1.48%,  respectively.  Our maximum short-term  borrowings  outstanding
during both 2004 and 2003 was $25.0 million.

Employees
---------

      At December 31, 2004, we had 58 full-time and 25 part-time employees. None
of our employees is represented  by a collective  bargaining  group.  We believe
that our relationship with our employees is good.

Supervision and Regulation
--------------------------

      Bank holding  companies  and banks are  extensively  regulated  under both
federal  and state  law.  These laws and  regulations  are  intended  to protect
depositors,  not  shareholders.  To the extent  that the  following  information
describes statutory and regulatory  provisions,  it is qualified in its entirety
by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory  provisions.  Any change
in the applicable  law or regulation may have a material  effect on the business
and prospects of the Company and the Bank.

Bank Holding Company Regulation
-------------------------------

      As a bank holding company  registered  under the Bank Holding Company Act,
the Company is subject to the  regulation  and  supervision  applicable  to bank
holding  companies by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  The
Company is required to file with the Federal  Reserve  annual  reports and other
information regarding its business operations and those of its subsidiaries.

      The Bank  Holding  Company Act  requires,  among other  things,  the prior
approval  of the  Federal  Reserve  in any  case  where a bank  holding  company
proposes  to (i)  acquire  all or  substantially  all of the assets of any other
bank,  (ii) acquire  direct or indirect  ownership or control of more than 5% of
the  outstanding  voting  stock of any bank  (unless it owns a majority  of such
company's  voting  shares)  or (iii)  merge or  consolidate  with any other bank
holding company.  The Federal Reserve will not approve any acquisition,  merger,
or consolidation that would have a substantially anti-competitive effect, unless
the anti-competitive impact of the proposed transaction is clearly outweighed by
a greater public  interest in meeting the convenience and needs of the community
to be served.  The Federal  Reserve also  considers  capital  adequacy and other
financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the companies and the
banks concerned,  together with the convenience and needs of the community to be
served, when reviewing acquisitions or mergers.

      The Bank Holding Company Act generally  prohibits a bank holding  company,
with certain  limited  exceptions,  from (i)  acquiring  or retaining  direct or
indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the outstanding voting stock of
any  company  which  is not a bank or bank  holding  company,  or (ii)  engaging
directly or indirectly in  activities  other than those of banking,  managing or
controlling  banks,  or performing  services for its  subsidiaries,  unless such
non-banking  business  is  determined  by the  Federal  Reserve to be so closely
related to banking or managing or controlling  banks as to be properly  incident
thereto.

      The Bank  Holding  Company  Act has been  amended to permit  bank  holding
companies  and banks,  which meet  certain  capital,  management  and  Community
Reinvestment  Act  standards,  to  engage  in a  broader  range  of  non-banking
activities.  In addition, bank holding companies which elect to become financial
holding  companies  may engage in certain  banking  and  non-banking  activities
without prior Federal Reserve approval. Finally, the Financial Modernization Act
imposes certain privacy  requirements  on all financial  institutions  and their
treatment of consumer information.  At this time, the Company has elected not to
become a financial holding company,  as it does not engage in any activities not
permissible for banks.


                                       21

      There are a number of obligations and restrictions imposed on bank holding
companies and their  depository  institution  subsidiaries by law and regulatory
policy that are designed to minimize  potential  loss to the  depositors of such
depository institutions and the FDIC insurance funds in the event the depository
institution is in danger of default.  Under a policy of the Federal Reserve with
respect to bank holding company  operations,  a bank holding company is required
to  serve  as a  source  of  financial  strength  to its  subsidiary  depository
institutions   and  to  commit   resources  to  support  such   institutions  in
circumstances  where it might not do so absent such policy.  The Federal Reserve
also has the  authority  under the Bank  Holding  Company  Act to require a bank
holding company to terminate any activity or to relinquish control of a non-bank
subsidiary  upon the  Federal  Reserve's  determination  that such  activity  or
control  constitutes a serious risk to the financial  soundness and stability of
any bank subsidiary of the bank holding company.

Capital Adequacy Guidelines for Bank Holding Companies
------------------------------------------------------

      The Federal  Reserve has adopted  risk-based  capital  guidelines for bank
holding  companies.  The  risk-based  capital  guidelines  are  designed to make
regulatory  capital  requirements  more sensitive to differences in risk profile
among  banks and bank  holding  companies,  to  account  for  off-balance  sheet
exposure,  and to minimize  disincentives for holding liquid assets. Under these
guidelines,  assets  and  off-balance  sheet  items are  assigned  to broad risk
categories each with appropriate weights. The resulting capital ratios represent
capital as a percentage  of total  risk-weighted  assets and  off-balance  sheet
items.

      The minimum  ratio of total  capital to  risk-weighted  assets  (including
certain off-balance sheet activities,  such as standby letters of credit) is 8%.
At least 4% of the total capital is required to be "Tier I Capital,"  consisting
of common  shareholders'  equity and qualifying  preferred  stock,  less certain
goodwill items and other  intangible  assets.  The remainder ("Tier II Capital")
may consist of (a) the allowance for loan losses of up to 1.25% of risk-weighted
assets, (b) non-qualifying preferred stock, (c) hybrid capital instruments,  (d)
perpetual  debt,  (e)  mandatory  convertible  securities,  and  (f)  qualifying
subordinated  debt  and  intermediate-term  preferred  stock up to 50% of Tier I
capital.  Total capital is the sum of Tier I and Tier II capital less reciprocal
holdings of other banking  organizations'  capital  instruments,  investments in
unconsolidated  subsidiaries  and any  other  deductions  as  determined  by the
Federal  Reserve  (determined  on a case by case  basis or as a matter of policy
after formal rule-making).

      Bank holding  company  assets are given  risk-weights  of 0%, 20%, 50% and
100%. In addition,  certain  off-balance  sheet items are given  similar  credit
conversion  factors  to  convert  them to asset  equivalent  amounts to which an
appropriate  risk-weight  will  apply.  These  computations  result in the total
risk-weighted assets. Most loans are assigned to the 100% risk category,  except
for performing first mortgage loans fully secured by residential  property which
carry a 50% risk-weighting and loans secured by deposits in the Bank which carry
a 20% risk-weighting.  Most investment securities (including, primarily, general
obligation  claims of  states  or other  political  subdivisions  of the  United
States) are assigned to the 20% category,  except for municipal or state revenue
bonds, which have a 50% risk-weight, and direct obligations of the U.S. Treasury
or obligations backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government, which
have a 0%  risk-weight.  In converting  off-balance  sheet items,  direct credit
substitutes  including general  guarantees and standby letters of credit backing
financial  obligations  are  given a 100%


                                       22
<PAGE>

risk-weighting.  Transaction  related  contingencies such as bid bonds,  standby
letters of credit  backing  nonfinancial  obligations,  and undrawn  commitments
(including  commercial  credit  lines with an initial  maturity of more than one
year) have a 50% risk-weighting.  Short-term commercial letters of credit have a
20% risk-weighting and certain short-term unconditionally cancelable commitments
have a 0% risk-weighting.

      In addition to the risk-based capital guidelines,  the Federal Reserve has
adopted a minimum Tier I capital  (leverage)  ratio,  under which a bank holding
company  must  maintain  a minimum  level of Tier I  capital  to  average  total
consolidated  assets of at least 3% in the case of a bank  holding  company that
has  the  highest  regulatory   examination  rating  and  is  not  contemplating
significant  growth or expansion.  All other bank holding companies are expected
to  maintain  a  leverage  ratio of at least 100 to 200 basis  points  above the
stated minimum.

Bank Regulation
---------------

      As a New  Jersey-chartered  commercial  bank,  the Bank is  subject to the
regulation, supervision, and examination of the New Jersey Department of Banking
and Insurance. As an FDIC-insured institution, we are subject to the regulation,
supervision  and  examination of the FDIC, an agency of the federal  government.
The  regulations  of the FDIC  and the New  Jersey  Department  of  Banking  and
Insurance impact virtually all of our activities, including the minimum level of
capital we must maintain,  our ability to pay  dividends,  our ability to expand
through new branches or acquisitions and various other matters.

      Insurance  of  Deposits.  Our  deposits  are  insured  up to a maximum  of
$100,000 per depositor  under the Bank  Insurance Fund of the FDIC. The FDIC has
established  a  risk-based   assessment   system  for  all  insured   depository
institutions.  Under the risk-based assessment system, deposit insurance premium
rates range from 0-27 basis points of assessed deposits.

      Capital Adequacy Guidelines.  The FDIC has promulgated  risk-based capital
guidelines,  which are designed to make  regulatory  capital  requirements  more
sensitive to differences in risk profile among banks, to account for off-balance
sheet exposure,  and to minimize  disincentives for holding liquid assets. Under
these guidelines,  assets and off-balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk
categories,   each  with  appropriate  weights.  The  resulting  capital  ratios
represent capital as a percentage of total risk-weighted  assets and off-balance
sheet items.  These guidelines are substantially  similar to the Federal Reserve
guidelines discussed above.

      In addition to the risk-based capital  guidelines,  the FDIC has adopted a
minimum Tier 1 capital  (leverage)  ratio.  This  measurement  is  substantially
similar to the Federal Reserve leverage capital measurement  discussed above. At
December 31, 2004, the Bank's ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets was
12.83%.  Our Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted  assets was 11.84%,  and our Tier I
capital to adjusted total assets was 7.89%.

      Dividends. The Bank may pay dividends as declared from time to time by the
Board  of  Directors  out  of  funds  legally  available,   subject  to  certain
restrictions.  Under the New Jersey  Banking Act of 1948, the Bank may not pay a
cash dividend  unless,  following the payment,  the Bank's capital stock will be
unimpaired  and the Bank  will  have a  surplus  of no less than 50% of the Bank
capital  stock or, if not,  the  payment  of the  dividend  will not  reduce the
surplus. In


                                       23
<PAGE>

addition,  the Bank cannot pay dividends in amounts that would reduce the Bank's
capital below regulatory imposed minimums.

The USA PATRIOT Act
-------------------

      In response to the terrorist events of September 11, 2001, the Uniting and
Strengthening  America by Providing  Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and
Obstruct  Terrorism  Act of 2001, or the USA PATRIOT Act, was signed into law on
October 26, 2001. The USA PATRIOT Act gives the federal government new powers to
address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures,  expanded
surveillance  powers,  increased  information  sharing and broadened  anti-money
laundering requirements. For years, financial institutions such as the Bank have
been subject to federal  anti-money  laundering  obligations.  As such, the bank
does  not  believe  the USA  PATRIOT  Act will  have a  material  impact  on its
operations.

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
--------------------------

      The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ("Sarbanes-Oxley"),  contains a broad range
of legislative  reforms intended to address  corporate and accounting  fraud. In
addition to the  establishment  of a new  accounting  oversight  board that will
enforce auditing,  quality control and independence standards and will be funded
by fees  from all  publicly  traded  companies,  Sarbanes-Oxley  places  certain
restrictions  on the scope of services that may be provided by accounting  firms
to their public company audit clients.  Any non-audit services being provided to
a public company audit client will require  preapproval  by the company's  audit
committee. In addition, Sarbanes-Oxley makes certain changes to the requirements
for audit partner rotation after a period of time. Sarbanes-Oxley requires chief
executive officers and chief financial officers, or their equivalent, to certify
to the  accuracy of periodic  reports  filed with the  Securities  and  Exchange
Commission,  subject  to civil  and  criminal  penalties  if they  knowingly  or
willingly violate this certification requirement.  The Company's Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer have signed certifications to this Form 10-K
as required by Sarbanes-Oxley.  In addition, under Sarbanes-Oxley,  counsel will
be required to report evidence of a material violation of the securities laws or
a breach of fiduciary  duty by a company to its chief  executive  officer or its
chief legal officer,  and, if such officer does not  appropriately  respond,  to
report such evidence to the audit  committee or other  similar  committee of the
board of directors or the board itself.

      Under  Sarbanes-Oxley,   longer  prison  terms  will  apply  to  corporate
executives who violate federal  securities laws; the period during which certain
types of suits can be brought against a company or its officers is extended; and
bonuses issued to top executives  prior to restatement of a company's  financial
statements  are now  subject  to  disgorgement  if such  restatement  was due to
corporate misconduct.  Executives are also prohibited from trading the company's
securities  during  retirement  plan  "blackout"  periods,  and loans to company
executives  (other than loans by  financial  institutions  permitted  by federal
rules and regulations)  are restricted.  In addition,  a provision  directs that
civil penalties levied by the Securities and Exchange  Commission as a result of
any judicial or  administrative  action under  Sarbanes-Oxley  be deposited to a
fund for the benefit of harmed  investors.  The Federal  Accounts  for  Investor
Restitution  provision also requires the  Securities and Exchange  Commission to
develop methods of improving  collection rates. The legislation  accelerates the
time  frame for  disclosures  by


                                       24
<PAGE>

public  companies,  as they must  immediately  disclose any material  changes in
their financial  condition or operations.  Directors and executive officers must
also provide information for most changes in ownership in a company's securities
within two business days of the change.

      Sarbanes-Oxley  also  increases  the  oversight  of, and codifies  certain
requirements  relating to, audit  committees  of public  companies  and how they
interact with the company's "registered public accounting firm." Audit Committee
members must be independent and are absolutely barred from accepting consulting,
advisory or other compensatory fees from the issuer. In addition, companies must
disclose  whether at least one member of the  committee is a "financial  expert"
(as such term is defined by the Securities and Exchange  Commission) and if not,
why not. Under Sarbanes-Oxley,  a company's registered public accounting firm is
prohibited from performing  statutorily mandated audit services for a company if
such company's chief executive officer,  chief financial  officer,  comptroller,
chief accounting officer or any person serving in equivalent  positions had been
employed by such firm and  participated  in the audit of such company during the
one-year  period  preceding  the  audit  initiation  date.  Sarbanes-Oxley  also
prohibits  any officer or director of a company or any other person acting under
their  direction  from  taking any  action to  fraudulently  influence,  coerce,
manipulate  or mislead any  independent  accountant  engaged in the audit of the
company's  financial  statements  for the  purpose of  rendering  the  financial
statements  materially  misleading.  Sarbanes-Oxley also requires the Securities
and Exchange  Commission to prescribe rules requiring  inclusion of any internal
control   report  and   assessment   by  management  in  the  annual  report  to
shareholders. Sarbanes-Oxley requires the company's registered public accounting
firm that  issues  the audit  report  to  attest to and  report on  management's
assessment of the company's internal controls.

      Although the Company has  incurred  some  additional  expense in complying
with the  provisions of the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act and the resulting  regulations,
management  does not expect that such  compliance will have a material impact on
our results of operations or financial condition.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        OF OPERATIONS
        -------------

General
-------

      BCB Bancorp,  Inc., completed its acquisition of Bayonne Community Bank on
May 1, 2003.  Information  at and for the twelve months ended  December 31, 2003
reflects the consolidated financial information of BCB Bancorp Inc. Prior to the
completion of the acquisition,  BCB Bancorp, Inc. had no assets,  liabilities or
operations.  Consequently  the  information  provided below at and for the years
ended December 31, 2002 and prior is for Bayonne Community Bank on a stand-alone
basis.

      This discussion, and other written material, and statements management may
make, may contain  certain  forward-looking  statements  regarding the Company's
prospective  performance and strategies within the meaning of Section 27A of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended,  and Section 21E of the Securities  Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended. The Company intends such forward-looking  statements to
be  covered  by  the  safe  harbor  provisions  for  forward-looking  statements
contained  in the  Private  Securities  Litigation  Reform  Act of 1995,  and is
including this statement for purposes of said safe harbor provisions.

      Forward-looking   information   is   inherently   subject   to  risks  and
uncertainties,  and actual results could differ  materially from those currently
anticipated due to a number of factors,  which include,  but are not limited to,
factors  discussed  in the  Company's  Annual  Report  on Form 10-K and in other
documents  filed by the Company with the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission.
Forward-looking statements,  which are based on certain assumptions and describe
future  plans,  strategies  and  expectations  of  the  Company,  are  generally
identified  by the  use of the  words  "plan,"  "believe,"  "expect,"  "intend,"
"anticipate,"   "estimate,"   "project,"  "may,"  "will,"   "should,"   "could,"
"predicts,"  "forecasts,"  "potential,"  or  "continue"  or similar terms or the
negative of these terms. The Company's  ability to predict results or the actual
effects of its plans or strategies is inherently uncertain.  Accordingly, actual
results may differ materially from anticipated results.

      Factors that could have a material adverse effect on the operations of the
Company and its subsidiaries  include, but are not limited to, changes in market
interest  rates,  general  economic  conditions,  legislation,  and  regulation;
changes  in  monetary  and fiscal  policies  of the  United  States  Government,
including  policies of the United  States  Treasury and Federal  Reserve  Board;
changes in the  quality or  composition  of the loan or  investment  portfolios;
changes in deposit flows, competition, and demand for financial services, loans,
deposits and  investment  products in the Company's  local  markets;  changes in
accounting  principles and guidelines;  war or terrorist  activities;  and other
economic, competitive,  governmental, regulatory, geopolitical and technological
factors affecting the Company's operations, pricing and services.

      Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking
statements,  which speak only as of the date of this  discussion.  Although  the
Company  believes  that  the  expectations   reflected  in  the  forward-looking
statements are reasonable,  the Company cannot guarantee future results,  levels
of activity,  performance or achievements.  Except as required by applicable law
or   regulation,   the  Company   undertakes   no  obligation  to  update  these
forward-


                                       28
<PAGE>

looking  statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date
on which such statements were made.

Critical Accounting Policies
----------------------------

      Critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that can have a
significant impact on the Company's financial position and results of operations
that  require  the use of  complex  and  subjective  estimates  based  upon past
experiences and management's  judgment.  Because of the uncertainty  inherent in
such estimates,  actual results may differ from these estimates. Below are those
policies applied in preparing the Company's  consolidated  financial  statements
that management  believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates
and assumptions.  For additional  accounting  policies,  see Note 2 of "Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements."

Allowance for Loan Losses

      Loans  receivable  are presented  net of an allowance for loan losses.  In
determining  the  appropriate  level of the  allowance,  management  considers a
combination of factors, such as economic and industry trends, real estate market
conditions,  size and type of loans in portfolio, nature and value of collateral
held,  borrowers'  financial  strength and credit  ratings,  and  prepayment and
default  history.  The calculation of the appropriate  allowance for loan losses
requires  a  substantial   amount  of  judgment  regarding  the  impact  of  the
aforementioned factors, as well as other factors, on the ultimate realization of
loans receivable.

Stock Options

      The  Company  has the choice to account  for stock  options  using  either
Accounting  Principles  Board  Opinion  No.  25  ("APB  25")  or SFAS  No.  123,
"Accounting  for Stock-Based  Compensation."  The Company has elected to use the
accounting  method under APB 25 and the related  interpretations  to account for
its stock  options.  Under APB 25,  generally,  when the  exercise  price of the
Company's  stock options equals the market price of the underlying  stock on the
date of grant, no compensation expense is recognized. Had the Company elected to
use SFAS No. 123 to account for its stock  options  under the fair value method,
it would have been  required to record  compensation  expense  and, as a result,
diluted earnings per share for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003
would have been lower by $0.18 and $0.16  respectively.  No stock  options  were
granted  prior  to  2002.  See  Note  2  to  "Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial
Statements."  Effective July 1, 2005, the Company will have to account for stock
options  pursuant to SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004).  See discussions  under Recent
Accounting  Pronouncements  for our  analysis  of the  impact  of SFAS  No.  123
(revised 2004) on future operations.

Financial Condition
-------------------

Comparison at December 31, 2004 and at December 31, 2003

      Since we  commenced  operations  in 2000 we have sought to grow our assets
and deposit base consistent with our capital requirements.  We offer competitive
loan and deposit products and seek to distinguish ourselves from our competitors
through our service and availability. Total


                                       29
<PAGE>

assets  increased  by $77.6  million or 25.8% to $378.3  million at December 31,
2004 from $300.7  million at December 31, 2003 as the Company  continued to grow
the Bank's deposit base and invest these deposits in loans and securities.

      Total cash and cash equivalents decreased by $7.3 million or 61.5% to $4.5
million at December 31, 2004 from $11.8 million at December 31, 2003 as the Bank
reduced  excess  liquidity  and  redeployed  it into higher  yielding  loans and
securities.  Securities  held-to-maturity increased by $26.7 million or 29.6% to
$117.0  million at December  31, 2004 from $90.3  million at December  31, 2003.
This  increase was  primarily  attributable  to the purchase of $48.1 million of
callable agency  securities and the purchase of $27.7 million of mortgage backed
securities  partially  offset by the call of $42.0 million of agency  securities
and repayments and  prepayments  of $7.1 million in mortgage  backed  securities
during the twelve months ended December 31, 2004.

      Loans receivable  increased by $57.6 million or 30.5% to $246.4 million at
December  31,  2004 from $188.8  million at  December  31,  2003.  The  increase
resulted  primarily  from a $44.7 million  increase in  commercial  and business
loans,  net of  amortization,  a $10.1  million  increase in home  mortgages and
construction loans, net of amortization, and a $3.5 million increase in consumer
loans, net of  amortization,  partially offset by an increase of $393,000 in the
allowance  for loan  losses.  The  growth  in  loans  receivable  was  primarily
attributable  to  competitive  pricing  in a lower  than  normal  interest  rate
environment  and a vibrant  local  economy  where real estate  construction  and
rehabilitation remain strong.

      During 2004, the Bank decided to discontinue its involvement in commercial
heavy  equipment  lending  due  to  the  relatively  poor  performance  of  that
portfolio. Accordingly, the portfolio, which consisted of 29 loans totaling $3.3
million at  December  31,  2003,  was  reduced to 9 loans  totaling  $945,000 at
December 31, 2004. In June 2004, the Bank sold in bulk 14  non-performing  loans
for $1.1 million,  incurring a $56,000  loss.  In addition,  the Bank resolved 5
non-performing  loans via  repossession  and sale of the underlying  collateral,
resulting in $297,000 in net  charge-offs to the allowance for loan losses.  The
Bank has not originated any commercial  heavy equipment loans since May 2003 and
has no current plans to originate such loans in the future.

      Fixed assets  remained at $5.7 million at both  December 31, 2004 and 2003
as fixed asset purchases  during 2004 primarily  equated to the  depreciation of
fixed assets during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004.

      Deposit liabilities  increased by $83.6 million or 33.0% to $337.2 million
at December  31, 2004 from $253.7  million at December  31,  2003.  The increase
resulted  primarily  from an increase  of $35.0  million or 21.5% in savings and
club  accounts  to $197.9  million  from  $162.8  million,  an increase of $38.4
million or 69.9% in time  deposits to $93.2 million from $54.8  million,  and an
increase  of $10.2  million or 28.4% in demand  deposits to $46.2  million  from
$36.0  million.  The Bank has been able to achieve  these growth  rates  through
competitive pricing on select deposit products.


                                       30
<PAGE>

      Borrowings  decreased  by $10.9  million  or 43.5%  to  $14.1  million  at
December  31,  2004 from $25.0  million at  December  31,  2003.  This  decrease
resulted  primarily from the maturity and subsequent  reduction of $15.0 million
of a $25.0  million  Federal  Home Loan  Bank  Advance  partially  offset by the
issuance  of pooled  trust  preferred  securities  totaling  $4.1  million.  The
reduction in Federal Home Loan Bank Advances reflects managements  philosophy of
reducing  wholesale  borrowings during a time of steadily  increasing short term
interest rates so as to more closely monitor and reduce interest  expense and to
continue to fund balance sheet growth through more organic means.

      Stockholders'  equity  increased by $4.9 million or 23.0% to $26.0 million
at December 31, 2004 from $21.2 million at December 31, 2003.  This increase was
primarily  attributable  to net income for the twelve months ended  December 31,
2004 of $3.6 million,  cash totaling $1.1 million  received from the exercise of
stock options by directors, officers and employees of the Bank and a tax benefit
related to the exercise of the  aforementioned  stock  options of  $179,000.  At
December  31,  2004 the Bank's  Tier 1  leverage,  Tier 1  risk-based  and Total
risk-based capital ratios were 7.75%, 11.84%, and 12.83% respectively.

Comparison at December 31, 2003 and at December 31, 2002

      Total assets  increased by $117.6 million,  or 64.2%, to $300.7 million at
December  31,  2003 from  $183.1  million at  December  31,  2002 as the Company
continued to grow the Bank's deposit base and invest these deposits in loans and
investments.

      Total cash and cash equivalents  increased by $6.7 million,  or 131.4%, to
$11.8  million at December  31, 2003 from $5.1  million at December  31, 2002 in
order to accumulate cash liquidity to facilitate loan closings in the near-term.
Investment securities  held-to-maturity increased by $39.7 million, or 78.5%, to
$90.3 million at December 31, 2003 from $50.6 million at December 31, 2002. This
increase was primarily attributable to the purchase of $70.0 million of callable
agency   securities  and  the  purchase  of  $6.0  million  of   mortgage-backed
securities,  which was  partially  offset by the call of $20.0 million of agency
securities  and  $16.3  million  of  mortgage  backed  security  repayments  and
prepayments during the twelve months ended December 31, 2003.

      Loans receivable  increased by $66.7 million,  or 54.6%, to $188.8 million
at December  31, 2003 from $122.1  million at December  31,  2002.  The increase
resulted  primarily from a $50.2 million increase in commercial and multi-family
loans net of  amortization,  a $14.2  million  increase  in home  mortgages  and
construction  loans net of  amortization,  a $2.9  million  increase in consumer
loans net of  amortization,  partially  offset by an increase of $880,000 in the
allowance  for loan  losses.  The  growth  in  loans  receivable  was  primarily
attributable  to  competitive  pricing  in a lower  than  normal  interest  rate
environment  and  a  strong  local  economy  as  real  estate  construction  and
rehabilitation was active during 2003.

      Fixed assets  increased  by $3.1  million,  or 119.2%,  to $5.7 million at
December 31, 2003 from $2.6 million at December 31, 2002.  The increase in fixed
assets resulted  primarily from the rehabilitation of and equipment purchase for
a leased  facility,  presently being used as a branch office,  opened during the
spring of 2003 and the  acquisition,  construction  and outfitting of our 13,200
square foot  corporate  headquarters  which opened during the fourth  quarter of
2003.

      Deposit  liabilities  increased  by $90.2  million,  or  55.2%,  to $253.7
million at December  31, 2003 from $163.5  million at  December  31,  2002.  The
increase  resulted  primarily  from an  increase  of $46.5  million  or 40.0% in
savings and club accounts to $162.8 million from $116.3 million,  an increase of
$34.8 million or 174.0% in time  deposits to $54.8  million from $20.0  million,
and an increase  of $8.8  million or 32.4% in demand  deposits to $36.0  million
from $27.2 million. The Bank has been able to achieve these growth rates through
competitive pricing on select deposit products.

      Borrowings  increased  by $25.0  million to $25.0  million at December 31,
2003, as the Bank employed a leverage strategy funded with wholesale  borrowings
from the  Federal  Home  Loan Bank of New York  maturing  in  November  2004 and
carrying a 1.48% interest rate to invest in two callable  investment  securities
issued by the FHLB.  The two  investment  securities  have a final  maturity  of
fifteen years, and consist of a $20.85 million  investment  yielding 6.05% and a
$4.15 million investment yielding 6.00%.

      Stockholders' equity increased by $2.4 million, or 12.8%, to $21.2 million
at December 31, 2003 from $18.8  million at December 31, 2002.  The increase was
wholly  attributable to net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003
of $2.4  million.  At  December  31,  2003 the Bank's  Tier 1  leverage,  Tier 1
risk-based and Total risk-based  capital ratios were 7.02%,  10.47%,  and 11.51%
respectively.

Analysis of Net Interest Income
-------------------------------

      Net  interest  income  is  the  difference   between  interest  income  on
interest-earning  assets and interest expense on  interest-bearing  liabilities.
Net interest income depends on the relative amounts of  interest-earning  assets
and interest-bearing  liabilities and the interest rates earned or paid on them,
respectively.

      The following  tables set forth balance sheets,  average yields and costs,
and certain other  information for the periods  indicated.  All average balances
are daily  average  balances.  The yields set forth below  include the effect of
deferred fees, discounts and premiums, which are included in interest income.

Results of Operations
---------------------

Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2004 and 2003

      Net income increased by $1.2 million or 51.1% to $3.6 million for the year
ended  December 31, 2004 from $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2003.
The increase in net income is a result of  increases in net interest  income and
non-interest  income and a decrease in the provision  for loan losses  partially
offset by  increases  in  non-interest  expense and income  taxes.  Net interest
income  increased by $4.0  million or 40.4% to $13.8  million for the year ended
December  31, 2004 from $9.8 million for the year ended  December 31, 2003.  The
increase  resulted  primarily  from an increase in average net interest  earning
assets of $4.3 million or 13.5% to $36.2 million for the year ended December 31,
2004 from $31.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 partially offset by
a decrease in the net interest  margin to 3.96% for the year ended  December 31,
2004 from 4.34% for the year ended  December 31,  2003.  The decrease in our net
interest  margin  reflects the on-going  philosophy of the Federal  Reserve Open
Market  Committee,  specifically  during  the  second  half of 2004,  to tighten
monetary policy by raising short-term  interest rates while long term rates have
trended slightly downward during that same time period.

      Interest income on loans receivable increased by $4.04 million or 37.6% to
$14.8  million for the year ended  December 31, 2004 from $10.8  million for the
year ended  December 31, 2003.  The increase was primarily due to an increase in
average loans  receivable  of $66.1  million or 42.6% to $221.3  million for the
year ended December 31, 2004 from $155.1 million for the year ended December 31,
2003 partially  offset by a decrease in the average yield on loans receivable to
6.68%  for the year  ended  December  31,  2004 from  6.93%  for the year  ended
December  31,  2003.  The  increase  in the  average  balance of loans  reflects
management's  philosophy to deploy funds in higher yielding loans,  specifically
commercial  real estate as opposed to investments  in lower yielding  government
securities.  The decrease in average yield  reflects the continuing of the lower
long-term interest rate environment in 2004.

      Interest  income on securities  increased by $2.5 million or 74.5% to $5.8
million  for the year ended  December  31,  2004 from $3.3  million for the year
ended December 31, 2003. The increase was primarily  attributable to an increase
of $48.0 million or 79.6% in the average balance of securities to $108.3 million
for the year  ended  December  31,  2004 from $60.3  million  for the year ended
December  31,  2003,  partially  offset by a decrease  in the  average  yield on
securities to 5.32% for the year ended December 31, 2004 from 5.47% for the year
ended  December  31,  2003.  The  increase  in  average  balances  reflects  the
redeployment  of  funds  previously  invested  in  short-term  interest  earning
deposits and the  on-going  leverage  strategy  done with the use of the Federal
Home Loan Bank advances.

      Interest income on other interest-earning assets,  consisting primarily of
federal funds sold  increased by $68,000 or 74.7% to $159,000 for the year ended
December  31,  2004 from  $91,000  for the year ended  December  31,  2003.  The
increase  was  primarily  due to an  increase  in the  average  balance of other
interest-earning  assets to $17.7  million for the year ended  December 31, 2004
from $10.4 million for the year ended  December 31, 2003  partially  offset by a
slight increase in the average yield on other  interest-earning  assets to 0.90%
for the year ended  December 31, 2004 from 0.87% for the year ended December 31,
2003. As the Bank's loan


                                       35
<PAGE>

pipeline  consistently  totaled over $30.0 million  during 2004, the increase in
average balance in other interest-earning assets is a reflection of management's
philosophy to maintain a liquid source of funds to facilitate the prompt closing
of those loans.

      Total interest expense  increased by $2.6 million or 60.2% to $6.9 million
for the year  ended  December  31,  2004 from $4.3  million  for the year  ended
December 31, 2003.  This  increase  resulted  from an increase in average  total
interest bearing deposit liabilities of $94.4 million or 49.4% to $285.4 million
for the year ended  December  31,  2004 from  $191.1  million for the year ended
December 31, 2003,  and an increase of $22.7  million in average  borrowings  to
$25.7  million  at  December  31,  2004,  from $2.9  million  for the year ended
December 31, 2003. The average cost of total interest  bearing  liabilities  was
2.23% for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003.

      The provision for loan losses totaled  $690,000 and $880,000 for the years
ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The provision for loan losses is
established based upon management's review of the Bank's loans and consideration
of  a  variety  of  factors  including,   but  not  limited  to,  (1)  the  risk
characteristics  of the loan portfolio,  (2) current  economic  conditions,  (3)
actual losses previously  experienced,  (4) the significant level of loan growth
and (5) the  existing  level of reserves  for loan losses that are  possible and
estimable.  During  2004,  the  Bank  experienced  $297,000  in net  charge-offs
(consisting  of  $332,000 in  charge-offs  and  $35,000 in  recoveries)  related
entirely  to the  liquidation  of five  commercial  heavy  equipment  loans.  As
previously  discussed,  the Bank decided to discontinue  its involvement in this
lending segment. During 2003, there were no charge-offs or recoveries.  The Bank
had  non-accrual  loans  totaling  $553,000 at December  31, 2004 and $67,000 at
December 31, 2003.  The allowance for loan losses stood at $2.5 million or 1.01%
of gross total loans at December  31, 2004 as compared to $2.1  million or 1.11%
of gross total loans at December 31, 2003.  The amount of the allowance is based
on estimates and the ultimate  losses may vary from such  estimates.  Management
assesses the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis and makes provisions
for loan losses as necessary in order to maintain the adequacy of the allowance.
While management uses available  information to recognize loses on loans, future
loan loss  provisions  may be necessary  based on changes in the  aforementioned
criteria. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their
examination  process,  periodically review the allowance for loan losses and may
require the Bank to recognize  additional  provisions based on their judgment of
information  available  to them at the  time of  their  examination.  Management
believes  that the  allowance  for loan losses was adequate at both December 31,
2004 and 2003.

      Total  non-interest  income increased by $143,000 or 29.8% to $623,000 for
the year ended  December 31, 2004 from $480,000 for the year ended  December 31,
2003. The increase in  non-interest  income  resulted  primarily from a $150,000
increase in fees and  service  charges,  a $42,000  increase in gain on sales of
loans  originated  for sale,  and a $7,000  increase in other  income  partially
offset by the aforementioned  $56,000 loss in 2004 on the sale of non-performing
commercial heavy equipment loans.

      Total  non-interest  expense  increased  by $2.3  million or 42.1% to $7.7
million  for the year ended  December  31,  2004 from $5.4  million for the year
ended  December 31, 2003.  The increase in 2004 was primarily due to an increase
of $1.2  million or 41.3% in  salaries  and


                                       36
<PAGE>

employee  benefits  expense to $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004
from $2.8  million for the year ended  December  31, 2003 as the Bank  increased
staffing levels and  compensation  in an effort to service its growing  customer
base. Full time equivalent  employees increased to seventy-five (75) at December
31, 2004 from  sixty-six  (66) at  December  31,  2003 and  thirty-four  (34) at
December 31, 2002.  Equipment  expense increased by $488,000 to $1.4 million for
the year ended  December 31, 2004 from $940,000 for the year ended  December 31,
2003. The primary  component of this expense  relates to the increased  costs of
the Bank's data service  provider  reflecting  the overall  growth of the Bank's
balance sheet.  Occupancy expense increased by $244,000 to $655,000 for the year
ended  December 31, 2004 from  $411,000 for the year ended  December 31, 2003 as
the Bank  incurred a full year's worth of  occupancy  expense on the two offices
opened during 2003.  Advertising expense decreased by $8,000 to $161,000 for the
year ended December 31, 2004 from $169,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003.
Other  non-interest  expense increased by $384,000 to $1.44 million for the year
ended December 31, 2004 from $1.06 million for the year ended December 31, 2003.
The  increase  in other  non-interest  expense  was  primarily  attributable  to
increased  legal,  professional  and shareholder  relation expense as during the
year ended December 31, 2004, the Company  incurred  expenses  associated with a
proxy contest  initiated by an opposing slate of directors.  Other  non-interest
expense  is  comprised  of  directors'  fees,  stationary,  forms and  printing,
professional  fees,  check  printing,  correspondent  bank fees,  telephone  and
communication, shareholder relations and other fees and expenses.

      Income tax expense  increased by $794,000 or 49.2% to $2.4 million for the
year ended  December 31, 2004 from $1.6 million for the year ended  December 31,
2003  reflecting  pre-tax  income of $6.0 million  earned  during the year ended
December 31, 2004 compared to pre-tax  income of $4.0 million  earned during the
year ended December 31, 2003.

Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2003 and 2002

      Net income  increased by $1.1 million,  or 84.6%,  to $2.4 million for the
year ended  December 31, 2003 from $1.3 million for the year ended  December 31,
2002. This increase in net income resulted from increases in net interest income
and  non-interest  income,  which  was  partially  offset  by  increases  in the
provision for loan losses,  non-interest  expense and income taxes. Net interest
income  increased by $3.8 million,  or 63.3%, to $9.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2003 from $6.0 million for the year ended  December 31, 2002.  This
increase  resulted  primarily  from an increase in average net interest  earning
assets of $8.4 million,  or 35.7%,  to $31.9 million for the year ended December
31,  2003 from  $23.5  million  for the year ended  December  31,  2002,  and an
increase in the net  interest  margin to 4.34% for the year ended  December  31,
2003 from 4.03% for the year ended  December 31,  2002.  The increase in our net
interest margin reflected  management's  ability to invest a large percentage of
our  deposit  base in higher  yielding,  conservatively  underwritten  loans and
federally-sponsored United States Government Agency Securities.

      Interest income on loans receivable  increased by $4.6 million,  or 75.4%,
to $10.7 million for the year ended  December 31, 2003 from $6.1 million for the
year ended December 31, 2002.  This increase was primarily due to an increase in
average loans  receivable of $71.4 million,  or 85.3%, to $155.1 million for the
year ended  December 31, 2003 from $83.7 million for the year ended December 31,
2002,  which was  partially  offset by a decrease in the average  yield on loans


                                       37
<PAGE>

receivable to 6.93% for the year ended December 31, 2003 from 7.31% for the year
ended December 31, 2002. The increase in the average  balance of loans reflected
management's strategy of deploying funds in higher yielding loans,  specifically
commercial  real  estate  loans as  opposed  to lower  yielding  investments  in
government securities. The decrease in average yield reflects the lower interest
rate environment in 2003 as compared to 2002.

      Interest  income on securities  increased by $350,000,  or 11.9%, to $3.30
million for the year ended  December  31,  2003 from $2.95  million for the year
ended December 31, 2002. The increase was primarily  attributable to an increase
in the average balance of investment  securities of $11.9 million,  or 24.6%, to
$60.3  million for the year ended  December 31, 2003 from $48.4  million for the
year ended  December 31, 2002,  which was partially  offset by a decrease in the
average yield on investment  securities to 5.47% for the year ended December 31,
2003 from 6.10% for the year ended  December 31,  2002.  The increase in average
balances  reflects the redeployment of funds  previously  invested in short-term
interest  earning deposits and the use of borrowings that were invested in short
term investments to secure a positive short term interest rate spread.

      Interest income on other  interest-earning  assets consisting primarily of
federal  funds sold  decreased  by $181,000,  or 66.5%,  to $91,000 for the year
ended December 31, 2003 from $272,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002. This
decrease  was  primarily  due to a  decrease  in the  average  balance  of other
interest-earning  assets to $10.4  million for the year ended  December 31, 2003
from $15.9 million for the year ended  December 31, 2002,  and a decrease in the
average  yield on other  interest-earning  assets  to 0.87%  for the year  ended
December 31, 2003 from 1.71% for the year ended  December 31, 2002. The decrease
in the average balance reflects  management's decision to deploy funds in higher
yielding  loans and  securities  and the decrease in average yield  reflects the
lower interest rate environment in 2003 as compared to 2002.

      Total interest  expense  increased by $956,000,  or 28.3%, to $4.3 million
for the year  ended  December  31,  2003 from $3.4  million  for the year  ended
December 31, 2002.  This  increase  resulted  from an increase in average  total
interest bearing deposits of $66.6 million,  or 53.5%, to $191.1 million for the
year ended December 31, 2003 from $124.5 million for the year ended December 31,
2002, and a $2.9 million  increase in borrowings at December 31, 2003,  compared
to no borrowings the prior year-end, which was partially offset by a decrease in
the average  cost of interest  bearing  liabilities  to 2.23% for the year ended
December 31, 2003 from 2.71% for the year ended  December 31, 2002. The decrease
in average cost reflects the lower interest rate environment in 2003 as compared
to 2002.

      The provision for loan losses totaled  $880,000 and $843,000 for the years
ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 respectively.  The provision for loan losses is
established based upon management's review of the Bank's loans and consideration
of  a  variety  of  factors  including,   but  not  limited  to,  (1)  the  risk
characteristics  of the loan portfolio,  (2) current  economic  conditions,  (3)
actual losses previously  experienced,  (4) the significant level of loan growth
and (5) the  existing  level of reserves  for loan losses that are  possible and
estimable.  The Bank had non-accrual loans totaling $67,000 at December 31, 2003
and at December 31, 2002. The allowance for loan losses stood at $2.1 million or
1.1% of gross total loans at December 31,  2003,  as compared to $1.2 million or
1.0% of gross total loans at December 31, 2002.  The amount of the  allowance is
based on  estimates  and the  ultimate  losses  may vary  from  such


                                       38
<PAGE>

estimates.  Management  assesses  the  allowance  for loan losses on a quarterly
basis and makes provisions for loan losses as necessary in order to maintain the
adequacy of the  allowance.  While  management  uses  available  information  to
recognize losses on loans, future loan loss provisions may be necessary based on
changes  in  the  aforementioned  criteria.  In  addition,   various  regulatory
agencies, as an integral part of their examination process,  periodically review
the allowance  for loan losses and may require the Bank to recognize  additional
provisions based on their judgment of information  available to them at the time
of their examination. Management believes that the allowance for loan losses was
adequate at both December 31, 2003 and 2002.

      Total non-interest income increased by $145,000, or 43.2%, to $481,000 for
the year ended  December 31, 2003 from $336,000 for the year ended  December 31,
2002.  The increase in  non-interest  income  resulted  primarily from a $53,000
increase in fees and  service  charges,  a $94,000  increase in gain on sales of
loans  originated  for sale as the Bank initiated a program to sell select fixed
rate mortgages to the secondary  market,  and a $5,000 increase in other income,
which was partially  offset by a $8,000  decrease in gain on sales of securities
available for sale.

      Total non-interest  expenses increased by $2.1 million,  or 63.6%, to $5.4
million  for the year ended  December  31,  2003 from $3.3  million for the year
ended  December 31, 2002.  The increase in 2003 was primarily due to an increase
of $1.2 million,  or 75.0%,  in salaries and employee  benefits  expense to $2.8
million  for the year ended  December  31,  2003 from $1.6  million for the year
ended December 31, 2002 as the Bank increased  staffing levels and  compensation
in an effort  to  service  its  growing  customer  base.  Full  time  equivalent
employees  increased  to 66 at December  31, 2003 from 34 at December  31, 2002.
Equipment  expense increased by $294,000 to $940,000 for the year ended December
31,  2003 from  $646,000  for the year ended  December  31,  2002.  The  primary
component  of this  expense  relates to the  increased  costs of the Bank's data
service  provider  reflecting  the overall  growth of the Bank's  balance sheet.
Occupancy  expense increased by $164,000 to $411,000 for the year ended December
31, 2003 from  $247,000 for the year ended  December 31, 2002,  and  advertising
expense  increased by $90,000 to $169,000  for the year ended  December 31, 2003
from $79,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002,  primarily as a result of the
opening of two new offices  during the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 and
the increased  advertising  expense to promote them. Other non-interest  expense
increased by $309,000 to $1.1 million for the year ended  December 31, 2003 from
$749,000 for the year ended  December 31, 2002.  Other  non-interest  expense is
comprised of directors' fees, stationary, forms and printing, professional fees,
check  printing,   correspondent   bank  fees,   telephone  and   communication,
shareholder relations and other fees and expenses.

      Income tax expense  increased by $742,000,  or 85.1%,  to $1.6 million for
the year ended  December 31, 2003 from $872,000 for the year ended  December 31,
2002  reflecting  pre-tax income of $4.0 million for the year ended December 31,
2003 compared to pre-tax  income of $2.2 million  earned for year ended December
31, 2002.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
-------------------------------

      Our  funding  sources  include  income  from   operations,   deposits  and
borrowings,  principal  payments  on  loans  and  investment  securities.  While
maturities and scheduled  amortization  of


                                       39
<PAGE>

loans and  securities are  predictable  sources of funds,  deposit  outflows and
mortgage  prepayments  are greatly  influenced  by the general level of interest
rates, economic conditions and competition.

      Our primary  investing  activities  are the  origination of commercial and
multi-family real estate loans, one-to four-family mortgage loans, construction,
commercial   business   and  consumer   loans,   as  well  as  the  purchase  of
mortgage-backed and other investment securities.  During 2004, loan originations
totaled $110.8 million compared to $105.0 million and $90.5 million for 2003 and
2002,  respectively.  The increase in loan  originations  reflects  management's
efforts to increase total assets of the Bank, the continued  focus on increasing
commercial and multi-family  lending  operations and the strong refinance market
in 2004.

      During 2004,  cash flow provided by the calls and maturities and principal
payments  received on  maturing  securities  held to maturity  amounted to $49.1
million  compared to $36.3 million and $13.1  million in 2003 and 2002.  Deposit
growth  provided $83.6  million,  $90.1 million and $61.8 million of funding for
the years  ending  December 31, 2004,  2003 and 2002,  respectively.  Borrowings
totaled $14.1 million in 2004 and were used to fund asset growth.

      Loan  Commitments.  In the  ordinary  course of business  the Bank extends
commitments to originate  residential  and  commercial  loans and other consumer
loans. Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long
as  there  is no  violation  of  any  condition  established  in  the  contract.
Commitments  generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination  clauses
and may  require  payment  of a fee.  Since the Bank does not  expect all of the
commitments  to be  funded,  the total  commitment  amounts  do not  necessarily
represent  future  cash   requirements.   The  Bank  evaluates  each  customer's
creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis.  Collateral may be obtained based upon
management's  assessment  of the  customers'  creditworthiness.  Commitments  to
extend credit may be written on a fixed rate basis exposing the Bank to interest
rate risk  given the  possibility  that  market  rates may  change  between  the
commitment  date and the actual  extension of credit.  The Bank had  outstanding
commitments to originate and fund loans of approximately $38.8 million and $33.2
million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

      The following tables sets forth our contractual obligations and commercial
commitments at December 31, 2004.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
--------------------------------

Accounting for Share-based Payments

      In December 2004, the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board (the "FASB")
issued  Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards  ("SFAS") No. 123 (revised
2004),  "Share-Based  Payment".  This  statement  revises the original  guidance
contained in SFAS No, 123 and  supersedes  Accounting  Principles  Board ("APB")
Opinion  No. 25,  "Accounting  for Stock  Issued to  Employees,  and its related
implementation guidance. Under SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), a public entity such
as the  Company  will be  required  to  measure  the cost of  employee  services
received in exchange for an award of equity  instruments based on the grant-date
fair value of the award (with limited  exceptions)  and recognize such cost over
the period  during which an employee is required to provide  service in exchange
for the award  (usually  the  vesting  period).  For stock  options  and similar
instruments, grant-date fair value will be estimated using option-pricing models
adjusted for the unique characteristics of instruments (unless observable market
prices for the same or similar instruments are available).  For Public entities,
such as the  Company,  that do not or will not file as small  business  issuers,
SFAS No.  123  (revised  2004) is  effective  as of the  beginning  of the first
interim or annual reporting period that begins after June 15, 2005.

      Under SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004),  the Company will be required to record
compensation  expense for all new awards  granted and any awards  modified after
June 30, 2005.  In addition,  the  transition  rules under SFAS No. 123 (revised
2004) will require that, for all awards  outstanding at June 30, 2005, for which
the requisite  service has not yet been rendered,  compensation cost be recorded
as such service is rendered after June 30, 2005.

      The aforementioned  pronouncement related to stock-based payments will not
have any effect on the  Company's  existing  historical  consolidated  financial
statements as restatements of previously  reported periods will not be required.
However,  the Company's stock option awards  generally  require a service period
which  extends  beyond the  effective  date of SFAS No. 123 (revised  2004) and,
accordingly, the Company will be required to record compensation expense on such
awards  beginning  on July 1, 2005.  Our  preliminary  analysis  indicates  that
compensation expense, net of income tax benefits,  related to awards expected to
exist at June 30, 2005,  which will require future service by grantees,  will be
approximately  $226,000 during the last six months of 2005, $376,000 in 2006 and
$162,000 in 2007.

      In  December  2003,  the FASB  issued a  revision  to  Interpretation  46,
"Consolidation of Variable Interest  Entities," which established  standards for
identifying a variable  interest entity ("VIE") and for  determining  under what
circumstances  a VIE  should  be  consolidated  with  its  primary  beneficiary.
Application of this Interpretation is required in financial statements of public
entities  that have  interests in  special-purpose  entities for periods  ending
after  December  15,  2003.  Application  by public  entities,  other than small
business  issuers,  for  all  other  types  of  VlEs is  required  in  financial
statements for periods ending after March I5, 2004.  Small business issuers must
apply  this  interpretation  to all other  types of VlEs at the end of the first
reporting   period  ending  after  December  15,  2004.  The  adoption  of  this
Interpretation  has not had and is not expected to have a material effect on our
financial position or results of operations.

Accounting  for  Certain  Financial  Instruments  with  Characteristics  of both
Liabilities and Equity

      In May  2003,  the FASB  issued  SFAS No.  150,  "Accounting  for  Certain
Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity" (SFAS
No. 150). This Statement  established standards for how a company classifies and
measures certain financial  instruments with characteristics of both liabilities
and  equity  as well as  their  classification  in the  company's  statement  of
financial position. It requires that the company classify a financial instrument
that is  within  its  scope as a  liability  when that  instrument  embodies  an
obligation of the issuer.  SFAS No. 150 did not have any impact on the Company's
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

      On April 30, 2003,  the FASB issued SFAS No. 149,  "Amendment of Statement
133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS No. 149"). SFAS No.
149  amends and  clarifies  accounting  for  derivative  instruments,  including
certain  derivative  instruments  embedded in other  contracts,  and for hedging
activities  under SFAS No.  133.  With a number of  exceptions,  SFAS No. 149 is
effective  for  contracts  entered  into or modified  after June 30,  2003.  The
adoption  of SFAS  No.  149 did not  have a  material  impact  on the  Company's
consolidated financial statements.

Guarantor's  Accounting and Disclosure  Requirements  for Guarantees,  Including
Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others

      In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantor's
Accounting  and  Disclosure  Requirements  for  Guarantees,  Including  Indirect
Guarantees of  Indebtedness  of Others" ("FIN 45").  FIN 45 requires a guarantor
entity, at the inception of a guarantee covered by the measurement provisions of
the  interpretation,  to record a liability for the fair value of the obligation
undertaken  in  issuing  the  guarantee.  In  addition,  FIN  45  elaborates  on
previously existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees,  including loan
guarantees  such as  standby  letters  of  credit.  The  Company  does  not have
financial letters of credit as of December 31, 2004.

ITEM 7A. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF MARKET RISK
-------------------------------------------------------------

Management of Market Risk
-------------------------

      General.  The  majority  of our assets and  liabilities  are  monetary  in
nature.  Consequently,  one of our  most  significant  forms of  market  risk is
interest rate risk. Our assets,  consisting  primarily of mortgage  loans,  have
longer maturities than our liabilities,  consisting primarily of deposits.  As a
result,  a principal  part of our business  strategy is to manage  interest rate
risk and reduce the  exposure  of our net  interest  income to changes in market
interest  rates.  Accordingly,   our  Board  of  Directors  has  established  an
Asset/Liability  Committee which is responsible for evaluating the interest rate
risk inherent in our assets and  liabilities,  for determining the level of risk
that is appropriate given our business strategy, operating environment, capital,
liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with
the guidelines  approved by the Board of Directors.  Senior management  monitors
the  level of  interest  rate risk on a  regular  basis and the  Asset/Liability
Committee,  which consists of senior management and outside


                                       42
<PAGE>

directors  operating under a policy adopted by the Board of Directors,  meets as
needed to review our asset/liability policies and interest rate risk position.

      The following  table  presents the Company's net portfolio  value ("NPV").
These  calculations  were based upon  assumptions  believed to be  fundamentally
sound,  although  they may vary from  assumptions  utilized  by other  financial
institutions. The information set forth below is based on data that included all
financial instruments as of December 31, 2004. Assumptions have been made by the
Company  relating  to  interest  rates,  loan  prepayment  rates,  core  deposit
duration,  and the market  values of certain  assets and  liabilities  under the
various interest rate scenarios.  Actual maturity dates were used for fixed rate
loans and certificate  accounts.  Investment securities were scheduled at either
the  maturity  date or the next  scheduled  call date  based  upon  management's
judgment  of whether  the  particular  security  would be called in the  current
interest rate  environment and under assumed  interest rate scenarios.  Variable
rate loans were  scheduled as of their next  scheduled  interest rate  repricing
date.  Additional  assumptions  made in the preparation of the NPV table include
prepayment rates on loans and mortgage-backed  securities, core deposits without
stated  maturity  dates were  scheduled  with an assumed term of 48 months,  and
money market and  noninterest  bearing  accounts were  scheduled with an assumed
term of 24  months.  The NPV at "PAR"  represents  the  difference  between  the
Company's estimated value of assets and estimated value of liabilities  assuming
no change in interest rates.  The NPV for a decrease of 200 and 300 basis points
has been  excluded  since it  would  not be  meaningful,  in the  interest  rate
environment  as of December 31, 2004. The following sets forth the Company's NPV
as of December 31, 2004.

</TABLE>

      ----------
      bp-basis points

      The table above indicates that at December 31, 2004, in the event of a 100
basis point decrease in interest rates, we would  experience a 1.60% decrease in
NPV. In the event of a 100 basis point  increase  in  interest  rates,  we would
experience a 12.08% decrease in NPV.

      Certain  shortcomings  are inherent in the  methodology  used in the above
interest rate risk  measurement.  Modeling changes in NPV require making certain
assumptions  that may or may not reflect the manner in which  actual  yields and
costs respond to changes in market interest rates. In this regard, the NPV table
presented  assumes that the  composition  of our  interest-sensitive  assets and
liabilities  existing at the  beginning of a period  remains  constant  over the
period being measured and assumes that a particular  change in interest rates is
reflected  uniformly  across  the yield  curve  regardless  of the  duration  or
repricing  of specific  assets and  liabilities.  Accordingly,  although the NPV
table  provides an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular
point in time,  such  measurements  are not  intended  to and do not  provide  a
precise  forecast of the effect of changes in market  interest  rates on our net
interest income, and will differ from actual results.
