ITEM 1. BUSINESS BCB
---------------------

Bancorp, Inc.
-------------

      BCB Bancorp,  Inc. (the "Company") is a New Jersey  corporation,  which on
May 1,  2003  became  the  holding  company  parent of BCB  Community  Bank (the
"Bank").  The Company has not engaged in any significant business activity other
than owning all of the  outstanding  common  stock of BCB  Community  Bank.  Our
executive office is located at 104-110 Avenue C, Bayonne,  New Jersey 07002. Our
telephone  number is (201) 823-0700.  At December 31, 2008 we had $578.6 million
in  consolidated  assets,  $410.5  million  in  deposits  and $49.7  million  in
consolidated   stockholders'   equity.  The  Company  is  subject  to  extensive
regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

BCB Community Bank
------------------

      BCB  Community  Bank,  formerly  known  as  Bayonne  Community  Bank,  was
chartered as a New Jersey bank on October 27,  2000,  and we opened for business
on November  1, 2000.  We changed our name from  Bayonne  Community  Bank to BCB
Community  Bank in April of 2007. We operate  through three  branches in Bayonne
and  Hoboken,  New Jersey and through our  executive  office  located at 104-110
Avenue C,  Bayonne,  New Jersey 07002.  Our deposit  accounts are insured by the
Federal  Deposit  Insurance  Corporation and we are a member of the Federal Home
Loan Bank System.

      We are a  community-oriented  financial  institution.  Our  business is to
offer FDIC-insured deposit products and to invest funds held in deposit accounts
at the Bank,  together  with funds  generated  from  operations,  in  investment
securities and loans. We offer our customers:

            o     loans,  including  commercial  and  multi-family  real  estate
                  loans, one- to four-family  mortgage loans, home equity loans,
                  construction  loans,  consumer loans and  commercial  business
                  loans.  In  recent  years  the  primary  growth  in  our  loan
                  portfolio has been in loans secured by commercial  real estate
                  and multi-family properties;

            o     FDIC-insured  deposit  products,  including  savings  and club
                  accounts,   non-interest   bearing   accounts,   money  market
                  accounts,  certificates  of deposit and individual  retirement
                  accounts; and

            o     retail  and  commercial   banking   services   including  wire
                  transfers,  money  orders,  traveler's  checks,  safe  deposit
                  boxes, a night depository,  federal payroll tax deposits, bond
                  coupon redemption and automated teller services.

Business Strategy
-----------------

      Our business strategy is to operate as a well-capitalized,  profitable and
independent  community-oriented  financial  institution  dedicated  to providing
quality customer  service.  Managements'  and the Board of Directors'  extensive
knowledge of the Hudson County market  differentiates  us from our  competitors.
Our  business  strategy  incorporates  the  following  elements:  maintaining  a
community focus, focusing on profitability, continuing our growth,

<PAGE>

concentrating  on real estate based lending,  capitalizing  on market  dynamics,
providing attentive and personalized service and attracting highly qualified and
experienced personnel.

      Maintaining a community  focus. Our management and Board of Directors have
strong ties to the Bayonne  community.  Many members of the management  team are
Bayonne  natives  and are  active  in the  community  through  non-profit  board
membership, local business development organizations, and industry associations.
In addition,  our board members are well established  professionals and business
people in the Bayonne area.  Management and the Board are interested in making a
lasting  contribution to the Bayonne  community and have succeeded in attracting
deposits and loans through attentive and personalized service.

      Focusing  on   profitability.   On  an  operational   basis,  we  achieved
profitability  in our tenth month of operation.  For the year ended December 31,
2008,  our return on average  equity was 7.00% and our return on average  assets
was 0.60%.  Our earnings  per diluted  share  decreased  from $0.93 for the year
ended December 31, 2004 to $0.74 for the year ended December 31, 2008.  Although
earnings per share  results have come under  pressure  recently,  primarily as a
result of the pervasive economic downturn in both the national and local economy
as well as several  one-time  events,  management  is committed  to  maintaining
profitability by diversifying the products, pricing and services we offer.

      Continuing our growth.  We have  consistently  increased our assets.  From
December 31, 2004 to December 31, 2008,  our assets have  increased  from $378.3
million to $578.6  million.  Over the same time period,  our loan  balances have
increased from $246.4 million to $406.8  million,  while deposits have increased
from $337.2 million to $410.5 million. In addition, we have maintained our asset
quality  ratios while  growing the loan  portfolio.  At December  31, 2008,  our
non-performing assets to total assets ratio was 0.89%.

      Concentrating  on  real  estate-based  lending.  A  primary  focus  of our
business  strategy is to originate loans secured by commercial and  multi-family
properties.  Such loans  provide  higher  returns than loans  secured by one- to
four-family real estate.  As a result of our underwriting  practices,  including
debt service  requirements  for commercial real estate and  multi-family  loans,
management  believes  that such loans offer us an  opportunity  to obtain higher
returns.

      Capitalizing on market dynamics. The consolidation of the banking industry
in  Hudson  County  has  created  the  need  for  a  customer   focused  banking
institution.  This  consolidation  has moved  decision  making  away from local,
community-based banks to much larger banks headquartered outside of New Jersey.

      Providing  attentive and personalized  service.  Management  believes that
providing  attentive and personalized  service is the key to gaining deposit and
loan  relationships in Bayonne and its surrounding  communities.  Since we began
operations, our branches have been open seven (7) days a week.

      Attracting highly experienced and qualified  personnel.  An important part
of our  strategy  is to hire  bankers  who have prior  experience  in the Hudson
County market as well as  pre-existing  business  relationships.  Our management
team has an average of 30 years of banking  experience,  while our  lenders  and
branch  personnel  have  significant  prior  experience  at community  banks and
regional banks in Hudson County.  Management  believes that its knowledge of the
Hudson County market has been a critical element in the success of BCB Community
Bank.

                                        2

<PAGE>

Management's  extensive  knowledge  of the local  communities  has allowed us to
develop and implement a highly focused and  disciplined  approach to lending and
has enabled the Bank to attract a high percentage of low cost deposits.

Recent Market Developments

      In response  to the  financial  crises  affecting  the banking  system and
financial  markets  and going  concern  threats  to  investment  banks and other
financial institutions, on October 3, 2008, the Emergency Economic Stabilization
Act of 2008  (the  "EESA")  was  signed  into  law.  Under  the  EESA,  the U.S.
Department  of the Treasury  was given the  authority  to,  among other  things,
purchase  up  to  $700  billion  of  securities  and  certain  other   financial
instruments  from  financial  institutions  for the purpose of  stabilizing  and
providing liquidity to the U.S. financial markets.

      On October 14, 2008, the Treasury Department  announced a Capital Purchase
Program  under which it would  acquire  equity  investments,  usually  preferred
stock, in banks and thrifts and their holding companies. In conjunction with the
purchase of preferred stock, the Treasury  Department also received  warrants to
purchase common stock from participating financial  institutions.  Participating
financial  institutions  also were  required to adopt the Treasury  Department's
standards for executive  compensation  and corporate  governance  for the period
during  which the  department  holds equity  issued  under the Capital  Purchase
Program.  We have  determined  that we  would  not  participate  in the  Capital
Purchase Program.

      On  November  21,  2008,  the FDIC  adopted  a final  rule  relating  to a
Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program,  which the FDIC had previously  announced
as an initiative  to counter the  system-wide  crisis in the nation's  financial
sector.  Under  the  Temporary  Liquidity  Guarantee  Program  the FDIC will (i)
guarantee,  through  the earlier of maturity  or June 30,  2012,  certain  newly
issued senior  unsecured debt issued by  participating  institutions on or after
October 14,  2008,  and before June 30, 2009 and (ii)  provide full FDIC deposit
insurance  coverage  for  non-interest  bearing  transaction  deposit  accounts,
Negotiable  Order of Withdrawal  ("NOW") accounts paying less than 0.5% interest
per  annum  and  certain  other  accounts  held  at  participating  FDIC-insured
institutions  through December 31, 2009.  Coverage under the Temporary Liquidity
Guarantee  Program was available for the first 30 days without  charge.  The fee
assessment for coverage of senior  unsecured debt ranges from 50 basis points to
100 basis points per annum,  depending on the initial  maturity of the debt. The
fee assessment for deposit insurance  coverage is 10 basis points per quarter on
amounts in covered accounts exceeding  $250,000.  We have elected to participate
in the deposit insurance program.

      The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 ("ARRA"), more commonly
known as the economic stimulus or economic recovery package, was signed into law
on February  17,  2009,  by  President  Obama.  ARRA  includes a wide variety of
programs   intended  to  stimulate   the  economy  and  provide  for   extensive
infrastructure,  energy, health, and education needs. In addition,  ARRA imposes
certain new  executive  compensation  and  corporate  expenditure  limits on all
current and future TARP recipients  until the recipient has repaid the Treasury,
which is now permitted  under ARRA without penalty and without the need to raise
new  capital,  subject  to the  Treasury's  consultation  with  the  recipient's
appropriate regulatory agency.

      For further information regarding regulatory and legislative  developments
affecting our business see "Supervision and Regulation".

Our Market Area
---------------

      We are  located in the City of Bayonne and  Hoboken,  Hudson  County,  New
Jersey.  The Bank's  locations  are  easily  accessible  to  provide  convenient
services to businesses and individuals throughout our market area.

      Our market area includes the City of Bayonne,  Jersey City and portions of
Hoboken,  New Jersey.  These areas are all  considered  "bedroom" or  "commuter"
communities  to  Manhattan.  Our  market  area is  well-served  by a network  of
arterial roadways including Route 440 and the New Jersey Turnpike.

      Our  market  area  has a  high  level  of  commercial  business  activity.
Businesses are concentrated in the service sector and retail trade areas.  Major
employers  in our market area  include  Bayonne  Medical  Center and the Bayonne
Board of Education.

Competition
-----------

      The banking  business in New Jersey is extremely  competitive.  We compete
for  deposits  and loans with  existing  New Jersey and  out-of-state  financial
institutions that have longer operating  histories,  larger capital reserves and
more  established  customer  bases.  Our  competition  includes large  financial
service  companies  and  other  entities  in  addition  to  traditional  banking
institutions such as savings and loan  associations,  savings banks,  commercial
banks and credit unions.

      Our larger  competitors  have a greater  ability  to finance  wide-ranging
advertising  campaigns  through their greater capital  resources.  Our marketing
efforts depend heavily upon  referrals from officers,  directors,  stockholders,
selective  advertising in local media and direct mail solicitations.  We compete
for business principally on the basis of personal service to customers, customer
access to our officers and directors and competitive interest rates and fees.

      In the  financial  services  industry  in  recent  years,  intense  market
demands, technological and regulatory changes and economic pressures have eroded
industry  classifications that were once clearly defined. Banks have diversified
their services,  increased rates paid on deposits and become more cost effective
as a result of  competition  with one  another  and with new types of  financial
service companies,  including  non-banking  competitors.  Some of the results of
these market dynamics in the financial  services  industry have been a number of
new bank and non-bank  competitors,  increased  merger  activity,  and increased
customer awareness of product and service differences among competitors.

The Bank has  strengthened  certain loan  underwriting  criteria in an effort to
more  prudently  make  loan  facility   determinations  and  mitigate  increased
potential loan loss provisions prospectively.

      Commercial  and  Multi-family   Real  Estate  Loans.  Our  commercial  and
multi-family  real  estate  loans are  secured by  commercial  real  estate (for
example,  shopping centers, medical buildings,  retail offices) and multi-family
residential  units,  consisting  of five  or  more  units.  Permanent  loans  on
commercial and multi-family properties are generally originated in amounts up to
75% of the appraised value of the property. Our commercial real estate loans are
secured  by  improved  property  such  as  office   buildings,   retail  stores,
warehouses, church buildings and other non-residential buildings. Commercial and
multi-family real estate loans are generally made at rates that adjust above the
five year U.S.  Treasury  interest  rate,  with terms of up to 25 years,  or are
balloon loans with fixed interest rates which generally  mature in three to five
years with principal  amortization  for a period of up to 30 years.  Our largest
commercial  loan had a principal  balance of $2.4  million at December 31, 2008,
and was  secured  by a  mixed  use  property  comprised  of  retail  and  office
facilities.  Our  largest  multi-family  loan had a  principal  balance  of $4.4
million at December 31, 2008.  Both loans were  performing  in  accordance  with
their terms on that date.

      Loans secured by  commercial  and  multi-family  real estate are generally
larger and involve a greater degree of risk than one- to four-family residential
mortgage  loans.  The borrower's  creditworthiness  and the feasibility and cash
flow  potential  of  the  project  is  of  primary  concern  in  commercial  and
multi-family  real  estate  lending.  Loans  secured  by income  properties  are
generally  larger and involve  greater  risks than  residential  mortgage  loans
because  payments on loans secured by income  properties are often  dependent on
the successful operation or management of the properties. As a result, repayment
of such loans may be subject to a greater  extent than  residential  real estate
loans to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy.  We intend
to continue  emphasizing  the  origination  of loans secured by commercial  real
estate and multi-family properties.

      One- to Four-Family Lending. Our one- to four-family  residential mortgage
loans are secured by property  located in the State of New Jersey.  We generally
originate one- to four-family residential mortgage loans in amounts up to 80% of
the lesser of the appraised  value or selling  price of the  mortgaged  property
without requiring mortgage insurance. We will originate loans with loan to value
ratios up to 90% provided the borrowers  obtain private mortgage  insurance.  We
originate both fixed rate and adjustable rate loans.  One- to four-family  loans
may have terms of up to 30 years.  The majority of one- to four-family  loans we
originate for retention in our portfolio have terms no greater than 15 years. We
offer  adjustable  rate loans with fixed rate periods of up to five years,  with
principal and interest calculated using a maximum 30-year  amortization  period.
We offer these  loans with a fixed rate for the first five years with  repricing
following every year after the initial period.  Adjustable rate loans may adjust
up to 200 basis points  annually and 600 basis points over the term of the loan.
We also broker for a third party lender one- to four-family  residential  loans,
which are primarily fixed rate loans with terms of 30 years.  Our loan brokerage
activities  permit us to offer customers  longer-term  fixed rate loans we would
not otherwise originate while providing a source of fee income.  During 2008, we
brokered  $6.6  million in one- to  four-family  loans and  recognized  gains of
$137,000 from the sale of such loans.

      All of our one- to  four-family  mortgages  include "due on sale" clauses,
which are provisions  giving us the right to declare a loan immediately  payable
if the borrower  sells or  otherwise  transfers an interest in the property to a
third party.

      Property appraisals on real estate securing our single-family  residential
loans are made by state certified and licensed  independent  appraisers approved
by  our  Board  of  Directors.  Appraisals  are  performed  in  accordance  with
applicable  regulations and policies. At our discretion,  we obtain either title
insurance  policies or attorneys'  certificates  of title on all first  mortgage
real estate loans originated. We also require fire and casualty insurance on all
properties  securing our one- to four-family loans. We also require the borrower
to obtain flood insurance where appropriate.  In some instances, we charge a fee
equal to a percentage of the loan amount commonly referred to as points.

      Construction  Loans. We offer loans to finance the construction of various
types of commercial and  residential  property.  We originated  $15.6 million of
such loans  during the year  ended  December  31,  2008.  Construction  loans to
builders  generally are offered with terms of up to eighteen months and interest
rates are tied to the prime rate plus a margin. These loans

                                        7

<PAGE>

generally are offered as adjustable  rate loans.  We will originate  residential
construction loans for individual borrowers and builders, provided all necessary
plans and permits are in order.  Construction  loan funds are  disbursed  as the
project progresses. At December 31, 2008, our largest construction loan was $5.0
million,  of which $3.0 million was disbursed.  This  construction loan has been
made for the construction of residential properties.  At December 31, 2008, this
loan was performing in accordance with its terms.

      Construction  financing is generally considered to involve a higher degree
of risk of loss than long-term financing on improved, occupied real estate. Risk
of loss on a  construction  loan is  dependent  largely upon the accuracy of the
initial  estimate of the  property's  value at  completion of  construction  and
development and the estimated cost (including interest) of construction.  During
the  construction  phase,  a number of factors  could  result in delays and cost
overruns. If the estimate of construction costs proves to be inaccurate,  we may
be required to advance  funds beyond the amount  originally  committed to permit
completion of the project.  Additionally,  if the estimate of value proves to be
inaccurate,  we may be confronted, at or prior to the maturity of the loan, with
a project having a value which is insufficient to assure full repayment.

      Home Equity  Loans and Home Equity  Lines of Credit.  We offer home equity
loans and lines of credit that are secured by the borrower's  primary residence.
Our home equity loans can be  structured  as loans that are disbursed in full at
closing or as lines of credit. Home equity loans and lines of credit are offered
with terms up to 15 years. Virtually all of our home equity loans are originated
with fixed rates of interest and home equity lines of credit are originated with
adjustable interest rates tied to the prime rate. Home equity loans and lines of
credit are  underwritten  under the same criteria that we use to underwrite one-
to four-family  loans. Home equity loans and lines of credit may be underwritten
with a  loan-to-value  ratio of 80% when combined with the principal  balance of
the existing  mortgage  loan. At the time we close a home equity loan or line of
credit,  we file a mortgage to perfect our security  interest in the  underlying
collateral.  At December 31, 2008, the outstanding balances of home equity loans
and lines of credit totaled $38.1 million, or 9.22% of our loan portfolio.

      Commercial  Business Loans. Our commercial business loans are underwritten
on the basis of the  borrower's  ability to service such debt from  income.  Our
underwriting  standards for  commercial  business  loans include a review of the
applicant's tax returns, financial statements,  credit history and an assessment
of the  applicant's  ability to meet  existing  obligations  and payments on the
proposed  loan  based  on  cash  flow  generated  by the  applicant's  business.
Commercial  business loans are generally  made to small and mid-sized  companies
located within the State of New Jersey. In most cases, we require  collateral of
equipment, accounts receivable, inventory, chattel or other assets before making
a commercial business loan. Our largest commercial business loan at December 31,
2008 had a  principal  balance of $2.7  million  and was  secured by  marketable
equity securities.  We have also received personal guarantees from the borrower,
principals  of the borrower  and a director of BCB Bancorp,  Inc. As of December
31, 2008, this loan was performing according to its terms. The Bank continues to
monitor the value of the underlying collateral of this loan on a regular basis.

      Commercial  business  loans  generally have higher rates and shorter terms
than one- to  four-family  residential  loans,  but they may also involve higher
average balances and a higher

                                        8

<PAGE>

risk of default  since  their  repayment  generally  depends  on the  successful
operation of the borrower's business.

      Consumer  Loans.  We make various types of secured and unsecured  consumer
loans and loans that are  collateralized by new and used  automobiles.  Consumer
loans generally have terms of three years to ten years.

      Consumer  loans are  advantageous  to us  because of their  interest  rate
sensitivity,  but they also involve more credit risk than  residential  mortgage
loans because of the higher potential for default,  the nature of the collateral
and the difficulty in disposing of the collateral.

      The  following  table  shows  our  loan  origination,  purchase,  sale and
repayment activities for the periods indicated.

      Loan Approval  Authority and  Underwriting.  We establish  various lending
limits for executive  management  and also maintain a loan  committee.  The loan
committee is comprised of the Chairman of the Board,  the President,  the Senior
Lending  Officer and five  non-employee

                                        9

<PAGE>

members of the Board of Directors.  The President or the Senior Lending Officer,
together with one other loan officer, have authority to approve applications for
real  estate  loans up to  $500,000,  other  secured  loans up to  $500,000  and
unsecured loans up to $25,000.  The loan committee considers all applications in
excess of the above  lending  limits and the entire board of directors  ratifies
all such loans.

      Upon receipt of a completed loan application from a prospective  borrower,
a credit report is ordered. Income and certain other information is verified. If
necessary,  additional financial  information may be requested.  An appraisal is
required for the  underwriting of all one- to four-family  loans. We may rely on
an estimate of value of real estate  performed by our Senior Lending Officer for
home equity loans or lines of credit of up to $250,000. Appraisals are processed
by state certified independent appraisers approved by the Board of Directors.

      An  attorney's  certificate  of title is required on all newly  originated
real estate mortgage loans. In connection with refinancing and home equity loans
or lines of credit in amounts up to  $250,000,  we will obtain a record  owner's
search in lieu of an attorney's certificate of title. Borrowers also must obtain
fire and casualty  insurance.  Flood insurance is also required on loans secured
by property that is located in a flood zone.

      Loan Commitments.  Written commitments are given to prospective  borrowers
on all approved real estate loans.  Generally, we honor commitments for up to 60
days from the date of  issuance.  At December  31, 2008,  our  outstanding  loan
origination commitments totaled $5.7 million,  outstanding construction loans in
progress  totaled $25.7 million and  undisbursed  lines of credit  totaled $14.8
million.

      Loan Delinquencies. We send a notice of nonpayment to borrowers when their
loan  becomes 15 days past due. If such payment is not received by month end, an
additional  notice of  nonpayment  is sent to the  borrower.  After 60 days,  if
payment is still  delinquent,  a notice of right to cure  default is sent to the
borrower giving 30 additional days to bring the loan current before  foreclosure
is commenced.  If the loan continues in a delinquent status for 90 days past due
and no repayment plan is in effect,  foreclosure  proceedings will be initiated.
In an effort to more closely  monitor the  performance of our loan portfolio and
asset quality,  the Bank has created  various  concentration  of credit reports,
specifically  as it relates  to our  construction  and  commercial  real  estate
portfolios.  These reports  stress test declining  values in the  aforementioned
portfolios up to and including a 25% value deprecation to the original appraised
value to ascertain our potential exposure.

      Loans are reviewed and are placed on a non-accrual  status and the accrual
of interest is  discontinued  when the loan becomes more than 90 days delinquent
or when, in our opinion,  the  collection  of  additional  interest is doubtful.
Subsequent  interest  payments,  if any, are either  applied to the  outstanding
principal balance or recorded as interest income, depending on the assessment of
the ultimate  collectability  of the loan.  At December  31,  2008,  we had $3.7
million in non-accruing  loans. Our largest exposure of non-performing  loans at
that date  consisted of three loans,  with one  specific  borrower  with a total
principal  balance of $2.0 million,  collateralized  by several  parcels of real
estate whose total  appraised  value was  approximately  $3.2 million as of that
date.  Another  loan  relationship  consisting  of three loans with one specific
borrower and a total balance of $1.1 million is also in non-accrual status. This
borrower  is in

                                       10

foreclosure  and there is the prospect,  upon  conveyance and disposition of the
properties,  that  the  Bank may  incur a loss as the  value  of the  properties
secured as collateral for these loans have depreciated in value.

      A loan is  considered  impaired  when it is probable the borrower will not
repay  the  loan  according  to the  original  contractual  terms  of  the  loan
agreement.  We have  determined that first mortgage loans on one- to four-family
properties  and all consumer  loans  represent  large groups of  smaller-balance
homogeneous loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment.  Additionally,
we have  determined  that an  insignificant  delay  (less than 90 days) will not
cause a loan to be  classified  as impaired and a loan is not impaired  during a
period of delay in payment,  if we expect to collect  all amounts due  including
interest  accrued at the  contractual  interest rate for the period of delay. We
independently  evaluate all loans  identified  as impaired.  We estimate  credit
losses on impaired  loans based on the present  value of expected  cash flows or
the fair value of the  underlying  collateral  if the loan  repayment is derived
from the sale or operation of such  collateral.  Impaired  loans, or portions of
such loans, are charged off when we determine that a realized loss has occurred.
Until such time,  an  allowance  for loan  losses is  maintained  for  estimated
losses.  Cash receipts on impaired  loans are applied first to accrued  interest
receivable unless otherwise required by the loan terms,  except when an impaired
loan is also a  nonaccrual  loan,  in which  case the  portion  of the  receipts
related to interest is recognized  as income.  At December 31, 2008, we had nine
loans  totaling $3.7 million which are  classified as impaired and on which loan
loss allowances  totaling $881,000 have been established.  During 2008, interest
income of $138,000 was recognized on impaired loans.

      The following table sets forth  delinquencies  in our loan portfolio as of
the dates indicated:

      The table below sets forth the amounts and  categories  of  non-performing
assets in the Bank's loan portfolio. Loans are placed on non-accrual status when
the  collection of principal  and/or  interest  become  doubtful.  For all years
presented,  BCB Community  Bank has had no troubled debt  restructurings  (which
involve  forgiving  a portion of interest  or  principal  on any loans or making
loans at a rate  materially less than that of market rates).  Foreclosed  assets
include assets acquired in settlement of loans.

      For the year ended December 31, 2008,  gross  interest  income which would
have been recorded had our  non-accruing  loans been current in accordance  with
their original terms amounted to $289,000.  We received and recorded $138,000 in
interest income for such loans for the year ended December 31, 2008.

      Classified  Assets.  Our policies provide for a classification  system for
problem assets. Under this classification  system, problem assets are classified
as  "substandard,"   "doubtful,"  "loss"  or  "special  mention."  An  asset  is
considered  substandard if it is inadequately protected by its current net worth
and paying  capacity  of the  borrower  or of the  collateral  pledged,  if any.
Substandard  assets include those  characterized  by the "distinct  possibility"
that "some loss" will be sustained if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets
classified  as doubtful  have all the  weaknesses  inherent in those  classified
substandard  with the  added  characteristic  that the  weakness  present  makes
"collection or liquidation  in full" on the basis of currently  existing  facts,
conditions,  and values, "highly questionable and improbable." Assets classified
as loss are those considered "uncollectible" and of such little value that their
continuance  as assets without the  establishment  of a specific loss reserve is
not warranted,  and the loan is  charged-off.  Assets may be designated  special
mention  because  of  potential   weaknesses  that  do  not  currently   warrant
classification in one of the aforementioned categories.

                                       13

<PAGE>

      When we classify problem assets, we may establish  general  allowances for
loan  losses in an amount  deemed  prudent  by  management.  General  allowances
represent loss allowances  which have been established to recognize the inherent
risk associated with lending activities,  but which, unlike specific allowances,
have not been allocated to particular  problem assets. A portion of general loss
allowances  established to cover possible losses related to assets classified as
substandard or doubtful may be included in determining  our regulatory  capital.
Specific  valuation  allowances  for loan  losses  generally  do not  qualify as
regulatory capital. At December 31, 2008, we had $12,000 in assets classified as
doubtful,  $3.4 million in assets  classified as substandard,  all of which were
also  classified  as impaired and $3.0 million in assets  classified  as special
mention,  of which $341,000 was classified as impaired.  The loans classified as
substandard  represent primarily  commercial loans secured either by residential
real estate, commercial real estate or heavy equipment.

      Allowances  for Loan  Losses.  A  provision  for loan losses is charged to
operations  based on management's  evaluation of the losses that may be incurred
in our loan portfolio. The evaluation,  including a review of all loans on which
full  collectability  of interest and principal  may not be reasonably  assured,
considers:  (1) the risk  characteristics  of the loan  portfolio;  (2)  current
economic conditions; (3) actual losses previously experienced;  (4) the level of
loan  growth;  and (5) the  existing  level of reserves for loan losses that are
possible and estimable.

      We  monitor  our  allowance  for loan  losses  and make  additions  to the
allowance as economic conditions dictate. Although we maintain our allowance for
loan losses at a level that we consider  adequate for the inherent  risk of loss
in our  loan  portfolio,  future  losses  could  exceed  estimated  amounts  and
additional  provisions  for loan losses  could be  required.  In  addition,  our
determination  of the  amount of the  allowance  for loan  losses is  subject to
review by the New Jersey  Department  of Banking and  Insurance and the FDIC, as
part of their examination process.  After a review of the information available,
our regulators might require the establishment of an additional  allowance.  Any
increase in the loan loss allowance required by regulators would have a negative
impact on our earnings.

Investment Activities
---------------------

     Investment  Securities.  We  are  required  under  federal  regulations  to
maintain a minimum  amount of liquid  assets that may be  invested in  specified
short-term securities and certain other investments.  The level of liquid assets
varies depending upon several factors,  including:  (i) the yields on investment
alternatives,  (ii) our  judgment  as to the  attractiveness  of the yields then
available in relation to other opportunities,  (iii) expectation of future yield
levels,  and (iv) our  projections as to the  short-term  demand for funds to be
used in loan origination and other activities.  Investment securities, including
mortgage-backed  securities,  are classified at the time of purchase, based upon
management's  intentions  and  abilities,  as  securities   held-to-maturity  or
securities  available  for sale.  Debt  securities  acquired with the intent and
ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and are stated at
cost and adjusted for  amortization of premium and accretion of discount,  which
are  computed  using the level yield method and  recognized  as  adjustments  of
interest  income.  All  other  debt and  equity  securities  are  classified  as
available for sale to serve  principally as a source of liquidity.  During 2008,
the Bank  recorded  an other than  temporary  impairment  (OTTI)  charge of $2.9
million on a $3.0 million  investment in Federal National  Mortgage  Association
(FNMA) preferred stock. This OTTI charge resulted from a significant  decline in
the market value of these  securities  following the announcement by the Federal
Housing  Finance  Agency  (FHFA)  that FNMA would be placed in  conservatorship.
Additionally,  the FHFA  eliminated  the  payment  of  dividends  on common  and
preferred  stock and  assumed  the powers of the Board and  management  of FNMA.
Based on these  factors,  the Company  evaluated  the  impairment  as other than
temporary.

     Current   regulatory  and  accounting   guidelines   regarding   investment
securities require us to categorize  securities as  held-to-maturity,  available
for  sale or  trading.  As of  December  31,  2008,  we had  $141.3  million  of
securities classified as held-to-maturity,  $888,000 in securities classified as
available  for  sale,  and  no  securities  classified  as  trading.  Securities
classified as available for sale are reported for financial  reporting  purposes
at the fair  value with net  changes  in the fair  value  from  period to period
included as a separate  component of stockholders'  equity, net of income taxes.
At December 31, 2008, our securities  classified as held-to-maturity  had a fair
value of $141.1 million.  Changes in the fair value of securities  classified as
held-to-maturity do not affect our income. Management has the intent and we have
the ability to hold securities  classified as held-to-maturity.  During the year
ended December 31, 2008, we had no securities sales.

     At  December  31,  2008,  our  investment  policy  allowed  investments  in
instruments such as: (i) U.S. Treasury obligations;  (ii) U.S. federal agency or
federally sponsored agency obligations;  (iii) mortgage-backed  securities;  and
(iv)  certificates of deposit.  The Board of Directors may authorize  additional
investments. At December 31, 2008, our U.S. Government agency securities totaled
$98.6  million,  all of which  were  classified  as  held-to-maturity  and which
primarily  consisted  of  callable  securities  issued by  government  sponsored
enterprises.

     As a source of liquidity and to supplement our lending activities,  we have
invested in residential mortgage-backed  securities.  Mortgage-backed securities
generally yield less than the loans that underlie such securities because of the
cost of payment  guarantees  or credit  enhancements  that reduce  credit  risk.
Mortgage-backed  securities can serve as collateral for borrowings and,  through
repayments, as a source of liquidity. Mortgage-backed securities

                                       17

<PAGE>

represent a participation  interest in a pool of  single-family or other type of
mortgages.  Principal  and  interest  payments  are  passed  from  the  mortgage
originators, through intermediaries (generally government-sponsored enterprises)
that pool and repackage the  participation  interests in the form of securities,
to  investors,  like us.  The  government-sponsored  enterprises  guarantee  the
payment of principal and interest to investors and include  Freddie Mac,  Ginnie
Mae, and Fannie Mae.

     Mortgage-backed  securities  typically  are issued  with  stated  principal
amounts. The securities are backed by pools of mortgage loans that have interest
rates that are within a set range and have varying  maturities.  The  underlying
pool of  mortgages  can be  composed  of either  fixed rate or  adjustable  rate
mortgage loans. Mortgage-backed securities are generally referred to as mortgage
participation certificates or pass-through certificates.  The interest rate risk
characteristics  of the  underlying  pool  of  mortgages  (i.e.,  fixed  rate or
adjustable  rate) and the  prepayment  risk,  are  passed on to the  certificate
holder. The life of a mortgage-backed pass-through security is equal to the life
of the underlying  mortgages.  Expected  maturities will differ from contractual
maturities due to scheduled  repayments and because borrowers may have the right
to call or prepay obligations with or without prepayment penalties.

our securities portfolio and Federal funds at the dates indicated.

Sources of Funds
----------------

      Our  major  external  source  of funds for  lending  and other  investment
purposes  are  deposits.  Funds are also derived from the receipt of payments on
loans,   prepayment  of  loans,   maturities  of   investment   securities   and
mortgage-backed  securities and borrowings.  Scheduled loan principal repayments
are a relatively stable source of funds,  while deposit inflows and outflows and
loan  prepayments  are  significantly  influenced by general  interest rates and
market conditions.

      Deposits.  Consumer and commercial deposits are attracted principally from
within our primary  market area  through the  offering of a selection of deposit
instruments  including  demand,  NOW,  savings and club  accounts,  money market
accounts, and term certificate accounts. Deposit account terms vary according to
the minimum balance required,  the time period the funds must remain on deposit,
and the interest rate.

      The interest  rates paid by us on deposits are set at the direction of our
senior  management.  Interest  rates  are  determined  based  on  our  liquidity
requirements,  interest  rates paid by our  competitors,  our growth goals,  and
applicable  regulatory  restrictions and requirements.  At December 31, 2008, we
had no brokered deposits.

      Deposit  Accounts.  The  following  table sets forth the dollar  amount of
deposits  in the  various  types of deposit  programs we offered as of the dates
indicated.

      Borrowings. Our advances from the FHLB of New York are secured by a pledge
of our stock in the FHLB of New York and investment securities. Each FHLB credit
program has its own interest rate,  which may be fixed or adjustable,  and range
of maturities.  If the need arises,  we may also access the Federal Reserve Bank
discount  window to supplement  our supply of funds that we can loan and to meet
deposit  withdrawal  requirements.  During the year ended  December  31, 2008 we
utilized  short term  borrowings in the form of an overnight line of credit with
the FHLB of New York and during  the year ended  December  31,  2007,  we had no
short-term borrowings. Our maximum short-term borrowings outstanding during 2008
was  $24.0  million.  At  December  31,  2008,  we had  the  ability  to  borrow
approximately  $113.1 million under our credit  facilities  with the FHLB of New
York.

Employees
---------

      At December 31, 2008, we had 66 full-time and 27 part-time employees. None
of our employees is represented  by a collective  bargaining  group.  We believe
that our relationship with our employees is good.

Subsidiaries
------------

      We have one non-bank subsidiary.  BCB Holding Company Investment Corp. was
established in 2004 for the purpose of holding and investing in securities. Only
securities  authorized  to be  purchased by BCB  Community  Bank are held by BCB
Holding Company  Investment Corp. At December 31, 2008, this company held $130.3
million in securities.

Supervision and Regulation
--------------------------

      Bank holding  companies  and banks are  extensively  regulated  under both
federal  and state  law.  These laws and  regulations  are  intended  to protect
depositors,  not  shareholders.  To the extent  that the  following  information
describes statutory and regulatory  provisions,  it is qualified in its entirety
by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory  provisions.  Any change
in the applicable  law or regulation may have a material  effect on the business
and prospects of the Company and the Bank.

      Bank Holding  Company  Regulation.  As a bank holding  company  registered
under the Bank Holding  Company Act of 1956, as amended,  the Company is subject
to the regulation and  supervision  applicable to bank holding  companies by the
Board of Governors  of the Federal  Reserve  System.  The Company is required to
file with the Federal Reserve annual reports and other information regarding its
business operations and those of its subsidiaries.

      The Bank  Holding  Company Act  requires,  among other  things,  the prior
approval  of the  Federal  Reserve  in any  case  where a bank  holding  company
proposes  to (i)  acquire  all or  substantially  all of the assets of any other
bank,  (ii) acquire  direct or indirect  ownership or control of more than 5% of
the  outstanding  voting  stock of any bank  (unless it owns a majority  of such
company's  voting  shares)  or (iii)  merge or  consolidate  with any other bank
holding company.  The Federal Reserve will not approve any acquisition,  merger,
or consolidation that would have a substantially anti-competitive effect, unless
the anti-competitive impact of the proposed transaction is clearly outweighed by
a greater public  interest in meeting the convenience and needs of the community
to be served.  The Federal  Reserve also  considers

                                       23

<PAGE>

capital  adequacy  and other  financial  and  managerial  resources  and  future
prospects  of  the  companies  and  the  banks  concerned,   together  with  the
convenience and needs of the community to be served, when reviewing acquisitions
or mergers.

      The Bank Holding Company Act generally  prohibits a bank holding  company,
with certain  limited  exceptions,  from (i)  acquiring  or retaining  direct or
indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the outstanding voting stock of
any  company  which  is not a bank or bank  holding  company,  or (ii)  engaging
directly or indirectly in  activities  other than those of banking,  managing or
controlling  banks,  or performing  services for its  subsidiaries,  unless such
non-banking  business  is  determined  by the  Federal  Reserve to be so closely
related to banking or managing or controlling  banks as to be properly  incident
thereto.

      The Bank  Holding  Company  Act has been  amended to permit  bank  holding
companies  and banks,  which meet  certain  capital,  management  and  Community
Reinvestment  Act  standards,  to  engage  in a  broader  range  of  non-banking
activities.  In addition, bank holding companies which elect to become financial
holding  companies  may engage in certain  banking  and  non-banking  activities
without prior Federal  Reserve  approval.  At this time, the Company has elected
not to  become  a  financial  holding  company,  as it does  not  engage  in any
activities not permissible for banks.

      There are a number of obligations and restrictions imposed on bank holding
companies and their  depository  institution  subsidiaries by law and regulatory
policy that are designed to minimize  potential  loss to the  depositors of such
depository institutions and the FDIC insurance funds in the event the depository
institution is in danger of default.  Under a policy of the Federal Reserve with
respect to bank holding company  operations,  a bank holding company is required
to  serve  as a  source  of  financial  strength  to its  subsidiary  depository
institutions   and  to  commit   resources  to  support  such   institutions  in
circumstances  where it might not do so absent such policy.  The Federal Reserve
also has the  authority  under the Bank  Holding  Company  Act to require a bank
holding company to terminate any activity or to relinquish control of a non-bank
subsidiary  upon the  Federal  Reserve's  determination  that such  activity  or
control  constitutes a serious risk to the financial  soundness and stability of
any bank subsidiary of the bank holding company.

      Capital Adequacy Guidelines for Bank Holding Companies. The Federal
Reserve has adopted risk-based capital guidelines for bank holding companies.
The risk-based capital guidelines are designed to make regulatory capital
requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profile among banks and bank
holding companies, to account for off-balance sheet exposure, and to minimize
disincentives for holding liquid assets. Under these guidelines, assets and
off-balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories each with
appropriate weights. The resulting capital ratios represent capital as a
percentage of total risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet items.

      The Company is subject to regulatory  capital  requirements and guidelines
imposed by the Federal Reserve, which are substantially similar to those imposed
by the FDIC on depository  institutions within their jurisdictions.  At December
31, 2008,  BCB Bancorp,  Inc.,  was  considered  to be a well  capitalized  Bank
Holding Company.

                                       24

<PAGE>

      The  Federal  Reserve  may set higher  capital  requirements  for  holding
companies  whose  circumstances  warrant  it.  For  example,  holding  companies
experiencing  internal  growth or making  acquisitions  are expected to maintain
strong capital positions  substantially  above the minimum  supervisory  levels,
without significant reliance on intangible assets.

      From time to time,  the Federal  Reserve  Board and the other federal bank
regulatory agencies propose changes to, and issue interpretations of, risk-based
capital  guidelines  and  related  reporting   instructions.   Such  changes  or
interpretations  could,  if  implemented  in the  future,  affect the  Company's
capital ratios and risk-adjusted assets.

      Bank Regulation. As a New Jersey-chartered commercial bank, the Bank is
subject to the regulation, supervision, and examination of the New Jersey
Department of Banking and Insurance. As an FDIC-insured institution, we are
subject to the regulation, supervision and examination of the FDIC, an agency of
the federal government. The regulations of the FDIC and the New Jersey
Department of Banking and Insurance impact virtually all of our activities,
including the minimum level of capital we must maintain, our ability to pay
dividends, our ability to expand through new branches or acquisitions and
various other matters.

      Insurance  of Deposit  Accounts.  Our deposit  accounts are insured by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, generally up to a maximum of $250,000 per
separately  insured  depositor,   pursuant  to  the  Federal  Deposit  Insurance
Corporation's  recently announced increase in deposit insurance  available which
will remain  effective until December 31, 2009.  Congress has recently  proposed
legislation  to make this  increased  deposit  insurance  limit  permanent.  Our
deposits are subject to Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation deposit insurance
assessments.  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has adopted a risk-based
system for determining deposit insurance assessments.

      On  December  22,  2008,  the FDIC  published a final rule that raises the
current deposit  insurance  assessment rates uniformly for all institutions by 7
basis  points (to a range from 12 to 50 basis  points)  effective  for the first
quarter of 2009.  On February 27,  2009,  the FDIC also issued a final rule that
revises the way the FDIC calculates  federal deposit insurance  assessment rates
beginning in the second quarter of 2009. Under the new rule, the FDIC will first
establish an  institution's  initial  base  assessment  rate.  This initial base
assessment rate will range,  depending on the risk category of the  institution,
from 12 to 45  basis  points.  The  FDIC  will  then  adjust  the  initial  base
assessment  (higher  or lower) to obtain  the total base  assessment  rate.  The
adjustments  to  the  initial  base  assessment  rate  will  be  based  upon  an
institution's  levels of  unsecured  debt,  secured  liabilities,  and  brokered
deposits.  The total base assessment rate will range from 7 to 77.5 basis points
of the  institution's  deposits.  Additionally,  the FDIC issued an interim rule
that would impose a special 20 basis points  assessment on June 30, 2009,  which
would be collected on September  30,  2009.  However,  the FDIC has  indicated a
willingness  to decrease  the special  assessment  under  certain  circumstances
concerning  the  overall  financial  health  of  the  insurance  fund.   Special
assessments  of 10 and 20 basis  points would  result in  additional  expense of
approximately $450,000 to $900,000,  respectively.  The interim rule also allows
for additional special assessments.

      Insurance of deposits may be  terminated  by the FDIC upon finding that an
institution  has  engaged  in  unsafe  or  unsound  practices,  is in an  unsafe
condition to continue operations or has

                                       25

<PAGE>

violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the
FDIC. We do not know of any practice,  condition or violation that might lead to
termination of deposit insurance.

      In addition to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation assessments,  the
Financing  Corporation  ("FICO") is authorized  to impose and collect,  with the
approval  of  the  Federal  Deposit  Insurance   Corporation,   assessments  for
anticipated  payments,  issuance costs and custodial fees on bonds issued by the
FICO in the 1980s to recapitalize  the former Federal Savings and Loan Insurance
Corporation.  The bonds  issued  by the FICO are due to  mature in 2017  through
2019. For the quarter ended  September 30, 2008, the annualized  FICO assessment
was equal to 1.12 basis points for each $100 in domestic deposits  maintained at
an institution.

      On October 14,  2008,  the FDIC  announced  a new program - the  Temporary
Liquidity  Guarantee  Program  ("TLGP").  This program has two  components.  One
guarantees   newly   issued   senior   unsecured   debt  of  the   participating
organizations,  up to certain limits  established for each  institution,  issued
between  October  14,  2008 and  June 30,  2009.  The FDIC  will pay the  unpaid
principal and interest on an  FDIC-guaranteed  debt  instrument upon the uncured
failure of the  participating  entity to make a timely  payment of  principal or
interest in accordance  with the terms of the  instrument.  The  guarantee  will
remain in effect until June 30, 2012.  On February 27, 2009,  the FDIC issued an
interim rule allowing  participants  to apply to have the FDIC  guarantee  newly
issued senior unsecured debt that  mandatorily  converts into common shares on a
specified  date that is on or before  June 30,  2012.  In return  for the FDIC's
guarantee,  participating  institutions  will  pay the  FDIC a fee  based on the
amount and  maturity of the debt.  The Company has opted not to  participate  in
this  component of the TLGP.  The other  component of the program  provides full
FDIC insurance coverage for non-interest  bearing  transaction deposit accounts,
regardless  of dollar  amount,  until  December 31, 2009. An annualized 10 basis
point assessment on balances in  noninterest-bearing  transaction  accounts that
exceed the existing  deposit  insurance  limit of $250,000 will be assessed on a
quarterly  basis  to  insured  depository  institutions  participating  in  this
component of the TLGP.  The Company has chosen to  participate in this component
of the TLGP. The additional  expense related to this coverage is not expected to
be significant for the Bank.

      Capital Adequacy Guidelines.  The FDIC has promulgated  risk-based capital
rules, which are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive
to differences  in risk profile among banks,  to account for  off-balance  sheet
exposure,  and to minimize  disincentives for holding liquid assets. Under these
rules, assets and off-balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories,
each with appropriate weights. The resulting capital ratios represent capital as
a percentage of total  risk-weighted  assets and off-balance sheet items.  These
rules are substantially similar to the Federal Reserve rules discussed above.

      In  addition  to the  risk-based  capital  rules,  the FDIC has  adopted a
minimum Tier 1 capital  (leverage)  ratio.  This  measurement  is  substantially
similar to the Federal Reserve leverage capital measurement  discussed above. At
December 31, 2008, the Bank's ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets was
14.63%.  Our Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted  assets was 13.38%,  and our Tier 1
capital to average assets was 9.22%.

      Dividends. The Bank may pay dividends as declared from time to time by the
Board  of  Directors  out  of  funds  legally  available,   subject  to  certain
restrictions. Under the New Jersey

                                       26

<PAGE>

Banking Act of 1948, as amended,  the Bank may not pay a cash  dividend  unless,
following the payment,  the Bank's capital stock will be unimpaired and the Bank
will have a surplus  of no less than 50% of the Bank  capital  stock or, if not,
the payment of the dividend will not reduce the surplus.  In addition,  the Bank
cannot pay  dividends  in amounts  that would  reduce the Bank's  capital  below
regulatory imposed minimums.

The USA PATRIOT Act
-------------------

      In response to the terrorist events of September 11, 2001, the Uniting and
Strengthening  America by Providing  Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and
Obstruct  Terrorism  Act of 2001, or the USA PATRIOT Act, was signed into law on
October 26, 2001. The USA PATRIOT Act gave the federal  government new powers to
address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures,  expanded
surveillance  powers,  increased  information  sharing and broadened  anti-money
laundering requirements. For years, financial institutions such as the Bank have
been subject to federal  anti-money  laundering  obligations.  As such, the Bank
does  not  believe  the USA  PATRIOT  Act will  have a  material  impact  on its
operations.

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
--------------------------

      The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ("Sarbanes-Oxley"),  contains a broad range
of legislative  reforms intended to address  corporate and accounting  fraud. In
addition to the  establishment  of a new  accounting  oversight  board that will
enforce auditing,  quality control and independence standards and will be funded
by fees  from all  publicly  traded  companies,  Sarbanes-Oxley  places  certain
restrictions  on the scope of services that may be provided by accounting  firms
to their public company audit clients.  Any non-audit services being provided to
a public company audit client will require  preapproval  by the company's  audit
committee. In addition, Sarbanes-Oxley makes certain changes to the requirements
for audit partner rotation after a period of time. Sarbanes-Oxley requires chief
executive officers and chief financial officers, or their equivalent, to certify
to the  accuracy of periodic  reports  filed with the  Securities  and  Exchange
Commission,  subject  to civil  and  criminal  penalties  if they  knowingly  or
willingly violate this certification requirement.  The Company's Chief Executive
Officer and Principal Accounting Officer have signed certifications to this Form
10-K as required by Sarbanes-Oxley.  In addition, under Sarbanes-Oxley,  counsel
will be required to report  evidence of a material  violation of the  securities
laws or a breach of fiduciary duty by a company to its chief  executive  officer
or its chief legal officer, and, if such officer does not appropriately respond,
to report such evidence to the audit committee or other similar committee of the
board of directors or the board itself.

      Under  Sarbanes-Oxley,   longer  prison  terms  will  apply  to  corporate
executives who violate federal  securities laws; the period during which certain
types of suits can be brought against a company or its officers is extended; and
bonuses issued to top executives  prior to restatement of a company's  financial
statements  are now  subject  to  disgorgement  if such  restatement  was due to
corporate misconduct.  Executives are also prohibited from trading the company's
securities  during  retirement  plan  "blackout"  periods,  and loans to company
executives  (other than loans by  financial  institutions  permitted  by federal
rules and regulations)  are restricted.  In addition,  a provision  directs that
civil penalties levied by the Securities and Exchange  Commission as a result of
any judicial or  administrative  action under  Sarbanes-Oxley

                                       27

be deposited to a fund for the benefit of harmed investors. The Federal Accounts
for Investor  Restitution  provision  also requires the  Securities and Exchange
Commission to develop  methods of improving  collection  rates.  The legislation
accelerates  the time frame for  disclosures by public  companies,  as they must
immediately  disclose  any  material  changes in their  financial  condition  or
operations.  Directors and executive officers must also provide  information for
most changes in ownership in a company's  securities within two business days of
the change.

      Sarbanes-Oxley  also  increases  the  oversight  of, and codifies  certain
requirements  relating to, audit  committees  of public  companies  and how they
interact with the company's "registered public accounting firm." Audit Committee
members must be independent and are absolutely barred from accepting consulting,
advisory or other compensatory fees from the issuer. In addition, companies must
disclose  whether at least one member of the  committee is a "financial  expert"
(as such term is defined by the Securities and Exchange  Commission) and if not,
why not. Under Sarbanes-Oxley,  a company's registered public accounting firm is
prohibited from performing  statutorily mandated audit services for a company if
such company's chief executive officer,  chief financial  officer,  comptroller,
chief accounting officer or any person serving in equivalent  positions had been
employed by such firm and  participated  in the audit of such company during the
one-year  period  preceding  the  audit  initiation  date.  Sarbanes-Oxley  also
prohibits  any officer or director of a company or any other person acting under
their  direction  from  taking any  action to  fraudulently  influence,  coerce,
manipulate  or mislead any  independent  accountant  engaged in the audit of the
company's  financial  statements  for the  purpose of  rendering  the  financial
statements  materially  misleading.  Sarbanes-Oxley also requires the Securities
and Exchange  Commission to prescribe rules requiring  inclusion of any internal
control   report  and   assessment   by  management  in  the  annual  report  to
shareholders. Sarbanes-Oxley requires the company's registered public accounting
firm that  issues  the audit  report  to  attest to and  report on  management's
assessment of the company's internal controls.

      Under  Section 404 of the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act of 2002, we are required to
conduct a  comprehensive  review and  assessment of the adequacy of our existing
financial systems and controls. For the year ending December 31, 2009, we expect
that our  auditors  will  have to audit  our  internal  control  over  financial
reporting.

      Our Annual Report is available on our website, www.bcbbancorp.com. We will

ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS
----------------------

Our loan portfolio  consists of a high percentage of loans secured by commercial
real estate and  multi-family  real  estate.  These loans are riskier than loans
secured by one- to four-family properties.

      At December  31,  2008,  $223.2  million,  or 54.1% of our loan  portfolio
consisted  of  commercial  and  multi-family  real  estate  loans.  We intend to
continue to  emphasize  the  origination  of these  types of loans.  These loans
generally  expose a lender to greater risk of

                                       28

<PAGE>

nonpayment and loss than one- to four-family  residential mortgage loans because
repayment  of the loans often  depends on the  successful  operation  and income
stream of the  borrower's  business.  Such loans  typically  involve larger loan
balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers  compared to one- to
four-family  residential  mortgage loans.  Consequently,  an adverse development
with  respect  to one  loan  or  one  credit  relationship  can  expose  us to a
significantly  greater  risk of loss  compared  to an adverse  development  with
respect to a one- to four-family residential mortgage loan.

We may not be able to successfully maintain and manage our growth.

      Since December 31, 2004, our assets have grown at a compound annual growth
rate of 11.2%,  our loan balances have grown at a compound annual growth rate of
13.4% and our deposits have grown at a compound  annual growth rate of 5.0%. Our
ability to continue  to grow  depends,  in part,  upon our ability to expand our
market presence,  successfully  attract core deposits,  and identify  attractive
commercial lending opportunities.

      We cannot be  certain  as to our  ability  to manage  increased  levels of
assets and  liabilities.  We may be required to make  additional  investments in
equipment and personnel to manage higher asset levels and loans balances,  which
may adversely impact our efficiency ratio, earnings and shareholder returns.

If our allowance for loan losses is not  sufficient to cover actual loan losses,
our earnings could decrease.

      Our loan  customers  may not repay their loans  according  to the terms of
their  loans,  and the  collateral  securing  the  payment of their loans may be
insufficient to assure repayment.  We may experience  significant credit losses,
which could have a material  adverse  effect on our operating  results.  We make
various   assumptions  and  judgments  about  the  collectability  of  our  loan
portfolio,  including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the
real estate and other assets  serving as collateral for the repayment of many of
our loans. In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, we review
our loans and our loss and  delinquency  experience,  and we  evaluate  economic
conditions.  If our  assumptions  prove to be incorrect,  our allowance for loan
losses may not cover losses in our loan  portfolio at the date of the  financial
statements.  Material  additions to our allowance would materially  decrease our
net income.  At December 31, 2008,  our allowance  for loan losses  totaled $5.3
million, representing 1.28% of total loans.

      While we have only been  operating  for seven years,  we have  experienced
significant  growth in our loan  portfolio,  particularly  our loans  secured by
commercial real estate.  Although we believe we have  underwriting  standards to
manage normal lending risks, and although we had $5.2 million, or 0.89% of total
assets consisting of non-performing assets at December 31, 2008, it is difficult
to assess the future  performance  of our loan  portfolio due to the  relatively
recent origination of many of these loans. We can give you no assurance that our
non-performing  loans will not increase or that our non-performing or delinquent
loans will not adversely affect our future performance.

                                       29

<PAGE>

      In  addition,   federal  and  state  regulators  periodically  review  our
allowance  for loan losses and may require us to increase our allowance for loan
losses or recognize further loan charge-offs.  Any increase in our allowance for
loan losses or loan charge-offs as required by these  regulatory  agencies could
have a material  adverse  effect on our  results  of  operations  and  financial
condition.

We depend  primarily  on net interest  income for our  earnings  rather than fee
income.

      Net interest  income is the most  significant  component of our  operating
income.  We do not rely on  traditional  sources of fee income  utilized by some
community banks, such as fees from sales of insurance,  securities or investment
advisory  products or services.  For the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007,
our net interest income was $20.0 million and $17.2 million,  respectively.  The
amount of our net interest  income is  influenced  by the overall  interest rate
environment,  competition, and the amount of interest-earning assets relative to
the  amount of  interest-bearing  liabilities.  In the event that one or more of
these factors were to result in a decrease in our net interest income, we do not
have significant  sources of fee income to make up for decreases in net interest
income.

If Our  Investment  in the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York is  Classified  as
Other-Than-Temporarily  Impaired or as  Permanently  Impaired,  Our Earnings and
Stockholders' Equity Could Decrease

      We own common stock of the Federal  Home Loan Bank of New York  (FHLB-NY).
We hold the FHLB-NY  common stock to qualify for  membership in the Federal Home
Loan Bank System and to be eligible to borrow funds under the FHLB-NY's  advance
program.  The  aggregate  cost and fair value of our FHLB-NY  common stock as of
December  31, 2008 was $5.7 million  based on its par value.  There is no market
for our FHLB-NY common stock.

      Recent published reports indicate that certain member banks of the Federal
Home Loan Bank System may be subject to accounting rules and asset quality risks
that could result in materially lower regulatory  capital levels.  In an extreme
situation,  it is possible that the  capitalization of a Federal Home Loan Bank,
including  the FHLB-NY,  could be  substantially  diminished or reduced to zero.
Consequently,  we believe  that there is a risk that our  investment  in FHLB-NY
common stock could be deemed other-than-temporarily impaired at some time in the
future, and if this occurs, it would cause our earnings and stockholders' equity
to decrease by the after-tax amount of the impairment charge.

Fluctuations in interest rates could reduce our profitability.

      We realize income  primarily  from the difference  between the interest we
earn  on  loans  and  investments  and  the  interest  we  pay on  deposits  and
borrowings. The interest rates on our assets and liabilities respond differently
to  changes  in  market  interest  rates,   which  means  our   interest-bearing
liabilities  may be more sensitive to changes in market  interest rates than our
interest-earning  assets,  or vice versa.  In either event,  if market  interest
rates  change,  this "gap"  between  the amount of  interest-earning  assets and
interest-bearing  liabilities  that reprice in

                                       30

<PAGE>

response to these  interest  rate  changes may work against us, and our earnings
may be negatively affected.

      We are unable to predict  fluctuations in market interest rates, which are
affected by, among other factors, changes in the following:

      o     inflation rates;

      o     business activity levels;

      o     money supply; and

      o     domestic and foreign financial markets.

      The value of our investment  portfolio and the  composition of our deposit
base are  influenced by prevailing  market  conditions and interest  rates.  Our
asset-liability  management strategy,  which is designed to mitigate the risk to
us from changes in market  interest  rates,  may not prevent changes in interest
rates or  securities  market  downturns  from reducing  deposit  outflow or from
having a material  adverse  effect on our results of  operations,  our financial
condition or the value of our investments.

Adverse  events  in New  Jersey,  where  our  business  is  concentrated,  could
adversely affect our results and future growth.

      Our   business,   the  location  of  our  branches  and  the  real  estate
collateralizing  our real estate  loans are  concentrated  in New  Jersey.  As a
result,  we are  exposed to  geographic  risks.  The  occurrence  of an economic
downturn in New Jersey,  or adverse changes in laws or regulations in New Jersey
could impact the credit quality of our assets, the business of our customers and
our ability to expand our business.

      Our success  significantly  depends upon the growth in population,  income
levels,  deposits and housing in our market area. If the communities in which we
operate do not grow or if prevailing  economic  conditions locally or nationally
are  unfavorable,  our business may be  negatively  affected.  In addition,  the
economies of the communities in which we operate are substantially  dependent on
the  growth  of the  economy  in the State of New  Jersey.  To the  extent  that
economic  conditions in New Jersey are unfavorable or do not continue to grow as
projected, the economy in our market area would be adversely affected. Moreover,
we cannot give any  assurance  that we will  benefit  from any market  growth or
favorable economic conditions in our market area if they do occur.

      In  addition,  the  market  value of the  real  estate  securing  loans as
collateral  could be  adversely  affected by  unfavorable  changes in market and
economic conditions.  As of December 31, 2008,  approximately 96.4% of our total
loans were secured by real estate.  Adverse  developments  affecting commerce or
real estate  values in the local  economies  in our primary  market  areas could
increase  the credit  risk  associated  with our loan  portfolio.  In  addition,
substantially  all of our loans are to individuals and businesses in New Jersey.
Our  business

                                       31

<PAGE>

customers may not have customer bases that are as diverse as businesses  serving
regional or national  markets.  Consequently,  any decline in the economy of our
market  area  could  have  an  adverse  impact  on our  revenues  and  financial
condition. In particular, we may experience increased loan delinquencies,  which
could result in a higher  provision for loan losses and  increased  charge-offs.
Any sustained period of increased  non-payment,  delinquencies,  foreclosures or
losses caused by adverse market or economic  conditions in our market area could
adversely  affect the value of our assets,  revenues,  results of operations and
financial condition.

We operate in a highly  regulated  environment and may be adversely  affected by
changes in federal, state and local laws and regulations.

      We are subject to extensive  regulation,  supervision  and  examination by
federal and state banking authorities.  Any change in applicable  regulations or
federal,  state or local legislation  could have a substantial  impact on us and
our operations.  Additional legislation and regulations that could significantly
affect our powers,  authority  and  operations  may be enacted or adopted in the
future,  which could have a material  adverse effect on our financial  condition
and results of operations.  Further,  regulators have significant discretion and
authority to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of laws
by banks and bank holding  companies in the performance of their supervisory and
enforcement  duties.  The exercise of  regulatory  authority may have a negative
impact on our results of operations and financial condition.

      Like other bank holding  companies  and  financial  institutions,  we must
comply with significant  anti-money  laundering and  anti-terrorism  laws. Under
these  laws,  we are  required,  among  other  things,  to  enforce  a  customer
identification  program and file currency  transaction  and suspicious  activity
reports  with the  federal  government.  Government  agencies  have  substantial
discretion to impose  significant  monetary penalties on institutions which fail
to comply  with  these laws or make  required  reports.  Because we operate  our
business in the highly urbanized greater Newark/New York City metropolitan area,
we may be at greater risk of scrutiny by government  regulators  for  compliance
with these laws.

Our expenses will increase as a result of increases in FDIC insurance premiums.

      The Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation  imposes an assessment  against
institutions  for  deposit  insurance.  This  assessment  is  based  on the risk
category  of the  institution  and  ranges  from  5 to 43  basis  points  of the
institution's  deposits.  Federal law requires that the designated reserve ratio
for the deposit  insurance  fund be established by the FDIC at 1.15% to 1.50% of
estimated insured deposits.  If this reserve ratio drops below 1.15% or the FDIC
expects  that it to do so within  six  months,  the FDIC  must,  within 90 days,
establish and implement a plan to restore the designated  reserve ratio to 1.15%
of  estimated   insured   deposits  within  five  years  (absent   extraordinary
circumstances).

      Recent bank failures coupled with deteriorating  economic  conditions have
significantly reduced the deposit insurance fund's reserve ratio. As of June 30,
2008, the designated  reserve ratio was 1.01% of estimated  insured  deposits at
March 31, 2008. As a result of this reduced  reserve ratio, on October 16, 2008,
the FDIC  published a proposed rule that would restore the reserve ratios to its
required  level.  The proposed  rule would raise the current  deposit  insurance

                                       32

<PAGE>

assessment  rates  uniformly for all  institutions by 7 basis points (to a range
from 12 to 50 basis  points) for the first  quarter of 2009.  The proposed  rule
would  also  alter  the  way  the  FDIC  calculates  federal  deposit  insurance
assessment rates beginning in the second quarter of 2009 and thereafter.

      On  December  22,  2008,  the FDIC  published a final rule that raises the
current deposit  insurance  assessment rates uniformly for all institutions by 7
basis  points (to a range from 12 to 50 basis  points)  effective  for the first
quarter of 2009.  On February 27,  2009,  the FDIC also issued a final rule that
revises the way the FDIC calculates  federal deposit insurance  assessment rates
beginning  in the  second  quarter of 2009.  Under the new rule,  the total base
assessment  rate will  range from 7 to 77.5  basis  points of the  institution's
deposits,   depending  on  the  risk  category  of  the   institution   and  the
institution's  levels of  unsecured  debt,  secured  liabilities,  and  brokered
deposits.  Additionally,  the FDIC  issued an interim  rule that would  impose a
special 20 basis points assessment on June 30, 2009, which would be collected on
September 30, 2009.  However,  the FDIC has indicated a willingness  to decrease
the special assessment to 10 basis points under certain circumstances concerning
the overall  financial health of the insurance fund.  Special  assessments of 10
and 20 basis points would result in additional expense of approximately $450,000
to $900,000,  respectively.  The interim rule also allows for additional special
assessments.

      In  addition,  the  Emergency  Economic  Stabilization  Act of 2008 (EESA)
temporarily  increased  the limit on FDIC  insurance  coverage  for  deposits to
$250,000 through December 31, 2009, and the FDIC took action to provide coverage
for newly-issued senior unsecured debt and non-interest  bearing transaction and
certain NOW accounts in excess of the  $250,000  limit,  for which  institutions
will be assessed additional premiums.  These actions will significantly increase
our  non-interest  expense in 2009 and in future years as long as the  increased
premiums are in place.

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
-------  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
         OF OPERATIONS
         -------------

General
-------

      This discussion, and other written material, and statements management may
make, may contain  certain  forward-looking  statements  regarding the Company's
prospective  performance and strategies within the meaning of Section 27A of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended,  and Section 21E of the Securities  Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended. The Company intends such forward-looking  statements to
be  covered  by  the  safe  harbor  provisions  for  forward-looking  statements
contained  in the  Private  Securities  Litigation  Reform  Act of 1995,  and is
including this statement for purposes of said safe harbor provisions.

      Forward-looking   information   is   inherently   subject   to  risks  and
uncertainties,  and actual results could differ  materially from those currently
anticipated due to a number of factors,  which include,  but are not limited to,
factors  discussed  in the  Company's  Annual  Report  on Form 10-K and in other
documents  filed by the Company with the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission.
Forward-looking statements,  which are based on certain assumptions and describe
future  plans,  strategies  and  expectations  of  the  Company,  are  generally
identified  by the  use of the  words  "plan,"  "believe,"  "expect,"  "intend,"
"anticipate,"   "estimate,"   "project,"  "may,"  "will,"   "should,"   "could,"
"predicts,"  "forecasts,"  "potential,"  or  "continue"  or similar terms or the

                                       38

<PAGE>

negative of these terms. The Company's  ability to predict results or the actual
effects of its plans or strategies is inherently uncertain.  Accordingly, actual
results may differ materially from anticipated results.

      Factors that could have a material adverse effect on the operations of the
Company and its subsidiaries  include, but are not limited to, changes in market
interest  rates,  general  economic  conditions,  legislation,  and  regulation;
changes  in  monetary  and fiscal  policies  of the  United  States  Government,
including  policies of the United  States  Treasury and Federal  Reserve  Board;
changes in the  quality or  composition  of the loan or  investment  portfolios;
changes in deposit flows, competition, and demand for financial services, loans,
deposits and  investment  products in the Company's  local  markets;  changes in
accounting  principles and guidelines;  war or terrorist  activities;  and other
economic, competitive,  governmental, regulatory, geopolitical and technological
factors affecting the Company's operations, pricing and services.

      Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking
statements,  which speak only as of the date of this  discussion.  Although  the
Company  believes  that  the  expectations   reflected  in  the  forward-looking
statements are reasonable,  the Company cannot guarantee future results,  levels
of activity,  performance or achievements.  Except as required by applicable law
or   regulation,   the  Company   undertakes   no  obligation  to  update  these
forward-looking  statements to reflect events or circumstances  that occur after
the date on which such statements were made.

Critical Accounting Policies
----------------------------

      Critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that can have a
significant impact on the Company's financial position and results of operations
that  require  the use of  complex  and  subjective  estimates  based  upon past
experiences and management's  judgment.  Because of the uncertainty  inherent in
such estimates,  actual results may differ from these estimates. Below are those
policies applied in preparing the Company's  consolidated  financial  statements
that management  believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates
and assumptions.  For additional  accounting  policies,  see Note 2 of "Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements."

Allowance for Loan Losses

      Loans  receivable  are presented  net of an allowance for loan losses.  In
determining  the  appropriate  level of the  allowance,  management  considers a
combination of factors, such as economic and industry trends, real estate market
conditions,  size and type of loans in portfolio, nature and value of collateral
held,  borrowers'  financial  strength and credit  ratings,  and  prepayment and
default  history.  The calculation of the appropriate  allowance for loan losses
requires  a  substantial   amount  of  judgment  regarding  the  impact  of  the
aforementioned factors, as well as other factors, on the ultimate realization of
loans receivable.

Other-than-Temporary Impairment of Securities

      We  evaluate   on  a  quarterly   basis   whether   any   securities   are
other-than-temporarily  impaired. In making this determination,  we consider the
extent and duration of the  impairment,  the nature and financial  health of the
issuer and our ability and intent to hold securities for a

                                       39

<PAGE>

period sufficient to allow for any anticipated  recovery in market value.  Other
considerations  include a review of the  credit  quality  of the  issuer and the
existence of a guarantee or  insurance,  if  applicable  to the  security.  If a
security  is  determined  to be  other-than-temporarily  impaired,  we record an
impairment  loss as a charge to income  for the  period in which the  impairment
loss is determined  to exist,  resulting in a reduction to our earnings for that
period.

Financial Condition
-------------------

Comparison at December 31, 2008 and at December 31, 2007

      Since we  commenced  operations  in 2000 we have sought to grow our assets
and deposit base consistent with our capital requirements.  We offer competitive
loan and deposit products and seek to distinguish ourselves from our competitors
through our service and availability. Total assets increased by $15.1 million or
2.7% to $578.6  million at December 31, 2008 from $563.5 million at December 31,
2007 as the Company continued to grow the Bank's balance sheet with loans funded
primarily  through  growth in the Bank's  deposit  base and the  utilization  of
wholesale funding sources, specifically Federal Home Loan Bank advances.

      Total cash and cash equivalents decreased by $5.0 million or 42.4% to $6.8
million at December 31, 2008 from $11.8 million at December 31, 2007  reflecting
management's  decision,  with money market rates at historically low levels,  to
deploy those liquid  assets into loans in an effort to achieve  higher  returns.
Securities  held-to-maturity  decreased  by $23.7  million  or  14.4% to  $141.3
million at December  31, 2008 from $165.0  million at  December  31,  2007.  The
decrease was primarily  attributable to call options  exercised on $78.9 million
of callable agency  securities and $5.5 million of repayments and prepayments in
the mortgage  backed  securities  portfolio  during the year ended  December 31,
2008,  partially  offset  by  purchases  of $47.3  million  of  callable  agency
securities and $13.3 million in the mortgage backed securities.

      Loans receivable  increased by $42.1 million or 11.5% to $406.8 million at
December  31,  2008 from $364.7  million at  December  31,  2007.  The  increase
resulted  primarily  from a $46.4  million  increase  in real  estate  mortgages
comprising  residential,  commercial,  construction and participation loans with
other financial institutions,  net of amortization,  and a $2.8 million increase
in consumer  loans,  net of  amortization,  partially  offset by a $5.8  million
decrease in commercial loans  comprising  business loans and commercial lines of
credit,  net of  amortization,  and a $1.2 million increase in the allowance for
loan  losses.  At December  31,  2008,  the  allowance  for loan losses was $5.3
million  or  1.28% of loans  receivable.  The  growth  in loans  receivable  was
primarily  attributable  to  competitive  pricing in a lower  than  historically
normal interest rate environment.

      Deposit  liabilities  increased by $11.7 million or 2.9% to $410.5 million
at December  31, 2008 from $398.8  million at December  31,  2007.  The increase
resulted primarily from an increase of $20.5 million or 9.6% in time deposits to
$235.0  million  from  $214.5  million,  partially  offset by a decrease of $8.0
million or 9.5% in demand  deposits to $75.9  million  from $83.9  million and a
decrease of $855,000 or 0.9% in savings and club  accounts to $99.6 million from
$100.4  million.  The  decrease  in demand,  savings and club  account  balances
resulted primarily from internal disintermediation brought on by an increasingly
competitive  local market

                                       40

<PAGE>

for deposit growth. The Bank has been able to achieve overall growth in deposits
through competitive pricing on select deposit products.

      Total borrowed  money  increased by $2.0 million or 1.8% to $116.1 million
at December 31, 2008 from $114.1  million at December 31, 2007.  The increase in
borrowings  reflects  the use of  Federal  Home Loan Bank  advances  to  augment
deposits as the Bank's funding source for originating loans.

      Total  stockholders'  equity  increased  by $1.2  million or 2.5% to $49.7
million at  December  31,  2008 from $48.5  million at December  31,  2007.  The
increase in stockholders'  equity primarily  reflects net income of $3.5 million
for the year ended  December 31, 2008 and the exercise of stock  options  during
the year to purchase 104,873 shares of the Company's common stock for a total of
approximately  $925,000,  partially offset by the repurchase of 93,029 shares of
the Company's common stock through the stock repurchase plans in place at a cost
during  the  year of $1.3  million  and cash  dividends  paid  through  the year
totaling $1.9 million.  At December 31, 2008 the Bank's Tier 1 leverage,  Tier 1
risk-based and Total risk-based  capital ratios were 9.22%,  13.38%,  and 14.63%
respectively.

Analysis of Net Interest Income
-------------------------------

      Net  interest  income  is  the  difference   between  interest  income  on
interest-earning  assets and interest expense on  interest-bearing  liabilities.
Net interest income depends on the relative amounts of  interest-earning  assets
and interest-bearing  liabilities and the interest rates earned or paid on them,
respectively.

Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2008 and 2007

      Net income  decreased  by $970,000 or 21.8% to $3.47  million for the year
ended December 31, 2008 from $4.44 million for the year ended December 31, 2007.
The decrease in net income  resulted  primarily from a decrease in  non-interest
income and increases in the provision for loan losses and non-interest  expense,
partially  offset by an increase in net interest income and a decrease in income
taxes.  Net interest income  increased by $2.8 million or 16.3% to $20.0 million
for the year  ended  December  31,  2008 from $17.2  million  for the year ended
December 31, 2007. The increase in net interest income  resulted  primarily from
an increase of $37.7 million or 7.2% in the average balance of interest  earning
assets to $564.5  million  for the year  ended  December  31,  2008 from  $526.8
million for the year ended December 31, 2007 offset by a decrease in the average
yield on interest  earning  assets to 6.49% for the year ended December 31, 2008
from 6.53% for the year ended December 31, 2007. The average balance of interest
bearing  liabilities  increased  by $40.3  million or 8.9% to $490.7  million at
December  31,  2008 from $450.4  million at December  31, 2007 while the average
cost of  interest  bearing  liabilities  decreased  to 3.40% for the year  ended
December 31, 2008 from 3.82% for the year ended  December 31, 2007.  As a result
of the  aforementioned,  our net interest margin increased to 3.54% for the year
ended December 31, 2008 from 3.26% for the year ended December 31, 2007.

      The decrease in non-interest  income resulted primarily from an other than
temporary  impairment (OTTI) charge of $2.9 million on a $3.0 million investment
in Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) preferred stock. The increase in
non-interest  expense  reflected a change to income resulting from the discovery
of a deposit fraud scheme by a commercial  client of the Bank. The Bank recorded
a $560,000 loss in other non-interest expense related to this incident. The Bank
and Company  anticipate  that any future  recoveries  may partially  offset this
loss;  however  there can be no  assurance  of the level or  probability  of any
recovery. The Bank and the Company have notified its insurance carriers.

      Interest income on loans receivable  increased by $2.8 million or 11.5% to
$27.2  million for the year ended  December 31, 2008 from $24.4  million for the
year ended  December 31, 2007.  The increase was primarily due to an increase in
average loans  receivable  of $52.6  million or 15.5% to $393.2  million for the
year ended December 31, 2008 from $339.1 million for the year ended December 31,
2007, partially offset by a decrease in the average yield on loans receivable to
6.96%  for the year  ended  December  31,  2008 from  7.19%  for the year  ended
December  31,  2007.  The  increase  in the  average  balance of loans  reflects
management's  philosophy  of  deploying  funds in higher  yielding  instruments,
specifically  commercial  real  estate  loans,  in an effort to  achieve  higher
returns.   The  decrease  in  average  yield  reflects  the  competitive   price
environment  prevalent  in the Bank's  primary  market area for  commercial  and
construction  loans as well as the effect of the  actions  taken by the  Federal
Open Market Committee to reduce interest rates during 2008.

      Interest  income  on  securities  increased  by  $342,000  or 3.9% to $9.2
million  for the year ended  December  31,  2008 from $8.8  million for the year
ended December 31, 2007. The increase was primarily  attributable to an increase
in the average yield on securities to 5.70% for the year ended December 31, 2008
from 5.47% for the year ended  December 31, 2007,  partially  offset by a slight
decrease  in the  average  balance of  securities  of $426,000 or 0.3% to $161.3
million for the year ended  December  31, 2008 from $161.7  million for the year
ended December 31, 2007. The decrease in average  balances  reflects the issuing
agencies  decision  to  exercise  their  call  options  on a  select  number  of
securities which resulted in decreases to the investment portfolio. The increase
in average yield  reflects the fact that the exercise of call options  discussed
above occurred on seasoned securities whose yield was less than those securities
remaining in the investment portfolio.

      Interest income on other  interest-earning  assets consisting primarily of
federal funds sold decreased by $992,000 or 83.9% to $190,000 for the year ended
December 31, 2008 from $1.2 million for the year ended  December 31, 2007.  This
decrease  was  primarily  due to an  decrease  in the  average  balance of other
interest-earning  assets of $16.0 million or 61.5% to $10.0 million for the year
ended  December 31, 2008 from $26.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007
and a decrease in the average  yield on other  interest-earning  assets to 1.89%
for the year ended  December 31, 2008 from 4.54% for the year ended December 31,
2007. As a result of the lower interest rate environment for overnight  deposits
during the year ended  December  31,  2008,  a decrease in the  average  balance
resulted, as management deployed funds into loans in an effort to achieve higher
returns.

      Total interest expense  decreased by $554,000 or 3.2% to $16.7 million for
the year ended  December 31, 2008 from $17.2 million for the year ended December
31, 2007. This decrease  resulted  primarily from a decrease in the average cost
of interest  bearing  liabilities  to 3.40% for the year ended December 31, 2008
from 3.82% for the year ended December 31, 2007, partially offset by an increase
in the balance of total interest bearing deposit liabilities of $14.8 million or
4.1% to $371.8  million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $357.0 million
for the year ended  December 31, 2007, and an increase in the balance of average
borrowings  of $25.5  million  or 27.3% to  $118.9  million  for the year  ended
December 31, 2008, from $93.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007.

      The  provision  for loan losses  totaled $1.3 million and $600,000 for the
years ended  December 31, 2008 and 2007,  respectively.  The  provision for loan
losses is  established  based upon  management's  review of the Bank's loans and
consideration  of a variety of factors  including,  but not  limited to, (1) the
risk characteristics of the loan portfolio, (2) current economic conditions, (3)
actual losses previously  experienced,  (4) the significant level of loan growth
and (5) the  existing  level of reserves  for loan losses that are  possible and
estimable.  During  2008,  the  Bank  experienced  $61,000  in  net  charge-offs
(consisting of $101,000 in charge-offs and $40,000 in recoveries).  During 2007,
the Bank  experienced  $268,000 in net  charge-offs  (consisting  of $285,000 in
charge-offs and $17,000 in recoveries).  The Bank had non-accrual loans totaling
$3.7 million at December  31, 2008 and $3.8  million at December  31, 2007.  The
allowance for loan losses stood at $5.3 million or 1.28% of gross total loans at
December  31, 2008 as compared to $4.1  million or 1.10% of gross total loans at
December 31,  2007.  The amount of the  allowance is based on estimates  and the
ultimate losses may vary from such estimates.  Management assesses the allowance
for loan losses on a  quarterly  basis and makes  provisions  for loan losses as
necessary in order to maintain the adequacy of the allowance.  While  management
uses  available  information  to  recognize  loses on  loans,  future  loan loss
provisions may be necessary based on changes in the aforementioned  criteria. In
addition,  various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination
process,  periodically  review the allowance for loan losses and may require the
Bank to recognize  additional  provisions based on their judgment of information
available to them at the time of their examination. Management believes that the
allowance for loan losses was adequate at both December 31, 2008 and 2007.

      Total  non-interest  income  decreased  by $3.2  million to a loss of $2.1
million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from income of $1.1 million for the
year ended  December 31,  2007.  The decrease in  non-interest  income  resulted
primarily from an other than temporary  impairment (OTTI) charge of $2.9 million
on a $3.0 million  investment in Federal National  Mortgage  Association  (FNMA)
preferred  stock  as well as a  $283,000  decrease  in gain on  sales  of  loans
originated  for sale,  to  $137,000  for the year ended  December  31, 2008 from
$420,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007, and a $12,000 decrease in gain on
sale of real estate  owned,  partially  offset by a $64,000 or 9.7%  increase in
fees,  service  charges and other income to $723,000 for the year ended December
31, 2008 from  $659,000 for the year ended  December  31, 2007.  The decrease in
gain on sale  of  loans  originated  for  sale  reflects  the  softening  one-to
four-family residential real estate market during 2008.

      Total non-interest  expense increased by $596,000 or 5.6% to $11.3 million
for the year  ended  December  31,  2008 from $10.7  million  for the year ended
December 31, 2007. The

                                       46

increase in  non-interest  expense  resulted  primarily  from the discovery of a
deposit  fraud scheme by a commercial  client of the Bank during 2008.  The Bank
recorded  a  $560,000  loss  related  to this  incident.  The Bank  and  Company
anticipate that future recoveries may partially offset this loss;  however there
can be no assurance of the level or  probability  of any recovery.  The Bank and
the Company have notified its insurance carrier.  Salaries and employee benefits
expense  decreased  by  $207,000  or 3.6% to $5.5  million  for the  year  ended
December 31, 2008 from $5.7 million for the year ended  December 31, 2007.  This
decrease  resulted  from  a  decrease  in  full  time  equivalent  employees  to
eighty-five  (85) at December  31, 2008 from  ninety-three  (93) at December 31,
2007  and  from  eighty-seven  (87) at  December  31,  2006.  Occupancy  expense
increased  by $59,000 or 5.9% to $1.1  million for the year ended  December  31,
2008 from $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007.  Equipment  expense
increased  by $113,000 or 5.9% to $2.0  million for the year ended  December 31,
2008 from $1.9  million  for the year  ended  December  31,  2007.  The  primary
component of this expense item is data service  provider expense which increases
with the growth of the Bank's assets.  Advertising  expense decreased by $85,000
or 26.1% to $241,000 for the year ended  December 31, 2008 from $326,000 for the
year ended December 31, 2007. Other  non-interest  expense increased by $156,000
or 8.7% to $1.9  million for the year ended  December 31, 2008 from $1.8 million
for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in other non-interest expense
is primarily  attributable to increases in expenses  commensurate with a growing
franchise.   Other  non-interest   expense  is  comprised  of  directors'  fees,
stationary,  forms and printing,  professional fees, legal fees, check printing,
correspondent bank fees, telephone and communication,  shareholder relations and
other fees and expenses.

      Income tax expense  decreased  $689,000  or 27.5% to $1.8  million for the
year ended  December 31, 2008 from $2.5 million for the year ended  December 31,
2007 reflecting  decreased  pre-tax income earned during 2008. The  consolidated
effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 was 34.4% and for
the year ended December 31, 2007 was 36.1%.

Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2007 and 2006

      Net income  decreased by $1.13  million or 20.3% to $4.44  million for the
year ended  December 31, 2007 from $5.57 million for the year ended December 31,
2006.  The  decrease in net income  resulted  primarily  from  decreases  in net
interest income and non-interest income and an increase in non-interest expense,
partially  offset by decreases  in the  provision  for loan  losses,  and income
taxes.  Net interest  income  decreased by $611,000 or 3.4% to $17.2 million for
the year ended  December 31, 2007 from $17.8 million for the year ended December
31,  2006.  This  decrease in net interest  income  resulted  primarily  from an
increase of $42.6  million or 10.4% in the average  balance of  interest-bearing
liabilities  to $450.5  million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $407.9
million  for the year ended  December  31,  2006 and an  increase in the cost of
interest-bearing  liabilities to 3.82% for the year ended December 31, 2008 from
3.30%  for  the  year  ended   December  31,  2006.   The  average   balance  of
interest-earning  assets increased by $45.1 million or 9.4% to $526.8 million at
December  31, 2008 from $481.7  million at December  31, 2006 while the yield on
interest-earning  assets increased slightly to 6.53% for the year ended December
31, 2008 from 6.49% for the year ended  December 31, 2006. As a  consequence  of
the

                                       47

<PAGE>

aforementioned,  our net interest  margin  decreased to 3.26% for the year ended
December 31, 2008 from 3.69% for the year ended December 31, 2006.

      Interest income on loans  receivable  increased by $1.6 million or 7.0% to
$24.4  million for the year ended  December 31, 2007 from $22.8  million for the
year ended  December 31, 2006.  The increase was primarily due to an increase in
average loans receivable of $23.6 million or 7.5% to $339.1 million for the year
ended  December  31, 2008 from $315.5  million for the year ended  December  31,
2006,  partially  offset  by a slight  decrease  in the  average  yield on loans
receivable to 7.19% for the year ended December 31, 2007 from 7.22% for the year
ended December 31, 2006.  The increase in the average  balance of loans reflects
management's  philosophy  of  deploying  funds in higher  yielding  instruments,
specifically  commercial  real  estate  loans in an  effort  to  achieve  higher
returns.   The  decrease  in  average  yield  reflects  the  competitive   price
environment  prevalent  in the Bank's  primary  market area for  commercial  and
construction  loans as well as the effect of the  actions  taken by the  Federal
Open Market Committee to reduce interest rates during the latter half of 2007.

      Interest  income  on  securities  increased  by  $797,000  or 9.9% to $8.8
million  for the year ended  December  31,  2007 from $8.0  million for the year
ended December 31, 2006. The increase was primarily  attributable to an increase
in the average  balance of securities of $8.1 million or 5.3% to $161.7  million
for the year ended  December  31,  2007 from  $153.6  million for the year ended
December 31, 2006,  and an increase in the average  yield on securities to 5.47%
for the year ended  December 31, 2007 from 5.24% for the year ended December 31,
2006.  The increase in average  balances  reflects  management's  philosophy  to
deploy funds in investments,  absent an opportunity to originate higher yielding
loans, in an effort to achieve higher returns.

      Interest income on other  interest-earning  assets consisting primarily of
federal funds sold  increased by $737,000 or 165.6% to $1.2 million for the year
ended December 31, 2007 from $445,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006. This
increase  was  primarily  due to an  increase  in the  average  balance of other
interest-earning assets of $13.4 million or 106.3% to $26.0 million for the year
ended  December 31, 2007 from $12.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006
and an increase in the average yield on other  interest-earning  assets to 4.54%
for the year ended  December 31, 2007 from 3.54% for the year ended December 31,
2006.  During 2007, as short term interest rates remained elevated and the yield
curve remained inverted through the majority of the year,  increased balances in
cash and cash  equivalent  accounts,  in the  absence  of higher  yielding  loan
product, provided a competitive yield while affording management the latitude to
research more profitable investment opportunities.

      Total interest expense increased by $3.7 million or 27.4% to $17.2 million
for the year  ended  December  31,  2007 from $13.5  million  for the year ended
December  31,  2006.  This  increase  resulted  from an  increase in the average
balance of total  interest-bearing  deposit liabilities of $12.9 million or 3.7%
to $357.0  million for the year ended  December 31, 2007 from $344.1 million for
the year ended  December 31, 2006,  and an increase of $29.6 million or 46.4% in
average  borrowings to $93.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007,  from
$63.8  million for the year ended  December 31, 2006,  as well as an increase in
the average  cost of  interest-bearing  liabilities  to 3.82% for the year ended
December 31, 2007 from 3.30% for the year ended December 31, 2006.

      The provision for loan losses totaled  $600,000 and $625,000 for the years
ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The provision for loan losses is
established based upon management's review of the Bank's loans and consideration
of  a  variety  of  factors  including,   but  not  limited  to,  (1)  the  risk
characteristics  of the loan portfolio,  (2) current  economic  conditions,  (3)
actual losses previously  experienced,  (4) the significant level of loan growth
and (5) the  existing  level of reserves  for loan losses that are  probable and
estimable.  During  2007,  the  Bank  experienced  $268,000  in net  charge-offs
(consisting of $285,000 in charge-offs and $17,000 in recoveries).  During 2006,
the Bank  experienced  $18,000  in net  recoveries  (consisting  of  $85,000  in
recoveries and $67,000 in charge-offs).  The Bank had non-accrual loans totaling
$3.8  million at December  31,  2007 and  $323,000 at  December  31,  2006.  The
allowance for loan losses stood at $4.1 million or 1.10% of gross total loans at
December  31, 2007 as compared to $3.7  million or 1.16% of gross total loans at
December 31,  2006.  The amount of the  allowance is based on estimates  and the
ultimate losses may vary from such estimates.  Management assesses the allowance
for loan losses on a  quarterly  basis and makes  provisions  for loan losses as

      Total  non-interest  income decreased by $168,000 or 13.3% to $1.1 million
for the year  ended  December  31,  2007 from $1.3  million  for the year  ended
December 31, 2006. The decrease in non-interest income resulted primarily from a
$215,000 decrease in gain on sales of loans originated for sale, to $420,000 for
the year ended  December 31, 2007 from $635,000 for the year ended  December 31,
2006,  partially offset by a $34,000 increase in fees, service charges and other
income to $659,000 for the year ended  December  31, 2007 from  $625,000 for the
year  ended  December  31,  2006  and a  $13,000  increase  in  gain  on sale of
non-performing  loans. The decrease in gain on sale of loans originated for sale
reflects the softening one-to four-family  residential real estate market during
the year 2007.

      Total  non-interest  expense  increased  by $1.1 million or 11.5% to $10.7
million  for the year ended  December  31,  2007 from $9.6  million for the year
ended  December 31, 2006.  The increase in 2007 was primarily due to an increase
of $489,000 or 9.4% in salaries  and employee  benefits  expense to $5.7 million
for the year  ended  December  31,  2007 from $5.2  million  for the year  ended
December 31, 2006 as the Bank increased  staffing levels and  compensation in an
effort to service its growing  customer  base.  Full time  equivalent  employees
increased to ninety-three  (93) at December 31, 2007 from  eighty-seven  (87) at
December 31, 2006 and eighty-two  (82) at December 31, 2005.  Occupancy  expense
increased by $100,000 or 11.1% to $1.0  million for the year ended  December 31,
2007 from  $900,000  for the year ended  December 31,  2006.  Equipment  expense
increased  by $172,000 or 9.9% to $1.9  million for the year ended  December 31,
2007 from $1.7  million  for the year  ended  December  31,  2006.  The  primary
component of this expense item is data service  provider expense which increases
with the growth of the Bank's assets.  Advertising  expense remained  relatively
stable at $326,000 for the year ended  December 31, 2007 as compared to $329,000
for the year ended December 31, 2006. Other non-interest

expense  increased  by  $328,000  or 22.5% to $1.8  million  for the year  ended
December  31, 2007 from $1.5 million for the year ended  December 31, 2006.  The
increase in other non-interest expense is primarily attributable to increases in
expenses  commensurate with a growing franchise.  Other non-interest  expense is
comprised of directors' fees, stationary, forms and printing, professional fees,
legal  fees,   check   printing,   correspondent   bank  fees,   telephone   and
communication, shareholder relations and other fees and expenses.

      Income tax expense  decreased  $711,000  or 22.1% to $2.5  million for the
year ended  December 31, 2007 from $3.2 million for the year ended  December 31,
2006 reflecting  decreased  pre-tax income earned during 2007. The  consolidated
effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2007 was 36.1% and for
the year ended December 31, 2006 was 36.6%.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
-------------------------------

      Our  funding  sources  include  income  from   operations,   deposits  and
borrowings  and principal  payments on loans and  investment  securities.  While
maturities and scheduled  amortization  of loans and securities are  predictable
sources  of  funds,  deposit  outflows  and  mortgage  prepayments  are  greatly
influenced  by the general  level of interest  rates,  economic  conditions  and
competition.

      Our primary  investing  activities  are the  origination of commercial and
multi-family   real  estate  loans,   one-  to   four-family   mortgage   loans,
construction, commercial business and consumer loans, as well as the purchase of
mortgage-backed and other investment  securities.  During 2008 loan originations
totaled  $110.7  million  compared to $142.5 million and $119.6 million for 2007
and 2006,  respectively.  The continued  strength of loan originations  reflects
management's  efforts to  increase  our total  assets,  the  continued  focus on
increasing  commercial  and  multi-family  lending  operations and the refinance
market in 2008.

      During 2008,  cash flow  provided by the calls,  maturities  and principal
repayments and prepayments received on securities  held-to-maturity  amounted to
$84.4  million  compared to $21.0  million  and $28.8  million in 2007 and 2006.
Deposit  growth  provided  $11.7  million,  $16.1  million and $19.9  million of
funding to facilitate  asset growth for the years ending December 31, 2008, 2007
and  2006,  respectively.   Borrowings  increased  $2.0  million  in  2008  with
additional  short-term  borrowings  of $24.0  million  and  repayments  of $22.0
million through the FHLB.

      Loan  Commitments.  In the  ordinary  course of business  the Bank extends
commitments to originate  residential  and  commercial  loans and other consumer
loans. Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long
as  there  is no  violation  of  any  condition  established  in  the  contract.
Commitments  generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination  clauses
and may  require  payment  of a fee.  Since the Bank does not  expect all of the
commitments  to be  funded,  the total  commitment  amounts  do not  necessarily
represent  future  cash   requirements.   The  Bank  evaluates  each  customer's
creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis.  Collateral may be obtained based upon
management's  assessment  of the  customers'  creditworthiness.  Commitments  to
extend credit may be written on a fixed rate basis exposing the Bank to interest
rate risk  given the  possibility  that  market  rates may  change  between  the
commitment  date and the actual  extension of credit.  The Bank had  outstanding
commitments to

                                       50

originate  and fund loans of  approximately  $46.1  million and $57.4 million at
December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
--------------------------------

      In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
Statement  No.  160   "Noncontrolling   Interests  in   Consolidated   Financial
Statements--an  amendment of ARB No. 51". This Statement establishes  accounting
and reporting standards for the noncontrolling  interest in a subsidiary and for
the  deconsolidation  of a subsidiary.  The guidance will become effective as of
the beginning of a company's  fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2008. The
Company believes that this new pronouncement  will not have a material impact on
its consolidated financial statements.

      In May  2008,  the FASB  issued  Statement  No.  162,  "The  Hierarchy  of
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles." This Statement identifies the sources
of accounting  principles and the framework for selecting the principles used in
the  preparation  of financial  statements.  This Statement is effective 60 days
following the SEC's approval of the Public Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board
amendments to AU Section 411, "The Meaning of Present Fairly in Conformity  with
Generally  Accepted  Accounting  Principles." The Company believes that this new
pronouncement  will not have a  material  impact on its  consolidated  financial
statements.

      In June 2008,  the FASB issued FASB Staff  Position  ("FSP")  EITF 03-6-1,
"Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are
Participating  Securities."  This FSP clarifies  that all  outstanding  unvested
share-based  payment  awards that  contain  rights to  nonforfeitable  dividends
participate in undistributed  earnings with common shareholders.  Awards of this
nature are  considered  participating  securities  and the  two-class  method of
computing  basic and diluted  earnings  per share must be  applied.  This FSP is
effective for fiscal years  beginning  after December 15, 2008. The Company does
not expect that EITF 03-6-1  will have an impact on its  consolidated  financial
statements.

      In  November  2008,  the SEC  released a proposed  roadmap  regarding  the
potential  use by U.S.  issuers of financial  statements  prepared in accordance
with  International   Financial  Reporting   Standards   ("IFRS").   IFRS  is  a
comprehensive  series of  accounting  standards  published by the  International
Accounting Standards Board ("IASB"). Under the proposed roadmap, the Company may
be required to prepare financial statements in accordance with IFRS

                                       51

<PAGE>

as early as  2014.  The SEC will  make a  determination  in 2011  regarding  the
mandatory  adoption of IFRS. The Company is currently  assessing the impact that
this potential change would have on its consolidated  financial statements,  and
it will continue to monitor the development of the potential  implementation  of
IFRS.

      In November  2008, the FASB ratified  Emerging  Issues Task Force ("EITF")
Issue No. 08-6, "Equity Method Investment Accounting Considerations".  EITF 08-6
clarifies the accounting for certain transactions and impairment  considerations
involving  equity  method  investments.  EITF 08-6 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2008, with early adoption  prohibited.  The Company
does not expect that EITF 08-6 will have an impact on its consolidated financial
statements.

      In November 2008, the FASB ratified EITF Issue No. 08-7,  "Accounting  for
Defensive  Intangible  Assets".  EITF 08-7  clarifies the accounting for certain
separately  identifiable  intangible assets which an acquirer does not intend to
actively  use but  intends to hold to prevent  its  competitors  from  obtaining
access to them.  EITF 08-7  requires an acquirer  in a business  combination  to
account for a defensive  intangible asset as a separate unit of accounting which
should be amortized to expense  over the period the asset  diminishes  in value.
EITF 08-7 is effective for fiscal years  beginning after December 15, 2008, with
early  adoption  prohibited.  This new  pronouncement  will impact the Company's
accounting  for  any  defensive   intangible   assets  acquired  in  a  business
combination completed beginning January 1, 2009.

      In December 2008,  the FASB issued FSP SFAS 140-4 and FASB  Interpretation
("FIN") 46(R)-8,  "Disclosures by Public Entities  (Enterprises) about Transfers
of Financial Assets and Interests in Variable Interest Entities". FSP SFAS 140-4
and FIN 46(R)-8 amends FASB SFAS 140  "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of
Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities", to require public entities
to provide  additional  disclosures about transfers of financial assets. It also
amends FIN 46(R),  "Consolidation  of Variable  Interest  Entities",  to require
public  enterprises,  including  sponsors  that have a  variable  interest  in a
variable  interest  entity,  to  provide  additional   disclosures  about  their
involvement with variable  interest  entities.  Additionally,  this FSP requires
certain  disclosures to be provided by a public enterprise that is (a) a sponsor
of a qualifying special purpose entity ("SPE") that holds a variable interest in
the  qualifying  SPE but  was not the  transferor  of  financial  assets  to the
qualifying  SPE and (b) a servicer of a qualifying  SPE that holds a significant
variable  interest in the qualifying SPE but was not the transferor of financial
assets to the qualifying SPE. The disclosures required by FSP SFAS 140-4 and FIN
46(R)-8 are intended to provide  greater  transparency  to  financial  statement
users about a transferor's  continuing  involvement with  transferred  financial
assets and an  enterprise's  involvement  with  variable  interest  entities and
qualifying SPEs. FSP SFAS 140-4 and FIN 46(R) is effective for reporting periods
(annual or  interim)  ending  after  December  15,  2008.  The  adoption of this
pronouncement  did not have a  material  impact  on our  consolidated  financial
statements.

      In January  2009,  the FASB issued FSP EITF  99-20-1,  "Amendments  to the
Impairment  of Guidance of EITF Issue No.  99-20".  FSP EITF 99-20-1  amends the
impairment guidance in EITF Issue No. 99-20, "Recognition of Interest Income and
Impairment on Purchased  Beneficial  Interests  and  Beneficial  Interests  That
Continue to Be Held by a Transferor in Securitized

                                       52

<PAGE>

Financial  Assets",  to  achieve  more  consistent  determination  of whether an
other-than-temporary  impairment has occurred. FSP EITF 99-20-1 also retains and
emphasizes the objective of an  other-than-temporary  impairment  assessment and
the related  disclosure  requirements  in SFAS No. 115,  "Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities", and other related guidance. FSP EITF
99-20-1 is  effective  for interim and annual  reporting  periods  ending  after
December 15, 2008, and shall be applied prospectively. Retrospective application
to a prior interim or annual reporting period is not permitted.  The adoption of
EITF  99-20-1  did not have a  material  impact  on our  consolidated  financial
statements.

ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
--------    ----------------------------------------------------------

Management of Market Risk
-------------------------

      Qualitative  Analysis.  The  majority  of our assets and  liabilities  are
monetary in nature.  Consequently,  one of our most significant  forms of market
risk is interest rate risk. Our assets,  consisting primarily of mortgage loans,
have longer maturities than our liabilities,  consisting  primarily of deposits.
As a result,  a principal  part of our business  strategy is to manage  interest
rate risk and  reduce  the  exposure  of our net  interest  income to changes in
market  interest rates.  Accordingly,  our Board of Directors has established an
Asset/Liability  Committee which is responsible for evaluating the interest rate
risk inherent in our assets and  liabilities,  for determining the level of risk
that is appropriate given our business strategy, operating environment, capital,
liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with
the guidelines  approved by the Board of Directors.  Senior management  monitors
the  level of  interest  rate risk on a  regular  basis and the  Asset/Liability
Committee,  which consists of senior management and outside directors  operating
under a policy adopted by the Board of Directors,  meets as needed to review our
asset/liability policies and interest rate risk position.

      Quantitative  Analysis.  The  following  table  presents the Company's net
portfolio value ("NPV"). These calculations were based upon assumptions believed
to be fundamentally  sound,  although they may vary from assumptions utilized by
other financial  institutions.  The information set forth below is based on data
that included all  financial  instruments  as of December 31, 2008.  Assumptions
have been made by the Company relating to interest rates, loan prepayment rates,
core deposit  duration,  and the market values of certain assets and liabilities
under the various  interest rate scenarios.  Actual maturity dates were used for
fixed rate loans and certificate accounts.  Investment securities were scheduled
at  either  the  maturity  date or the  next  scheduled  call  date  based  upon
management's  judgment of whether the particular security would be called in the
current  interest rate  environment  and under assumed  interest rate scenarios.
Variable  rate loans were  scheduled as of their next  scheduled  interest  rate
repricing date. Additional  assumptions made in the preparation of the NPV table
include prepayment rates on loans and mortgage-backed  securities, core deposits
without stated  maturity dates were scheduled with an assumed term of 48 months,
and money market and noninterest bearing accounts were scheduled with an assumed
term of 24  months.  The NPV at "PAR"  represents  the  difference  between  the
Company's estimated value of assets and estimated value of liabilities  assuming
no change in interest  rates.  The NPV for a decrease of 100 to 300 basis points
has

                                       53

<PAGE>

been excluded since it would not be meaningful, in the interest rate environment
as of December  31,  2008.  The  following  sets forth the  Company's  NPV as of
December 31, 2008.

bp-basis points

      The table above indicates that at December 31, 2008, in the event of a 100
basis point increase in interest rates, we would  experience a 3.21% increase in
NPV.

      Certain  shortcomings  are inherent in the  methodology  used in the above
interest rate risk  measurement.  Modeling changes in NPV require making certain
assumptions  that may or may not reflect the manner in which  actual  yields and
costs respond to changes in market interest rates. In this regard, the NPV table
presented  assumes that the  composition  of our  interest-sensitive  assets and
liabilities  existing at the  beginning of a period  remains  constant  over the
period being measured and assumes that a particular  change in interest rates is
reflected  uniformly  across  the yield  curve  regardless  of the  duration  or
repricing  of specific  assets and  liabilities.  Accordingly,  although the NPV
table  provides an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular
point in time,  such  measurements  are not  intended  to and do not  provide  a
precise  forecast of the effect of changes in market  interest  rates on our net
interest income, and will differ from actual results.

ITEM 9A.(T) CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
-----------------------------------

      (a)   Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.

      Under  the  supervision  and with  the  participation  of our  management,
including our Chief Executive  Officer,  Chief  Financial  Officer and Principal
Accounting  Officer,  we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation
of our  disclosure  controls and  procedures  (as defined in Rule  13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e)  under  the  Exchange  Act)  as of the  end of the  fiscal  year  (the
"Evaluation  Date").  Based upon that evaluation,  the Chief Executive  Officer,
Chief Financial Officer and Principal  Accounting  Officer concluded that, as of
the Evaluation Date, our

                                       54

<PAGE>

disclosure controls and procedures were effective in timely alerting them to the
material information relating to us (or our consolidated  subsidiaries) required
to be included in our periodic SEC filings.

      (b)   Management's  Annual  Report  on  Internal  Control  over  Financial
            Reporting

      Management  of BCB Bancorp,  Inc.,  and  subsidiaries  (the  "Company") is
responsible for  establishing  and maintaining  adequate  internal  control over
financial reporting.  The Company's system of internal control is designed under
the supervision of management,  including our Chief Executive  Officer and Chief
Operating Officer, to provide reasonable  assurance regarding the reliability of
our  financial   reporting  and  the  preparation  of  the  Company's  financial
statements for external  reporting  purposes in accordance  with U.S.  generally
accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").

      Our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  includes  policies and
procedures  that  pertain to the  maintenance  of records  that,  in  reasonable
detail,  accurately and fairly reflect  transactions and dispositions of assets;
provide  reasonable  assurances that  transactions  are recorded as necessary to
permit  preparation  of financial  statements in accordance  with GAAP, and that
receipts and expenditures are made only in accordance with the  authorization of
management  and  the  Board  of  Directors;  and  provide  reasonable  assurance
regarding  prevention or timely detection of unauthorized  acquisition,  use, or
disposition  of the  Company's  assets that could have a material  effect on our
financial statements.

      Because of its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections on any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
become  inadequate  because  of  changes  in  conditions  or that the  degree of
compliance with policies and procedures may deteriorate.

      As of December 31, 2008,  management  assessed  the  effectiveness  of the
Company's  internal  control over financial  reporting  based upon the framework
established in Internal  Control - Integrated  Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring  Organizations of the Treadway  Commission (COSO).  Based upon its
assessment,  management  believes  that  the  Company's  internal  control  over
financial  reporting as of December 31, 2008 is effective  using these criteria.
This  annual  report  does not include an  attestation  report of the  company's
registered  public  accounting  firm regarding  internal  control over financial
reporting.  Management's  report was not subject to attestation by the company's
registered  public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities
and Exchange  Commission  that permit the company to provide  only  management's
report in this annual report.

      (c)   Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting.

      There were no significant changes made in our internal controls during the
period  covered by this report or, to our  knowledge,  in other factors that has
materially  affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's
internal control over financial reporting.

      See the  Certifications  pursuant to Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
of 2002.
