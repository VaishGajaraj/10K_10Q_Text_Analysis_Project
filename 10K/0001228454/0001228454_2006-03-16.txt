ITEM 1. BUSINESS
----------------

BCB Bancorp, Inc.
-----------------

     BCB Bancorp, Inc. (the "Company") is a New Jersey corporation, which on May
1, 2003  became  the  holding  company  parent of  Bayonne  Community  Bank (the
"Bank").  The Company has not engaged in any significant business activity other
than owning all of the outstanding  common stock of Bayonne  Community Bank. Our
executive office is located at 104-110 Avenue C, Bayonne,  New Jersey 07002. Our
telephone  number is (201) 823-0700.  At December 31, 2005 we had $466.2 million
in  consolidated  assets,  $362.9  million  in  deposits  and $47.8  million  in
consolidated   stockholders'   equity.  The  Company  is  subject  to  extensive
regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

Recent Events
-------------

     BCB Bancorp,  Inc.  conducted a secondary  public stock offering during the
fourth quarter of 2005.  The Company sold  1,265,000  shares of its common stock
for an aggregate offering price of $19.3 million.  The Company offered 1,100,000
shares of its common stock, (with an over-allotment option of 165,000 shares) to
the public at a price of $15.25.  The stock offering was  underwritten by Janney
Montgomery  Scott LLC on a firm  commitment  basis.  The Company's  registration
statement on Form S-1 (Commission File No. 333-128214) was declared effective by
the  Securities  and Exchange  Commission on December 13, 2005. The Company also
filed a rule  462  registration  statement  on Form  S-1  (Commission  File  No.
333-130307)  which was effective  upon filing on December 14, 2005.  The sale of
the  1.1  million   shares  was   completed  on  December  19,  2005,   and  the
over-allotment  was exercised in full on January 5, 2006.  Expenses of the stock
offering (including the underwriter's  discount) were $1.4 million and were paid
to the underwriters,  underwriters'  counsel,  our counsel,  our printer and our
transfer  agent.  Net proceeds from the stock  offering of  approximately  $17.9
million will be available for  contribution  to capital,  for use in lending and
investing  activities,  for branch expansion and for general corporate purposes.
In the short-term,  the net proceeds have been invested in overnight funds until
we are able to deploy the proceeds as described above.

     In connection  with the secondary  public stock  offering,  the Company was
approved for listing on the Nasdaq National Market. The Company began trading on
Nasdaq National Market on December 14, 2005 under the symbol "BCBP."

     On October 27, 2005, the Company paid a 25% stock dividend to  stockholders
of record as of the close of business on October 13, 2005.

Bayonne Community Bank
----------------------

     Bayonne  Community  Bank was  chartered as a New Jersey bank on October 27,
2000,  and we opened for business on November 1, 2000. We operate  through three
branches in Bayonne,  New Jersey and through  our  executive  office  located at
104-110  Avenue C,  Bayonne,  New Jersey 07002.  Our  telephone  number is (201)
823-0700.  Our deposit  accounts  are insured by the Federal  Deposit  Insurance
Corporation and we are a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System.

<PAGE>

     We are a community-oriented financial institution. Our business is to offer
FDIC-insured  deposit  products and invest funds held in deposit accounts at the
bank,  together with funds generated from operations,  in investment  securities
and loans. We offer our customers:

     o    loans,  including  commercial and multi-family real estate loans, one-
          to four-family mortgage loans, home equity loans,  construction loans,
          consumer  loans and  commercial  business  loans.  In recent years the
          primary  growth in our loan  portfolio  has been in loans  secured  by
          commercial real estate and multi-family properties;
     o    FDIC-insured  deposit  products,  including savings and club accounts,
          non-interest bearing accounts, money market accounts,  certificates of
          deposit and individual retirement accounts; and
     o    retail and commercial banking services including wire transfers, money
          orders,  traveler's  checks,  safe deposit boxes, a night  depository,
          federal  payroll tax deposits,  bond coupon  redemption  and automated
          teller services.

Business Strategy
-----------------

     Our business strategy is to operate as a  well-capitalized,  profitable and
independent  community-oriented  financial  institution  dedicated  to providing
quality customer  service.  Managements'  and the Board of Directors'  extensive
knowledge of the Hudson County market  differentiates  us from our  competitors.
Our  business  strategy  incorporates  the  following  elements:  maintaining  a
community focus, focusing on profitability, continuing our growth, concentrating
on real  estate  based  lending,  capitalizing  on  market  dynamics,  providing
attentive  and  personalized   service  and  attracting   highly  qualified  and
experienced personnel.

     Maintaining a community  focus.  Our management and Board of Directors have
strong ties to the Bayonne  community.  Many members of the management  team are
Bayonne  natives  and are  active  in the  community  through  non-profit  board
membership, local business development organizations, and industry associations.
In addition,  our board members are well established  professionals and business
people in the Bayonne area.  Management and the Board are interested in making a
lasting  contribution to the Bayonne  community and have succeeded in attracting
deposits and loans through attentive and personalized service.

     Focusing  on   profitability.   On  an  operational   basis,   we  achieved
profitability  in our tenth month of operation.  For the year ended December 31,
2005,  our return on average  equity was 16.00% and our return on average assets
was 1.14%.  Our earnings  per diluted  share  increased  from $0.43 for the year
ended  December  31,  2002 to $1.20 for the year  ended  December  31,  2005,  a
compound  annual  growth rate of 40.8%.  We  achieved  this  earnings  growth by
focusing  on  low-cost  deposits  and by tightly  controlling  our  non-interest
expenses.  Management is committed to maintaining  profitability by diversifying
the services we offer. We have a mortgage  banking division as well as a leasing
division to increase our fee-based income.

     Continuing  our growth.  We have  consistently  increased our assets.  From
December 31, 2002 to December 31, 2005,  our assets have  increased  from $183.1
million to $466.2  million.  Over the same time period,  our loan  balances have
increased from $122.1 million to $284.5  million,  while deposits have increased
from $163.5 million to $362.9 million. In addition, we have maintained our asset
quality  ratios while  growing the loan  portfolio.  At December  31, 2005,  our
non-performing assets to total assets ratio was 0.22%.

                                       2

     Concentrating on real estate-based lending. A primary focus of our business
strategy  is  to  originate   loans  secured  by  commercial  and   multi-family
properties.  Such loans  provide  higher  returns than loans  secured by one- to
four-family real estate.  As a result of our underwriting  practices,  including
debt service  requirements  for commercial real estate and  multi-family  loans,
management  believes  that such loans offer us an  opportunity  to obtain higher
returns.

     Capitalizing on market dynamics.  The consolidation of the banking industry
in  Hudson  County  has  created  the  need  for  a  customer   focused  banking
institution.  This  consolidation  has moved  decision  making  away from local,
community-based banks to much larger banks headquartered outside of New Jersey.

     Providing  attentive and  personalized  service.  Management  believes that
providing  attentive and personalized  service is the key to gaining deposit and
loan relationships in Bayonne and its surrounding communities.  Since inception,
our branches have been open 7 days per week.

     Attracting highly experienced and qualified personnel. An important part of
our strategy is to hire bankers who have prior  experience  in the Hudson County
market as well as pre-existing business  relationships.  Our management team has
an average  of 27 years of  banking  experience,  while our  lenders  and branch
personnel  have  significant  prior  experience at community  banks and regional
banks in Hudson  County.  It is a fundamental  belief of management  that having
knowledge of the Hudson  County  market is a critical  element in the success of
Bayonne  Community  Bank.   Management's   extensive   knowledge  of  the  local
communities  has  allowed us to  develop  and  implement  a highly  focused  and
disciplined  approach  to  lending  and has  enabled  the bank to attract a high
percentage of low cost deposits.

Our Market Area
---------------

     We are  located in the City of Bayonne,  Hudson  County,  New  Jersey.  The
Bank's  locations  are easily  accessible  to  provide  convenient  services  to
businesses and individuals throughout our market area.

     Our market area  includes the city of Bayonne,  Jersey City and portions of
Hoboken,  New Jersey.  These areas are all  considered  "bedroom" or  "commuter"
communities  to  Manhattan.  Our  market  area is  well-served  by a network  of
arterial roadways including Route 440 and the New Jersey Turnpike.

     Our  market  area  has  a  high  level  of  commercial  business  activity.
Businesses are concentrated in the service sector and retail trade areas.  Major
employers  in our market area  include  Bayonne  Medical  Center and the Bayonne
Board of Education.

Competition
-----------

     The  banking  business  in New  Jersey is  extremely  competitive.  We will
compete  for  deposits  and loans with  existing  New  Jersey  and  out-of-state
financial  institutions  that have longer  operating  histories,  larger capital
reserves and more  established  customer bases.  Our competition  includes large
financial  service  companies  and other  entities in  addition  to

                                       3
<PAGE>

traditional banking institutions such as savings and loan associations,  savings
banks, commercial banks and credit unions.

     Our larger  competitors  have a greater  ability  to  finance  wide-ranging
advertising  campaigns  through their greater capital  resources.  Our marketing
efforts   depend   heavily  upon  referrals  from  officers  and  directors  and
stockholders,   selective   advertising   in  local   media  and   direct   mail
solicitations.  We compete  for  business  principally  on the basis of personal
service  to  customers,  customer  access  to our  officers  and  directors  and
competitive interest rates and fees.

     In the financial services industry in recent years, intense market demands,
technological and regulatory changes and economic pressures have eroded industry
classifications  that were  once  clearly  defined.  Banks  have been  forced to
diversify their  services,  increase rates paid on deposits and become more cost
effective,  as a result of  competition  with one  another and with new types of
financial service  companies,  including  non-banking  competitors.  Some of the
results of these market dynamics in the financial  services industry have been a
number of new bank and non-bank  competitors,  increased  merger  activity,  and
increased   customer   awareness  of  product  and  service   differences  among
competitors. These factors could affect our business prospects.

     Commercial  and   Multi-family   Real  Estate  Loans.  Our  commercial  and
multi-family  real  estate  loans are  secured by  commercial  real  estate (for
example,  shopping centers, medical buildings,  retail offices) and multi-family
residential  units,  consisting  of five  or  more  units.  Permanent  loans  on
commercial and multi-family properties are generally originated in amounts up to
75% of the appraised value of the property. Our commercial real estate loans are
secured  by  improved  property  such  as  office   buildings,   retail  stores,
warehouses, church buildings and other non-residential buildings. Commercial and
multi-family real estate loans are generally made at rates that adjust above the
five year U.S.  Treasury  interest  rate,  with terms of up to 25 years,  or are
balloon loans with fixed interest rates which generally  mature in three to five
years with principal  amortization  for a period of up to 30 years.  Our largest
commercial  loan had a principal  balance of $2.6  million at December 31, 2005,
and was  secured  by a  mixed  use  property  comprised  of  retail  and  office
facilities.  Our  largest  multi-family  loan had a  principal  balance  of $1.5
million at December 31, 2005.  Both loans were  performing  in  accordance  with
their terms on that date.

     Loans  secured by  commercial  and  multi-family  real estate are generally
larger and involve a greater degree of risk than one- to four-family residential
mortgage  loans.  The borrower's  creditworthiness  and the feasibility and cash
flow potential of the project is of

                                       6
<PAGE>

primary  concern in  commercial  and  multi-family  real estate  lending.  Loans
secured by income properties are generally larger and involve greater risks than
residential   mortgage  loans  because  payments  on  loans  secured  by  income
properties are often dependent on the successful  operation or management of the
properties.  As a result,  repayment  of such  loans may be subject to a greater
extent than  residential  real estate  loans to adverse  conditions  in the real
estate market or the economy. We intend to continue  emphasizing the origination
of loans secured by commercial real estate and multi-family properties.

     One- to Four-Family Lending.  Our one- to four-family  residential mortgage
loans are secured by property  located in the State of New Jersey.  We generally
originate one- to four-family residential mortgage loans in amounts up to 80% of
the lesser of the appraised  value or selling  price of the  mortgaged  property
without requiring mortgage insurance. We will originate loans with loan to value
ratios up to 90% provided the borrowers  obtain private mortgage  insurance.  We
originate both fixed rate and adjustable rate loans.  One- to four-family  loans
may have terms of up to 30 years.  The majority of one- to four-family  loans we
originate for retention in our portfolio have terms no greater than 15 years. We
offer  adjustable  rate loans with fixed rate periods of up to five years,  with
principal and interest calculated using a maximum 30-year  amortization  period.
We offer these  loans with a fixed rate for the first five years with  repricing
following every year after the initial period.  Adjustable rate loans may adjust
up to 200 basis points  annually and 600 basis points over the term of the loan.
In August 2003, through our mortgage banking division,  we began to broker for a
third party lender one-to  four-family  residential  loans, which were primarily
fixed rate loans with terms of 30 years. Our loan brokerage activities permit us
to offer customers longer-term fixed rate loans we would not otherwise originate
while  providing a source of fee income.  During 2005, we brokered $17.1 million
in one-to four-family loans and received $252,000 in fee income from the sale of
such loans.

     All of our one- to  four-family  mortgages  include "due on sale"  clauses,
which are provisions  giving us the right to declare a loan immediately  payable
if the borrower  sells or  otherwise  transfers an interest in the property to a
third party.

     Property  appraisals on real estate securing our single-family  residential
loans are made by state certified and licensed  independent  appraisers approved
by  our  Board  of  Directors.  Appraisals  are  performed  in  accordance  with
applicable  regulations and policies. At our discretion,  we obtain either title
insurance  policies or attorneys'  certificates  of title, on all first mortgage
real estate loans originated. We also require fire and casualty insurance on all
properties  securing our one-to  four-family loans. We also require the borrower
to obtain flood insurance where appropriate.  In some instances, we charge a fee
equal to a percentage of the loan amount commonly referred to as points.

     Construction  Loans. We offer loans to finance the  construction of various
types of commercial and  residential  property.  We originated  $35.8 million of
such loans  during the year  ended  December  31,  2005.  Construction  loans to
builders  generally are offered with terms of up to eighteen months and interest
rates are tied to prime rate plus a margin. These loans generally are offered as
adjustable  rate loans.  We will originate  residential  construction  loans for
individual borrowers and builders,  provided all necessary plans and permits are
in order.  Construction loan funds are disbursed as the project  progresses.  At
December 31, 2005,  our

                                       7
<PAGE>

largest  construction  loan was $2.2 million,  of which  $612,000 was disbursed.
This  construction  loan  has  been  made for the  construction  of  residential
properties. At December 31, 2005 this loan was performing in accordance with its
terms.

     Construction  financing is generally  considered to involve a higher degree
of risk of loss than long-term financing on improved, occupied real estate. Risk
of loss on a  construction  loan is  dependent  largely upon the accuracy of the
initial  estimate of the  property's  value at  completion of  construction  and
development and the estimated cost (including interest) of construction.  During
the  construction  phase,  a number of factors  could  result in delays and cost
overruns. If the estimate of construction costs proves to be inaccurate,  we may
be required to advance  funds beyond the amount  originally  committed to permit
completion of the project.  Additionally,  if the estimate of value proves to be
inaccurate,  we may be confronted, at or prior to the maturity of the loan, with
a project having a value which is insufficient to assure full repayment.

     Home  Equity  Loans and Home Equity  Lines of Credit.  We offer home equity
loans and lines of credit that are secured by the borrower's  primary residence.
Our home equity loans can be  structured  as loans that are disbursed in full at
closing or as lines of credit. Home equity loans and lines of credit are offered
with terms up to 15 years. Virtually all of our home equity loans are originated
with fixed rates of interest and home equity lines of credit are originated with
adjustable interest rates tied to the prime rate. Home equity loans and lines of
credit are  underwritten  under the same criteria that we use to underwrite one-
to four-family  loans. Home equity loans and lines of credit may be underwritten
with a  loan-to-value  ratio of 80% when combined with the principal  balance of
the existing  mortgage  loan. At the time we close a home equity loan or line of
credit,  we file a mortgage to perfect our security  interest in the  underlying
collateral.  At December 31, 2005, the outstanding balances of home equity loans
and lines of credit totaled $24.3 million, or 8.4% of our loan portfolio.

     Commercial  Business Loans. Our commercial  business loans are underwritten
on the basis of the  borrower's  ability to service such debt from  income.  Our
underwriting  standards for  commercial  business  loans include a review of the
applicant's tax returns, financial statements,  credit history and an assessment
of the  applicant's  ability to meet  existing  obligations  and payments on the
proposed  loan  based  on  cash  flow  generated  by the  applicant's  business.
Commercial  business loans are generally  made to small and mid-sized  companies
located within the State of New Jersey. In most cases, we require  collateral of
equipment, accounts receivable, inventory, chattel or other assets before making
a commercial business loan. Our largest commercial business loan at December 31,
2005 had a  principal  balance of $1.3  million  and was  secured by  marketable
equity securities.  We have also received personal guarantees from the borrower,
principals of the borrower and a director of BCB Bancorp, Inc.

     Commercial  business  loans  generally  have higher rates and shorter terms
than one- to  four-family  residential  loans,  but they may also involve higher
average  balances and a higher risk of default since their  repayment  generally
depends on the successful operation of the borrower's business.

                                       8
<PAGE>

     Consumer  Loans.  We make various types of secured and  unsecured  consumer
loans and loans that are  collateralized by new and used  automobiles.  Consumer
loans generally have terms of three years to ten years.

     Consumer  loans are  advantageous  to us  because  of their  interest  rate
sensitivity,  but they also involve more credit risk than  residential  mortgage
loans because of the higher potential for default,  the nature of the collateral
and the difficulty in disposing of the collateral.

     The  following  table  shows  our  loan  origination,  purchase,  sale  and
repayment activities for the periods indicated.

     Loan Approval  Authority and  Underwriting.  We establish  various  lending
limits for executive  management  and also maintain a loan  committee.  The loan
committee is comprised of the Chairman of the Board,  the President,  the Senior
Lending  Officer and five  non-employee  members of the Board of Directors.  The
President or the Senior Lending  Officer,  together with one other loan officer,
have  authority  to approve  applications  for real estate loans up to

                                       9
<PAGE>

$500,000,  other secured loans up to $500,000 and unsecured loans up to $25,000.
The loan  committee  considers all  applications  in excess of the above lending
limits and the entire board of directors ratifies all such loans.

     Upon receipt of a completed loan application from a prospective borrower, a
credit report is ordered.  Income and certain other information is verified.  If
necessary,  additional financial  information may be requested.  An appraisal is
required for the  underwriting of all one- to four-family  loans. We may rely on
an estimate of value of real estate  performed by our Senior Lending Officer for
home equity loans or lines of credit of up to $250,000. Appraisals are processed
by state certified independent appraisers approved by the Board of Directors.

     An attorney's certificate of title is required on all newly originated real
estate mortgage  loans. In connection with  refinancing and home equity loans or
lines of credit in  amounts  up to  $250,000,  we will  obtain a record  owner's
search in lieu of an attorney's certificate of title. Borrowers also must obtain
fire and casualty  insurance.  Flood insurance is also required on loans secured
by property that is located in a flood zone.

     Loan Commitments. Written commitments are given to prospective borrowers on
all approved real estate loans.  Generally,  we honor  commitments  for up to 60
days from the date of  issuance.  At December  31, 2005,  our  outstanding  loan
origination commitments totaled $15.0 million, outstanding construction loans in
progress  totaled $20.0 million and  undisbursed  lines of credit  totaled $10.2
million.

Non-performing and Problem Assets
---------------------------------

     Loan Delinquencies.  We send a notice of nonpayment to borrowers when their
mortgage loan becomes 15 days past due. If such payment is not received by month
end, an additional notice of nonpayment is sent to the borrower.  After 60 days,
if payment is still delinquent, a notice of right to cure default is sent to the
borrower giving 30 additional days to bring the loan current before  foreclosure
is commenced.  If the loan continues in a delinquent status for 90 days past due
and no repayment plan is in effect, foreclosure proceedings will be initiated.

     Loans are  reviewed  and are placed on a  non-accrual  status when the loan
becomes more than 120 days delinquent or when, in our opinion, the collection of
additional interest is doubtful.  Interest accrued and unpaid at the time a loan
is placed on nonaccrual  status is charged against interest  income.  Subsequent
interest  payments,  if any,  are either  applied to the  outstanding  principal
balance or recorded as  interest  income,  depending  on the  assessment  of the
ultimate  collectability  of the loan.  At December 31, 2005, we had $787,000 in
non-accruing  loans. Our largest exposure of  non-performing  loans at that date
consisted  of two loans to a borrower,  which in the  aggregate  had a principal
balance of $555,000.  The loans comprising this lending relationship are secured
by a commercial building.  In January 2005, we had an appraisal completed on the
commercial building. At that time, the property was appraised for $995,000.  The
borrower has filed for bankruptcy protection. Consequently, we cannot be assured
that we will not incur a loss on our loans to this  borrower.  At  December  31,
2005, we had two loans  totaling  $245,000 that were  delinquent 90 days or more
and accruing.

                                       10
<PAGE>

     A loan is  considered  impaired  when it is probable the borrower  will not
repay  the  loan  according  to the  original  contractual  terms  of  the  loan
agreement.  We have determined  that first mortgage loans on one-to  four-family
properties  and all consumer  loans  represent  large groups of  smaller-balance
homogeneous  loans  that  are  collectively  evaluated.  Additionally,  we  have
determined that an insignificant delay (less than 90 days) will not cause a loan
to be classified as impaired and a loan is not impaired during a period of delay
in payment,  if we expect to collect all amounts due including  interest accrued
at the  contractual  interest  rate for the  period of delay.  We  independently
evaluate all loans identified as impaired. We estimate credit losses on impaired
loans based on the present value of expected cash flows or the fair value of the
underlying  collateral  if the  loan  repayment  is  derived  from  the  sale or
operation of such  collateral.  Impaired loans,  or portions of such loans,  are
charged off when we  determine  that a realized  loss has  occurred.  Until such
time,  an allowance for loan losses is maintained  for  estimated  losses.  Cash
receipts on  impaired  loans are applied  first to accrued  interest  receivable
unless  otherwise  required by the loan terms,  except when an impaired  loan is
also a nonaccrual  loan,  in which case the portion of the  receipts  related to
interest is  recognized  as income.  At December  31,  2005,  we had three loans
totaling  $705,000  which are  classified  as  impaired  and on which  loan loss
allowances totaling $214,000 have been established. During 2005, interest income
of $7,000 was recognized on impaired loans.

         The following table sets forth  delinquencies  in our loan portfolio as
of the dates indicated:

     The table  below sets forth the amounts and  categories  of  non-performing
assets in the Bank's loan portfolio. Loans are placed on non-accrual status when
the  collection of principal  and/or  interest  become  doubtful.  For all years
presented, Bayonne Community Bank has had no troubled debt restructurings (which
involve  forgiving  a portion of interest  or  principal  on any loans or making
loans at a rate  materially less than that of market rates).  Foreclosed  assets
include assets acquired in settlement of loans.

     For the year ended  December 31, 2005,  gross  interest  income which would
have been recorded had our  non-accruing  loans been current in accordance  with
their original terms  amounted to $66,000.  We received and recorded  $10,000 in
interest income for such loans for the year ended December 31, 2005.

     Classified  Assets.  Our policies provide for a  classification  system for
problem assets. Under this classification  system, problem assets are classified
as  "substandard,"   "doubtful,"  "loss"  or  "special  mention."  An  asset  is
considered  substandard if it is inadequately protected by its current net worth
and paying  capacity  of the  borrower  or of the  collateral  pledged,  if any.
Substandard  assets include those  characterized  by the "distinct  possibility"
that "some loss" will be sustained if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets
classified  as doubtful  have all the  weaknesses  inherent in those  classified
substandard  with the  added  characteristic  that the  weakness  present  makes
"collection or liquidation  in full" on the basis of currently  existing  facts,
conditions,  and values, "highly questionable and improbable." Assets classified
as loss are those considered "uncollectible" and of such little value that their
continuance  as assets without the  establishment  of a specific loss reserve is
not warranted,  and the loan is  charged-off.  Assets may be designated  special
mention  because  of  potential   weaknesses  that  do  not  currently   warrant
classification in one of the aforementioned categories.

     When we classify problem assets,  we may establish  general  allowances for
loan  losses in an amount  deemed  prudent  by  management.  General  allowances
represent loss allowances  which have been established to recognize the inherent
risk associated with lending activities,  but which, unlike specific allowances,
have not been allocated to particular  problem assets. A portion of general loss
allowances  established to cover possible losses related to assets classified as
substandard or doubtful may be included in determining  our regulatory  capital.
Specific  valuation  allowances  for loan  losses  generally  do not  qualify as
regulatory  capital.  At December 31, 2005, we had $150,000 in assets classified
as doubtful,  $1.0 million in assets  classified as substandard  and $637,000 in
assets  classified  as special  mention.  The loans  classified  as doubtful and
substandard  represent primarily  commercial loans secured either by

                                       14
<PAGE>

residential real estate,  commercial real estate or heavy  equipment.  The loans
that have been classified  substandard were classified as such primarily because
either  updated  financial  information  has not been  timely  provided,  or the
collateral underlying the loan is in the process of being revalued.

     In addition to loans that have been classified, management has identified a
lending  relationship that merits  additional  scrutiny for reasons unrelated to
the performance of the loans. This borrowing relationship consists of six loans,
which had a total  principal  balance at December 31, 2005 of $1.8 million.  The
largest  single  loan had a total  principal  balance at  December  31,  2005 of
$402,000.  The six loans are secured by mixed-use real estate.  The loans in the
aggregate have a loan value ratio of 70%.  These loans are currently  performing
in accordance with their terms.

     Allowances  for Loan  Losses.  A  provision  for loan  losses is charged to
operations  based on management's  evaluation of the losses that may be incurred
in our loan portfolio. The evaluation,  including a review of all loans on which
full  collectability  of interest and principal  may not be reasonably  assured,
considers:  (1) the risk  characteristics  of the loan  portfolio;  (2)  current
economic conditions; (3) actual losses previously experienced;  (4) the level of
loan  growth;  and (5) the  existing  level of reserves for loan losses that are
possible and estimable.

     We  monitor  our  allowance  for  loan  losses  and make  additions  to the
allowance as economic conditions dictate. Although we maintain our allowance for
loan losses at a level that we consider  adequate for the inherent  risk of loss
in our  loan  portfolio,  future  losses  could  exceed  estimated  amounts  and
additional  provisions  for loan losses  could be  required.  In  addition,  our
determination  of the  amount of the  allowance  for loan  losses is  subject to
review by the New Jersey  Department  of Banking and  Insurance and the FDIC, as
part of their examination process.  After a review of the information available,
our regulators might require the establishment of an additional  allowance.  Any
increase in the loan loss allowance required by regulators would have a negative
impact on our earnings.

     Allocation  of  the  Allowance  for  Loan  Losses.   The  following   table
illustrates the allocation of the allowance for loan losses for each category of
loan.  The  allocation  of the  allowance  to each  category is not  necessarily
indicative of future loss in any  particular  category and does not restrict our
use of the allowance to absorb losses in other loan categories.

Investment Activities
---------------------

     Investment  Securities.  We  are  required  under  federal  regulations  to
maintain a minimum  amount of liquid  assets that may be  invested in  specified
short-term securities and certain other investments.  The level of liquid assets
varies depending upon several factors,  including:  (i) the yields on investment
alternatives,  (ii) our  judgment  as to the  attractiveness  of the yields then
available in relation to other opportunities,  (iii) expectation of future yield
levels,  and (iv) our  projections as to the  short-term  demand for funds to be
used in loan origination and other activities.  Investment securities, including
mortgage-backed  securities,  are classified at the time of purchase, based upon
management's  intentions  and  abilities,  as  securities   held-to-maturity  or
securities  available  for sale.  Debt  securities  acquired with the intent and
ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and are stated at
cost and adjusted for  amortization of premium and accretion of discount,  which
are  computed  using the level yield method and  recognized  as  adjustments  of
interest income.  All other debt securities are classified as available for sale
to serve principally as a source of liquidity.

     Current   regulatory  and  accounting   guidelines   regarding   investment
securities require us to categorize securities as "held-to-maturity," "available
for sale" or  "trading."  As of  December  31,  2005,  we had $140.0  million of
securities  classified as  "held-to-maturity,"  and no securities  classified as
available for sale or trading. Securities classified as "available for sale" are
reported  for  financial  reporting  purposes at the fair market  value with net
changes  in the

                                       17
<PAGE>

market  value  from  period  to  period  included  as a  separate  component  of
stockholders'  equity, net of income taxes. At December 31, 2005, our securities
classified as held-to-maturity had a market value of $137.8 million.  Changes in
the market value of classified as securities  held-to-maturity do not affect our
income.  Management  has the intent and we have the  ability to hold  securities
classified as held-to-maturity.  During the year ended December 31, 2005, we had
securities sales of $7.3 million  consisting of  mortgage-backed  securities and
U.S.  Government  and agency  securities.  The sales were made in reliance  upon
guidance set forth in SFAS 115 relating to the sale of securities  classified as
held-to-maturity,  when  over  85%  of the  original  principal  balance  of the
securities had been repaid, or where there was a significant  probability of the
securities being called within three months.

     At  December  31,  2005,  our  investment  policy  allowed  investments  in
instruments such as: (i) U.S. Treasury obligations;  (ii) U.S. federal agency or
federally sponsored agency obligations;  (iii) mortgage-backed  securities;  and
(iv)  certificates of deposit.  The board of directors may authorize  additional
investments.  At December 31, 2005 our U.S. Government agency securities totaled
$109.1  million,  all of which were  classified  as  held-to-maturity  and which
primarily  consisted  of  callable  securities  issued by  government  sponsored
enterprises.

     As a source of liquidity and to supplement our lending activities,  we have
invested in residential mortgage-backed  securities.  Mortgage-backed securities
generally yield less than the loans that underlie such securities because of the
cost of payment  guarantees  or credit  enhancements  that reduce  credit  risk.
Mortgage-backed  securities can serve as collateral for borrowings and,  through
repayments,  as a source of liquidity.  Mortgage-backed  securities  represent a
participation  interest in a pool of  single-family  or other type of mortgages.
Principal  and  interest  payments  are passed  from the  mortgage  originators,
through intermediaries  (generally  government-sponsored  enterprises) that pool
and  repackage  the  participation  interests  in the  form  of  securities,  to
investors,  like us. The government-sponsored  enterprises guarantee the payment
of principal and interest to investors and include  Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae, and
Fannie Mae.

     Mortgage-backed  securities  typically  are issued  with  stated  principal
amounts. The securities are backed by pools of mortgage loans that have interest
rates that are within a set range and have varying  maturities.  The  underlying
pool of  mortgages  can be  composed  of either  fixed rate or  adjustable  rate
mortgage loans. Mortgage-backed securities are generally referred to as mortgage
participation certificates or pass-through certificates.  The interest rate risk
characteristics  of the  underlying  pool  of  mortgages  (i.e.,  fixed  rate or
adjustable  rate) and the  prepayment  risk,  are  passed on to the  certificate
holder. The life of a mortgage-backed pass-through security is equal to the life
of the underlying  mortgages.  Expected  maturities will differ from contractual
maturities due to scheduled  repayments and because borrowers may have the right
to call or prepay obligations with or without prepayment penalties.

Sources of Funds
----------------

     Our  major  external  source  of funds for  lending  and  other  investment
purposes  are  deposits.  Funds are also derived from the receipt of payments on
loans and  prepayment  of loans and  maturities  of  investment  securities  and
mortgage-backed  securities and borrowings.  Scheduled loan principal repayments
are a relatively stable source of funds,  while deposit inflows and outflows and
loan  prepayments  are  significantly  influenced by general  interest rates and
market conditions.

     Deposits.  Consumer and commercial deposits are attracted  principally from
within our primary  market area  through the  offering of a selection of deposit
instruments  including  demand,  NOW,  savings and club  accounts,  money market
accounts, and term certificate accounts. Deposit account terms vary according to
the minimum balance required,  the time period the funds must remain on deposit,
and the interest rate.

     The interest  rates paid by us on deposits are set at the  direction of our
senior  management.  Interest  rates  are  determined  based  on  our  liquidity
requirements,  interest rates paid by our competitors,  and our growth goals and
applicable  regulatory  restrictions and requirements.  At December 31, 2005, we
had no brokered deposits.

     Deposit  Accounts.  The  following  table sets  forth the dollar  amount of
savings  deposits in the various types of deposit  programs we offered as of the
dates indicated.

     Borrowings.  Our advances from the FHLB of New York are secured by a pledge
of our  stock in the FHLB of New  York,  and  investment  securities.  Each FHLB
credit program has its own interest rate, which may be fixed or adjustable,  and
range of maturities.  If the need arises, we may also access the Federal Reserve
Bank discount  window to supplement  our supply of funds that we can loan and to
meet deposit withdrawal  requirements.  During the years ended December 31, 2005
and 2004, we had average short-term borrowings,  consisting of FHLB advances, of
$9.7 million and $23.4 million,  respectively,  with a weighted  average cost of
3.14% and 1.54%,  respectively.  Our maximum short-term  borrowings  outstanding
during 2005 and 2004 was $21.4 million and $25.0 million, respectively.

Employees
---------

     At December 31, 2005, we had 63 full-time and 27 part-time employees.  None
of our employees is represented  by a collective  bargaining  group.  We believe
that our relationship with our employees is good.

Subsidiaries
------------

     We have two non-bank subsidiaries. BCB Holding Company Investment Corp. was
established in 2004 for the purpose of holding and investing in securities. Only
securities  authorized to be purchased by Bayonne Community Bank are held by BCB
Holding Company  Investment Corp. At December 31, 2005, this company held $140.0
million in securities.

     Our other  subsidiary,  BCB Equipment  Leasing LLC, is a  participant  in a
joint  venture  for the  purpose of  assisting  in  financing  arrangements  for
companies entering into equipment leases. The activities of this subsidiary have
been nominal to date. The impact of this  subsidiary on our financial  condition
and results of operation has not been material.

Supervision and Regulation
--------------------------

     Bank  holding  companies  and banks are  extensively  regulated  under both
federal  and state  law.  These laws and  regulations  are  intended  to protect
depositors,  not  shareholders.  To the extent  that the  following  information
describes statutory and regulatory  provisions,  it is qualified in its entirety
by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory  provisions.  Any change
in the applicable  law or regulation may have a material  effect on the business
and prospects of the Company and the Bank.

Bank Holding Company Regulation
-------------------------------

     As a bank holding  company  registered  under the Bank Holding Company Act,
the Company is subject to the  regulation  and  supervision  applicable  to bank
holding  companies by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  The
Company is required to file with the Federal  Reserve  annual  reports and other
information regarding its business operations and those of its subsidiaries.

     The Bank  Holding  Company  Act  requires,  among other  things,  the prior
approval  of the  Federal  Reserve  in any  case  where a bank  holding  company
proposes  to (i)  acquire  all or  substantially  all of the assets of any other
bank,  (ii) acquire  direct or indirect  ownership or control of more than 5% of
the  outstanding  voting  stock of any bank  (unless it owns a majority  of such
company's  voting  shares)  or (iii)  merge or  consolidate  with any other bank
holding company.  The Federal Reserve will not approve any acquisition,  merger,
or consolidation that would have a substantially anti-competitive effect, unless
the anti-competitive impact of the proposed transaction is clearly outweighed by
a greater public  interest in meeting the convenience and needs of the community
to be served.  The Federal  Reserve also  considers  capital  adequacy and other
financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the companies and the
banks concerned,  together with the convenience and needs of the community to be
served, when reviewing acquisitions or mergers.

     The Bank Holding  Company Act generally  prohibits a bank holding  company,
with certain  limited  exceptions,  from (i)  acquiring  or retaining  direct or
indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the outstanding voting stock of
any  company  which  is not a bank or bank  holding  company,  or (ii)  engaging
directly or indirectly in  activities  other than those of banking,  managing or
controlling  banks,  or performing  services for its  subsidiaries,  unless such
non-

                                       23
<PAGE>

banking  business is determined by the Federal  Reserve to be so closely related
to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be properly incident thereto.

     The Bank  Holding  Company  Act has been  amended  to permit  bank  holding
companies  and banks,  which meet  certain  capital,  management  and  Community
Reinvestment  Act  standards,  to  engage  in a  broader  range  of  non-banking
activities.  In addition, bank holding companies which elect to become financial
holding  companies  may engage in certain  banking  and  non-banking  activities
without prior Federal Reserve approval. Finally, the Financial Modernization Act
imposes certain privacy  requirements  on all financial  institutions  and their
treatment of consumer information.  At this time, the Company has elected not to
become a financial holding company,  as it does not engage in any activities not
permissible for banks.

     There are a number of obligations and restrictions  imposed on bank holding
companies and their  depository  institution  subsidiaries by law and regulatory
policy that are designed to minimize  potential  loss to the  depositors of such
depository institutions and the FDIC insurance funds in the event the depository
institution is in danger of default.  Under a policy of the Federal Reserve with
respect to bank holding company  operations,  a bank holding company is required
to  serve  as a  source  of  financial  strength  to its  subsidiary  depository
institutions   and  to  commit   resources  to  support  such   institutions  in
circumstances  where it might not do so absent such policy.  The Federal Reserve
also has the  authority  under the Bank  Holding  Company  Act to require a bank
holding company to terminate any activity or to relinquish control of a non-bank
subsidiary  upon the  Federal  Reserve's  determination  that such  activity  or
control  constitutes a serious risk to the financial  soundness and stability of
any bank subsidiary of the bank holding company.

Capital Adequacy Guidelines for Bank Holding Companies
------------------------------------------------------

     The Federal  Reserve has adopted  risk-based  capital  guidelines  for bank
holding  companies.  The  risk-based  capital  guidelines  are  designed to make
regulatory  capital  requirements  more sensitive to differences in risk profile
among  banks and bank  holding  companies,  to  account  for  off-balance  sheet
exposure,  and to minimize  disincentives for holding liquid assets. Under these
guidelines,  assets  and  off-balance  sheet  items are  assigned  to broad risk
categories each with appropriate weights. The resulting capital ratios represent
capital as a percentage  of total  risk-weighted  assets and  off-balance  sheet
items.

     The  minimum  ratio of total  capital to  risk-weighted  assets  (including
certain off-balance sheet activities,  such as standby letters of credit) is 8%.
At least 4% of the total capital is required to be "Tier I Capital,"  consisting
of common  shareholders'  equity and qualifying  preferred  stock,  less certain
goodwill items and other  intangible  assets.  The remainder ("Tier II Capital")
may consist of (a) the allowance for loan losses of up to 1.25% of risk-weighted
assets, (b) non-qualifying preferred stock, (c) hybrid capital instruments,  (d)
perpetual  debt,  (e)  mandatory  convertible  securities,  and  (f)  qualifying
subordinated  debt  and  intermediate-term  preferred  stock up to 50% of Tier I
capital.  Total capital is the sum of Tier I and Tier II capital less reciprocal
holdings of other banking  organizations'  capital  instruments,  investments in
unconsolidated  subsidiaries  and any  other  deductions  as  determined  by the
Federal  Reserve  (determined  on a case by case  basis or as a matter of policy
after formal rule-making).

                                       24
<PAGE>

     Bank  holding  company  assets are given  risk-weights  of 0%, 20%, 50% and
100%. In addition,  certain  off-balance  sheet items are given  similar  credit
conversion  factors  to  convert  them to asset  equivalent  amounts to which an
appropriate  risk-weight  will  apply.  These  computations  result in the total
risk-weighted assets. Most loans are assigned to the 100% risk category,  except
for performing first mortgage loans fully secured by residential  property which
carry a 50% risk-weighting and loans secured by deposits in the Bank which carry
a 20% risk-weighting.  Most investment securities (including, primarily, general
obligation  claims of  states  or other  political  subdivisions  of the  United
States) are assigned to the 20% category,  except for municipal or state revenue
bonds, which have a 50% risk-weight, and direct obligations of the U.S. Treasury
or obligations backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government, which
have a 0%  risk-weight.  In converting  off-balance  sheet items,  direct credit
substitutes  including general  guarantees and standby letters of credit backing
financial  obligations  are  given a 100%  risk-weighting.  Transaction  related
contingencies such as bid bonds,  standby letters of credit backing nonfinancial
obligations,  and undrawn commitments (including commercial credit lines with an
initial  maturity of more than one year) have a 50%  risk-weighting.  Short-term
commercial  letters of credit have a 20%  risk-weighting  and certain short-term
unconditionally cancelable commitments have a 0% risk-weighting.

     In addition to the risk-based capital  guidelines,  the Federal Reserve has
adopted a minimum Tier I capital  (leverage)  ratio,  under which a bank holding
company  must  maintain  a minimum  level of Tier I  capital  to  average  total
consolidated  assets of at least 3% in the case of a bank  holding  company that
has  the  highest  regulatory   examination  rating  and  is  not  contemplating
significant  growth or expansion.  All other bank holding companies are expected
to  maintain  a  leverage  ratio of at least 100 to 200 basis  points  above the
stated minimum.

Bank Regulation
---------------

     As a New  Jersey-chartered  commercial  bank,  the Bank is  subject  to the
regulation, supervision, and examination of the New Jersey Department of Banking
and Insurance. As an FDIC-insured institution, we are subject to the regulation,
supervision  and  examination of the FDIC, an agency of the federal  government.
The  regulations  of the FDIC  and the New  Jersey  Department  of  Banking  and
Insurance impact virtually all of our activities, including the minimum level of
capital we must maintain,  our ability to pay  dividends,  our ability to expand
through new branches or acquisitions and various other matters.

     Insurance of Deposits. Our deposits are insured up to a maximum of $100,000
per  depositor  under  the  Bank  Insurance  Fund  of the  FDIC.  The  FDIC  has
established  a  risk-based   assessment   system  for  all  insured   depository
institutions.  Under the risk-based assessment system, deposit insurance premium
rates range from 0-27 basis points of assessed deposits.

     On  February  15,  2006,  federal  legislation  to reform  federal  deposit
insurance was signed into law. This law requires, among other things, the merger
of the Savings  Association  Insurance  Fund and the Bank  Insurance Fund into a
unified  insurance  deposit fund,  an increase in the amount of federal  deposit
insurance  coverage from $100,000 to $130,000 (with a cost of living  adjustment
to become  effective  in five  years),  and the reserve  ratio to be modified to
provide for a range between 1.15% and 1.50% of estimated insured  deposits.  The
law requires the FDIC to issue implementing regulations and the changes required
by the law will not become

                                       25
<PAGE>

effective until final regulations have been issued,  which must be no later than
270 days from February 15, 2006.

     Capital Adequacy  Guidelines.  The FDIC has promulgated  risk-based capital
guidelines,  which are designed to make  regulatory  capital  requirements  more
sensitive to differences in risk profile among banks, to account for off-balance
sheet exposure,  and to minimize  disincentives for holding liquid assets. Under
these guidelines,  assets and off-balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk
categories,   each  with  appropriate  weights.  The  resulting  capital  ratios
represent capital as a percentage of total risk-weighted  assets and off-balance
sheet items.  These guidelines are substantially  similar to the Federal Reserve
guidelines discussed above.

     In addition to the risk-based  capital  guidelines,  the FDIC has adopted a
minimum Tier 1 capital  (leverage)  ratio.  This  measurement  is  substantially
similar to the Federal Reserve leverage capital measurement  discussed above. At
December 31, 2005, the Bank's ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets was
12.62%.  Our Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted  assets was 11.59%,  and our Tier 1
capital to average assets was 7.75%.

     Dividends.  The Bank may pay dividends as declared from time to time by the
Board  of  Directors  out  of  funds  legally  available,   subject  to  certain
restrictions.  Under the New Jersey  Banking Act of 1948, the Bank may not pay a
cash dividend  unless,  following the payment,  the Bank's capital stock will be
unimpaired  and the Bank  will  have a  surplus  of no less than 50% of the Bank
capital  stock or, if not,  the  payment  of the  dividend  will not  reduce the
surplus. In addition, the Bank cannot pay dividends in amounts that would reduce
the Bank's capital below regulatory imposed minimums.

The USA PATRIOT Act
-------------------

     In response to the terrorist  events of September 11, 2001, the Uniting and
Strengthening  America by Providing  Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and
Obstruct  Terrorism  Act of 2001, or the USA PATRIOT Act, was signed into law on
October 26, 2001. The USA PATRIOT Act gives the federal government new powers to
address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures,  expanded
surveillance  powers,  increased  information  sharing and broadened  anti-money
laundering requirements. For years, financial institutions such as the Bank have
been subject to federal  anti-money  laundering  obligations.  As such, the bank
does  not  believe  the USA  PATRIOT  Act will  have a  material  impact  on its
operations.

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
--------------------------

     The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002  ("Sarbanes-Oxley"),  contains a broad range
of legislative  reforms intended to address  corporate and accounting  fraud. In
addition to the  establishment  of a new  accounting  oversight  board that will
enforce auditing,  quality control and independence standards and will be funded
by fees  from all  publicly  traded  companies,  Sarbanes-Oxley  places  certain
restrictions  on the scope of services that may be provided by accounting  firms
to their public company audit clients.  Any non-audit services being provided to
a public company audit client will require  preapproval  by the company's  audit
committee. In addition, Sarbanes-Oxley makes certain changes to the requirements
for audit partner rotation after a period of time. Sarbanes-Oxley requires chief
executive officers and chief financial

                                       26
<PAGE>

officers,  or their  equivalent,  to certify to the accuracy of periodic reports
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, subject to civil and criminal
penalties if they knowingly or willingly violate this certification requirement.
The Company's  Chief Executive  Officer and Chief Financial  Officer have signed
certifications  to this Form 10-K as required by  Sarbanes-Oxley.  In  addition,
under Sarbanes-Oxley,  counsel will be required to report evidence of a material
violation of the  securities  laws or a breach of fiduciary duty by a company to
its chief  executive  officer or its chief legal  officer,  and, if such officer
does not appropriately  respond,  to report such evidence to the audit committee
or other similar committee of the board of directors or the board itself.

     Under   Sarbanes-Oxley,   longer  prison  terms  will  apply  to  corporate
executives who violate federal  securities laws; the period during which certain
types of suits can be brought against a company or its officers is extended; and
bonuses issued to top executives  prior to restatement of a company's  financial
statements  are now  subject  to  disgorgement  if such  restatement  was due to
corporate misconduct.  Executives are also prohibited from trading the company's
securities  during  retirement  plan  "blackout"  periods,  and loans to company
executives  (other than loans by  financial  institutions  permitted  by federal
rules and regulations)  are restricted.  In addition,  a provision  directs that
civil penalties levied by the Securities and Exchange  Commission as a result of
any judicial or  administrative  action under  Sarbanes-Oxley  be deposited to a
fund for the benefit of harmed  investors.  The Federal  Accounts  for  Investor
Restitution  provision also requires the  Securities and Exchange  Commission to
develop methods of improving  collection rates. The legislation  accelerates the
time  frame for  disclosures  by  public  companies,  as they  must  immediately
disclose  any  material  changes in their  financial  condition  or  operations.
Directors and executive officers must also provide  information for most changes
in ownership in a company's securities within two business days of the change.

     Sarbanes-Oxley  also  increases  the  oversight  of, and  codifies  certain
requirements  relating to, audit  committees  of public  companies  and how they
interact with the company's "registered public accounting firm." Audit Committee
members must be independent and are absolutely barred from accepting consulting,
advisory or other compensatory fees from the issuer. In addition, companies must
disclose  whether at least one member of the  committee is a "financial  expert"
(as such term is defined by the Securities and Exchange  Commission) and if not,
why not. Under Sarbanes-Oxley,  a company's registered public accounting firm is
prohibited from performing  statutorily mandated audit services for a company if
such company's chief executive officer,  chief financial  officer,  comptroller,
chief accounting officer or any person serving in equivalent  positions had been
employed by such firm and  participated  in the audit of such company during the
one-year  period  preceding  the  audit  initiation  date.  Sarbanes-Oxley  also
prohibits  any officer or director of a company or any other person acting under
their  direction  from  taking any  action to  fraudulently  influence,  coerce,
manipulate  or mislead any  independent  accountant  engaged in the audit of the
company's  financial  statements  for the  purpose of  rendering  the  financial
statements  materially  misleading.  Sarbanes-Oxley also requires the Securities
and Exchange  Commission to prescribe rules requiring  inclusion of any internal
control   report  and   assessment   by  management  in  the  annual  report  to
shareholders. Sarbanes-Oxley requires the company's registered public accounting
firm that  issues  the audit  report  to  attest to and  report on  management's
assessment of the company's internal controls.

                                       27
<PAGE>

     Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we will be required to
conduct a  comprehensive  review and  assessment of the adequacy of our existing
financial  systems and  controls at December 31,  2007,  and our  auditors  must
attest to our assessment.  This is expected to result in additional  expenses in
2006 and 2007.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
---------------------

Risks Associated with our Business

Our loan portfolio  consists of a high percentage of loans secured by commercial
real estate and  multi-family  real  estate.  These loans are riskier than loans
secured by one- to four-family properties.

     At  December  31,  2005,  $185.2  million,  or 64.3% of our loan  portfolio
consisted  of  commercial  and  multi-family  real  estate  loans.  We intend to
continue to  emphasize  the  origination  of these  types of loans.  These loans
generally  expose a lender to greater risk of  nonpayment  and loss than one- to
four-family  residential  mortgage  loans  because  repayment of the loans often
depends  on the  successful  operation  and  income  stream  of  the  borrower's
business.  Such loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers
or groups of  related  borrowers  compared  to one- to  four-family  residential
mortgage loans. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or
one credit  relationship  can expose us to a significantly  greater risk of loss
compared  to an  adverse  development  with  respect  to a one-  to  four-family
residential mortgage loan.

We may not be able to successfully maintain and manage our growth.

     Since December 31, 2002, our assets have grown at a compound  annual growth
rate of 36.6%,  our loan balances have grown at a compound annual growth rate of
32.6% and our deposits have grown at a compound  annual growth rate of 30.4%. We
intend to use a portion of the proceeds of our recently completed stock offering
to support  further growth of our assets and deposits and the number of branches
we operate.  Our ability to continue to grow depends,  in part, upon our ability
to expand our market presence,  successfully attract core deposits, and identify
attractive commercial lending opportunities.

     We cannot be certain as to our ability to manage increased levels of assets
and liabilities.  We may be required to make additional investments in equipment
and  personnel  to manage  higher  asset  levels and loans  balances,  which may
adversely impact our efficiency ratio, earnings and shareholder returns.

                                       28
<PAGE>

If our allowance for loan losses is not  sufficient to cover actual loan losses,
our earnings could decrease.

     Our loan  customers  may not repay  their loans  according  to the terms of
their  loans,  and the  collateral  securing  the  payment of their loans may be
insufficient to assure repayment.  We may experience  significant credit losses,
which could have a material  adverse  effect on our operating  results.  We make
various   assumptions  and  judgments  about  the  collectability  of  our  loan
portfolio,  including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the
real estate and other assets  serving as collateral for the repayment of many of
our loans. In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, we review
our loans and our loss and  delinquency  experience,  and we  evaluate  economic
conditions.  If our  assumptions  prove to be incorrect,  our allowance for loan
losses may not cover  inherent  losses in our loan  portfolio at the date of the
financial  statements.  Material  additions to our  allowance  would  materially
decrease our net income.  At December 31, 2005,  our  allowance  for loan losses
totaled $3.1 million, representing 1.07% of total loans.

     While we have only  been  operating  for five  years,  we have  experienced
significant  growth in our loan  portfolio,  particularly  our loans  secured by
commercial real estate.  Although we believe we have  underwriting  standards to
manage normal lending risks, and although we had $1.0 million, or 0.22% of total
assets consisting of non-performing assets at December 31, 2005, it is difficult
to assess the future  performance  of our loan  portfolio due to the  relatively
recent origination of many of these loans. We can give you no assurance that our
non-performing  loans will not increase or that our non-performing or delinquent
loans will not adversely affect our future performance.

     In addition, federal and state regulators periodically review our allowance
for loan losses and may require us to increase our  allowance for loan losses or
recognize  further  loan  charge-offs.  Any increase in our  allowance  for loan
losses or loan charge-offs as required by these regulatory agencies could have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

We depend  primarily  on net interest  income for our  earnings  rather than fee
income.

     Net interest  income is the most  significant  component  of our  operating
income.  We do not rely on  traditional  sources of fee income  utilized by some
community banks, such as fees from sales of insurance,  securities or investment
advisory  products or services.  For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004,
our net interest income was $15.9 million and $13.8 million,  respectively.  The
amount of our net interest  income is  influenced  by the overall  interest rate
environment,  competition, and the amount of interest earning assets relative to
the amount of  interest  bearing  liabilities.  In the event that one or more of
these factors were to result in a decrease in our net interest income, we do not
have significant  sources of fee income to make up for decreases in net interest
income.

                                       29
<PAGE>

Fluctuations in interest rates could reduce our profitability.

     We realize income  primarily  from the  difference  between the interest we
earn  on  loans  and  investments  and  the  interest  we  pay on  deposits  and
borrowings. The interest rates on our assets and liabilities respond differently
to  changes  in  market  interest  rates,   which  means  our   interest-bearing
liabilities  may be more sensitive to changes in market  interest rates than our
interest-earning  assets,  or vice versa.  In either event,  if market  interest
rates  change,  this "gap"  between  the amount of  interest-earning  assets and
interest-bearing  liabilities  that reprice in response to these  interest  rate
changes may work against us, and our earnings may be negatively affected.

     We are unable to predict  fluctuations in market interest rates,  which are
affected by, among other factors, changes in the following:

     o    inflation rates;

     o    business activity levels;

     o    money supply; and

     o    domestic and foreign financial markets.

     The value of our  investment  portfolio and the  composition of our deposit
base are  influenced by prevailing  market  conditions and interest  rates.  Our
asset-liability  management strategy,  which is designed to mitigate the risk to
us from changes in market  interest  rates,  may not prevent changes in interest
rates or  securities  market  downturns  from reducing  deposit  outflow or from
having a material  adverse  effect on our results of  operations,  our financial
condition or the value of our investments.

Adverse  events  in New  Jersey,  where  our  business  is  concentrated,  could
adversely affect our results and future growth.

     Our   business,   the   location  of  our  branches  and  the  real  estate
collateralizing  our real estate  loans are  concentrated  in New  Jersey.  As a
result,  we are  exposed to  geographic  risks.  The  occurrence  of an economic
downturn in New Jersey,  or adverse changes in laws or regulations in New Jersey
could impact the credit quality of our assets, the business of our customers and
our ability to expand our business.

     Our success  significantly  depends upon the growth in  population,  income
levels,  deposits and housing in our market area. If the communities in which we
operate do not grow or if prevailing  economic  conditions locally or nationally
are  unfavorable,  our business may be  negatively  affected.  In addition,  the
economies of the communities in which we operate are substantially  dependent on
the  growth  of the  economy  in the State of New  Jersey.  To the  extent  that
economic  conditions in New Jersey are unfavorable or do not continue to grow as
projected, the economy in our market area would be adversely affected. Moreover,
we cannot give any

                                       30
<PAGE>

assurance  that we will  benefit from any market  growth or  favorable  economic
conditions in our market area if they do occur.

     In  addition,  the  market  value  of the  real  estate  securing  loans as
collateral  could be  adversely  affected by  unfavorable  changes in market and
economic conditions.  As of December 31, 2005,  approximately 94.8% of our total
loans were secured by real estate.  Adverse  developments  affecting commerce or
real estate  values in the local  economies  in our primary  market  areas could
increase  the credit  risk  associated  with our loan  portfolio.  In  addition,
substantially  all of our loans are to individuals and businesses in New Jersey.
Our  business  customers  may not have  customer  bases  that are as  diverse as
businesses  serving regional or national markets.  Consequently,  any decline in
the economy of our market area could have an adverse  impact on our revenues and
financial   condition.   In  particular,   we  may  experience   increased  loan
delinquencies,  which  could  result in a higher  provision  for loan losses and
increased   charge-offs.   Any  sustained   period  of  increased   non-payment,
delinquencies,  foreclosures  or losses  caused by  adverse  market or  economic
conditions  in our market area could  adversely  affect the value of our assets,
revenues, results of operations and financial condition.

We operate in a highly  regulated  environment and may be adversely  affected by
changes in federal, state and local laws and regulations.

     We are subject to extensive  regulation,  supervision  and  examination  by
federal and state banking authorities.  Any change in applicable  regulations or
federal,  state or local legislation  could have a substantial  impact on us and
our operations.  Additional legislation and regulations that could significantly
affect our powers,  authority  and  operations  may be enacted or adopted in the
future,  which could have a material  adverse effect on our financial  condition
and results of operations.  Further,  regulators have significant discretion and
authority to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of laws
by banks and bank holding  companies in the performance of their supervisory and
enforcement  duties.  The exercise of  regulatory  authority may have a negative
impact on our results of operations and financial condition.

     Like other bank  holding  companies  and  financial  institutions,  we must
comply with significant  anti-money  laundering and  anti-terrorism  laws. Under
these  laws,  we are  required,  among  other  things,  to  enforce  a  customer
identification  program and file currency  transaction  and suspicious  activity
reports  with the  federal  government.  Government  agencies  have  substantial
discretion to impose  significant  monetary penalties on institutions which fail
to comply  with  these laws or make  required  reports.  Because we operate  our
business in the highly urbanized greater Newark/New York City metropolitan area,
we may be at greater risk of scrutiny by government  regulators  for  compliance
with these laws.

We expect to incur  additional  expense in connection  with our compliance  with
Sarbanes-Oxley.

     Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we will be required to
conduct a  comprehensive  review and  assessment of the adequacy of our existing
financial  systems and  controls at December 31,  2007,  and our  auditors  must
attest to our assessment.  This is expected to result in additional  expenses in
2006 and 2007.  Moreover,  a review of our  financial  systems

                                       31
<PAGE>

and controls may uncover deficiencies in existing systems and controls.  If that
is the  case,  we  would  have  to take  the  necessary  steps  to  correct  any
deficiencies,  which may be costly and may strain our  management  resources and
negatively  impact  earnings.  We also would be required  to  disclose  any such
deficiencies, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.

facility and lease our two branch  offices.  In August  2005,  we entered into a
lease for a future branch  facility to be located in Hoboken,  New Jersey.  This
facility is expected to open for business during the second quarter of 2006.

ITEM 7.   MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
          RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
          ---------------------

General
-------

     BCB Bancorp,  Inc.,  completed its acquisition of Bayonne Community Bank on
May 1, 2003.  Information  at and for the twelve months ended  December 31, 2003
reflects the consolidated financial information of BCB Bancorp Inc. Prior to the
completion of the acquisition,  BCB Bancorp, Inc. had no assets,  liabilities or
operations.  Consequently  the  information  provided below at and for the years
ended December 31, 2002 and prior is for Bayonne Community Bank on a stand-alone
basis.

     This discussion,  and other written material, and statements management may
make, may contain  certain  forward-looking  statements  regarding the Company's
prospective  performance and strategies within the meaning of Section 27A of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended,  and Section 21E of the Securities  Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended. The Company intends such forward-looking  statements to
be  covered  by  the  safe  harbor  provisions  for  forward-looking  statements
contained  in the  Private  Securities  Litigation  Reform  Act of 1995,  and is
including this statement for purposes of said safe harbor provisions.

                                       34
<PAGE>

     Forward-looking   information   is   inherently   subject   to  risks   and
uncertainties,  and actual results could differ  materially from those currently
anticipated due to a number of factors,  which include,  but are not limited to,
factors  discussed  in the  Company's  Annual  Report  on Form 10-K and in other
documents  filed by the Company with the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission.
Forward-looking statements,  which are based on certain assumptions and describe
future  plans,  strategies  and  expectations  of  the  Company,  are  generally
identified  by the  use of the  words  "plan,"  "believe,"  "expect,"  "intend,"
"anticipate,"   "estimate,"   "project,"  "may,"  "will,"   "should,"   "could,"
"predicts,"  "forecasts,"  "potential,"  or  "continue"  or similar terms or the
negative of these terms. The Company's  ability to predict results or the actual
effects of its plans or strategies is inherently uncertain.  Accordingly, actual
results may differ materially from anticipated results.

     Factors that could have a material  adverse effect on the operations of the
Company and its subsidiaries  include, but are not limited to, changes in market
interest  rates,  general  economic  conditions,  legislation,  and  regulation;
changes  in  monetary  and fiscal  policies  of the  United  States  Government,
including  policies of the United  States  Treasury and Federal  Reserve  Board;
changes in the  quality or  composition  of the loan or  investment  portfolios;
changes in deposit flows, competition, and demand for financial services, loans,
deposits and  investment  products in the Company's  local  markets;  changes in
accounting  principles and guidelines;  war or terrorist  activities;  and other
economic, competitive,  governmental, regulatory, geopolitical and technological
factors affecting the Company's operations, pricing and services.

     Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these  forward-looking
statements,  which speak only as of the date of this  discussion.  Although  the
Company  believes  that  the  expectations   reflected  in  the  forward-looking
statements are reasonable,  the Company cannot guarantee future results,  levels
of activity,  performance or achievements.  Except as required by applicable law
or   regulation,   the  Company   undertakes   no  obligation  to  update  these
forward-looking  statements to reflect events or circumstances  that occur after
the date on which such statements were made.

Critical Accounting Policies
----------------------------

     Critical  accounting policies are those accounting policies that can have a
significant impact on the Company's financial position and results of operations
that  require  the use of  complex  and  subjective  estimates  based  upon past
experiences and management's  judgment.  Because of the uncertainty  inherent in
such estimates,  actual results may differ from these estimates. Below are those
policies applied in preparing the Company's  consolidated  financial  statements
that management  believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates
and assumptions.  For additional  accounting  policies,  see Note 2 of "Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements."

Allowance for Loan Losses

     Loans  receivable  are presented  net of an allowance  for loan losses.  In
determining  the  appropriate  level of the  allowance,  management  considers a
combination of factors, such as economic and industry trends, real estate market
conditions,  size and type of loans in portfolio, nature and value of collateral
held,  borrowers'  financial  strength and credit  ratings,  and

                                       35
<PAGE>

prepayment and default history. The calculation of the appropriate allowance for
loan losses  requires a substantial  amount of judgment  regarding the impact of
the  aforementioned   factors,  as  well  as  other  factors,  on  the  ultimate
realization of loans receivable.

Stock Options

     The Company had, through December 31, 2005, the choice to account for stock
options using either  Accounting  Principles  Board Opinion No. 25 ("APB 25") or
SFAS No. 123,  "Accounting  for  Stock-Based  Compensation."  For the year ended
December 31, 2005,  the Company has elected to use the  accounting  method under
APB 25 and the related  interpretations to account for its stock options.  Under
APB 25, generally, when the exercise price of the Company's stock options equals
the market price of the underlying  stock on the date of grant,  no compensation
expense is  recognized.  On December  14,  2005,  the Board of  Directors of the
Company approved the accelerated  vesting and exercisability of all unvested and
unexercisable  stock options granted as a part of the 2003 and 2002 Stock Option
Plans  effective  December 20, 2005. Had the Company elected to use SFAS No. 123
to account for its stock options under the fair value method, it would have been
required to record compensation  expense and, as a result,  diluted earnings per
share for the fiscal  years  ended  December  31,  2005 and 2004 would have been
lower by $0.32 and $0.14  respectively.  No stock  options were granted prior to
2002.  See Note 2 to "Notes to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements."  Effective
January 1, 2006, the Company will have to account for stock options  pursuant to
SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004).  The  acceleration of vesting was done primarily to
avoid the recording of  compensation  expense in future years.  See  discussions
under Recent  Accounting  Pronouncements  for our analysis of the impact of SFAS
No. 123 (revised 2004) on current and future operations.

Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis of  Financial  Condition  and Results of
Operations

Financial Condition

Comparison at December 31, 2005 and at December 31, 2004

     Since we commenced operations in 2000 we have sought to grow our assets and
deposit base consistent with our capital requirements. We offer competitive loan
and deposit  products and seek to  distinguish  ourselves  from our  competitors
through our service and availability. Total assets increased by $87.9 million or
23.2% to $466.2 million at December 31, 2005 from $378.3 million at December 31,
2004 as the Company  continued to grow the Bank's  balance  sheet with loans and
securities  funded  primarily  through  growth in the Bank's  deposit base,  the
utilization of wholesale  funding sources,  specifically  Federal Home Loan Bank
advances  and the net  proceeds  from our  offering of common  stock in December
2005.

     Total cash and cash  equivalents  increased  by $20.6  million or 457.8% to
$25.1 million at December 31, 2005 from $4.5 million at December 31, 2004 as the
Company,  reflecting the successful  completion of our recent offering of common
stock,  and the  attractiveness  of liquid  investments  during the current flat
yield curve environment.  Securities held-to-maturity increased by $23.0 million
or 19.7% to $140.0  million at December 31, 2005 from $117.0

                                       36
<PAGE>

million at December 31, 2004.  The increase was  primarily  attributable  to the
purchase of $55.8 million of callable agency securities partially offset by call
options exercised on $18.8 million of callable agency securities,  sales of $6.0
million of  callable  agency  securities  and $1.3  million of  mortgage  backed
securities and $6.8 million of repayments and prepayments in the mortgage backed
securities  portfolio  during the year ended December 31, 2005. As the Company's
securities are exclusively  categorized as held-to-maturity,  the Bank relied on
an explanatory portion of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 115
(FASB 115) to engage in the specific sales of agency securities.

     Specifically, FASB 115 recognizes sales of debt securities that meet either
of the following two conditions as maturities for purposes of the classification
of securities.

     a.   The sale of a security  occurs  near enough to its  maturity  date (or
          call date if exercise of the call is probable) that interest rate risk
          is substantially  eliminated as a pricing factor. That is, the date of
          sale is so near the maturity or call date (for  example,  within three
          months)  that  changes  in  market  interest  rates  would  not have a
          significant effect on the security's fair value.
     b.   The  sale of a  security  occurs  after  the  enterprise  has  already
          collected a substantial portion (at least 85 percent) of the principal
          outstanding  at  acquisition  due  either to  prepayments  on the debt
          security or to scheduled  payments on a debt security payable in equal
          installments (both principal and interest) over its term.

     In the  case of the  sale  of the  agency  debt  securities,  FASB  115 was
satisfied because the sales of the debt securities occurred near enough to their
call  dates,  with  the  calls  being  probable,  that  interest  rate  risk was
substantially  eliminated.  In the  case  of the  sale  of the  mortgage  backed
securities, a substantial portion (over 85 percent) of the principal outstanding
at acquisition had been collected.

     Loans  receivable  increased by $38.1 million or 15.5% to $284.5 million at
December  31,  2005 from $246.4  million at  December  31,  2004.  The  increase
resulted  primarily  from a $36.0  million  increase  in real  estate  mortgages
comprising residential,  commercial and construction loans, net of amortization,
and a $3.4 million increase in consumer loans,  net of  amortization,  partially
offset by a $545,000  decrease  in  commercial  loans  consisting  primarily  of
business  loans and  commercial  lines of credit and a $584,000  increase in the
allowance for loan losses.  At December 31, 2005,  the allowance for loan losses
was $3.1 million.  The growth in loans receivable was primarily  attributable to
competitive  pricing in a lower than  normal  interest  rate  environment  and a
vibrant local economy where real estate  construction and rehabilitation  remain
strong.

     Deposit liabilities increased by $25.7 million or 7.6% to $362.9 million at
December  31,  2005 from $337.2  million at  December  31,  2004.  The  increase
resulted  primarily  from an increase of $49.5 million or 53.1% in time deposits
to $142.7 million from $93.2 million and an increase of $6.4 million or 13.9% in
demand  deposits to $52.6  million  from $46.2  million,  partially  offset by a
decrease  of $30.4  million  or 15.4% in  savings  and club  accounts  to $167.5

                                       37
<PAGE>

million from $197.9 million.  The decrease in savings and club account  balances
resulted primarily from internal  disintermediation  brought on by the series of
Federal  Open  Market  Committee  short-term  interest  rate  increases  and the
increasingly competitive local market for deposit growth. The Bank has been able
to achieve  these growth rates  through  competitive  pricing on select  deposit
products.

     Borrowed  money  increased by $40.0  million or 283.7% to $54.1  million at
December  31, 2005 from $14.1  million at December  31,  2004.  The  increase in
borrowings  reflects  the use of long-term  Federal  Home Loan Bank  advances to
augment  deposits  as the  Bank's  funding  source  for  originating  loans  and
investing in Government Sponsored Enterprise (GSE) investment securities. During
July and  August  2005,  we  obtained  $50.0  million in  long-term,  fixed rate
advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank. Borrowings were at an average interest
rate of 3.37% with a final maturity of ten years, callable after one year.

     Total  stockholders'  equity  increased by $21.8  million or 83.8% to $47.8
million at  December  31,  2005 from $26.0  million at December  31,  2004.  The
increase  primarily  reflects the  completion of our common stock offering which
raised $17.9 million in additional  capital,  as well as net income for the year
ended  December  31,  2005 of $4.7  million.  The net  proceeds  from the  stock
offering  will be used for  lending  and  investment  activity as well as branch
expansion and general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2005 the Bank's Tier 1
leverage,  Tier 1 risk-based  and Total  risk-based  capital  ratios were 7.75%,
11.59%, and 12.62% respectively.

Analysis of Net Interest Income
-------------------------------

     Net  interest  income  is  the  difference   between   interest  income  on
interest-earning  assets and interest expense on  interest-bearing  liabilities.
Net interest income depends on the relative amounts of  interest-earning  assets
and interest-bearing  liabilities and the interest rates earned or paid on them,
respectively.

     The following  tables set forth balance  sheets,  average yields and costs,
and certain other  information for the periods  indicated.  All average balances
are daily  average  balances.  The yields set forth below  include the effect of
deferred fees, discounts and premiums, which are included in interest income.

Results of Operations
---------------------

Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2005 and 2004

     Net income increased by $1.1 million or 30.6 % to $4.7 million for the year
ended  December 31, 2005 from $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004.
This  increase  in net income  reflects  increases  in net  interest  income and
non-interest  income,  partially  offset by increases in the  provision for loan
losses,  non-interest expense and income taxes. Net interest income increased by
$2.1 million or 15.2% to $15.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 from
$13.8  million for the year ended  December 31,  2004.  This  increase  resulted
primarily  from an  increase  in average  net  interest  earning  assets of $7.7
million or 21.3% to $43.9  million  for the year ended  December  31,  2005 from
$36.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 and a slight  increase in the
net interest margin to 3.98% for the year ended December 31, 2005 from 3.96% for
the year ended December 31, 2004. The slight increase in our net interest margin
resulted  primarily from an increase in the average yield on loans receivable to
6.93%  for the year  ended  December  31,  2005 from  6.68%  for the year  ended
December  31, 2004  partially  offset by an  increase  in the cost of  wholesale
borrowings to 3.64% for the year ended December 31, 2005 from 1.79% for the year
ended December 31, 2004.

     Interest income on loans  receivable  increased by $4.0 million or 27.0% to
$18.8  million for the year ended  December 31, 2005 from $14.8  million for the
year ended  December 31, 2004.  The increase was primarily due to an increase in
average loans  receivable  of $50.1  million or 22.6% to $271.4  million for the
year ended December 31, 2005 from $221.3 million for the year ended December 31,
2004 and an increase in the average  yield on loans  receivable to 6.93% for the
year ended  December  31, 2005 from 6.68% for the year ended  December 31, 2004.
The increase in the average balance of loans reflects management's philosophy of
deploying funds in higher yielding loans, specifically commercial real estate as
opposed to lower yielding investments in government securities.  The increase in
average yield reflects the Bank's  diligence in deploying funds into prime based
lending  products  whose yield  increased as the Federal  Open Market  Committee
continued to increase short-term interest rates throughout 2005.

     Interest income on securities increased by $540,000 or 9.4% to $6.3 million
for the year  ended  December  31,  2005 from $5.8  million  for the year  ended
December 31, 2004. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the
average  balance of securities  of $16.0 million or 14.8% to $124.3  million for
the year ended December 31, 2005 from $108.3 million for the year ended December
31, 2004,  partially  offset by a decrease in the average yield on securities to
5.07%  for the year  ended  December  31,  2005 from  5.32%  for the year  ended
December  31,  2004.  The  increase in average  balances  reflects  the on-going
leverage strategy with the use of the Federal Home Loan Bank advances.

     Interest income on other  interest-earning  assets consisting  primarily of
federal  funds sold  decreased by $88,000 or 55.3% to $71,000 for the year ended
December  31, 2005 from  $159,000 for the year ended  December  31,  2004.  This
decrease  was  primarily  due to a  decrease  in the  average  balance  of other
interest-earning  assets to $4.7  million for the year ended  December  31, 2005
from $17.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004  partially  offset by an
increase in the average yield on other interest-earning  assets to 1.51% for the
year ended  December  31, 2005 from 0.90% for the year ended  December 31, 2004.
During 2005, the Bank decided to actively

                                       41
<PAGE>

manage its liquid  investments  in order to  redeploy  its  earning  assets into
higher yielding loans and securities in an effort to maximize returns.

     Total interest  expense  increased by $2.3 million or 33.3% to $9.2 million
for the year  ended  December  31,  2005 from $6.9  million  for the year  ended
December 31, 2004.  This  increase  resulted  from an increase in average  total
interest bearing deposit liabilities of $37.6 million or 13.2% to $323.0 million
for the year ended  December  31,  2005 from  $285.4  million for the year ended
December 31,  2004,  and an increase of $7.8  million in average  borrowings  to
$33.5  million at  December  31,  2005,  from $25.7  million  for the year ended
December  31,  2004,  as well as an  increase  in the  average  cost of interest
bearing liabilities to 2.59% for the year ended December 31, 2005 from 2.23% for
the year ended December 31, 2004.

     The  provision  for loan losses  totaled  $1.1 million and $690,000 for the
years ended  December 31, 2005 and 2004,  respectively.  The  provision for loan
losses is  established  based upon  management's  review of the Bank's loans and
consideration  of a variety of factors  including,  but not  limited to, (1) the
risk characteristics of the loan portfolio, (2) current economic conditions, (3)
actual losses previously  experienced,  (4) the significant level of loan growth
and (5) the  existing  level of reserves  for loan losses that are  possible and
estimable.  During  2005,  the  Bank  experienced  $534,000  in net  charge-offs
(consisting  of  $546,000 in  charge-offs  and  $12,000 in  recoveries)  related
primarily to the foreclosure and bankruptcy of one lending  relationship and two
commercial heavy equipment loans. During 2004, the Bank experienced  $297,000 in
net   charge-offs   (consisting  of  $332,000  in  charge-offs  and  $35,000  in
recoveries)  related  entirely  to the  liquidation  of  five  commercial  heavy
equipment  loans. The Bank had non-accrual  loans totaling  $787,000 at December
31, 2005 and $553,000 at December 31, 2004.  The allowance for loan losses stood
at $3.1  million or 1.07% of gross total loans at December  31, 2005 as compared
to $2.5 million or 1.01% of gross total loans at December  31, 2004.  The amount
of the  allowance  is based on estimates  and the ultimate  losses may vary from
such estimates. Management assesses the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly
basis and makes provisions for loan losses as necessary in order to maintain the
adequacy of the  allowance.  While  management  uses  available  information  to
recognize loses on loans,  future loan loss provisions may be necessary based on
changes  in  the  aforementioned  criteria.  In  addition,   various  regulatory
agencies, as an integral part of their examination process,  periodically review
the allowance  for loan losses and may require the Bank to recognize  additional
provisions based on their judgment of information  available to them at the time
of their examination. Management believes that the allowance for loan losses was
adequate at both December 31, 2005 and 2004.

     Total  non-interest  income  increased by $255,000 or 40.9% to $878,000 for
the year ended  December 31, 2005 from $623,000 for the year ended  December 31,
2004. The increase in  non-interest  income  resulted  primarily from a $116,000
increase in gain on sales of loans  originated  for sale, a $56,000  decrease in
losses on sales of non-performing  loans as the Bank did not sell any such loans
or record any gain or loss therefrom  during the year ended December 31, 2005 as
compared to a $56,000 loss recorded  during the year ended  December 31, 2004, a
$48,000  increase in fees and  service  charges,  and a $28,000  gain on sale of
securities held-to-maturity in the current year. The aforementioned gain on sale
of  securities  was  accomplished  from  securities   originally  designated  as
held-to-maturity.  Because  certain  language  located  in the  text of FASB 115
specified   earlier   allows   for  the  sale  of   securities   designated   as
held-to-maturity

                                       42
<PAGE>

if certain criteria are met, management undertook the research necessary to make
their  determination  that such sales were permitted.  Upon scrutiny of the text
and  concurrence  and  confirmation  with  the  Company's  independent  external
auditor, the allowable transactions were consummated.

     Total  non-interest  expense  increased by $547,000 or 7.1% to $8.2 million
for the year  ended  December  31,  2005 from $7.7  million  for the year  ended
December 31,  2004.  The  increase in 2005 was  primarily  due to an increase of
$452,000 or 11.4% in salaries and employee  benefits expense to $4.4 million for
the year ended  December 31, 2005 from $4.0 million for the year ended  December
31, 2004 as the Bank increased  staffing levels and compensation in an effort to
service its growing customer base. Full time equivalent  employees  increased to
eighty-two (82) at December 31, 2005 from seventy-five (75) at December 31, 2004
and  sixty-six  (66) at December  31,  2003.  An increase  in the  aggregate  of
$202,000 or 9.0% was recorded in the  categories  of  occupancy,  equipment  and
advertising  expense to $2.4  million for the year ended  December 31, 2005 from
$2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 as these expense increases are
commensurate with a growing franchise.  These increases were partially offset by
a decrease of $109,000 or 7.6% in other non-interest expense to $1.3 million for
the year ended  December 31, 2005 from $1.4 million for the year ended  December
31, 2004. Other non-interest expense is comprised of director fees,  stationary,
forms and printing, professional fees, legal fees, check printing, correspondent
bank fees, telephone and communication, shareholder relations and other fees and
expenses.  The decrease in other non-interest expense is primarily  attributable
to decreased  legal,  professional  and  shareholder  relation  expense,  as the
Company incurred expenses associated with a contested proxy contest initiated by
an opposing slate of directors  during the year ended December 31, 2004. No such
additional expenses were incurred during the year ended December 31, 2005.

     Income tax expense  increased  by $337,000 or 14.0% to $2.7 million for the
year ended  December 31, 2005 from $2.4 million for the year ended  December 31,
2004  reflecting  pre-tax  income of $7.5 million  earned  during the year ended
December 31, 2005 compared to pre-tax  income of $6.0 million  earned during the
year ended December 31, 2004,  partially  offset by the formation of BCB Holding
Company Investment Corp. (the Investment  Company").  The Investment  Company, a
New Jersey  Investment  Company  wholly owned by the Bank, is subject to a state
income tax rate of 3.6% as compared to the 9.0% rate paid by the Company and the
Bank.  The  Investment  Company was funded by a transfer of securities  from the
Bank. The utilization of the Investment  Company to hold investments  during the
year ended  December  31,  2005  reduced  consolidated  income tax  expenses  by
approximately $223,000 and reduced the consolidated effective income tax rate by
approximately  3.0%.  The  Company's  effective  tax rate was 36.7% for the year
ended  December  31, 2005 as compared to 40.0% for the year ended  December  31,
2004.

Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2004 and 2003

     Net income  increased by $1.2 million or 51.1% to $3.6 million for the year
ended  December 31, 2004 from $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2003.
This  increase in net income is as a result of increases in net interest  income
and  non-interest  income  and a  decrease  in the  provision  for  loan  losses
partially  offset by increases in  non-interest  expense and income  taxes.  Net
interest income increased by $4.0 million or 40.4% to $13.8 million for the

                                       43
<PAGE>

year ended  December 31, 2004 from $9.8 million for the year ended  December 31,
2003. This increase resulted  primarily from an increase in average net interest
earning  assets of $4.3  million  or 13.5% to $36.2  million  for the year ended
December  31,  2004 from $31.9  million  for the year ended  December  31,  2003
partially  offset by a decrease in the net interest margin to 3.96% for the year
ended  December 31, 2004 from 4.34% for the year ended  December  31, 2003.  The
decrease in our net interest  margin  reflects the  on-going  philosophy  of the
Federal Reserve Open Market  Committee,  specifically  during the second half of
2004, to tighten monetary policy by raising short-term interest rates while long
term rates trended slightly downward during that same time period.

     Interest income on loans receivable  increased by $4.04 million or 37.6% to
$14.8  million for the year ended  December 31, 2004 from $10.7  million for the
year ended  December 31, 2003.  The increase was primarily due to an increase in
average loans  receivable  of $66.1  million or 42.6% to $221.3  million for the
year ended December 31, 2004 from $155.1 million for the year ended December 31,
2003 partially  offset by a decrease in the average yield on loans receivable to
6.68%  for the year  ended  December  31,  2004 from  6.93%  for the year  ended
December  31,  2003.  The  increase  in the  average  balance of loans  reflects
management's  philosophy to deploy funds in higher yielding loans,  specifically
commercial  real estate as opposed to lower  yielding  investments in government
securities.  The decrease in average yield reflects the continuance of the lower
long-term interest rate environment in 2004.

     Interest  income on  securities  increased by $2.5 million or 74.5% to $5.8
million  for the year ended  December  31,  2004 from $3.3  million for the year
ended December 31, 2003. The increase was primarily  attributable to an increase
in the average balance of securities of $48.0 million or 79.6% to $108.3 million
for the year  ended  December  31,  2004 from $60.3  million  for the year ended
December  31,  2003,  partially  offset by a decrease  in the  average  yield on
securities to 5.32% for the year ended December 31, 2004 from 5.47% for the year
ended  December  31,  2003.  The  increase  in  average  balances  reflects  the
redeployment  of  funds  previously  invested  in  short-term  interest  earning
deposits and the  on-going  leverage  strategy  done with the use of the Federal
Home Loan Bank advances.

     Interest income on other  interest-earning  assets consisting  primarily of
federal funds sold  increased by $68,000 or 74.7% to $159,000 for the year ended
December  31,  2004 from  $91,000 for the year ended  December  31,  2003.  This
increase  was  primarily  due to an  increase  in the  average  balance of other
interest-earning  assets to $17.7  million for the year ended  December 31, 2004
from $10.4 million for the year ended  December 31, 2003  partially  offset by a
slight increase in the average yield on other  interest-earning  assets to 0.90%
for the year ended  December 31, 2004 from 0.87% for the year ended December 31,
2003. As the Bank's loan pipeline consistently totaled over $30.0 million during
2004,  the  increase in average  balance in other  interest-earning  assets is a
reflection of management's  philosophy to accumulate liquidity to facilitate the
prompt closing of those loans.

     Total interest  expense  increased by $2.6 million or 60.2% to $6.9 million
for the year  ended  December  31,  2004 from $4.3  million  for the year  ended
December 31, 2003.  This  increase  resulted  from an increase in average  total
interest bearing deposit liabilities of $94.4 million or 49.4% to $285.4 million
for the year ended  December  31,  2004 from  $191.1  million

                                       44
<PAGE>

for the year ended  December  31,  2003,  and an  increase  of $22.7  million in
average  borrowings to $25.7 million at December 31, 2004, from $2.9 million for
the year ended  December 31, 2003.  The average cost of total  interest  bearing
liabilities was 2.23% for both the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003.

     The provision for loan losses  totaled  $690,000 and $880,000 for the years
ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The provision for loan losses is
established based upon management's review of the Bank's loans and consideration
of  a  variety  of  factors  including,   but  not  limited  to,  (1)  the  risk
characteristics  of the loan portfolio,  (2) current  economic  conditions,  (3)
actual losses previously  experienced,  (4) the significant level of loan growth
and (5) the  existing  level of reserves  for loan losses that are  possible and
estimable.  During  2004,  the  Bank  experienced  $297,000  in net  charge-offs
(consisting  of  $332,000 in  charge-offs  and  $35,000 in  recoveries)  related
entirely to the liquidation of five commercial  heavy  equipment  loans.  During
2003,  there were no charge-offs or recoveries.  The Bank had non-accrual  loans
totaling  $553,000 at December 31, 2004 and $67,000 at December  31,  2003.  The
allowance for loan losses stood at $2.5 million or 1.01% of gross total loans at
December  31, 2004 as compared to $2.1  million or 1.11% of gross total loans at
December 31,  2003.  The amount of the  allowance is based on estimates  and the
ultimate losses may vary from such estimates.  Management assesses the allowance
for loan losses on a  quarterly  basis and makes  provisions  for loan losses as
necessary in order to maintain the adequacy of the allowance.  While  management
uses  available  information  to  recognize  loses on  loans,  future  loan loss
provisions may be necessary based on changes in the aforementioned  criteria. In
addition,  various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination
process,  periodically  review the allowance for loan losses and may require the
Bank to recognize  additional  provisions based on their judgment of information
available to them at the time of their examination. Management believes that the
allowance for loan losses was adequate at both December 31, 2004 and 2003.

     Total  non-interest  income  increased by $143,000 or 29.8% to $623,000 for
the year ended  December 31, 2004 from $480,000 for the year ended  December 31,
2003. The increase in  non-interest  income  resulted  primarily from a $150,000
increase in fees and  service  charges,  a $42,000  increase in gain on sales of
loans  originated  for sale,  and a $7,000  increase in other  income  partially
offset  by  a  $56,000   loss  in  2004  on  the  sale  of  the   aforementioned
non-performing commercial heavy equipment loans.

     Total  non-interest  expenses  increased  by $2.3  million or 42.1% to $7.7
million  for the year ended  December  31,  2004 from $5.4  million for the year
ended  December 31, 2003.  The increase in 2004 was primarily due to an increase
of $1.2  million or 41.3% in  salaries  and  employee  benefits  expense to $4.0
million  for the year ended  December  31,  2004 from $2.8  million for the year
ended December 31, 2003 as the Bank increased  staffing levels and  compensation
in an effort  to  service  its  growing  customer  base.  Full  time  equivalent
employees  increased to  seventy-five  (75) at December 31, 2004 from  sixty-six
(66) at December 31, 2003 and thirty-four  (34) at December 31, 2002.  Equipment
expense  increased by $488,000 to $1.4  million for the year ended  December 31,
2004 from $940,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003.  The primary  component
of this  expense  relates  to the  increased  costs of the Bank's  data  service
provider  reflecting the overall  growth of the Bank's balance sheet.  Occupancy
expense  increased by $244,000 to $655,000 for the year ended  December 31, 2004
from  $411,000 for the

                                       45
<PAGE>

year  ended  December  31,  2003 as the Bank  incurred  a full  year's  worth of
occupancy  expense on the two offices  opened during 2003.  Advertising  expense
decreased  by $8,000 to  $161,000  for the year  ended  December  31,  2004 from
$169,000  for the year ended  December  31,  2003.  Other  non-interest  expense
increased by $384,000 to $1.44 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from
$1.06  million  for the year ended  December  31,  2003.  The  increase in other
non-interest expense was primarily attributable to increased legal, professional
and shareholder relation expense as during the year ended December 31, 2004, the
Company  incurred  expenses  associated  with a proxy  contest  initiated  by an
opposing  slate  of  directors.  Other  non-interest  expense  is  comprised  of
directors'  fees,  stationary,  forms and  printing,  professional  fees,  check
printing,  correspondent  bank fees,  telephone and  communication,  shareholder
relations and other fees and expenses.

     Income tax expense  increased  by $794,000 or 49.2% to $2.4 million for the
year ended  December 31, 2004 from $1.6 million for the year ended  December 31,
2003  reflecting  pre-tax  income of $6.0 million  earned  during the year ended
December 31, 2004 compared to pre-tax  income of $4.0 million  earned during the
year ended  December 31, 2003.  The Company's  effective tax rates were 40.0% in
2004 and 40.3% in 2003.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
-------------------------------

     Our funding sources include income from operations, deposits and borrowings
and principal payments on loans and investment securities.  While maturities and
scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds,
deposit outflows and mortgage  prepayments are greatly influenced by the general
level of interest rates, economic conditions and competition.

     Our primary  investing  activities  are the  origination  of commercial and
multi-family real estate loans, one-to four-family mortgage loans, construction,
commercial   business   and  consumer   loans,   as  well  as  the  purchase  of
mortgage-backed and other investment securities.  During 2005, loan originations
totaled  $133.7  million  compared to $110.8 million and $105.0 million for 2004
and 2003, respectively.  The increase in loan originations reflects management's
efforts  to  increase  our  total  assets,  the  continued  focus on  increasing
commercial and multi-family  lending  operations and the strong refinance market
in 2005.

     During  2005,  cash flow  provided  by the  calls,  sales,  maturities  and
principal  repayments and  prepayments  received on securities  held-to-maturity
amounted to $32.9  million  compared to $49.1  million and $36.3 million in 2004
and 2003. Deposit growth provided $25.6 million, $83.6 million and $90.1 million
of funding to  facilitate  asset growth for the years ending  December 31, 2005,
2004 and 2003,  respectively.  Borrowings increased $40.0 million in 2005 and in
addition to deposit  growth  served to fund asset growth and provide  additional
capital.  During 2004,  we borrowed  $4.1  million  through the issuance of $4.1
million  in  trust  preferred  securities  and  repaid  $15.0  million  in  FHLB
borrowings. During 2003, we borrowed $25.0 million in FHLB advances.

     Loan  Commitments.  In the  ordinary  course of business  the Bank  extends
     -----------------
commitments to originate  residential  and  commercial  loans and other consumer
loans. Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long
as  there  is no  violation  of  any  condition

                                       46
<PAGE>

established in the contract.  Commitments  generally have fixed expiration dates
or other  termination  clauses and may require  payment of a fee. Since the Bank
does not  expect  all of the  commitments  to be  funded,  the total  commitment
amounts  do  not  necessarily  represent  future  cash  requirements.  The  Bank
evaluates each customer's  creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis.  Collateral
may  be  obtained   based  upon   management's   assessment  of  the  customers'
creditworthiness.  Commitments  to extend  credit may be written on a fixed rate
basis exposing the Bank to interest rate risk given the possibility  that market
rates may change between the commitment date and the actual extension of credit.
The  Bank  had   outstanding   commitments   to  originate  and  fund  loans  of
approximately  $45.2  million and $38.8  million at December  31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively.

     The following tables sets forth our contractual  obligations and commercial
commitments at December 31, 2005.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
--------------------------------

Accounting for Share-based Payments

     In December 2004,  the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board (the "FASB")
issued   Statement  of  Financial   Accounting   Standards  No.  123  (revised),
"Share-Based  Payment".  Statement No. 123 (revised)  replaces Statement No. 123
and  supersedes  APB  Opinion  No.  25.  Statement  No. 123  (revised)  requires
compensation costs related to share based payment  transactions to be recognized
in the financial statements over the period that an employee provides service in
exchange for the award.  Public companies are required to adopt the new standard
using a modified prospective method and may elect to restate prior periods using
the  modified  retrospective  method.  Under the  modified  prospective  method,
companies are required to record  compensation  cost for new and modified awards
over  the  related  vesting  period  of such  awards  prospectively  and  record
compensation  cost  prospectively  for  the  unvested  portion  at the  date  of
adoption, of previously issued and outstanding awards over the remaining vesting
period of such awards.  No change to prior periods  presented is permitted under
the  modified  prospective  method.  Under the  modified  retrospective  method,
companies  record  compensation  costs for prior periods  retroactively  through
restatement  of such periods using the exact pro forma amounts  disclosed in the
companies'  footnotes.  Also,  in the period of  adoption  and after,  companies
record compensation cost based on the modified prospective method.

     On April 14, 2005,  the Securities  and Exchange  Commission  adopted a new
rule that amends the compliance dates for Statement No. 123 (revised). Under the
new rule,  we are  required to adopt  Statement  No. 123  (revised) in the first
annual period beginning after June 15, 2005. Early  application of Statement No.
123 (revised) is encouraged, but not required.  Accordingly,  we are required to
record  compensation  expense for all new awards granted and

                                       47
<PAGE>

any awards  modified after January 1, 2006. In addition,  the  transition  rules
under SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) will require that, for all awards  outstanding
at January 1, 2006,  for which the requisite  service has not yet been rendered,
compensation cost be recorded as such service is rendered after January 1, 2006.

     The pronouncement  related to stock-based payments will not have any effect
on our existing historical  consolidated financial statements as restatements of
previously  reported  periods  will not be required.  However,  our stock option
awards  generally  require a service  period which extends  beyond the effective
date of SFAS No. 123  (revised  2004) and,  accordingly,  we will be required to
record  compensation  expense on such awards  beginning on January 1, 2006. As a
result,  the Board of Directors of BCB Bancorp,  Inc.  approved the  accelerated
vesting and  exercisiability  of all unvested and  unexercisable  stock  options
granted as a part of the 2003 and 2002 Stock Option Plans effective December 20,
2005. We do not expect a significant  expense relating to existing stock options
will need to be recognized in 2006 or future years.

Accounting for Variable Interest Entities

     In  December   2003,   FASB  issued  a  revision  to   Interpretation   46,
"Consolidation of Variable Interest  Entities," which established  standards for
identifying a variable  interest entity ("VIE") and for  determining  under what
circumstances  a VIE  should  be  consolidated  with  its  primary  beneficiary.
Application of this Interpretation is required in financial statements of public
entities  that have  interests in  special-purpose  entities for periods  ending
after  December  15,  2003.  Application  by public  entities,  other than small
business  issuers,  for  all  other  types  of  VIEs is  required  in  financial
statements for periods ending after March 15, 2004.  Small business issuers must
apply  this  interpretation  to all other  types of VIEs at the end of the first
reporting   period  ending  after  December  15,  2004.  The  adoption  of  this
Interpretation  has not had and is not expected to have a material effect on our
financial position or results of operations.

Accounting  for  Certain  Financial  Instruments  with  Characteristics  of both
Liabilities and Equity

     In May 2003, FASB issued SFAS No. 150,  "Accounting  for Certain  Financial
Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity" (SFAS No. 150).
This Statement  established  standards for how a company classifies and measures
certain  financial  instruments  with  characteristics  of both  liabilities and
equity as well as their  classification in the company's  statement of financial
position.  It requires that the company classify a financial  instrument that is
within its scope as a liability when that  instrument  embodies an obligation of
the issuer.  SFAS No. 150 did not have any impact on the Company's  Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

     On April 30, 2003, FASB issued SFAS No. 149, "Amendment of Statement 133 on
Derivative  Instruments and Hedging  Activities"  ("SFAS No. 149"). SFAS No. 149
amends and clarifies  accounting for derivative  instruments,  including certain
derivative  instruments embedded in other contracts,  and for hedging activities
under SFAS No. 133. With a number of  exceptions,  SFAS No. 149 is effective for
contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003. The adoption of SFAS No.
149 did not have a  material  impact  on the  Company's  consolidated  financial
statements.

Guarantor's  Accounting and Disclosure  Requirements  for Guarantees,  Including
Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others

     In November  2002,  FASB issued FASB  Interpretation  No. 45,  "Guarantor's
Accounting  and  Disclosure  Requirements  for  Guarantees,  Including  Indirect
Guarantees of  Indebtedness  of Others" ("FIN 45").  FIN 45 requires a guarantor
entity, at the inception of a guarantee covered by the measurement provisions of
the  interpretation,  to record a liability for the fair value of the obligation
undertaken  in  issuing  the  guarantee.  In  addition,  FIN  45  elaborates  on
previously existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees,  including loan
guarantees  such as  standby  letters  of  credit.  The  Company  does  not have
financial letters of credit as of December 31, 2005.

ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Management of Market Risk
-------------------------

     Qualitative  Analysis.  The  majority  of our  assets and  liabilities  are
monetary in nature.  Consequently,  one of our most significant  forms of market
risk is interest rate risk. Our assets,  consisting primarily of mortgage loans,
have longer maturities than our liabilities,  consisting  primarily of deposits.
As a result,  a principal  part of our business  strategy is to manage  interest
rate risk and  reduce  the  exposure  of our net  interest  income to changes in
market  interest rates.  Accordingly,  our Board of Directors has established an
Asset/Liability  Committee which is responsible for evaluating the interest rate
risk inherent in our assets and  liabilities,  for determining the level of risk
that is appropriate given our business strategy, operating environment, capital,
liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with
the guidelines  approved by the Board of Directors.  Senior management  monitors
the  level of  interest  rate risk on a  regular  basis and the  Asset/Liability
Committee,  which consists of senior management and outside directors  operating
under a policy adopted by the Board of Directors,  meets as needed to review our
asset/liability policies and interest rate risk position.

     Quantitative  Analysis.  The  following  table  presents the  Company's net
portfolio value ("NPV"). These calculations were based upon assumptions believed
to be fundamentally  sound,  although they may vary from assumptions utilized by
other financial  institutions.  The information set forth below is based on data
that included all  financial  instruments  as of December 31, 2005.  Assumptions
have been made by the Company relating to interest rates, loan prepayment rates,
core deposit  duration,  and the market values of certain assets and liabilities
under the various  interest rate scenarios.  Actual maturity dates were used for
fixed rate loans and certificate accounts.  Investment securities were scheduled
at  either  the  maturity  date or the  next  scheduled  call  date  based  upon
management's  judgment of whether the particular security would be called in the
current  interest rate  environment  and under assumed  interest rate scenarios.
Variable  rate loans were  scheduled as of their next  scheduled  interest  rate
repricing date. Additional  assumptions made in the preparation of the NPV table
include prepayment rates on loans and mortgage-backed  securities, core deposits
without stated  maturity dates were scheduled with an assumed term of 48 months,
and money market and noninterest bearing accounts were scheduled with an assumed
term of 24  months.  The NPV at "PAR"  represents  the  difference  between  the
Company's estimated value of assets and estimated value of liabilities  assuming
no change in interest rates.  The NPV for a decrease of 200 and 300 basis points
has

                                       49
<PAGE>

been excluded since it would not be meaningful, in the interest rate environment
as of December  31,  2005.  The  following  sets forth the  Company's  NPV as of
December 31, 2005.

----------
       bp-basis points
</TABLE>

     The table above  indicates that at December 31, 2005, in the event of a 100
basis point decrease in interest rates, we would  experience a 3.57% increase in
NPV. In the event of a 100 basis point  increase  in  interest  rates,  we would
experience a 14.55% decrease in NPV.

     Certain  shortcomings  are  inherent in the  methodology  used in the above
interest rate risk  measurement.  Modeling changes in NPV require making certain
assumptions  that may or may not reflect the manner in which  actual  yields and
costs respond to changes in market interest rates. In this regard, the NPV table
presented  assumes that the  composition  of our  interest-sensitive  assets and
liabilities  existing at the  beginning of a period  remains  constant  over the
period being measured and assumes that a particular  change in interest rates is
reflected  uniformly  across  the yield  curve  regardless  of the  duration  or
repricing  of specific  assets and  liabilities.  Accordingly,  although the NPV
table  provides an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular
point in time,  such  measurements  are not  intended  to and do not  provide  a
precise  forecast of the effect of changes in market  interest  rates on our net
interest income, and will differ from actual results.

ITEM 8.   FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
-----------------------------------------------------

     The financial statements identified in Item 15(a)(1) hereof are included as
Exhibit 13 and are incorporated hereunder.

ITEM 9.   CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
          FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
          --------------------

     On April 1, 2005,  Radics & Co. LLC,  ("Radics")  merged with Beard  Miller
Company LLP ("Beard  Miller")  to become the Pine  Brook,  New Jersey  office of
Beard Miller.  As a result,  on April 1, 2005,  Radics  resigned as  independent
auditors of BCB Bancorp,  Inc. On April 1, 2005, BCB Bancorp, Inc. engaged Beard
Miller as its successor  independent audit firm. BCB Bancorp,  Inc.'s engagement
of Beard Miller has been approved by our Audit Committee.

     The reports of Radics on our  consolidated  financial  statements as of and
for the fiscal year ended  December  31, 2004,  contained no adverse  opinion or
disclaimer  of opinion and were not  qualified  or  modified as to  uncertainty,
audit scope, or accounting principles.

     During the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004,  and in connection  with
the audit of our  financial  statements  for such  periods and until the date of
Radics'  resignation,  there were no

                                       50
<PAGE>

disagreements  between us and Radics on any matter of  accounting  principles or
practices,  financial  statement  disclosure,  or auditing  scope or  procedure,
which, if not resolved to the  satisfaction of Radics,  would have caused Radics
to make  reference to such matter in  connection  with its audit  reports on our
financial statements.

     We provided Radics with a copy of the above disclosures in response to Item
304(a) of  Regulation  S-K.  We  requested  that  Radics  deliver to us a letter
addressed to the Securities and Exchange  Commission  stating  whether it agrees
with the statements made by us in response to Item 304(a) of Regulation S-K, and
if not, stating the respects in which it does not agree. A copy of Radics letter
is filed as Exhibit 16 to a Form 8-K/A filed on April 27, 2005.

ITEM 9A.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
---------------------------------

     (a)  Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.

     Under  the  supervision  and  with  the  participation  of our  management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,  we evaluated
the  effectiveness  of the design and operation of our  disclosure  controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule  13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)  under the Exchange Act)
as of the end of the  fiscal  year  (the  "Evaluation  Date").  Based  upon that
