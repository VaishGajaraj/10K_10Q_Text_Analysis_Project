ITEM 1. BUSINESS

General

  Arch Coal, Inc. ("Arch Coal" or the "Company") is one of the largest coal
producers in the United States. The Company mines, processes and markets
compliance and low-sulfur coal from mines located in both the eastern and
western United States, enabling it to ship coal cost-effectively to most of
the major domestic coal-fired electric generation facilities. As of December
31, 2000, the Company had 28 operating mines and controlled approximately 3.37
billion tons of proven and probable coal reserves, approximately 1.90 billion
tons of which were assigned reserves and approximately 1.47 billion tons of
which were unassigned reserves. Arch Coal sold 105.5 million tons of coal in
2000. The Company sells substantially all of its coal to producers of electric
power.

  The Company owns a 99% membership interest in Arch Western Resources, LLC
("Arch Western"), a joint venture that was formed in connection with the
Company's acquisition of the United States coal operations of Atlantic
Richfield Company on June 1, 1998. The principal operating units of Arch
Western are Thunder Basin Coal Company, L.L.C., which operates the Black
Thunder and Coal Creek mines in the Southern Powder River Basin in Wyoming;
Mountain Coal Company, L.L.C., which operates the West Elk mine in Colorado;
Canyon Fuel Company, LLC ("Canyon Fuel"), which operates three mines in Utah;
and Arch of Wyoming, LLC, which operates two mines in the Hanna Basin of
Wyoming. Arch Western owns 100% of the membership interests of Thunder Basin
Coal Company, L.L.C., Mountain Coal Company, L.L.C. and Arch of Wyoming, LLC.
Arch Western owns a 65% membership interest in Canyon Fuel, with the remaining
35% membership interest owned by ITOCHU Coal International Inc., a subsidiary
of ITOCHU Corporation of Japan.

Recent Developments

  On February 22, 2001, the Company completed a public offering of 9,927,765
shares of its common stock. The offering consisted of 5,170,797 shares sold
directly by the Company and 4,756,968 shares held by Ashland Inc. The net
proceeds realized by the Company from the offering of $93.2 million were used
to pay down debt.

Business Environment

  United States Coal Markets. Production of coal in the United States has
increased from 434 million tons in 1960 to over 1.08 billion tons estimated in
2000. The following table sets forth demand trends for United States coal by
consuming sector through 2020 as compiled and estimated(e) or forecasted(f) by
the United States Department of Energy/Energy Information Agency. 2000 numbers
supplied from the Agency throughout this document are annualized using results
from the first ten months of the year.

  Electricity Generation. Over the past several decades, coal has consistently
maintained a 50% to 53% market share over competing energy sources to generate
electricity because of its relatively low cost and its availability throughout
the United States. On an average, all-in cost per megawatt-hour basis, coal-
fired

                                       1
<PAGE>

generation is substantially less expensive than electricity generated
utilizing natural gas, oil or nuclear power. Hydroelectric power is
inexpensive but is limited geographically, and there are few suitable sites
for new hydroelectric power dams. Consequently, approximately 91% of the coal
produced in the United States in 2000 was sold in the domestic market as a
fuel to the electric generation segment. The remainder of the tons were sold
as steam coal for industrial and residential purposes, into the export market,
and as metallurgical coal. In addition to the relative competitiveness of
coal-fired generation plants, coal consumption patterns are also influenced by
the demand for electricity, governmental regulation impacting coal production
and power generation, technological developments and the location,
availability and quality of competing sources of coal, as well as alternative
fuels such as natural gas, oil and nuclear and alternative energy sources such
as hydroelectric power.

  Long-term demand for electric power will depend upon a variety of economic,
regulatory, technological and climatic factors beyond the Company's control.
Historically, domestic demand for electric power has increased as the United
States economy has grown. Two important regulatory initiatives, one designed
to increase competition among utilities and lower the cost of electricity for
consumers, and another to improve air quality by reducing the level of sulfur
emitted from coal-burning power generation plants, have had and are expected
to continue to have significant effects on the electric utility industry and
its coal suppliers.

  According to the Energy Information Agency, coal is expected to remain the
primary fuel for electricity generation through 2020. The following table sets
forth the source fuel for electricity generation from 1990 through 2020 as
compiled and estimated(e) or forecasted(f) by the Energy Information Agency.

  Coal's primary advantage is its relatively low cost compared to other fuels
used to generate electricity. The following table sets forth the Energy
Information Agency's forecast of delivered fuel prices to electric utilities
through 2020. The table contains two data-sets. The top data-set is derived
from the Energy Information Agency's Long-Term forecast published in December
2000 and is presented in 1999 dollars. The lower data-set is derived from the
Energy Information Agency's Short-Term outlook published in February 2001. The
expected prices for petroleum fuel-oil and natural gas for 2001 and 2002 are
considerably above the forecasted prices published in December 2000, which
highlights the pricing volatility of petroleum and natural gas compared to
coal.

Sales and Marketing

  The Company sells coal both under long-term contracts, the terms of which
are greater than 12 months, and on a current market or spot basis. When the
Company's coal sales contracts expire or are terminated, it is exposed to the
risk of having to sell coal into the spot market, where demand is variable and
prices are subject to greater volatility. Historically, the price of coal sold
under long-term contracts has exceeded prevailing spot prices for coal.
However, in the past several years new contracts have been priced at or near
existing spot rates.

  The terms of the Company's coal sales contracts result from bidding and
extensive negotiations with customers. Consequently, the terms of these
contracts typically vary significantly in many respects, including price
adjustment features, provisions permitting renegotiation or modification of
coal sale prices, coal quality requirements, quantity parameters, flexibility
and adjustment mechanisms, permitted sources of supply, treatment of
environmental constraints, options to extend and force majeure, suspension,
termination and assignment provisions.

  Provisions permitting renegotiation or modification of coal sale prices are
present in many of the Company's more recently negotiated long-term contracts
and usually occur midway through a contract or every two to three years,
depending upon the length of the contract. In some circumstances, customers
have the option to terminate the contract if prices have increased by a
specified percentage from the price at the commencement of the contract or if
the parties cannot agree on a new price. The term of sales contracts has
decreased significantly over the last two decades as competition in the coal
industry has increased and, more recently, as electricity generators have
prepared themselves for federal Clean Air Act requirements and the impending
deregulation of their industry.

  There are some contract terms that differ between a standard "eastern United
States" contract and a standard "western United States" contract. In the
eastern United States, many customers require that the coal be sampled and
weighed at the destination. In the western United States, virtually all
samples are taken at the source. More

                                       3

eastern United States coal is purchased on the spot market. The eastern United
States market has more recently been a shorter-term market because of the
larger number of smaller mining operations in that region. Western United
States contracts sometimes stipulate that some production taxes and coal
royalties be reimbursed in full by the buyer rather than as a pricing
component within the contract. These items comprise a significant portion of
western United States coal pricing.

  A factor that may impact the Company's sale of coal in the future is the
development of coal commodity trading. The New York Mercantile Exchange
initiated electricity commodity trading a few years ago and has developed
standards for a coal contract. The Exchange has announced that it intends to
initiate coal contract trading based on a Huntington, West Virginia barge
loading hub. However, the Exchange has not yet initiated trading. The
development of standards to determine pricing has been difficult because of
the non-homogeneous character of coal and diversity in mining locations,
conditions and operations. Nonetheless, in anticipation of commodity trading,
some brokerage and marketing firms have entered the coal markets and devised
transactions that mimic commodity activity. Today, limited, but growing, over-
the-counter trading is being conducted on both firm-forward transactions as
well as put, call and other options. The trend to more commodity-type
transactions could mark a significant change in how coal is sold. The Company
is unable to predict whether this trend will have a material effect on its
sales and whether any such effect would be positive or negative on its
operating results.

Competition

  The coal industry is intensely competitive, primarily as a result of the
existence of numerous producers in the coal producing regions in which the
Company operates. The Company competes with several major coal producers in
the Central Appalachian and Powder River Basin areas. It also competes with a
number of smaller producers in those and its other market regions.

                                       4

Operations

  As of December 31, 2000, the Company operated a total of 28 mines, all
located in the United States. Coal is transported from the Company's mining
complexes to customers by means of railroad cars, river barges or trucks, or a
combination of these means of transportation. As is customary in the industry,
virtually all the Company's coal sales are made F.O.B. mine or loadout,

Transportation

  Coal from the mines of the Company's subsidiaries is transported by rail,
truck and barge to domestic customers and to Atlantic or Pacific coast
terminals for shipment to domestic and international customers.

  The Company's Arch Coal Terminal is located on a 60-acre site on the Big
Sandy River approximately seven miles upstream from its confluence with the
Ohio River. Arch Coal Terminal provides coal storage and transloading
services.

  The Company's Paint Creek Terminal is located on leased property on the
Kanawha River at Crown Hill, West Virginia. The facility transloads coal
trucked from the Campbells Creek and Samples mines for shipment by barge to
the Company's customers.

  Company subsidiaries together own a 17.5% interest in Dominion Terminal
Associates ("DTA"), which leases and operates a ground storage-to-vessel coal
transloading facility (the "DTA Facility") in Newport News, Virginia. The DTA
Facility has a rated throughput capacity of 20 million tons of coal per year
and ground storage capacity of approximately 1.7 million tons. The DTA
Facility serves international customers, as well as domestic coal users
located on the eastern seaboard of the United States.

  As of December 31, 2000, Arch Western owned a 5.3% equity interest and
Canyon Fuel owned a 9.0% equity interest in the Los Angeles Export Terminal
("LAXT"), which owns and operates a dry bulk terminal operation within the
Port of Los Angeles. LAXT is served by the Union Pacific railroad. Current
annual rated capacity at the terminal is 10 million tons. The City of Los
Angeles owns the land upon which the facility has been constructed. LAXT has
entered into a 35 year lease with the City which provides compensation for its
contribution of cash and land to the venture. The total cost of the facility
was approximately $144 million.

Regulations Affecting Coal Mining

  The information contained in the "Contingencies--Reclamation" and "Certain
Trends and Uncertainties--Environmental and Regulatory Factors" sections of
"Management's Discussion and Analysis" of the Company's 2000 Annual Report to
Stockholders is incorporated herein by reference.

Glossary Of Selected Mining Terms

  Assigned Reserves. Recoverable coal reserves that have been designated for
mining by a specific operation.

  Auger Mining. Auger mining employs a large auger, which functions much like
a carpenter's drill. The auger bores into a coal seam and discharges coal out
of the spiral onto waiting conveyor belts. After augering is completed, the
openings are reclaimed. This method of mining is usually employed to recover
any additional coal left in deep overburden areas that cannot be reached
economically by other types of surface mining.

  Btu--British Thermal Unit. A measure of the energy required to raise the
temperature of one pound of water one degree Fahrenheit.

  Coal Seam. A bed or stratum of coal.

  Coal Washing. The process of removing impurities, such as ash and sulfur
based compounds, from coal.

  Compliance Coal. Coal which, when burned, emits 1.2 pounds or less of sulfur
dioxide per million Btus. Compliance coal requires no mixing with other coals
or use of sulfur dioxide reduction technologies by generators of electricity
to comply with the requirements of the federal Clean Air Act.

  Continuous Mining. One of two major underground mining methods now used in
the United States (also see "Longwall Mining"). This process utilizes a
machine--a "continuous miner"--that mechanizes the entire

                                       7
<PAGE>

coal extraction process. The continuous miner removes or "cuts" the coal from
the seam. The loosened coal then falls on a conveyor for removal to a shuttle
car or larger conveyor belt system.

  Dragline. A large machine used in the surface mining process to remove the
overburden, or layers of earth and rock, covering a coal seam. The dragline
has a large bucket suspended from the end of a long boom. The bucket, which is
suspended by cables, is able to scoop up great amounts of overburden as it is
dragged across the excavation area.

  Longwall Mining. One of two major underground coal mining methods currently
in use (see also "Continuous Mining"). This method employs a rotating drum,
which is pulled mechanically back and forth across a face of coal that is
usually several hundred feet long. The loosened coal falls onto a conveyor for
removal from the mine. Longwall operations include a hydraulic roof support
system that advances as mining proceeds, allowing the roof to fall in a
controlled manner in areas already mined.

  Low-Sulfur Coal. Coal which, when burned, emits 1.6 pounds or less of sulfur
dioxide per million Btus.

  Metallurgical Coal. The various grades of coal suitable for distillation
into carbon in connection with the manufacture of steel. Also known as "met"
coal.

  Overburden. Layers of earth and rock covering a coal seam. In surface mining
operations, overburden is removed prior to coal extraction.

  Preparation Plant. A preparation plant is a facility for crushing, sizing
and washing coal to prepare it for use by a particular customer. The washing
process has the added benefit of removing some of the coal's sulfur content.

  Probable Reserves. Reserves for which quantity and grade and/or quality are
computed from information similar to that used for proven reserves, but the
sites for inspection, sampling and measurement are farther apart; therefore,
the degree of assurance, although lower than that for proven (measured)
reserves, is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation.

  Proven Reserves. Reserves for which (a) quantity is computed from dimensions
revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings or drill holes; grade and/or quality
are computed from the results of detailed sampling and (b) the sites for
inspection, sampling and measurement are spaced so closely and the geologic
character is so well defined that size, shape, depth and mineral content of
reserves are well established.

  Reclamation. The restoration of land and environmental values to a mining
site after the coal is extracted. Reclamation operations are usually underway
where the coal has already been taken from a mine, even as mining operations
are taking place elsewhere at the side. The process commonly includes
"recontouring" or shaping the land to its approximate original appearance,
restoring topsoil and planting native grass and ground covers.

  Recoverable Reserves. The amount of proven and probable reserves that can
actually be recovered from the reserve base taking into account all mining and
preparation losses involved in producing a saleable product using existing
methods and under current law.

  Spot Market. Sales of coal under an agreement for shipments over a period of
one year or less.

  Steam Coal. Coal used in steam boilers to produce electricity.

  Surface Mine. A mine in which the coal lies near the surface and can be
extracted by removing overburden.

  Tons. References to a "ton" mean a "short" or net tonne, which is equal to
2,000 pounds.

  Unassigned Reserves. Recoverable coal reserves that have not yet been
designated for mining by a specific operation.

                                       8
<PAGE>

  Underground Mine. Also known as a "deep" mine. Usually located several
hundred feet below the earth's surface, an underground mine's coal is removed
mechanically and transferred by shuttle car or conveyor to the surface.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

  The Company estimates that it owned or controlled, as of December 31, 2000,
approximately 3.37 billion tons of proven and probable recoverable reserves,
approximately 1.90 billion tons of which were assigned reserves and
approximately 1.47 billion tons of which were unassigned reserves. Assigned
reserves are recoverable coal reserves that have been designated to be mined
by a specific operation. Unassigned reserves are recoverable reserves that
have not yet been designated for mining by a specific operation. Recoverable
reserves include only saleable coal and do not include coal which would remain
unextracted, such as for support pillars, and processing losses, such as
washery losses. Reserve estimates are prepared by the Company's engineers and
geologists and reviewed and updated periodically. Total recoverable reserve
estimates and reserves dedicated to mines and complexes change from time to
time to reflect mining activities, analysis of new engineering and geological
data, changes in reserve holdings and other factors. The following table
presents the Company's estimated recoverable coal reserves at December 31,
2000:

* Represents 100% of the reserves held by Canyon Fuel, in which the Company
  has a 65% interest.

                                      10
<PAGE>

  Over 98% of the Company's recoverable reserves consists of steam coal, which
is coal used in steam boilers to make electricity. Less than 2% of the
Company's recoverable reserves consists of metallurgical coal, which is a
grade of coal used in the production of steel. Metallurgical coal represents
an immaterial amount of the Company's operations.

  As of December 31, 2000, approximately 87,057 acres (which includes 100% of
the acreage held by Canyon Fuel) out of the Company's total of 579,000 acres
of coal land was leased from the federal government. These leases have terms
expiring between 2001 and 2019, subject to readjustment or extension and to
earlier termination for failure to meet diligent development requirements. The
Company has entered into leases covering substantially all of its leased
reserves which are not scheduled to expire prior to expiration of projected
mining activities. The Company also controls, through ownership or long-term
leases, approximately 5,850 acres of land which are used either for its coal
processing facilities or are being held for possible future development.
Royalties are paid to lessors either as a fixed price per ton or as a
percentage of the gross sales price of the mined coal. The Company pays
percentage-based royalties under the majority of its significant leases. The
terms of most of these leases extend until the exhaustion of mineable and
merchantable coal. The remaining leases have initial terms ranging from one to
40 years from the date of their execution, with most containing options to
renew. In some cases, a lease bonus, or prepaid royalty, is required, payable
either at the time of execution of the lease or in annual installments. In
most cases, the prepaid royalty amount is applied to reduce future production
royalties.

  The Pine Creek, Black Bear, Campbells Creek, Samples, Ruffner and Holden
25/Ragland preparation plants and related loadout facilities are located on
properties held under leases which expire at varying dates over the next
thirty years with either optional 20-year extensions or with unlimited
extensions, and the balance of the Company's preparation plants and loadout
facilities are located on property owned by the Company.

  All of the identified coal reserves held by the Company's subsidiaries have
been subject to preliminary coal seam analysis to test sulfur content. Of
these reserves, approximately 68.2% consist of compliance coal while an
additional 21.3% could be sold as low-sulfur coal. The balance is classified
as high-sulfur coal. Some of the Company's low-sulfur coal can be marketed as
compliance coal when blended with other compliance coal. Accordingly, most of
the Company's reserves are primarily suitable for the domestic steam coal
markets. However, a substantial portion of the low-sulfur and compliance coal
reserves at the Mingo Logan operations may also be used as a high-volatile,
low-sulfur, metallurgical coal.

  Title to coal properties held by lessors or grantors to the Company and its
subsidiaries and the boundaries of properties are normally verified at the
time of leasing or acquisition. However, in cases involving less significant
properties and consistent with industry practices, title and boundaries are
not completely verified until such time as the Company's independent operating
subsidiaries prepare to mine such reserves. If defects in title or boundaries
of undeveloped reserves are discovered in the future, control of and the right
to mine such reserves could be adversely affected.

  From time to time, lessors or sublessors of land leased by the Company's
subsidiaries have sought to terminate such leases on the basis that such
subsidiaries have failed to comply with the financial terms of the leases or
that the mining and related operations conducted by such subsidiaries are not
authorized by the leases. Some of these allegations relate to leases upon
which the Company conducts operations material to the Company's consolidated
financial position, results of operations and liquidity, but the Company does
not believe any pending claims by such lessors or sublessors have merit or
will result in the termination of any material lease or sublease.

  The Company must obtain permits from applicable state regulatory authorities
before it begins to mine particular reserves. Applications for permits require
extensive engineering and data analysis and presentation, and must address a
variety of environmental, health and safety matters associated with a proposed
mining operation. These matters include the manner and sequencing of coal
extraction, the storage, use and disposal of waste and other substances and
other impacts on the environment, the construction of overburden fills and
water containment areas, and reclamation of the area after coal extraction.
The Company is required to post bonds to

                                      11
<PAGE>

secure performance under its permits. As is typical in the coal industry, the
Company strives to obtain mining permits within a time frame that allows it to
mine reserves as planned on an uninterrupted basis. The Company generally
begins preparing applications for permits for areas that it intends to mine up
to three years in advance of their expected issuance date. Regulatory
authorities have considerable discretion in the timing of permit issuance and
the public has rights to comment on and otherwise engage in the permitting
process, including through intervention in the courts.

  The Company's reported coal reserves are those that could be economically
and legally extracted or produced at the time of their determination. In
determining whether the Company's reserves meet this standard, it takes into
account, among other things, the Company's potential inability to obtain a
mining permit, the possible necessity of revising a mining plan, changes in
estimated future costs, changes in future cash flows caused by changes in
costs required to be incurred to meet regulatory requirements and obtaining
mining permits, variations in quantity and quality of coal, and varying levels
of demand and their effects on selling prices. Except as described elsewhere
in this document with respect to permits to conduct mining operations
involving valley fills, which has been taken into account in determining the
Company's reserves, the Company is not currently aware of matters which would
significantly hinder its ability to obtain future mining permits with respect
to its reserves.

  The carrying cost of the Company's coal reserves at December 31, 2000 (which
does not include the Company's 65% share of Canyon Fuel) was $910.7 million,
consisting of $19.8 million of prepaid royalties and the $890.9 million net
book value of coal lands and mineral rights.

  The Company's executive headquarters occupy approximately 50,000 square feet
of leased space at CityPlace One, St. Louis, Missouri. See "Item 1. Business"
for a further description of the Company's subsidiaries' mining complexes,
mines, transportation facilities and other operations. The Company's
subsidiaries currently own or lease the equipment utilized in their mining
operations.
