ITEM 1. BUSINESS

GENERAL

     Arch Coal, Inc. ("Arch Coal" or the "Company") is one of the largest coal
producers in the United States. The Company mines, processes and markets
compliance and low-sulfur coal from mines located in both the eastern and
western United States, enabling it to ship coal cost-effectively to most of the
major domestic coal-fired electric generation facilities. As of December 31,
2002, the Company had 25 operating mines and controlled approximately 2.9
billion tons of proven and probable coal reserves. Arch Coal sold 106.7 million
tons of coal in 2002. The Company sells substantially all of its coal to
producers of electric power.

     The Company owns a 99% membership interest in Arch Western Resources, LLC
("Arch Western"), a joint venture that was formed in connection with the
Company's acquisition of the United States coal operations of Atlantic Richfield
Company on June 1, 1998. The principal operating units of Arch Western are
Thunder Basin Coal Company, L.L.C., which operates the Black Thunder mine in the
Southern Powder River Basin in Wyoming; Mountain Coal Company, L.L.C., which
operates the West Elk mine in Colorado; Canyon Fuel Company, LLC ("Canyon
Fuel"), which operates three mines in Utah; and Arch of Wyoming, LLC, which
operates two mines in the Hanna Basin of Wyoming. Arch Western owns 100% of the
membership interests of Thunder Basin Coal Company, L.L.C., Mountain Coal
Company, L.L.C. and Arch of Wyoming, LLC. Arch Western owns a 65% membership
interest in Canyon Fuel, with the remaining 35% membership interest owned by
ITOCHU Coal International Inc., a subsidiary of ITOCHU Corporation of Japan.

     Electricity Generation.  Coal has consistently maintained a 49% to 53%
market share over competing energy sources to generate electricity during the
past ten years because of its relatively low cost and its availability
throughout the United States. Coal is the lowest cost fossil-fuel used for
base-load electric power generation -- considerably less expensive than natural
gas or oil. Coal-fired generation is also competitive with nuclear power
generation, especially on an all-in cost per megawatt-hour basis. Hydroelectric
power is inexpensive but is limited by both geography and susceptibility to
seasonal and climatic conditions. Non hydropower renewable power generation
accounts for less than 6% of all the electricity generated in the U.S. and is
limited by resources and/or technology. Consequently, approximately 88% of the
coal produced in the United States in 2002 was sold in the domestic market as a
fuel to the electric generation segment. The remainder of the tons were sold in
2002 as steam coal for industrial and residential purposes, into the export
market, and as metallurgical coal. In addition to the relative competitiveness
of coal-fired generation plants, coal consumption patterns are also influenced
by the demand for electricity, governmental regulation

                                        1
<PAGE>

impacting coal production and power generation, technological developments and
the location, availability and quality of competing sources of coal, as well as
other fuels such as natural gas, oil and nuclear and alternative energy sources
such as hydroelectric power.

     Long-term demand for electric power will depend upon a variety of economic,
regulatory, technological and climatic factors beyond our control. Historically,
domestic demand for electric power has increased as the United States economy
has grown. Two important regulatory initiatives, one designed to increase
competition among utilities and lower the cost of electricity for consumers, and
another to improve air quality by reducing the level of sulfur emitted from
coal-burning power generation plants, have had and are expected to continue to
have significant effects on the electric utility industry and its coal
suppliers.

     According to the Energy Information Agency, coal is expected to remain the
primary fuel for electricity generation through 2025. The following table sets
forth the source fuel for electricity generation from 1990 through 2025 as
compiled, preliminary(p), annualized(a) or forecasted(f) by the Energy
Information Agency.

SALES AND MARKETING

     The Company sells coal both under long-term contracts, the terms of which
are greater than 12 months, and on a current market or spot basis. When the
Company's coal sales contracts expire or are terminated, it is exposed to the
risk of having to sell coal into the spot market, where demand is variable and
prices are subject to greater volatility. Historically, the price of coal sold
under long-term contracts has exceeded prevailing spot prices for coal. However,
in the past several years new contracts have been priced at or near existing
spot rates.

     The terms of the Company's coal sales contracts result from bidding and
extensive negotiations with customers. Consequently, the terms of these
contracts typically vary significantly in many respects, including price
adjustment features, provisions permitting renegotiation or modification of coal
sale prices, coal quality requirements, quantity parameters, flexibility and
adjustment mechanisms, permitted sources of supply, treatment of environmental
constraints, options to extend, and force majeure, suspension, termination and
assignment provisions.

     Provisions permitting renegotiation or modification of coal sale prices are
present in many of the Company's more recently negotiated long-term contracts
and usually occur midway through a contract or every two to three years,
depending upon the length of the contract. In some circumstances, customers have
the option to terminate the contract if prices have increased by a specified
percentage from the price at the commencement of the contract or if the parties
cannot agree on a new price. The term of sales contracts has decreased
significantly over the last two decades as competition in the coal industry has
increased and, more recently, as electricity generators have prepared themselves
for federal Clean Air Act requirements and the impending deregulation of their
industry.

                                        3
<PAGE>

     There are some contract terms that differ between a standard "eastern
United States" contract and a standard "western United States" contract. In the
eastern United States, many customers require that the coal be sampled and
weighed at the destination. In the western United States, virtually all samples
are taken at the source. More eastern United States coal is purchased on the
spot market. The eastern United States market has more recently been a
shorter-term market because of the larger number of smaller mining operations in
that region. Western United States contracts sometimes stipulate that some
production taxes and coal royalties be reimbursed in full by the buyer rather
than as a pricing component within the contract. These items comprise a
significant portion of western United States coal pricing.

     A factor that may impact the Company's sale of coal in the future is the
development of coal commodity trading. The New York Mercantile Exchange has
initiated both electricity commodity trading and coal contract trading. The coal
contract trading is based on a Huntington, West Virginia barge loading hub. In
addition, some brokerage and marketing firms have entered the coal markets and
devised transactions that mimic commodity activity. Today, limited
over-the-counter trading is being conducted on both firm-forward transactions as
well as put, call and other options. A trend to more commodity-type transactions
could mark a significant change in how coal is sold. The Company is unable to
predict whether this trend will have a material effect on its sales and whether
any such effect would be positive or negative on its operating results.

COMPETITION

     The coal industry is intensely competitive, primarily as a result of the
existence of numerous producers in the coal producing regions in which the
Company operates. The Company competes with several major coal producers in the
Central Appalachian and Powder River Basin areas. It also competes with a number
of smaller producers in those and its other market regions.

OPERATIONS

     As of December 31, 2002, the Company operated a total of 25 mines, all
located in the United States. Coal is transported from the Company's mining
complexes to customers by means of railroad cars, river barges or trucks, or a
combination of these means of transportation. As is customary in the industry,
virtually all the Company's coal sales are made F.O.B. mine or loadout, meaning
that customers are responsible for the cost of transporting purchased coal to
their facilities. The following table provides the location and a summary of
information regarding the Company's principal mining complexes and the coal
reserves associated with these operations as of December 31, 2002:

TRANSPORTATION

     Coal from the mines of the Company's subsidiaries is transported by rail,
truck and barge to domestic customers and to Atlantic or Pacific coast terminals
for shipment to domestic and international customers.

     The Company's Arch Coal Terminal is located on a 60-acre site on the Big
Sandy River approximately seven miles upstream from its confluence with the Ohio
River. Arch Coal Terminal provides coal storage and transloading services.

     Company subsidiaries together own a 17.5% interest in Dominion Terminal
Associates ("DTA"), which leases and operates a ground storage-to-vessel coal
transloading facility (the "DTA Facility") in Newport News, Virginia. The DTA
Facility has a rated throughput capacity of 20 million tons of coal per year and
ground storage capacity of approximately 1.7 million tons. The DTA Facility
serves international customers, as well as domestic coal users located on the
eastern seaboard of the United States.

REGULATIONS AFFECTING COAL MINING

     The information contained in the "Contingencies -- Reclamation" and
"Certain Trends and Uncertainties -- Environmental and Regulatory Factors"
sections of "Management's Discussion and Analysis" of the Company's 2002 Annual
Report to Stockholders is incorporated herein by reference.

GLOSSARY OF SELECTED MINING TERMS

     Assigned Reserves.  Recoverable coal reserves that have been designated for
mining by a specific operation.

     Auger Mining.  Auger mining employs a large auger, which functions much
like a carpenter's drill. The auger bores into a coal seam and discharges coal
out of the spiral onto waiting conveyor belts. After augering is completed, the
openings are reclaimed. This method of mining is usually employed to recover any
additional coal left in deep overburden areas that cannot be reached
economically by other types of surface mining.

     Btu -- British Thermal Unit.  A measure of the energy required to raise the
temperature of one pound of water one degree Fahrenheit.

     Coal Seam.  A bed or stratum of coal.

     Coal Washing.  The process of removing impurities, such as ash and sulfur
based compounds, from coal.

     Compliance Coal.  Coal which, when burned, emits 1.2 pounds or less of
sulfur dioxide per million Btus. Compliance coal requires no mixing with other
coals or use of sulfur dioxide reduction technologies by generators of
electricity to comply with the requirements of the federal Clean Air Act.

     Continuous Mining.  One of two major underground mining methods now used in
the United States (also see "Longwall Mining"). This process utilizes a
machine -- a "continuous miner" -- that mechanizes the entire coal extraction
process. The continuous miner removes or "cuts" the coal from the seam. The
loosened coal then falls on a conveyor for removal to a shuttle car or larger
conveyor belt system.

     Dragline.  A large machine used in the surface mining process to remove the
overburden, or layers of earth and rock, covering a coal seam. The dragline has
a large bucket suspended from the end of a long boom. The bucket, which is
suspended by cables, is able to scoop up great amounts of overburden as it is
dragged across the excavation area.

                                        6
<PAGE>

     Longwall Mining.  One of two major underground coal mining methods now used
in the United States (see also "Continuous Mining"). This method employs a
rotating drum, which is pulled mechanically back and forth across a face of coal
that is usually several hundred feet long. The loosened coal falls onto a
conveyor for removal from the mine. Longwall operations include a hydraulic roof
support system that advances as mining proceeds, allowing the roof to fall in a
controlled manner in areas already mined.

     Low-Sulfur Coal.  Coal which, when burned, emits 1.6 pounds or less of
sulfur dioxide per million Btus.

     Metallurgical Coal.  The various grades of coal suitable for distillation
into carbon in connection with the manufacture of steel. Also known as "met"
coal.

     Preparation Plant.  A preparation plant is a facility for crushing, sizing
and washing coal to prepare it for use by a particular customer. The washing
process has the added benefit of removing some of the coal's sulfur content.

     Probable Reserves.  Reserves for which quantity and grade and/or quality
are computed from information similar to that used for proven reserves, but the
sites for inspection, sampling and measurement are farther apart; therefore, the
degree of assurance, although lower than that for proven (measured) reserves, is
high enough to assume continuity between points of observation.

     Proven Reserves.  Reserves for which (a) quantity is computed from
dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings or drill holes; grade and/or
quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling and (b) the sites for
inspection, sampling and measurement are spaced so closely and the geologic
character is so well defined that size, shape, depth and mineral content of
reserves are well established.

     Reclamation.  The restoration of land and environmental values to a mining
site after the coal is extracted. Reclamation operations are usually underway
where the coal has already been taken from a mine, even as mining operations are
taking place elsewhere at the site. The process commonly includes "recontouring"
or shaping the land to its approximate original appearance, restoring topsoil
and planting native grass and ground covers.

     Recoverable Reserves.  The amount of proven and probable reserves that can
actually be recovered from the reserve base taking into account all mining and
preparation losses involved in producing a saleable product using existing
methods and under current law.

     Spot Market.  Sales of coal under an agreement for shipments over a period
of one year or less.

     Steam Coal.  Coal used in steam boilers to produce electricity.

     Surface Mine.  A mine in which the coal lies near the surface and can be
extracted by removing overburden.

     Tons.  References to a "ton" mean a "short" or net tonne, which is equal to
2,000 pounds.

     Unassigned Reserves.  Recoverable coal reserves that have not yet been
designated for mining by a specific Company operation.

     Underground Mine.  Also known as a "deep" mine. Usually located several
hundred feet below the earth's surface, an underground mine's coal is removed
mechanically and transferred by shuttle car or conveyor to the surface.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

     The Company estimates that it owned or controlled, as of December 31, 2002,
approximately 2.9 billion tons of proven and probable recoverable reserves.
Recoverable reserves include only saleable coal and do not include coal which
would remain unextracted, such as for support pillars, and processing losses,
such as washery losses. Reserve estimates are prepared by the Company's
engineers and geologists and reviewed and updated periodically. Total
recoverable reserve estimates and reserves dedicated to mines and complexes
change from time to time to reflect mining activities, analysis of new
engineering and geological data, changes

-------------------------

* Represents 100% of the reserves held by Canyon Fuel, in which the Company has
  a 65% interest.

     Over 98% of the Company's recoverable reserves consists of steam coal,
which is coal used in steam boilers to make electricity. Less than 2% of the
Company's recoverable reserves consists of metallurgical coal, which is a grade
of coal used in the production of steel. Metallurgical coal represents an
immaterial amount of the Company's operations.

     As of December 31, 2002, approximately 86,659 acres (which includes 100% of
the acreage held by Canyon Fuel) out of the Company's total of approximately
608,000 acres of coal land was leased from the federal government. These leases
have terms expiring between 2002 and 2019, subject to readjustment or extension
and to earlier termination for failure to meet diligent development
requirements. The Company has entered into leases covering substantially all of
its leased reserves which are not scheduled to expire prior to expiration of
projected mining activities. Royalties are paid to lessors either as a
fixed-price per-ton or as a percentage of the gross sales price of the mined
coal. The Company pays percentage-based royalties under the majority of its
significant leases. The terms of most of these leases extend until the
exhaustion of mineable and merchantable coal. The remaining leases have initial
terms ranging from one to 40 years from the date of their execution, with most
containing options to renew. In some cases, a lease bonus, or prepaid royalty,
is required, payable either at the time of execution of the lease or in annual
installments. In most cases, the prepaid royalty amount is applied to reduce
future production royalties.

     The Pine Creek, Black Bear, Campbells Creek, Samples, Ruffner and Holden
25/Ragland preparation plants and related loadout facilities are located on
properties held under leases which expire at varying dates over the next thirty
years with either optional 20-year extensions or with unlimited extensions, and
the balance of the Company's preparation plants and loadout facilities are
located on property owned by the Company.

     All of the identified coal reserves held by the Company's subsidiaries have
been subject to preliminary coal seam analysis to test sulfur content. Of these
reserves, approximately 68% consist of compliance coal while an additional 21%
could be sold as low-sulfur coal. The balance is classified as high-sulfur coal.
Some of the Company's low-sulfur coal can be marketed as compliance coal when
blended with other compliance coal. Accordingly, most of the Company's reserves
are primarily suitable for the domestic steam coal markets. However, a
substantial portion of the low-sulfur and compliance coal reserves at the Mingo
Logan operations may also be used as a high-volatile, low-sulfur, metallurgical
coal.

     Title to coal properties held by lessors or grantors to the Company and its
subsidiaries and the boundaries of properties are normally verified at the time
of leasing or acquisition. However, in cases involving less significant
properties and consistent with industry practices, title and boundaries are not
completely verified until such time as the Company's independent operating
subsidiaries prepare to mine such reserves. If defects in title or boundaries of
undeveloped reserves are discovered in the future, control of and the right to
mine such reserves could be adversely affected.

     From time to time, lessors or sublessors of land leased by the Company's
subsidiaries have sought to terminate such leases on the basis that such
subsidiaries have failed to comply with the financial terms of the

                                        9
<PAGE>

leases or that the mining and related operations conducted by such subsidiaries
are not authorized by the leases. Some of these allegations relate to leases
upon which the Company conducts operations material to the Company's
consolidated financial position, results of operations and liquidity, but the
Company does not believe any pending claims by such lessors or sublessors have
merit or will result in the termination of any material lease or sublease.

     The Company must obtain permits from applicable state regulatory
authorities before it begins to mine particular reserves. Applications for
permits require extensive engineering and data analysis and presentation, and
must address a variety of environmental, health and safety matters associated
with a proposed mining operation. These matters include the manner and
sequencing of coal extraction, the storage, use and disposal of waste and other
substances and other impacts on the environment, the construction of overburden
fills and water containment areas, and reclamation of the area after coal
extraction. The Company is required to post bonds to secure performance under
its permits. As is typical in the coal industry, the Company strives to obtain
mining permits within a time frame that allows it to mine reserves as planned on
an uninterrupted basis. The Company generally begins preparing applications for
permits for areas that it intends to mine up to three years in advance of their
expected issuance date. Regulatory authorities have considerable discretion in
the timing of permit issuance and the public has rights to comment on and
otherwise engage in the permitting process, including through intervention in
the courts.

     The Company's reported coal reserves are those that could be economically
and legally extracted or produced at the time of their determination. In
determining whether the Company's reserves meet this standard, it takes into
account, among other things, the Company's potential inability to obtain a
mining permit, the possible necessity of revising a mining plan, changes in
estimated future costs, changes in future cash flows caused by changes in costs
required to be incurred to meet regulatory requirements and obtaining mining
permits, variations in quantity and quality of coal, and varying levels of
demand and their effects on selling prices. Except as described elsewhere in
this document with respect to permits to conduct mining operations involving
valley fills, which has been taken into account in determining the Company's
reserves, the Company is not currently aware of matters which would
significantly hinder its ability to obtain future mining permits with respect to
its reserves.

     The carrying cost of the Company's coal reserves at December 31, 2002
(which does not include the Company's 65% share of Canyon Fuel) was $816.9
million, consisting of $56.0 million of prepaid royalties and the $760.9 million
net book value of coal lands and mineral rights.

     The Company's executive headquarters occupy approximately 78,000 square
feet of leased space at One CityPlace Drive, in St. Louis, Missouri. See "Item
1. Business" for a further description of the Company's subsidiaries' mining
complexes, mines, transportation facilities and other operations. The Company's
subsidiaries currently own or lease the equipment utilized in their mining
operations.
