<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Strategic Realignment Plan</B>



<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">During 2004, we began the process of simplifying our business mix to focus solely on our core
travel and real estate services businesses. In connection with this process, we began a
four-phase strategic realignment plan to divest our non-core businesses. In the first phase,
completed in June&nbsp;2004, we disposed of our Jackson Hewitt tax preparation services business in an
initial public offering where we received proceeds of approximately $770&nbsp;million (net of
offering expenses). In the second phase, completed on January&nbsp;31, 2005, we spun-off our
mortgage, appraisal and fleet management businesses through the distribution to our stockholders
of all of the shares of common stock of PHH Corporation. In the third phase, completed on February&nbsp;22,
2005, we disposed of our Wright Express fuel card business in an initial public
offering, and in connection with the disposition, we received approximately $1&nbsp;billion (net
of offering expenses). The fourth and final phase of our strategic realignment plan is to dispose
of our Marketing Services division, including our Progeny Marketing Innovations, Trilegiant,
Trilegiant Loyalty Solutions and Cims businesses, which we expect to be consummated before the
conclusion of the third quarter of 2005. Upon completion of the strategic realignment plan, our
principal focus will be on the growth and profitability of our travel and real estate businesses.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Although we focus on organic growth, we may augment such growth through the select acquisition of
(or possible joint venture with) complementary businesses in the real estate and travel services
industries. We expect to fund the purchase price of any such acquisition with cash on hand or
borrowings under our credit lines. No assurance can be given with respect to the timing,
likelihood or business effect of any possible transaction. In addition, we continually review and
evaluate our portfolio of existing businesses to determine if they continue to meet our business
objectives. As part of our ongoing evaluation of such businesses, we intend from time to time to
explore and conduct discussions with regard to joint ventures, divestitures and related corporate
transactions. However, we can give no assurance with respect to the magnitude, timing, likelihood
or financial or business effect of any possible transaction. We also cannot predict whether any
divestitures or other transactions will be consummated or, if consummated, will result in a
financial or other benefit to us. We intend to use a portion of the proceeds from any such
dispositions and cash from operations to retire indebtedness, repurchase our common stock, make
acquisitions and for other general corporate purposes.

<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">We were created through a merger with HFS Incorporated in December&nbsp;1997 with the resultant
corporation being renamed Cendant Corporation. Our principal executive office is located at 9
West 57th Street, New York, New York 10019 (telephone number: (212)&nbsp;413-1800). We are subject

accordance therewith, we file reports, proxy and information statements and other information
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#147;Commission&#148; or the &#147;SEC&#148;) and certain of our
officers and directors file statements of changes in beneficial ownership on Form&nbsp;4 with the
Commission. Such reports, proxy statements and other information and such Form&nbsp;4s can be

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>SEGMENTS</B>



<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">In the first quarter of 2004, we established a new segment, the Mortgage Services segment,
consisting of our former mortgage business and our settlement services business which were
previously contained within the Real Estate Services segment. The Real Estate Services segment
was renamed the Real Estate Franchise and Operations segment in connection with such realignment.
In the second quarter of 2004, we also changed the name of our Financial Services segment to
Marketing Services. We recasted the financial information for our segments in connection with
these changes to our segment structure and in connection with the disposition of our tax
preparation business on Current Reports on Form&nbsp;8-K dated May&nbsp;3, 2004 and August&nbsp;2,
2004, respectively. As a result of the spin-off of our mortgage, appraisal and fleet management
businesses, we may further change our segment structure during 2005.

<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Our primary objectives are to sell new franchises, renew existing franchises and, most
importantly, provide world-class service and support to our franchisee real estate brokers in a
way that enables them to increase their revenue and profitability. We support our franchisees
with dedicated national marketing programs, technology, training and education.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">In exchange for the right to participate in one of our real estate franchise systems, our
franchisees pay us fees. Royalty and marketing fees on commissions from real estate transactions
are the primary component of revenue for our real estate franchise business. Our franchise
contracts generally have a term of ten years. In addition to offices owned and operated by our
franchisees, we own and operate approximately 940 of the Coldwell Banker, ERA, Coldwell Banker
Commercial and Sotheby&#146;s International Realty offices through our NRT subsidiary. NRT pays
intercompany royalty and marketing fees to our real estate franchise business in connection with
its operation of these offices. In 2004, NRT represented approximately 40% of the revenue
generated by our real estate franchise business though such revenue is eliminated in
consolidation.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">We also offer service providers an opportunity to market their products to our brokers through
our Preferred Alliance Program. To participate in this program, service providers generally pay
us an up-front fee, commissions or both. In connection with the spin-off of our former mortgage
business, PHH Mortgage will be the only Cendant endorsed provider of mortgages for the
franchisees of our real estate franchise systems. We will receive a marketing fee for promotion
in connection with our endorsement.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">We own the trademarks and intellectual property related to the CENTURY&nbsp;21, Coldwell Banker
and ERA franchise systems. We have an exclusive license to franchise the Sotheby&#146;s International
Realty system pursuant to a license agreement with Sotheby&#146;s Holdings, Inc. Such license
agreement has a 100-year term, which consists of an initial 50-year term and a 50-year renewal
option, whereby we pay a licensing fee to Sotheby&#146;s Holdings for the use of the Sotheby&#146;s
International Realty name. In connection with our acquisition of such license, we also acquired
the domestic residential real estate brokerage operations of Sotheby&#146;s which are now operated by
NRT. We paid approximately $100&nbsp;million in connection with such license and brokerages.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Each of our brands has a consumer web site that offers real estate listings, contacts and
services. Century21.com, coldwellbanker.com, coldwellbankercommercial.com, sothebysrealty.com and
era.com are the official web sites for the CENTURY&nbsp;21, Coldwell Banker, Coldwell Banker
Commercial, Sotheby&#146;s International Realty and ERA real estate franchise systems, respectively.
In addition, listings of our CENTURY&nbsp;21, Coldwell Banker and ERA brands are available through
the Realtor.com web site.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Growth. </B>Our strategies for growth include the continued expansion of our franchise systems
through additional franchise sales; facilitating mergers and acquisitions with our franchisees;
providing products, tools and technologies to improve broker revenue profitability; international
expansion; and aggressive marketing of the Sotheby&#146;s International Realty brand.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Competition. </B>Competition among the national real estate brokerage brand franchisors to grow their
franchise systems is intense. Our largest national competitors in this industry include the
Prudential, GMAC Real Estate and RE/MAX real estate brokerage brands. In addition, a real estate
broker may choose to affiliate with a regional chain or choose not to affiliate with a franchisor
but to remain independent. We believe that competition for the sale of franchises in the real
estate brokerage industry is based principally upon the perceived value and quality of the brand
and services offered to franchisees.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">The ability of our real estate brokerage franchisees to compete in this industry is important to
our prospects for growth. The ability of an individual franchisee to compete may be affected by
the location of its office, the services provided to its real estate agents, the number of
competing offices in the vicinity, its affiliation with a recognized brand name, community
reputation and other factors. A franchisee&#146;s success may also be affected by general, regional
and local economic conditions. The potential negative effect of these conditions on our results
of operations is generally reduced by virtue of the diverse geographical locations of our
franchisees. At December&nbsp;31, 2004, our combined real estate franchise systems had
approximately 8,650&nbsp;brokerage offices in the United States and approximately 13,700&nbsp;offices
worldwide. The real estate franchise systems have offices in 57 countries and territories
in North and South America, Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B><I>Real Estate Brokerage Business </I></B>(25%, 23% and 20% of revenue for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively)



<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Through our NRT Incorporated subsidiary, we operate the largest residential real estate brokerage
firm in the United States and have offices in the United Kingdom. We offer assistance with the
sale and purchase of properties through approximately 1,000 full service real estate brokerage
offices nationwide, principally under the Coldwell Banker, ERA, Corcoran Group, The Sunshine
Group and Sotheby&#146;s International Realty brand names. In addition, as a full service real estate
brokerage offering one-stop shopping to consumers, we promote the services of Cendant Mobility
and Cendant Settlement Services, in addition to PHH Mortgage (formerly Cendant Mortgage).


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Our real estate brokerage business derives revenue primarily from sales commissions, which we
receive at the closing of real estate transactions. Sales commissions usually range from 5% to 7%
of the sales price. In transactions in which we act as broker on one side of a transaction
(either the buying side or the selling side) and a third party is acting as broker on the other
side of the transaction, we typically agree to share half of the sales commission with the other
broker. Sales associates generally receive between 50% and 80% of such commissions.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">In connection with the spin-off of our former mortgage business, we formed a venture (the
&#147;mortgage venture&#148;) with PHH, named PHH Home Loans, LLC, for the purpose of originating and
selling mortgage loans primarily sourced through our residential real estate brokerage and
relocation businesses. We own 49.9% of the mortgage venture. The mortgage venture has a 50-year
term, subject to earlier termination upon the occurrence of certain events or at our election at
any time after January&nbsp;31, 2012 by providing two years&#146; notice to PHH. PHH may terminate the
venture upon the occurrence of certain events or, at its option, after January&nbsp;31, 2030. All
mortgage loans originated by the mortgage venture will be sold to PHH Mortgage or other third
party investors, and PHH Home Loans will not hold any mortgage loans for investment purposes or
perform servicing functions for any loans it originates. Accordingly, we will have no mortgage
servicing rights asset risk. PHH Home Loans will be the exclusive recommended provider of
mortgages for NRT. Until the mortgage venture is fully licensed, we have agreed that PHH Mortgage
is the exclusive recommended provider of mortgage products and services promoted by NRT and
Cendant Mobility for which we will receive a marketing fee.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Growth. </B>Our strategy is to grow both organically and through the acquisition of independent real
estate brokerages. In 2004, we acquired 21 brokerages (excluding the February&nbsp;2004 acquisition of
Sotheby&#146;s International Realty) for approximately $115&nbsp;million in cash. To grow organically,
we seek to recruit and retain sales associates, continue to provide exceptional service in
existing markets, and enter new markets. When we acquire a real estate brokerage, we typically
convert it to one of our existing real estate brands. We believe that approximately 60% of real
estate brokerages are currently unaffiliated with a real estate franchise brand.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Competition. </B>The real estate brokerage industry is highly competitive, particularly in the
metropolitan areas in which NRT operates. In addition, the industry has relatively low barriers
to entry for new participants, including participants pursuing non-traditional methods of
marketing real estate, such as internet-based listing services. Companies compete for sales and
marketing business primarily on the basis of services offered, reputation, personal contacts, and
brokerage commissions. NRT competes primarily with franchisees of local and regional real estate
franchisors; franchisees of our brands and of other national real estate franchisors, such as the
RE/MAX, GMAC Real Estate and Prudential real estate brokerage brands; regional independent real
estate organizations, such as Weichert Realtors and Long&nbsp;&#038; Foster Real Estate; discount
brokerages, such as Foxtons; web sites such as Lendingtree.com, and smaller niche companies
competing in local areas.

<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">The wide range of our services allows clients to outsource their entire relocation programs to us.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Clients pay a fee for the services performed and/or permit Cendant Mobility to retain referral
fees collected from brokers. We also receive commissions or referral fees from third-party
service providers, such as van lines. The majority of our clients pay interest on home equity
advances and reimburse all costs associated with our services, including, if necessary, repayment
of home equity advances and reimbursement of losses on the sale of homes purchased. This limits
our exposure on such items to the credit risk of our corporate clients rather than to the
potential changes in value of residential real estate or to the creditworthiness of the
individual transferring employee. We believe such risk is minimal due to the credit quality of
our corporate clients. Net credit losses as a percentage of the average balance of relocation
receivables serviced has been less than 0.25% in each of the last five years. In addition, the
average holding period for U.S.&nbsp;homes we purchased in 2004 on behalf of our clients was 47&nbsp;days.
In transactions where we assume the risk for losses on the sale of homes (primarily
U.S.&nbsp;federal government agency clients), which comprise less than 5% of net revenue for our
relocation business, we control all facets of the resale process, thereby limiting our exposure.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">About 5% of our relocation revenue is derived from our affinity services, which provide real
estate and relocation services, including home buying and selling assistance, as well as mortgage
assistance and moving services, to organizations such as insurance and airline companies that
have established members. Often these organizations offer our affinity services to their members
at no cost and, where permitted, provide their members with a financial incentive for using these
services. This service helps the organizations attract new members and retain current members.
Personal assistance is provided to over 60,000&nbsp;individuals, with approximately 27,000&nbsp;real
estate transactions annually. In addition, we derive about 6% of our relocation revenue from
referrals within our real estate broker network.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Growth. </B>Our strategy is to grow our global relocation business by generating business from
corporations and U.S.&nbsp;federal government agencies seeking to outsource their relocation
function due to downsizing, cost containment initiatives and increased need for expense tracking.
This strategy includes bringing innovative products and services to the market and expanding our
business as a lower cost provider by focusing on operational improvements and policy counseling
and design. We also seek to grow our affinity services business by increasing the number of
accounts, as well as through higher penetration of existing accounts.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Competition. </B>Competition is based on service, quality and price. We are the largest provider of
outsourced relocation services in the United States and a leader in the United Kingdom, Australia
and Southeast Asia. In the United States, we compete with in-house relocation solutions and with
numerous providers of outsourced relocation services, the largest of which is Prudential Real
Estate and Relocation Services, Inc. Internationally, we compete with in-house solutions, local
relocation providers and international accounting firms.

<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">The principal sources of revenue for our real estate franchise and real estate brokerage
businesses are based upon the timing of residential real estate sales, which are generally lower

are based upon the timing of transferee moves, which are generally lower in the first and last
quarters of each year.

Our mortgage business originated and serviced mortgages through Cendant Mortgage Corporation,

lender conducting business throughout the United States with a focus on retail mortgage
originations in which it provides mortgages directly to consumers. In the United States, for the
nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2004, PHH Mortgage was the sixth largest retail originator of
residential mortgages, a leading outsource provider of mortgage origination services to financial
institutions and the only mortgage company authorized to use the Coldwell Banker, CENTURY 21 and
ERA brand names.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">In connection with the spin-off, we formed the mortgage venture discussed above for the purpose
of originating and selling mortgage loans primarily sourced through our owned residential real

<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Our primary objectives are to sell new franchises, renew existing franchises and, most
importantly, provide world-class service and support to our franchisees in a way that enables
them to increase their revenue and profitability. We support our franchisees with dedicated
national marketing programs, technology, training and education.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Our lodging franchise business derives substantially all of its revenue from franchise fees,
which are comprised of royalty and marketing/reservation fees. The royalty fee is intended to
cover our operating expenses, such as expenses incurred for franchise services, including quality
assurance, administrative support and design and construction advice, and to provide us with
operating profits. The marketing/reservation fee is intended to reimburse the franchisor for
expenses associated with providing such franchise services as a central reservation system,
national advertising and marketing programs and certain training programs. Since we do not own or
operate hotel properties (we derive our revenue for this business from franchise fees), we do not
incur renovation expenditures. Renovation costs are the obligation of each franchisee. Similar to
our real estate franchise business, our lodging franchise business also derives revenue through
our Preferred Alliance Program.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">In December&nbsp;2003, we commenced marketing for TripRewards, a new loyalty program which enables
customers to earn points when purchasing services from any of our lodging brands, Avis, Budget,
RCI, Fairfield or Trendwest. In addition, travel packages can be booked on our TripRewards web
site. Members can also earn points when purchasing from over 35 independent businesses. There are
over 100 point redemption options for members to redeem TripRewards points for lodging, airline
tickets, resort vacations, movie and theme park tickets or at various retailers and restaurants,
including Home Depot, Circuit City, Olive Garden and Chili&#146;s. Businesses where points can be
earned pay a fee to participate in the program and those fees are then used to reimburse
businesses where the points are redeemed. TripRewards currently has over 3&nbsp;million members.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">In 2004, we also continued the execution of &#147;Project Restore&#148; to encourage and/or require our
franchisees&#146; to upgrade their properties. This initiative resulted in the termination of certain
franchisees and required other franchisees to independently renovate and upgrade their
properties. We believe this initiative will ultimately lead to higher revenue per available room
at our franchisees&#146; properties. In addition, we have decentralized our field support organization
to increase the &#147;hands on&#148; support of franchisee operations. In 2004, we also began a program to
increase the quality of the Ramada properties by requiring franchisees to renovate and upgrade
their hotels and by introducing a new Ramada logo.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Our lodging franchisees are dispersed geographically, which minimizes our exposure to any one
hotel owner or geographic region. Of the approximately 6,400 properties and approximately 4,900
franchisees in our lodging systems, no individual hotel owner accounts for more than 2% of our
franchised lodging properties.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">We own all of the trademarks associated with our lodging franchise systems. In December&nbsp;2004, we
purchased Ramada International Hotels&nbsp;&#038; Resorts from Marriott International which completed
the acquisition of all of the worldwide trademark rights for the Ramada brand by us. In the third
quarter of 2004, we merged our Villager brand into our Knights Inn brand and eliminated the
Villager brand as a franchise system.

<H5 align="left" style="page-break-before:always"><A HREF="#tocpage">Table of Contents</A></H5><P>

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Growth. </B>The sale of long-term franchise agreements to operators of existing and newly constructed
hotels is the leading source of revenue and earnings growth in our lodging franchise business. We
believe that 48% of hotel owners in the United States remain independent and unaffiliated with
any franchise which provides substantial opport
unity for continued growth of our franchise
systems.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">We market franchises principally to independent hotel and motel owners, as well as to owners who
have the right to terminate franchise affiliations of their properties with other hotel brands.
We believe that our existing franchisees also represent a significant potential growth
opportunity because many own, or may own in the future, other hotels, which can be converted to
one of our lodging brands. Accordingly, a significant factor in our sales strategy is maintaining
the satisfaction of our existing franchisees by providing quality services. We employ a national
franchise sales force, compensated primarily through commissions.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">We seek to expand our franchise systems on an international basis through license agreements with
developers, franchisors and franchisees based outside the United States. As of December&nbsp;31,
2004, our franchising subsidiaries have entered into international licensing agreements for part
or all of approximately 43&nbsp;countries on five continents.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">In April&nbsp;2004, we granted a master franchise of Super 8 motels in China, consummating a strategy
to compete in China in three lodging tiers: two to three star hotels under the Super 8 brand,
three to four star hotels under the Days Inn brand and four to five star hotels under the Howard
Johnson brand. In addition, in November&nbsp;2004, we granted a master franchise to franchise Days Inn
hotels in Russia and 14 other countries of the former Soviet Union. As noted above, in December
2004, we completed the acquisition of all Ramada worldwide trademark rights. The transaction also
conveyed Ramada trademark rights in Canada. The financial impact of this transaction was not
material. Earlier in the year, we acquired the trademark rights for the Ramada brand in the
United States by exercising our right to redeem, for approximately $200&nbsp;million, the interest
we did not own in a venture with Marriott.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Central Reservation Systems. </B>The lodging business is characterized by remote purchasing through
travel agencies and the use by consumers of toll-free telephone numbers and the Internet. We
maintain two reservation centers that are located in Aberdeen, South Dakota and Saint John, New
Brunswick, Canada. In 2004, we booked an aggregate of approximately 7.9&nbsp;million roomnights
from all Internet booking sources, compared to approximately 4.9&nbsp;million roomnights booked in
2003, an increase of 61%. Each of our brands has a consumer web site and provides content to
other travel-related sites, including Orbitz.com and CheapTickets.com.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Competition. </B>Competition among the national lodging brand franchisors to grow and maintain their
franchise systems is intense. Our largest national lodging brand competitors are the Holiday Inn
and Best Western brands and Choice Hotels, which franchises various brands, including the Comfort
Inn, Quality Inn and Econo Lodge brands. Our Days Inn, Travelodge and Super 8 brands compete with
brands, including the Comfort Inn, Red Roof Inn and Econo Lodge brands, in the economy sector.
Our Ramada, Howard Johnson, Wingate Inn and AmeriHost Inn brands compete with brands, including
Holiday Inn and Hampton Inn, in the middle market sector. Our Knights Inn and Travelodge brands
compete with Motel 6 and similar properties. In addition, a lodging facility owner may choose not
to affiliate with a franchisor but to remain independent.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">We believe that competition for the sale of franchises in the lodging industry is based
principally upon the perceived value and quality of the brand and services offered to
franchisees. We believe that prospective franchisees value a franchise based upon their view of
the cost/benefit relationship between affiliation and conversion costs and future charges to the
potential for increased revenue and profitability and the reputation of the franchisor. We also
believe that the perceived value of brand names to prospective franchisees is, to some extent,
a function of the success of the brand&#146;s existing franchisees.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">The ability of an individual franchisee to compete may be affected by the location and quality of
its property, the number of competing properties in the vicinity, its affiliation with a
recognized brand name, community reputation and other factors. A franchisee&#146;s success may also be
affected by general, regional and local economic conditions. The potential negative effect of
these conditions on our results of operations is substantially reduced by virtue of the diverse
geographical locations of our franchised properties.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B><I>Timeshare Exchange Business </I></B>(3%, 3% and 4% of revenue for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively)



<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Our Resort Condominiums International, LLC (&#147;RCI&#148;) subsidiary is a leading provider of timeshare
vacation exchange opportunities and services for over three million timeshare subscribers from
more than 3,900 resorts in more than 100 countries. Our RCI business consists primarily of the
publication of <I>Endless Vacation </I>magazine and other publications related to the vacation and
timeshare industry and travel-related services, the operation of three worldwide exchange
programs for timeshare owners at affiliated resorts and the operation of a vacation rental
network consisting of vacation inventory available for rent to consumers. RCI has significant
operations in North America, Europe, Latin America, Southern Africa, Australia and the Pacific
Rim as well as limited operations in the Middle East. In exchange for timeshare exchange
services, RCI charges its subscribers an annual subscription fee and an exchange fee for each
exchange, resulting in revenue from such fees of approximately $402&nbsp;million during 2004.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Growth. </B>The timeshare exchange industry has experienced significant growth over the past decade.
We believe that the factors driving this growth include the demographic trend toward older, more
affluent Americans who travel more frequently; the entrance of major hospitality and
entertainment companies into timeshare development; a worldwide acceptance of the timeshare
concept; and an increasing focus on leisure activities, family travel and a desire for value,
variety and flexibility in a vacation experience. We believe that future growth of the timeshare
exchange industry will be determined by general economic conditions both in the United States and
worldwide, the public image of the timeshare industry, improved approaches to marketing and sales
and a greater variety of products and price points. RCI members are acquired primarily through
developers; as a result, the growth of our timeshare exchange business is dependent on the sale
of timeshare units by affiliated resorts. RCI affiliates consist of international brand names and
independent developers, owners&#146; associations and vacation clubs.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">In 2004, we added ten timeshare resorts in China to our network of affiliated resorts. In 2004,
we also relaunched our Elite Rewards credit card, an RCI branded credit card which allows RCI
members to earn points that can be used for vacation products.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Competition. </B>The global timeshare exchange industry is comprised of a number of entities,
including resort developers and owners. RCI&#146;s competitors include specialized firms such as
Interval International Inc., vacation club products, internal exchange programs and regional and
local timeshare exchange companies.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B><I>Timeshare Sales and Marketing Business </I></B>(9%, 8% and 8% of revenue for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively)



<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Through our Fairfield Resorts, Inc. and Trendwest Resorts, Inc. subsidiaries, we are the largest
vacation ownership company in the United States in terms of property owners and vacation units
constructed. Our vacation ownership business includes sales and marketing of vacation ownership
interests, providing consumer financing to individuals purchasing vacation ownership interests
and providing property management services to property owners&#146; associations. We believe that we
have a well balanced portfolio of properties with a high degree of geographic and customer
diversity, helping to insulate our timeshare operations from regional downturns. While we operate
Fairfield and Trendwest as separate brands, we cross market to all of our timeshare owners and
obtain referrals from our lodging and car rental operations. We are presently undertaking
strategic initiatives to integrate certain business functions of Fairfield and Trendwest,
including consumer finance, information technology, certain staff functions, product development
and certain marketing activities. We utilize a points-based sales system at both Fairfield and
Trendwest to provide our owners with flexibility as to resort location and length of stay. We
generate revenue by selling vacation ownership interests, management of resort properties and
providing consumers with financing to purchase vacation ownership interests. At Fairfield,
purchasers acquire a deeded interest in real estate. Use rights associated with the real estate
are assigned to an exchange program managed by Fairfield and purchasers are allocated a specific
quantity of points permitting them to reserve and use accommodations at other Fairfield resorts.
At Trendwest, purchasers acquire a club membership associated with a specific quantity of points
entitling the holder to use of WorldMark, The Club resorts. In each instance, the points permit a
purchaser to reserve and use a resort unit, depending on unit type and season.

<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Fairfield Resorts. </B>Fairfield, based in Orlando, Florida, acquires, plans, designs and constructs
timeshare properties and markets, sells and finances vacation products that provide quality
recreational experiences to its more than 495,000 property owners and customers. As of December&nbsp;31,
2004, Fairfield&#146;s portfolio of resorts consisted of 77 resorts, nine of which are in
various stages of construction, located in 21&nbsp;states and the U.S.&nbsp;Virgin Islands. The
average purchase price of a Fairfield vacation ownership interest is approximately $14,900. In
2004, we expanded our resort portfolio in Orlando, Florida, Las&nbsp;Vegas, Nevada and Hawaii. In
2005, we expect to further expand our portfolio in Atlantic City, New Jersey and in 2006, we
expect to include properties in New Orleans, Louisiana, San&nbsp;Antonio, Texas and Waikiki,
Hawaii. Fairfield&#146;s vacation products consist of a deeded interest in a particular unit or resort
for a certain amount of time annually, depending on unit type and season. The annual maintenance
fees associated with the average vacation ownership interest purchased ranges from approximately
$400 to $600, paid to a property owners&#146; association. These fees are used to replace and renovate
furnishings, defray maintenance and cleaning costs and cover taxes, insurance and other related
costs. Typically, the property owners&#146; associations contract with Fairfield to manage the
properties.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Trendwest Resorts. </B>Trendwest, based in Redmond, Washington, acquires, plans, designs and
constructs timeshare properties and markets, sells and finances WorldMark, The Club and WorldMark
South Pacific Club vacation ownership interests. The 65 properties Trendwest markets are located
primarily in the western United States, British Columbia, Mexico, Hawaii and the South Pacific.
In 2004, the properties that we market were expanded to include properties in San&nbsp;Francisco,
California and Australia and in 2005 we expect to include properties in Seattle, Washington and
New Zealand. At December&nbsp;31, 2004, there were over 230,000 vacation credit owners in the
WorldMark system. Trendwest&#146;s vacation ownership interests consist of vacation credits which
entitle the owner to book a vacation through the WorldMark system for a specified number of days
as opposed to a deeded interest in a particular resort as offered by Fairfield. In 2004, the
average new owner purchase was approximately $10,900. Owners of an average Trendwest vacation
ownership interest pay annual maintenance fees of approximately $450&nbsp;per year to WorldMark,
The Club.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Trendwest formed WorldMark, The Club and WorldMark South Pacific Club (collectively the &#147;Clubs&#148;)
in 1989 and 1999, respectively. The Clubs own, operate and manage the real property conveyed to
the Clubs by Trendwest. Trendwest develops vacation properties and deeds them to the Clubs in
exchange for the exclusive right to sell the vacation credits associated with the properties
contributed and retain the proceeds. Our ownership interest in both Clubs results from
Trendwest&#146;s ownership of unsold vacation credits. The percentage of vacation credits owned by
Trendwest in the Clubs is minimal.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Trendwest has management agreements with the Clubs under which Trendwest acts as the exclusive
manager and servicing agent of the vacation owner programs. Trendwest oversees the property
management and service levels of the resorts as well as certain administrative functions. As
compensation for services, Trendwest generally receives a management fee. Each of the management
agreements of WorldMark, The Club and WorldMark South Pacific provides for automatic one-year and
five-year renewals, respectively, unless such renewal is denied by a majority of the voting power
of the owners, which excludes Trendwest.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Consumer Financing. </B>Both Fairfield and Trendwest offer financing to the purchasers of vacation
ownership interests. Loans extended are typically securitized. Fairfield and Trendwest continue
to service loans extended by them and therefore remain responsible for the maintenance of
accounts receivable files and all customer service, billing and collection activities through our
consumer finance operation located in Las Vegas, Nevada. This operation employs 320 people. In
addition, we employ 91 people in Redmond, Washington who are responsible for Trendwest&#146;s
compliance and loan servicing. As of December&nbsp;31, 2004, we serviced a portfolio of 237,000
loans totaling approximately $2.1&nbsp;billion in aggregate principal amount outstanding.
Approximately 80% of our borrowers make their loan payments through direct withdrawal.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Sales and Marketing. </B>Fairfield sells its vacation ownership interests at 39 resort locations and
7 off-site sales centers. Trendwest&#146;s sales primarily occur at 30 off-site sales offices located
in metropolitan areas in six regions, including the South Pacific. The remainder of its sales
occur at 22 on-site sales offices. Both Fairfield and Trendwest employ diverse types of marketing
methods and media to encourage prospective purchasers to attend sales presentations. Typical
marketing methods include vacation packages, in-person solicitation and solicitation of resort
guests. Typical marketing media include direct mail, referrals, Internet marketing, affinity marketing and

<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">outbound telemarketing. As a result of Do Not Call legislation, Fairfield and
Trendwest have reduced their reliance on outbound telemarketing.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Growth. </B>The growth strategy for our timeshare sales and marketing business is driven primarily by
further development of existing and future resort locations. Numerous factors, including
favorable demographic trends and low overall penetration of potential demand indicate continued
potential growth in the timeshare industry. We also continually explore strategic corporate
alliances and other transactions that would complement our timeshare sales and marketing business.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Competition. </B>The timeshare sales and marketing industry is highly competitive and is comprised of
a number of companies specializing primarily in timeshare development, sales and marketing. In
addition, a number of national hospitality chains develop and sell vacation ownership interests
to consumers. Our largest competitors include Disney Vacation Club, Hilton Grand Vacations
Company LLC, Marriott Ownership Resorts, Inc. and Starwood Vacation Ownership, Inc.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B><I>Vacation Rental Business </I></B>(1%, 1% and 1% of revenue for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively)



<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">We are a leading global marketer of vacation rental properties. The properties we market are
principally privately owned villas, cottages, bungalows, apartments and stationary caravans
located on vacation parks. In some locations we offer property management services for properties
under contract ranging from key-holding to full maintenance. Rental properties are marketed to
consumers through online and offline distribution channels under proprietary brand names such as
Cuendet, Dansommer, Novasol, Blakes, Ferrysavers.com, Country Cottages in France, English Country
Cottages, Welcome Holidays, French Life, Chez Nous, The Individual Travellers Company, Canvas
Holidays, and Landal GreenParks. We derive revenue primarily through commissions on gross rent,
which range from approximately 25% to 40%. Other sources of revenue consist of travel insurance
sales, transportation, property management fees, and on-site revenue from ancillary services.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">We do not generally own properties, but act as an intermediary for the owners in exchange for a
fee. We have an ownership interest or a long-term rental commitment for approximately 14% of the
properties in our rental portfolio.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Our vacation rental business has relationships with approximately 42,000 independent property
owners in over 22 countries, including the United States, United Kingdom, France, Ireland, The
Netherlands, Belgium, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Germany, Greece, Austria,
Croatia and eastern European countries. Property owners enter into one year, evergreen or
multi-year contracts with our Vacation Rental subsidiaries that market the 52,000&nbsp;rental
properties in our portfolio. In 2004, our vacation rental business booked approximately 880,000
vacation weeks.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Our Vacation Rental subsidiaries globally market the properties they represent through direct
marketing, proprietary and third party on-line distribution channels, tour operators and travel
agents.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">In May&nbsp;2004, we acquired Landal GreenParks, a leading Dutch vacation rental company, which
specializes in the rental of privately owned vacation homes located in European holiday parks for
approximately $81&nbsp;million, in cash, net of cash acquired. As part of this acquisition, we
also assumed approximately $78&nbsp;million of debt. Landal GreenParks manages and markets
properties throughout Europe, with approximately 8,500 vacation homes located in 53 parks
primarily in Holland, and also in Germany, Austria, Belgium and the Czech Republic. These
properties are offered through a combination of direct marketing, travel agencies, tour
operators, and on-line channels including www.landal.nl. In October&nbsp;2004, we acquired Canvas
Holidays. The financial terms of this acquisition were not material to Cendant. Canvas Holidays
markets camping and stationary caravan vacations located on holiday parks in approximately 100
destinations to consumers from the United Kingdom, Germany and The Netherlands. The vacations are
marketed through a combination of on-line direct marketing and travel agent partner channels.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Growth. </B>Our growth strategy is based upon increasingly successful marketing of properties in
existing and new geographic destinations to an expanding database of targeted consumers that have
demonstrated a propensity for the holidays we offer. We also aim to make available our world&#146;s
most extensive consumer offering of vacation rental properties to consumers in regions that have
not been a focus of past marketing through direct marketing,

targeted consumer databases where we lack relevant scale or where the opportunity for operating
cost synergies in existing markets yields attractive returns.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Competition. </B>Our Vacation Rental business markets principally European destinations to a global
consumer base that includes holiday consumers from Europe, the United States, Australia, and
South Africa. Companies that offer vacation rental product in these four regions rent an
aggregate of 47&nbsp;million vacations on an annual basis. This market is highly fragmented, and
even large operators such as the ResortQuest brand, Bourne Leisure Limited, Holidaybreak PLC and
Interhome Group, represent only a small portion of industry volume. We believe that competition
for vacation rental properties is based principally on the number and quality of properties
offered.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B><I>Hospitality Seasonality</I></B>



<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Our lodging franchise business generates higher revenue during the summer months because of
increased leisure travel. Therefore, any occurrence that disrupts travel patterns during the
summer period could have a greater adverse effect on our lodging franchisees&#146; annual performance
and consequently our annual performance than in other periods. A principal source of timeshare
exchange revenue relates to exchange services to members. Since members have historically shown a
tendency to plan their vacations in the first quarter of the year, revenue is generally slightly
higher in the first quarter. In timeshare sales, we rely upon tour flow to generate timeshare
sales; consequently, sales volume tends to increase in the summer months as a result of greater
tour flow from summer travelers. We cannot predict whether these trends will continue in the
future.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Most consumers in our vacation rental business book accommodations 8 to 15&nbsp;weeks in advance
of their departure date. Approximately 50% of departure dates fall during the summer. Therefore,
most bookings are made during the first and second quarters. Recently, some consumers have begun
to book accommodations closer to their departure date, shifting some bookings to the third
quarter.

<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">With the anticipated acquisition of Gullivers Travel Associates and Octopustravel.com in April
2005, TDS plans to expand the wholesale travel services component of its portfolio of businesses
providing travel agents and consumers with an even greater array of wholesale travel inventory.
Our Travel 2, Travel&nbsp;4 and Flairview businesses currently offer such inventory.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">In 2004, TDS focused on its transition from an &#147;order taker&#148; to an &#147;order maker&#148; strategy to
become a leading global travel intermediary. As an order taker, TDS is a leading transaction
processor of travel information through the global distribution system as well as through our
WizCom, Trust, THOR and Shepherd businesses. As an order maker, TDS is a transaction generator
that generates volume and demand through the distribution of customized travel packages and
end-to-end travel solutions. Our goal is to create a strategic synthesis between the order taking
and order making businesses.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">For 2004, 2003 and 2002, Travel Agency Services accounted for substantially all of the revenue of
our TDS segment.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B><I>Travel Agency Services</I></B>



<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">We provide, through Galileo, an electronic global distribution system (&#147;GDS&#148;) for the travel
industry using a sophisticated computerized reservation system. This is a core component of our
order taking business. Travel suppliers such as airlines, hotel companies and car rental firms
store, display, manage and sell their products and services through our GDS system. We market our
GDS under the brands Apollo and Galileo. Apollo is utilized in North America and Japan, and
Galileo is utilized in the rest of the world. Travel agencies and other subscribers at
approximately 43,500 locations throughout the world and numerous Internet travel sites, such as
CheapTickets.com, as well as corporations that use self-booking products, such as those provided
by Corporate Travel Solutions, are able to access schedule and fare information, book
reservations and issue tickets for nearly 500 airlines. Travel agency subscribers represent a
significant source of bookings that result in fees payable by travel suppliers to Galileo.
Bookings generated by our five largest travel agency subscribers constituted approximately 20% of
the bookings made through our GDS in 2004. Our GDS also provides subscribers with information and
booking capabilities covering approximately 23 car rental companies, approximately 240 hotel
companies with nearly 60,000 properties and approximately 430 tour companies and major cruise
lines throughout the world. In 2004, Galileo processed approximately 270&nbsp;million bookings.
Galileo operates in approximately 120 countries.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">We generate the vast majority of our Galileo GDS revenue from booking fees paid by travel
suppliers. In 2004, we generated approximately 93% of this booking fee revenue from airlines.
Other Galileo GDS revenue sources include lease fees for equipment provided to subscribers, such
as travel agents, as well as advertising revenue paid by travel suppliers. We generate
approximately 64% of our Galileo GDS revenue outside the United States.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Additional order taking products and services provided through Travel Agency Services include our
THOR subsidiary, which provides 24-hour travel reservation assistance to customers of its travel
agency clients; our Travel&nbsp;2 Travel&nbsp;4 subsidiary, which specializes in providing
inventory for long-haul travel exclusively through the travel agency channel; and Travelwire,
which provides office administration solutions to tour operators and travel agencies through its
process automation solutions, including the virtual travel agency, which provides a complete
software package for web-based or traditional travel agencies that want to distribute, administer
and sell a full range of inventory via the Internet.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">United Airlines, Inc. is the largest single travel supplier utilizing our system, generating
revenue of approximately $140&nbsp;million relating to hosting, network services and GDS booking
fees, which accounted for approximately 8% of our total TDS segment revenue in 2004. In 2004,
Galileo began a ten-year agreement with United to provide reservations system technology and
other services. In 2002, UAL Corporation, the parent of United, filed for bankruptcy protection.
If UAL does not successfully emerge from bankruptcy as expected in 2005, we may not be able to
recover outstanding amounts as of the date of any subsequent liquidation, which could range from
$10 to $20&nbsp;million, and we would expect certain components of revenue for this segment, such
as revenue generated from reservation and network management services (excluding GDS booking
fees), to be negatively affected.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">We have introduced new products to increase revenue and reduce costs for our travel agency
subscribers, such as Galileo Fee Manager, a valuable tool to permit travel agencies to charge on
a service rather than commission basis; and International Public Fares, which completes our 360
Fares product, making us the only GDS with a fully automated fares system. We have implemented
national vendor platforms in many European countries, ensuring agencies have access to the best
local content for their customers via their desktop and full content agreements with key
airlines, such as British Airways, Qantas, SWISS and KLM. We also introduced Galileo HotelClub,
which widens the reach of our HotelClub portfolio and offers additional content to our travel
agency subscribers. We plan to aggressively distribute these products and services through Travel
Agency Services.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">The global travel industry remains sensitive to the effects of military conflict, terrorist
threat alerts, continuing economic pressures, and natural disasters, such as the tsunami that
occurred in Asia in December&nbsp;2004. The continuing sensitivity to security, economic and
environmental concerns gives rise to greater volatility in the travel industry. As a result,
several major travel suppliers are experiencing liquidity problems and some, such as UAL, US
Airways Group and ATA, have sought, and others may seek, bankruptcy protection. Therefore, the
risk of non-payment of GDS fees from travel suppliers has increased. Travel activity could be
further reduced if any of these conditions continue or resurface, which could negatively impact
our TDS segment.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Distribution of Products and Services. </B>We market, distribute and support our Galileo products and
services for subscribers primarily through our internal sales and marketing organizations
(&#147;SMOs&#148;) throughout the world, which accounted for approximately 70% of our 2004 bookings.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">In regions not supported directly by our SMOs, we provide our products and services through our
relationships with independent national distribution companies (&#147;NDCs&#148;), which are typically
independently owned and operated by a local travel-related business in the related country. Each
NDC is responsible for maintaining the relationship with subscribers in its territory and
providing ongoing customer support. We pay each NDC a commission based upon the booking fees
generated in the NDC&#146;s territory, and the NDC retains all subscriber fees billed in the
territory. NDCs accounted for approximately 30% of our bookings in 2004.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Growth. </B>In order to grow our GDS business, we intend to expand our focus beyond booking fees as
an order taker to become a retailer of travel inventory and travel products and services as an
order maker, and thereby strengthen our relationships with our travel suppliers and travel agency
customers. In doing so, we intend to continue to capitalize on our competitive strengths, the key
elements of which are: (i)&nbsp;Cendant&#146;s business-to-business relationships and travel-related
assets; (ii)&nbsp;a diversified global presence; (iii)&nbsp;established relationships with a
diverse group of travel suppliers and travel agencies; (iv)&nbsp;a comprehensive offering of
innovative products and services; and (v)&nbsp;new product and services initiatives with strong
appeal to travel consumers, agencies and suppliers.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Competition. </B>Our competitors include: the three major traditional GDS companies, Sabre, Inc.,
Amadeus Global Travel Distribution&nbsp;S.A. and Worldspan, L.P.; the major regional reservation
systems, including Abacus International, Inc., Axess International Network, Inc., Infini Travel
Information, Inc. and Topas Co., Ltd.; and other travel infrastructure companies such as Pegasus
Solutions, Inc., Navitaire, Inc. and Datalex Communications USA, Inc. We also compete with
alternative channels by which travel products and services are distributed; for example, some
airlines operate computerized reservation systems on their web sites, and some low-cost airline
carriers do not utilize a GDS distribution channel. In addition, travelers are increasingly using
the Internet to make their own bookings, thereby shifting business away from the traditional
travel agency community.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Competition to attract and retain travel agency subscribers is intense. As a result, we and other
computerized reservation system service providers offer incentives to travel agency subscribers
if they achieve certain productivity or booking volume growth targets. Although continued
expansion of such incentive payments could adversely affect our profitability, our failure to
continue to make such incentive payments could result in the loss of some travel agency
subscribers, while competitive offerings could result in increased opportunities.

<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">As part of our order maker functions, we provide travel services directly to consumers. We are a

and Budget. We operate Avis and Budget as separate brands, with differentiated positioning,
service and pricing. The Avis brand targets customers who are seeking a premium service while the
Budget brand focuses on providing a value rental experience. We perform certain administrative
and operational functions for both Avis and Budget, such as tax planning and financing, as well
as voice reservation services through our contact centers. Furthermore, we provide Avis and
Budget locations with access to the Wizard System, our online computer system which is used by
these locations for (i)&nbsp;global reservations processing, (ii)&nbsp;rental agreement generation
and administration, and (iii)&nbsp;fleet accounting and control. For 2004, our car rental

<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">We operate and/or franchise approximately 1,900 of the approximately 4,900&nbsp;car rental
locations that comprise the Avis System, which represents one of the largest car rental systems
in the world, based on total revenue and number of locations, including locations at most of the
largest airports and cities in the United States and internationally. The Avis System in Europe,
Africa, part of Asia and the Middle East is operated under a royalty-free license arrangement
with Avis Europe Holdings Ltd. (&#147;Avis Europe&#148;), an independent third party, and is comprised of
approximately 3,000&nbsp;locations.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">We own and operate approximately 1,080&nbsp;Avis car rental locations in both airport and
non-airport (downtown and suburban) locations in the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico, the U.S.&nbsp;Virgin
Islands, Argentina, Australia and New Zealand. For 2004, Avis generated total vehicle
rental revenue of approximately $2.67&nbsp;billion, of which approximately 85% (or $2.28&nbsp;billion)
was derived from U.S.&nbsp;operations. In addition, we franchise the Avis System to
independent business owners in approximately 850&nbsp;locations throughout the United States,
Canada, Latin America and the Asia Pacific region. In 2004, approximately 95% of the Avis System
rental revenue in the United States was generated by locations owned by us or operated for us
under agency arrangements, and the remainder was generated by locations operated by independent
franchisees. Independent franchisees pay fees based either on total time and mileage charges or

real-time access to aggregated information on their car rental expenses to better manage their
car rental expenditures.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Avis Marketing. </B>In 2004, approximately 74% of vehicle rental transactions generated from our
owned and operated car rental locations were generated in the United States by travelers who
rented with Avis under contracts between Avis and the travelers&#146; employers or through membership
in an organization with whom Avis has an affiliation (such as AARP and USAA). Our franchisees
also have the option to participate in these contracts. Unaffiliated business and leisure
travelers are solicited by direct mail promotions and advertising campaigns.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Our domestic customers can make Avis reservations through the Avis toll-free reservation center
at 1-888-777-AVIS, via our Avis web site at <I>www.avis.com</I>, through online portals or by contacting
their travel agent. Travel agents can access Avis through all major global distribution systems,
and can obtain information with respect to our rental locations, vehicle availability and
applicable rate structures through these systems. An automated link between these systems and the
Wizard System gives them the ability to reserve and confirm rentals directly. We also maintain
strong links to the travel industry. Avis offers customers the ability to earn frequent traveler
points with virtually all the major airlines. Avis is also affiliated with TripRewards, our
loyalty marketing program, and with the frequent traveler programs of various hotels including
the Hilton Hotels Corporation, Hyatt Corporation, and Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide, Inc.
These arrangements provide various incentives to all program participants and cooperative
marketing opportunities for Avis and the airlines and hotels. We also have an arrangement with
our lodging brands whereby lodging customers who are making reservations by telephone may be
transferred to Avis if they desire to rent a vehicle. In addition, we have marketing
relationships with American Express, MBNA Corporation and Sears, Roebuck and Co., through which
we are able to provide their customers with incentives to rent from Avis.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Internationally, we utilize a multi-faceted approach to sales and marketing throughout our global
network by employing or contracting with teams of trained and qualified account executives to
negotiate contracts with major corporate accounts and leisure and travel industry companies. In
addition, we utilize a wide range of marketing and direct mail initiatives to continuously
broaden our customer base. Sales efforts are designed to secure customer commitment and support
customer requirements for both domestic and international car rental needs. Our international
operations maintain close relationships with the travel industry through participation in several
non- U.S.&nbsp;based airline frequent flyer programs, such as those operated by Air Canada and
Qantas Airways Limited. We also participate in Avis Europe&#146;s programs with British Airways Plc,
Lufthansa and other carriers.

<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">The Budget System is one of the largest car and truck rental systems in the world, based on total
revenue and number of locations. We operate and/or franchise 2,170 of the approximately 3,070&nbsp;car
rental locations in the Budget System, including locations at most of the largest airports
and cities in the United States and internationally. The Budget System in Europe, Africa, and the
Middle East is operated under a royalty-free license arrangement with Zodiac Europe Limited, an
independent third party and an affiliate of Avis Europe, and is comprised of approximately 900
locations. We operate approximately 825 Budget car rental locations in both airport and
non-airport (downtown and suburban) locations in the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico,
Australia and New Zealand. In 2004, our Budget car rental operations generated total vehicle
rental revenue of approximately $1.24&nbsp;billion, of which 92% (or $1.13&nbsp;billion) was
derived from U.S.&nbsp;operations. We also franchise the Budget System to independent business
owners who operate approximately 1,345&nbsp;locations throughout the United States, Canada, Latin
America, the Caribbean and the Asia Pacific region. In 2004, approximately 85% of the Budget
System rental revenue in the United States was generated by locations owned by us or operated for
us under agency arrangements, with the remainder generated by locations operated by independent
franchisees. Independent franchisees generally pay fees based on gross rental revenue.

fleet of approximately 28,000 trucks which are rented through a network of approximately 2,500&nbsp;corporate-owned
and commissioned dealer locations throughout the continental United States.
Our truck rental business serves both the consumer and light commercial sectors. The consumer
sector consists primarily of individuals who rent trucks to move household goods on either a
one-way or local basis. The light commercial sector consists of a wide range of businesses that
rent light to medium-duty trucks, which we define as trucks having a gross vehicle weight of less
than 26,000&nbsp;pounds, for a variety of commercial applications. In 2004 our Budget truck rental
business generated total vehicle revenue of approximately $514.7&nbsp;million.

<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Car Rental. </I>In connection with its focus on leisure travelers, Budget primarily uses retail
advertising and value pricing to drive reservations on its web site, in the reservation center,
and in other leisure channels. In addition, Budget offers proprietary marketing programs such as
Fastbreak, an expedited rental program for frequent travelers, and Unlimited Budget, a travel
agent rewards program.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">In 2003 Budget launched a small business program, the &#147;Budget Business Program.&#148; In response to
constraints of small business customers, the Budget Business Program focuses primarily on
offering a value proposition. In addition, Budget continued to build its affiliated base of
customers through relationships with various partners, including Costco Wholesale Corporation and
Southwest Airlines Company, and through TripRewards.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Customers can make Budget reservations through the Budget toll-free reservation center at
1-800-BUDGET7, via our Budget web site at <I>www.budget.com, </I>through online travel portals, or
through their travel agent. Travel agents can access Budget through all major global distribution
systems and can obtain information with respect to our rental locations, vehicle availability and
applicable rate structures through these systems. In addition, Budget offers Unlimited Budget, a
loyalty incentive program for travel agents. Participating travel agents earn cash for every
eligible U.S.&nbsp;business and leisure rental completed by their clients. As of December&nbsp;31,
2004, approximately 38,000 travel agents were enrolled and active in this program.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Truck Rental. </I>Budget primarily advertises in the yellow pages to promote its trucks to potential
customers. Customers can make truck reservations through the Budget truck toll-free reservation
center at 1-800-GO-BUDGET, via our Budget truck web site at <I>www.budgettruck.com </I>or by calling a
location directly. In addition, Budget has established online affiliations with web sites like
monstermoving.com to reach its targeted audience. Budget truck reservations may also be made
through the budget.com web site.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Vehicle Rental Optional Products and Services. </B>In addition to revenue from vehicle rentals and
franchisee royalties, we generate revenue from Avis and Budget customers through the sale of
optional products and services such as supplemental equipment (child seats and ski racks), loss
damage waivers, additional/supplemental liability insurance, personal accident/effects insurance
and gas service option and fuel service charges.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Vehicle Rental Growth. </B>For 2004, we generated 84.0% and 79.3% of our Avis and Budget revenue,
respectively, from our owned airport locations. We also opened 82 new off-airport Avis locations
in 2004, and intend to increase business at our off-airport locations through a combination of
advertising, promotions, local sales calls and targeted marketing to members of various
associations and corporations. Our business relationship with State Farm Insurance Company in the
insurance replacement market was also strengthened in 2004 utilizing the location network of our
two brands, as well as enhanced technology. We intend to increase our replacement business by
marketing our car rental services to other insurance carriers. We also intend to increase our
focus on Budget&#146;s truck business by continuing to upgrade the truck fleet and improving
utilization.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Vehicle Rental Web Sites. </B>Avis and Budget have strong brand presence on the Internet through
their web sites, avis.com and budget.com. A steadily increasing number of Avis and Budget vehicle
rental customers obtain rate, location and fleet information and then reserve their rentals
directly on these web sites. In addition, both Avis and Budget have agreements to promote their
car rental services with major Internet portals, and have a strong advertising presence on Yahoo!

featured supplier for the Budget brand is Ford Motor Company. Under the terms of our agreements
with Ford and GM, which expire in 2007 and 2008, respectively, we are required to purchase a
certain number of vehicles from these manufacturers. Our current operating strategy is to
maintain an average fleet age of approximately seven months. For model year 2004, approximately
99% of our domestic fleet vehicles were subject to repurchase programs. Under these programs,
subject to certain conditions, such as mileage and vehicle condition, a manufacturer is required
to repurchase those vehicles at a pre-negotiated price thereby reducing our risk on the resale of
the vehicles. In 2004, approximately 2.9% of repurchase program vehicles did not meet the
conditions for repurchase.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Vehicle Rental Airport Concession Fees. </B>In general, concession fees for airport locations are
based on a percentage of total commissionable revenue (as determined by each airport authority),
subject to minimum annual guaranteed amounts. Concessions are typically awarded by airport
authorities every three to five years based upon competitive bids. Our concession agreements with
the various airport authorities generally impose certain minimum operating requirements, provide
for relocation in the event of future construction and provide for abatement of the minimum
annual guarantee in the event of extended low passenger volume.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Vehicle Rental Competition. </B>The vehicle rental industry is characterized by intense price and
service competition. In any given location, we and our franchisees may encounter competition from
national, regional and local companies. Nationally, Avis&#146; principal competitor is Ford Motor
Company&#146;s Hertz Corporation and Budget&#146;s principal competitors are Alamo Rent-A-Car, LLC and
Dollar Rent-A-Car System, Inc. for car rental, and U-Haul International, Inc. and Penske Truck
Leasing Corporation for truck rental. However, both Avis and Budget also compete with each of
these car rental companies and with National Car Rental System, Inc., Thrifty Rent-A-Car System,
Inc., and Enterprise Rent-A-Car Company. In addition, we compete with a large number of smaller
regional and local vehicle rental companies throughout the country.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Competition in the U.S.&nbsp;vehicle rental operations business is based primarily upon price,
reliability, national distribution, usability of booking systems, ease of rental and return and
other elements of customer service. In addition, competition is influenced strongly by
advertising, marketing and brand reputation.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B><I>Fleet Management Services Business </I></B>(9%, 8% and 11% of revenue for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively)



<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">PHH Arval, the second largest provider of outsourced fleet management services in the United
States and Canada and Wright Express, a leading fuel card service provider in the United States
comprised this business during 2004. Both of these businesses are no longer part of our Company.
PHH Arval was distributed to our stockholders in a spin-off on January&nbsp;31, 2005. On February&nbsp;22,
2005, we disposed of our Wright Express business in an initial public offering and in
connection with this disposition, we received approximately $1&nbsp;billion (net of offering
expenses). In connection with this disposition, we also entered into a tax receivable agreement
with Wright Express, pursuant to which we currently expect Wright Express will make payments to
us over the expected 15-year term of the agreement aggregating over $300&nbsp;million. The actual
amount of payments, if any, and the timing of receipt of any payments will vary depending upon a
number of factors, including whether Wright Express earns sufficient taxable income to realize
the full tax benefit of the amortization of its assets.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">PHH Arval provides commercial fleet management services to corporate clients and government
agencies. Fleet management services include vehicle leasing, fleet policy analysis and
recommendations, benchmarking, vehicle recommendations, ordering and purchasing vehicles,
arranging for vehicle delivery and administration of the title and registration process, as well
as tax and insurance requirements, pursuing warranty claims and remarketing used vehicles. PHH
Arval also provides fuel, maintenance, accident and similar management services, which assist its
corporate and governmental clients in the effective management and control of automotive expenses
by providing cards that permit a client&#146;s representatives to purchase gasoline or other
fleet-related products and services through a network of merchants. As of December&nbsp;31, 2004,
PHH Arval had more than 320,000 vehicles leased. In February&nbsp;2004, PHH Arval acquired First Fleet

<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">For our Avis and Budget businesses, the third quarter of the year, which covers the summer
vacation period, represents the peak season for vehicle rentals. Any occurrence that disrupts
travel patterns during the summer period could have a greater adverse effect on Avis&#146; and
Budget&#146;s annual performance than in other periods. The fourth quarter is generally the weakest
financial quarter for the Avis and Budget Systems. In 2004 our average monthly combined Avis and
Budget car rental fleet, excluding franchisees ranged from a low of approximately 277,000
vehicles in January to a high of approximately 369,000 vehicles in July. Rental utilization for
the combined Avis and Budget car rental fleet, which is based on the number of hours vehicles are
rented compared to the total number of hours vehicles are available for rental, ranged from 65.1%
in December to 80.9% in August and averaged 74.1% for all of 2004.

services. Our programs offer consumers discounts on many categories along with shop-at-home
convenience in such areas as retail merchandise, travel, automotive and home improvement.
Participating institutions generally receive commissions on initial and renewal memberships,
based on a percentage of the net membership fees. We also provide our products to such
institutions on a wholesale or resale basis upon request. As of December&nbsp;31, 2004, we

membership business, including marketing to prospective new members, were outsourced to
Trilegiant Corporation. On January&nbsp;30, 2004, we terminated Trilegiant&#146;s right to market
membership programs that we had previously licensed to Trilegiant in July&nbsp;2001, terminated
Trilegiant&#146;s right to use the Trilegiant trademark and terminated our outsourcing arrangement
whereby Trilegiant provided membership fulfillment services to our members. We are now
responsible for providing fulfillment services to our members. In connection with this
transaction, we hired substantially all Trilegiant employees, agreed to service Trilegiant&#146;s
members and made a $13&nbsp;million cash payment to Trilegiant as consideration for the early
termination of the rights referred to above. Trilegiant has now changed its name to TRL Group,
Inc. and we have renamed one of our subsidiaries Trilegiant Corporation. In connection with such
transaction, we also acquired Trilegiant Loyalty Solutions, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of
TRL Group, for approximately $20&nbsp;million in cash. Trilegiant Loyalty Solutions offers
wholesale loyalty enhancement services primarily to credit card issuers who make such services
available to their credit card holders to foster increased product usage and loyalty and serves
as the administrator of our points database for our TripRewards Loyalty Program. We continue to
own preferred stock of TRL Group, which is currently convertible, at any time at our option, into
approximately 45% of TRL Group common stock (taken together with the shares of common stock
currently held by us). As a result of this transaction, we now have managerial control of TRL
Group through our majority representation on the TRL Group Board of Directors.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Upon completion of the Trilegiant Transaction, we began integrating our individual membership and
our Progeny loyalty/insurance marketing businesses. The organizational structures of the two
businesses have now been realigned to combine departments and eliminate redundant functions. We
also reorganized the sales forces to be more closely aligned with the size of our clients and
their needs and we have combined our marketing and procurement efforts to take advantage of the
larger scale of the combined businesses. We intend to expand our integration efforts to our Cims
loyalty marketing business.

membership services companies, such as Vertrue Incorporated (formerly known as MemberWorks

enhancement package, which generally includes $10,000 of accidental death and dismemberment
insurance and travel discounts. Other enhancements may include our shopping and credit card
registration services, a travel newsletter or pharmacy, eyewear or entertainment discounts. The
common carrier coverage is underwritten under group insurance policies with two third-party
underwriters. We generally charge a financial institution client an initial fee to implement this
program and monthly fees thereafter based on the number of customer accounts participating in
that financial institution&#146;s program.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>AD&#038;D Insurance. </B>Through our Progeny subsidiary, we serve as an agent and third-party
administrator for marketing accidental death and dismemberment insurance throughout the country
to the customers of financial institutions. Progeny&#146;s insurance products and other services are
offered primarily to customers of banks, credit unions, credit card issuers and mortgage
companies. These products are primarily marketed through direct mail solicitations and
telemarketing which generally offer $1,000 of accidental death and dismemberment insurance at no
cost to the customers and the opportunity to choose additional coverage of up to $250,000. The
annual premium generally ranges from $10 to $250 and we derive revenue primarily from commissions
based on premiums received pursuant to agreements with the insurance carriers that issue the
policies we market. Progeny also acts as an administrator for, and markets, term life and
hospital accident insurance as well as a number of other insurance products.

solution offered to Cims clients is the loyalty package. Loyalty packages provide targeted
consumers of client organizations with a &#147;package&#148; of benefits and services for the purpose of
improving customer retention, attracting consumers to become customers of the client organization
and encouraging them to buy additional services. For example, packages include discounted travel
services such as discounts on vacation rentals, car rentals, travel insurance, timeshare weeks,
cruises, hotels and airlines. As of December&nbsp;31, 2004, Cims has expanded its membership base
to approximately 19.7&nbsp;million individuals. Cims offers travel and real estate benefits and
other services within its loyalty packages for the benefit of consumers. Cims also uses its
internal insurance competencies and strategic relationships to provide insurance benefits to
consumers. Cims derives fees from its financial institution and other corporate clients for its
loyalty packages.

greater number of financial institutions and targeted non-financial partners. In addition, we are
expanding the array of insurance products and services sold through the direct marketing channels

consumers, from within our existing client base, who participate in loyalty programs for their
particular financial institution, (ii)&nbsp;to increase the number of financial institutions we
partner with for their respective loyalty marketing programs, (iii)&nbsp;to develop marketing
relationships with clients in other industries (wireless providers for example) and (iv)&nbsp;to
offer multiple loyalty solutions to our clients.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Competition. </B>Our checking account enhancement packages and services compete with similar services
offered by other companies, including insurance companies and other third-party marketers such as
Sisk Company, Generations Gold and Econ-O-Check Corporation. In larger financial institutions, we
may also compete with a financial institution&#146;s internal marketing staff. Competition for the
offering of our insurance products through financial institutions is growing and intense. Our
competitors include other third-party marketers and large national insurance companies with
established reputations that offer products with rates, benefits and compensation similar to
ours. Cims represents an outsourcing alternative to marketing departments of large retail
organizations. Cims competes with certain other niche loyalty solution providers throughout
Europe and internal marketing groups of large financial institutions.

<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Franchise Regulation. </B>The sale of franchises is regulated by various state laws, as well as by
the Federal Trade Commission (the &#147;FTC&#148;). The FTC requires that franchisors make extensive
disclosure to prospective franchisees but does not require registration. The FTC has proposed
changes to its franchise rule that will affect the sales practices and procedures and the content
of disclosure documents used by our franchising subsidiaries for selling franchises in the United
States. The content of the final rule and its effective date have not been announced. Although no
assurance can be given, proposed changes in the FTC&#146;s franchise rule should have no adverse
impact on our franchised businesses. A number of states require registration or disclosure in
connection with franchise offers and sales. In addition, several states have &#147;franchise
relationship laws&#148; or &#147;business opportunity laws&#148; that limit the ability of the franchisor to
terminate franchise agreements or to withhold consent to the renewal or transfer of these
agreements. While our franchising operations have not been materially adversely affected by such
existing regulation, we cannot predict the effect of any future federal or state legislation or
regulation. Our franchisors may engage in certain lending transactions common in their respective
industries and provide loans to franchisees as part of the sale of the franchise. Such
transactions may require the franchisor to register under state laws governing business lenders.
We cannot predict the effect of the impact of those laws or any decision not to register under
such laws and to cease offering such loans.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Real Estate Regulation. </B>The federal Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (&#147;RESPA&#148;) and state
real estate brokerage laws restrict payments which real estate and mortgage brokers and other
parties may receive or pay in connection with the sales of residences and referral of settlement
services (e.g., mortgages, homeowners insurance, title insurance). Such laws may to some extent
restrict preferred alliance and other arrangements involving our real estate franchise, real
estate brokerage, settlement services and relocation businesses. Our title insurance operations
are subject to numerous state laws and regulations. Our settlement services business is subject
to various federal and state regulations including those promulgated by state departments of insurance and

<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">departments of corporations. Currently, there are local efforts in certain states,
which could limit referral fees to our relocation business.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">In addition, with respect to our real estate brokerage, relocation and settlement services
businesses, RESPA and similar state laws require timely disclosure of certain relationships or
financial interests with providers of real estate settlement services. Our real estate brokerage
business is also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations that contain
general standards for and prohibitions on the conduct of real estate brokers and sales
associates, including those relating to licensing of brokers and sales associates, fiduciary and
agency duties, administration of trust funds, collection of commissions, advertising and consumer
disclosures and governing telephone practices under the Do Not Call legislation. Under state law,
our real estate brokers have the duty to supervise and are responsible for the conduct of their
brokerage business.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Timeshare Exchange Regulation. </B>Our timeshare exchange business, which includes RCI&nbsp;exchange
programs and other exchange programs operated by our timeshare sales and marketing business, is
subject to foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations including those relating to
taxes, consumer credit, environmental protection and labor matters. In addition, we are subject
to state statutes in those states regulating timeshare exchange services, and must prepare and
file annually certain disclosure guides with regulators in states where required. While our
timeshare exchange business is not subject to those state statutes governing the development of
timeshare properties and the sale of timeshare interests, such statutes directly affect both our
timeshare sales and marketing business as described below and the other members and resorts that
participate in the RCI&nbsp;exchange programs and other exchange programs operated by our
timeshare sales and marketing business. Therefore, the statutes indirectly impact our timeshare
exchange business.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Timeshare Sales and Marketing Regulation. </B>Our timeshare sales and marketing business, which
includes our resort management business, is subject to extensive regulation by the states and
countries in which our resorts are located and in which its vacation ownership interests are
marketed and sold. In addition, we are subject to federal legislation, including without
limitation, the Federal Trade Commission Act and rules promulgated by the FTC thereunder,
including the federal Telemarketing Sales Rule with its Do Not Call provisions; the Fair Housing
Act; the Truth-in-Lending Act and Regulation&nbsp;Z promulgated thereunder, which require certain
disclosures to borrowers regarding the terms of their loans; the Real Estate Settlement
Procedures Act and Regulation&nbsp;X promulgated thereunder which require certain disclosures to
borrowers regarding the settlement and servicing of loans; the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and
Regulation&nbsp;B promulgated thereunder, which prohibit discrimination in the extension of credit
on the basis of age, race, color, sex, religion, marital status, national origin, receipt of
public assistance or the exercise of any right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act; the
Telemarketing and Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act; the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the Fair Credit
Reporting Act, which address privacy of consumer financial information; and the Civil Rights Acts
of 1964, 1968 and 1991. In Australia, we are regulated by the Australian Securities and
Investments Commission.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Many states have laws and regulations regarding the sale of vacation ownership interests. The
laws of most states require a designated state authority to approve a timeshare public report, a
detailed offering statement describing the resort operator and all material aspects of the resort
and the sale of vacation ownership interests. In addition, the laws of most states in which we
sell vacation ownership interests grant the purchaser of such an interest the right to rescind a
contract of purchase at any time within a statutory rescission period, which generally ranges
from three to ten days. Furthermore, most states have other laws that regulate our timeshare
sales and marketing activities, such as real estate licensing laws, travel sales licensing laws,
anti-fraud laws, telemarketing laws, telephone solicitation laws including Do Not Call
legislation and restrictions on the use of predictive dialers, prize, gift and sweepstakes laws,
labor laws and various regulations governing access and use of our resorts by disabled persons.

including those relating to taxing and licensing of vehicles, franchising, consumer credit,
environmental protection and labor matters. The principal environmental regulatory requirements
applicable to our vehicle and rental operations relate to the ownership or use of tanks for the
storage of petroleum products, such as gasoline, diesel fuel and waste oils; the treatment or
discharge of waste waters; and the generation, storage, transportation and off-site treatment or
disposal of solid or liquid wastes. We operate 450&nbsp;Avis and Budget locations at which
petroleum products are stored in underground or above ground tanks. We have instituted an
environmental compliance program designed to ensure that these tanks are in compliance with
applicable technical and operational requirements, including the replacement and upgrade of
underground tanks to comply with the December&nbsp;1998 EPA&nbsp;upgrade mandate and periodic testing
and leak monitoring of underground storage tanks. We believe that the locations where we
currently operate are in compliance, in all material respects, with such regulatory requirements.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">We may also be subject to requirements related to the remediation of, or the liability for
remediation of, substances that have been released to the environment at properties owned or
operated by us or at properties to which we send substances for treatment or disposal. Such
remediation requirements may be imposed without regard to fault and liability for environmental
remediation can be substantial.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">We may be eligible for reimbursement or payment of remediation costs associated with future
releases from regulated underground storage tanks and have established funds to assist in the
payment of remediation costs for releases from certain registered underground tanks. Subject to
certain deductibles, the availability of funds, compliance status of the tanks and the nature of
the release, these tank funds may be available to us for use in remediating future releases from
our tank systems.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">A traditional revenue source for the vehicle rental industry has been the sale of loss damage
waivers, by which rental companies agree to relieve a customer from financial responsibility
arising from vehicle damage incurred during the rental period. Approximately 5% of our vehicle
operations revenue during 2004 was generated by the sale of loss damage waivers. Approximately 40&nbsp;states
have considered legislation affecting the loss damage waivers. To date, 24&nbsp;states
have enacted legislation which requires disclosure to each customer at the time of rental that
damage to the rented vehicle may be covered by the customer&#146;s personal automobile insurance and
that loss damage waivers may not be necessary. In addition, New York permits the sale of loss
damage waivers at a capped rate per day based on the vehicle manufacturer&#146;s suggested retail
price. Illinois, Nevada and California have similar rules regarding fees for loss damage waivers.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">We are also subject to regulation under the insurance statutes, including insurance holding
company statutes, of the jurisdictions in which our insurance company subsidiaries are domiciled.
These regulations vary from state to state, but generally require insurance holding companies and
insurers that are subsidiaries of insurance holding companies to register and file certain
reports including information concerning their capital structure, ownership, financial condition
and general business operations with the state regulatory authority, and require prior regulatory
agency approval of changes in control of an insurer and intercorporate transfers of assets within
the holding company structure. Such insurance statutes also require that we obtain limited
licenses to sell optional insurance coverage to our customers at the time of rental.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">The payment of dividends to us by our insurance company subsidiaries is restricted by government
regulations in Colorado, Bermuda and Barbados affecting insurance companies domiciled in those
jurisdictions.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Marketing Regulation. </B>The products and services offered by our various businesses, including our
real estate brokerage, timeshare exchange, timeshare sales and marketing, loyalty/insurance
marketing and individual membership businesses, are marketed via a number of distribution
channels, including direct mail, telemarketing and online. These channels are regulated on the
state and federal levels and we believe that these activities will increasingly be subject to
such regulation. Such regulation, including anti-fraud laws, consumer protection laws, privacy
laws, telemarketing laws and telephone solicitation laws, may limit our ability to solicit new
customers or to offer one or more products or services to existing customers. In addition to

significant users of email marketing to existing and prospective customers. It is unclear what
effect, if any, legislation restricting such marketing practices would have on those businesses.
California has enacted legislation requiring enhanced disclosure on Internet web sites regarding
consumer privacy and information sharing among affiliated entities. We cannot predict whether
these laws will inhibit customer information practices used in marketing our products and

Each European Union country in which we operate must implement these directives through national
laws. While we do not believe that the laws and regulations passed to date will have a material
impact on our business, additional European or national laws, including subsequent amendments to
existing laws, could cause a material adverse impact on our business.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Global Distribution Services Regulation. </B>Our GDS business is subject to specific GDS&nbsp;regulations
in the European Union&nbsp;(&#147;EU&#148;) and Canada. In 2004, the U.S.&nbsp;government allowed
its GDS&nbsp;regulations to expire in two stages. An abbreviated set of regulations was in effect
from January&nbsp;21, 2004 through July&nbsp;31, 2004. After July&nbsp;31, 2004, all GDS&nbsp;regulations
in the United States expired.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">In early 2004, the Canadian government published an amended set of regulations that eliminated
several GDS regulations and modified several others. For example, the new regulations retain the
prohibition against GDS&nbsp;display bias but eliminate the ban on discriminatory pricing. The
Canadian government reasoned that changes in the travel industry warranted a more discrete set of
regulations.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">In Europe, the EU&nbsp;commission continues to examine the ongoing need for GDS regulations. An
amended set of rules, if any, is expected to be issued in 2005. In 2002, the EU advised that it
was considering the elimination of many rules, including the rules that require GDSs to treat all
airlines and travel agents equally not only in terms of services offered but also with regard to
fees charged. In addition, the EU has proposed the elimination of many rules relating to
subscribers as well as the rule that requires an airline that owns a GDS to treat all GDSs
equally.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Travel Agency Regulation. </B>The products and services we provide are subject to various federal,
state and local regulations. We must comply with laws and regulations relating to our sales and
marketing activities, including those prohibiting unfair and deceptive advertising or practices.
Our travel service is subject to laws governing the offer and/or sale of travel products and
services, including laws requiring us to register as a &#147;seller of travel,&#148; to comply with
disclosure. In addition, many of our travel suppliers are heavily regulated by the United States
and other governments and we are indirectly affected by such regulation.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>EMPLOYEES</B>



<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">As of December&nbsp;31, 2004, we employed approximately 87,000&nbsp;people, inclusive of
approximately 8,000&nbsp;people employed by our former mortgage, appraisal, fleet management and
Wright Express fuel card businesses. We have approximately 7,300&nbsp;employees covered under
collective bargaining arrangements. Management considers our employee relations to be
satisfactory and does not anticipate any material interruptions to operations from labor disputes.

<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">After the April&nbsp;15, 1998 announcement of the discovery of accounting irregularities in the
former CUC&nbsp;International, Inc.&nbsp;(&#147;CUC&#148;) business units, and prior to the date of this
Annual Report on Form&nbsp;10-K, approximately 70&nbsp;lawsuits claiming to be class actions and
other proceedings were commenced against us and other defendants.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>In Re&nbsp;Cendant Corporation Litigation</I>, Master File No.&nbsp;98-1664&nbsp;(WHW)&nbsp;(D.N.J.) (the
&#147;Securities Action&#148;), is a consolidated class action brought on behalf of all persons who
acquired securities of the Company and CUC, except our PRIDES securities, between May&nbsp;31,
1995 and August&nbsp;28, 1998. Named as defendants are the Company; twenty-eight current and
former officers and directors of the Company, CUC and HFS; and Ernst&nbsp;&#038; Young&nbsp;LLP, CUC&#146;s
former independent accounting firm.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">The Amended and Consolidated Class&nbsp;Action Complaint in the Securities Action alleges that,
among other things, the lead plaintiffs and members of the class were damaged when they acquired
securities of the Company and CUC because, as a result of accounting irregularities, the
Company&#146;s and CUC&#146;s previously issued financial statements were materially false and misleading,
and the allegedly false and misleading financial statements caused the prices of the Company&#146;s
and CUC&#146;s securities to be inflated artificially.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">On December&nbsp;7, 1999, we announced that we had reached an agreement to settle claims made by
class members in the Securities Action for approximately $2.85&nbsp;billion in cash plus 50&nbsp;percent
of any amount we recover from Ernst&nbsp;&#038; Young as a result of our cross-claims against
Ernst&nbsp;&#038; Young as described below. This settlement received all necessary court approvals and
was fully funded by us on May&nbsp;24, 2002.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">On January&nbsp;25, 1999, the Company asserted cross-claims against Ernst&nbsp;&#038; Young alleging
that Ernst&nbsp;&#038; Young failed to follow professional standards to discover and recklessly
disregarded the accounting irregularities, and is therefore liable to the Company for damages in
unspecified amounts. The cross-claims assert claims for breaches of Ernst&nbsp;&#038; Young&#146;s audit
agreements with the Company, negligence, breaches of fiduciary duty, fraud, and contribution. On
July&nbsp;18, 2000, the Company filed amended cross-claims against Ernst&nbsp;&#038; Young asserting the
same claims.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">On March&nbsp;26, 1999, Ernst&nbsp;&#038; Young filed cross-claims against the Company and certain of
the Company&#146;s present and former officers and directors, alleging that any failure to discover
the accounting irregularities was caused by misrepresentations and omissions made to Ernst&nbsp;&#038;
Young in the course of its audits and other reviews of the Company&#146;s financial statements. Ernst&nbsp;&#038;
Young&#146;s cross-claims assert claims for breach of contract, fraud, fraudulent inducement,
negligent misrepresentation and contribution. Damages in unspecified amounts are sought for the
costs to Ernst&nbsp;&#038; Young associated with defending the various shareholder lawsuits, lost
business it claims is attributable to Ernst&nbsp;&#038; Young&#146;s association with Cendant, and for harm
to Ernst&nbsp;&#038; Young&#146;s reputation. On June&nbsp;4, 2001, Ernst&nbsp;&#038; Young filed amended
cross-claims against the Company asserting the same claims.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Welch&nbsp;&#038; Forbes, Inc.&nbsp;v. Cendant Corp., et&nbsp;al.</I>, No.&nbsp;98-2819&nbsp;(WHW) (the &#147;PRIDES
Action&#148;), is a consolidated class action filed on behalf of purchasers of the Company&#146;s PRIDES
securities between February&nbsp;24 and August&nbsp;28, 1998. Named as defendants are the Company;
Cendant Capital&nbsp;I, a statutory business trust formed by the Company to participate in the
offering of PRIDES securities; seventeen current and former officers and directors of the
Company, CUC and HFS; Ernst&nbsp;&#038; Young; and the underwriters for the PRIDES offering, Merrill
Lynch&nbsp;&#038;&nbsp;Co.; Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner&nbsp;&#038; Smith Incorporated; and Chase Securities&nbsp;Inc.
The allegations in the Amended Consolidated Complaint in the PRIDES Action are
substantially similar to those in the Securities Action.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">On March&nbsp;17, 1999, we entered into an agreement to settle the claims of class members in the
PRIDES Action who purchased PRIDES securities on or prior to April&nbsp;15, 1998. The settlement
did not resolve claims based upon purchases of PRIDES after April&nbsp;16, 1998 and, as of December&nbsp;31,
2001, other than Welch&nbsp;&#038; Forbes, Inc.&nbsp;v. Cendant Corp., et&nbsp;al., which is
previously discussed, no purchasers of PRIDES securities after April&nbsp;16, 1998 have instituted
proceedings against us.

<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">purchased securities
of American Bankers Insurance Group, Inc.&nbsp;(&#147;ABI&#148;) between January&nbsp;27, 1998 and October&nbsp;13,
1998. Named as defendants are the Company, four former CUC&nbsp;officers and directors
and Ernst&nbsp;&#038; Young. The complaints in the ABI actions, as amended on February&nbsp;8, 1999,
assert violations of Sections&nbsp;10(b), 14(e) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The plaintiffs
allege that they purchased shares of ABI&nbsp;common stock at prices artificially inflated by the
accounting irregularities after we announced a cash tender offer for 51% of ABI&#146;s outstanding
shares of common stock in January&nbsp;1998. Plaintiffs also allege that after the disclosure of the
accounting irregularities, we misstated our intention to complete the tender offer and a second
step merger pursuant to which the remaining shares of ABI stock were to be acquired by us.
Plaintiffs seek, among other things, unspecified compensatory damages. On April&nbsp;30, 1999, the
United States District Court for the District of New Jersey dismissed the complaints on motions
of the defendants. In an opinion dated August&nbsp;10, 2000, the United States Court of Appeals
for the Third Circuit vacated the District Court&#146;s judgment and remanded the ABI Actions for
further proceedings. On December&nbsp;15, 2000, we filed a motion to dismiss those claims based on
ABI purchases after April&nbsp;15, 1998, and the District Court granted this motion on May&nbsp;7,
2001. The plaintiffs subsequently moved for leave to file a Second Amended Complaint to reallege
claims based on ABI purchases between April&nbsp;16, 1998 and October&nbsp;13, 1998. That motion
was denied on August&nbsp;15, 2002. On January&nbsp;27, 2004, plaintiffs filed a motion for class
certification.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">The settlements described herein do not encompass all litigation asserting claims against us
associated with the accounting irregularities. We cannot give any assurance as to the final
outcome or resolution of these unresolved proceedings. An adverse outcome from certain unresolved
proceedings could be material with respect to earnings in any given reporting period. However, we
do not believe that the impact of such unresolved proceedings should result in a material
liability to us in relation to our consolidated financial position or liquidity.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>In Re Homestore.com Securities Litigation</I>, No.&nbsp;10-CV-11115 (MJP) (U.S.D.C., C.D. Cal.). On
November&nbsp;15, 2002, Cendant and Richard A. Smith, one of our officers, were added as
defendants in a purported class action. The 26 other defendants in such action include
Homestore.com, Inc., certain of its officers and directors and its auditors. Such action was
filed on behalf of persons who purchased stock of Homestore.com (an Internet-based provider of
residential real estate listings) between January&nbsp;1, 2000 and December&nbsp;21, 2001. The
complaint in this action alleges violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act
based on purported misconduct in connection with the accounting of certain revenues in financial
statements published by Homestore during the class period. On March&nbsp;7, 2003, the court
granted our motion to dismiss lead plaintiff&#146;s claim for failure to state a claim upon which
relief could be granted and dismissed the complaint, as against us and Mr.&nbsp;Smith, with
prejudice. On March&nbsp;8, 2004, the court entered final judgment, thus allowing for an appeal to
be made regarding its decision dismissing the complaint against Cendant, Mr.&nbsp;Smith and
others. In April&nbsp;2004, plaintiffs filed notice of such appeal and filed their opening brief on
July&nbsp;26, 2004. Cendant and Mr.&nbsp;Smith&#146;s answering appeal brief was filed on December&nbsp;10,
2004. Oral arguments have been scheduled for April&nbsp;5, 2005.

<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">During 2004, 2003, 2002 and 2001, we completed a number of acquisitions, the results of
operations and financial position of which have been included from their acquisition dates
forward. See Note&nbsp;5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed discussion of the
2004, 2003 and 2002 acquisitions. In 2001, we acquired Avis Group Holdings, Inc. for
approximately $994&nbsp;million in cash, which resulted in approximately $1.9&nbsp;billion of
goodwill, and Galileo International, Inc. for approximately $1.9&nbsp;billion, which resulted in
approximately $2.0&nbsp;billion of goodwill. If we had acquired Avis, Galileo, NRT and Trendwest
on January&nbsp;1, 2001, net revenues, income from continuing operations and net income would have
been approximately $13.8&nbsp;billion, $396&nbsp;million and $451&nbsp;million, respectively, on a
pro forma basis during 2001. If we had acquired Avis and Galileo on January&nbsp;1, 2000, net
revenues, income from continuing operations and net income would have been approximately $9.8&nbsp;billion,
$996&nbsp;million and approximately $1.0&nbsp;billion, respectively, on a pro forma basis
during 2000.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Additionally, during 2002, we adopted the non-amortization provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (&#147;SFAS&#148;) No.&nbsp;142, &#147;Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.&#148; Accordingly,
our results of operations for 2001 and 2000 reflect the amortization of goodwill and
indefinite-lived intangible assets, while our results of operations for 2004, 2003 and 2002 do
not reflect such amortization. Had we applied the non-amortization provisions of SFAS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;142
during 2001 and 2000, net income would have been $539&nbsp;million and $678&nbsp;million,
respectively, on a pro forma basis.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">We incurred restructuring and other unusual charges of $378&nbsp;million and $106&nbsp;million in
2001 and 2000, respectively. The 2001 charges primarily consisted of (i)&nbsp;$110&nbsp;million
related to strategic initiatives committed to as a result of changes in business and consumer
behavior following the September&nbsp;11, 2001 terrorist attacks, (ii)&nbsp;$95&nbsp;million related
to the funding of an irrevocable contribution to an independent technology trust responsible for
providing technology initiatives for the benefit of our current and future real estate
franchisees, (iii)&nbsp;$85&nbsp;million related to the funding of Trip Network, Inc. and (iv)&nbsp;$41&nbsp;million
related to the rationalization of the Avis fleet. The 2000 charges primarily
consisted of (i)&nbsp;$57&nbsp;million related to various strategic initiatives generally aimed at
improving the overall level of organizational efficiency, consolidating and rationalizing
existing processes, and reducing cost structures in our underlying businesses, (ii)&nbsp;$21&nbsp;million
related to the funding of an irrevocable contribution to an independent technology trust
responsible for completing the transition of our lodging franchisees to a common property
management system, and (iii)&nbsp;$11&nbsp;million of executive termination costs.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">We incurred acquisition and integration related costs of $21&nbsp;million, $54&nbsp;million, $285&nbsp;million
and $112&nbsp;million in 2004, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. See Note&nbsp;5 to
our Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description of the charges recorded in 2004,
2003 and 2002. The 2001 charges primarily related to (i)&nbsp;the outsourcing of Galileo&#146;s global
distribution system, desktop support and related services to a third party provider and (ii)&nbsp;the
integration of our travel agency business with Galileo&#146;s computerized reservation system.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">During 2004, 2003, 2002 and 2001, we incurred $(33)&nbsp;million, $11&nbsp;million, $103&nbsp;million
and $86&nbsp;million, respectively, of litigation and related costs (credits)&nbsp;primarily
associated with the CUC International, Inc. accounting irregularities discovered in
1998. See Note&nbsp;10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding the
2004, 2003 and 2002 amounts.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Income (loss)&nbsp;from discontinued operations, net of tax includes the after tax results of Jackson
Hewitt Tax Services Inc. for all periods presented and the after tax results of National Car
Parks for 2002, 2001 and 2000. The gain (loss)&nbsp;on disposal of discontinued operations, net of tax
includes the after tax gain on the sale of Jackson Hewitt Tax Services Inc. in 2004 and the after
tax loss on disposal of NCP in 2002. See Note&nbsp;3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for
detailed information regarding the discontinued operation presentation for Jackson Hewitt and NCP.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">As of December&nbsp;31, 2001, we had accrued a $2.85&nbsp;billion stockholder litigation settlement
liability for our principal securities class action lawsuit relating to the 1998 discovery of
accounting irregularities in the former business units of CUC and deposited cash totaling
approximately $1.41&nbsp;billion to a trust established for the benefit of the plaintiffs in this
lawsuit. We funded the remaining balance of the liability with cash payments of approximately
$1.44&nbsp;billion during 2002.

<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Our management team is committed to building long-term value through operational excellence and
we are steadfast in our commitment to deploy our cash to increase stockholder value. To this end,
in late 2002, we initiated a corporate debt reduction program with the goal of decreasing our
outstanding corporate indebtedness by $2.0&nbsp;billion. We accomplished this goal in late 2004
and ended the year with approximately $4.3&nbsp;billion of outstanding corporate indebtedness, a
decrease of approximately $2.5&nbsp;billion since December&nbsp;31, 2002. During this process, we
also eliminated all of our convertible debt securities and greatly simplified our corporate debt
structure, which now principally consists of six tranches of straight debt due over the next
eleven years and borrowings under our revolving credit facility.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">We also committed to an aggressive share repurchase plan and to our first ever regular common
stock dividend program. We used approximately $1.4&nbsp;billion of cash, net of proceeds from
option exercises, to repurchase our common stock during 2004 and 2003 and plan to continue this
program, within the constraints of our capitalization targets, for the foreseeable future. For
each of the first and second quarters of 2004, we paid quarterly cash dividends of 7 cents per
share and for the third and fourth quarters, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of 9 cents per
share. We also plan to pay a quarterly cash dividend of 9 cents per share on March&nbsp;15, 2005.
While no assurances can be given, we expect to periodically increase our dividend at a rate at
least equal to our earnings growth.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">In early 2004, we began to execute our plan to simplify our business model by exiting non-core
businesses or businesses that produce volatility to our earnings inconsistent with our business
model and the remainder of our portfolio. In June&nbsp;2004, we successfully completed the initial
public offering of Jackson Hewitt Tax Service Inc., raising approximately $770&nbsp;million of
cash (including a special dividend of $175&nbsp;million), and on January&nbsp;31, 2005, we
completed the spin-off of our mortgage, fleet leasing and appraisal businesses in a tax-free
distribution of PHH common stock to our shareholders. Additionally, on February&nbsp;22, 2005, we
completed the initial public offering of our Wright Express fuel card subsidiary for
approximately $1.0&nbsp;billion. We received approximately $690&nbsp;million of proceeds in
connection with the offering and a special dividend of approximately $300&nbsp;million. We also
expect to divest our Marketing Services segment no later than third quarter 2005.

<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">The proceeds of these divestitures will be or have already been reinvested to acquire strategic
assets in our core travel and real estate verticals and to repurchase additional common stock. We
continue to seek similar opportunities to augment our travel and real estate portfolios and
further shift the mix of our businesses toward the areas in which we believe our greatest
strategic advantages lie, as demonstrated by our recent acquisition of ebookers plc and our
pending acquisition of Gullivers Travel Associates (see Note&nbsp;5 to our Consolidated Financial
Statements).

<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Net revenues increased approximately $1.8&nbsp;billion (10%) in 2004 as compared with 2003 due
principally to growth in our core residential real estate and travel businesses, which also
contributed to the increase in total expenses to support the increased volume of underlying
transactions. In addition, the consolidation of TRL Group on July&nbsp;1, 2003 contributed to the
year-over-year increase in both revenues and expenses, as their results are included in all
twelve months of 2004 but only in six months during 2003 (post consolidation on July&nbsp;1, 2003
and forward). The acquisitions of several strategic businesses, primarily within the real estate
and travel verticals in 2004 (which are discussed in greater detail below), also contributed to
the increases in revenues and expenses, as their results are included from their respective
acquisition dates forward. These increases were partially offset by an expected decline in both
revenues generated and expenses incurred by our mortgage business, as expected, due to reduced
mortgage refinancing activity experienced industry-wide. Additionally offsetting the
above-mentioned increases in expenses was a reduction of $95&nbsp;million in interest expense
during 2004, which principally reflected a decrease in losses incurred in connection with our
early extinguishments of debt and an overall reduction in our outstanding debt, as well as $26&nbsp;million
of interest received in connection with a federal tax refund. In addition, we
recorded a net credit of $33&nbsp;million during 2004 in connection with the resolution of certain
legal matters relating to the 1998 discovery of accounting irregularities in the former business
units of CUC International, Inc., whereas we incurred $11&nbsp;million of expense during 2003.
Such change principally reflects $60&nbsp;million of previously established liabilities relating
to severance and other termination benefits for which we no longer believe we are liable,
partially offset by additional costs related to the ongoing investigations into the CUC
accounting irregularities. Our overall effective tax rate was 28.5% and 33.2% for 2004 and 2003,
respectively. The difference in the effective tax rates is primarily due to a reduction to our
tax contingency reserve primarily resulting from audit settlements in 2004 and taxes on the
redemption of our mandatorily redeemable preferred interest in 2003. As a result of the
above-mentioned items, income from continuing operations increased $390&nbsp;million (27%).

and Operations</I></B>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Revenues and EBITDA increased $988&nbsp;million (19%) and $177&nbsp;million (20%), respectively, in
2004 compared with 2003, reflecting growth across all of our real estate businesses.</DIV>


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">NRT Incorporated, our real estate brokerage subsidiary, made acquisitions of various real estate
brokerage businesses during 2004 and 2003 for which the operating results have been included from
their acquisition dates forward. NRT&#146;s significant acquisitions, including Sotheby&#146;s
International Realty, contributed $223&nbsp;million and $16&nbsp;million of incremental revenues
and EBITDA, respectively, to the operating results for 2004. Excluding the impact of these
significant acquisitions, NRT generated incremental revenues of $669&nbsp;million in 2004, a 15%
increase over 2003. This increase was substantially comprised of higher commission income earned
on homesale transactions, which was substantially driven by a 16% increase in the average price
of homes sold. NRT has a significant concentration of real estate brokerage offices and
transactions in geographic regions where home prices are at the higher end of the real estate
market, including northern and southern California. The 16% year-over-year increase in average
price was driven by an overall industry-wide increase in the market prices of homes and stronger
volume of higher-priced homesales in 2004 compared with 2003. We expect the upward trend in the
market values of homesale prices that we have benefited from in previous quarters to moderate in
future quarters. Commission expenses paid to real estate agents increased $471&nbsp;million as a
result of the incremental revenues earned on homesale transactions as well as a higher average
commission rate paid to real estate agents in 2004 due to variances in the geographic mix of
homesales and the progressive nature of agent commission schedules.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Our real estate franchise business generated $499&nbsp;million of royalties and marketing fund
revenues during 2004 as compared with $429&nbsp;million during 2003, an increase of $70&nbsp;million
(16%). Such growth was primarily driven by a 13% increase in the average price of homes
sold and an 8% increase in the number of homesale transactions, partially offset by an increase
in volume incentives paid to our largest independent brokers. Royalty increases in our real
estate franchise business are recognized with little or no corresponding increase in expenses due to the

<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">significant operating leverage within the franchise operations. In addition to royalties
received from our third-party franchise affiliates, NRT, our wholly-owned real estate brokerage
firm, continues to pay royalties to our real estate franchise business. However, these
intercompany royalties, which approximated $341&nbsp;million and $288&nbsp;million for 2004 and
2003, respectively, are eliminated in consolidation and therefore have no impact on this
segment&#146;s revenues or EBITDA. The real estate franchise business has affiliate offices that are
more widely dispersed across the United States and are not as concentrated in certain geographic
areas as our NRT brokerage operations. Accordingly, operating results and homesale statistics
driving operations may differ between NRT and the real estate franchise business based upon
geographic presence and the corresponding homesale activity in each geographic region. Our
strategy for continued growth in this business includes the international expansion and
aggressive marketing of our Sotheby&#146;s International Realty brand.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Revenues from our relocation services business increased $30&nbsp;million (7%) principally
resulting from higher referral fees, which were driven by an increased volume of relocation
referrals and a higher average fee per referral as home values have increased year-over-year.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Marketing, operating and administrative expenses (apart from the NRT acquisitions and real estate
agent commission expenses, both of which are discussed separately above) increased approximately
$135&nbsp;million, principally reflecting an increase in variable expenses associated with higher
NRT homesale revenue and growth in our relocation services business, as discussed above.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B><I>Mortgage Services</I></B>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Revenues and EBITDA decreased $372&nbsp;million (25%) and $197&nbsp;million (52%), respectively, in
2004 compared with 2003 primarily due to the expected decline in refinancing activity experienced
industry wide, partially offset by increased revenues from mortgage servicing activities.
Mortgage refinancing closings were approximately $30.8&nbsp;billion (63%) lower in 2004 than in
2003. Refinancing activity is sensitive to interest rate changes relative to borrowers&#146; current
interest rates and typically increases when interest rates fall and decreases when interest rates
rise. The year ended December&nbsp;31, 2003 was marked by historically high refinancing activity,
which decreased the propensity for borrowers to refinance during 2004. This factor along with
increased competitive pricing pressures due to lower industry volumes caused revenue from
mortgage loan production to decrease. Typically, as refinancing activity declines, borrower
prepayments also decline, which generally results in an increase in the value of the mortgage
servicing rights (&#147;MSR&#148;) asset, all other factors being equal.</DIV>


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Our production revenue in any given year is driven by a mix of mortgage loans closed and mortgage
loans sold. The following chart presents our production revenues from originated mortgage loans
held for sale (which are generated at the time of sale) and fee-based mortgage originations where
we perform outsourced mortgage origination functions for a fee (which are generated at the time
of closing):

<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Partially offsetting the decrease in production revenue was an increase of $391&nbsp;million in
net revenues generated from servicing mortgage loans. This increase reflects (i)&nbsp;a $320&nbsp;million
net reduction in amortization expense and provision for impairment related to our MSR
asset, net of derivative results, which is primarily attributable to lower prepayment rates
experienced in 2004 compared with 2003 driven by the decrease in refinancing activity in

<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">2004, (ii)&nbsp;a $47&nbsp;million (11%) increase in gross recurring servicing fees (fees received for
servicing existing loans in the portfolio) driven by a 12% increase in the average servicing
portfolio, which rose to approximately $137.9&nbsp;billion in 2004 and (iii)&nbsp;a $24&nbsp;million
increase in other servicing revenue.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Revenues within our appraisal business declined $37&nbsp;million (29%) in 2004 compared with 2003
due to lower volumes, consistent with the expected decline in mortgage refinancing volume.
Revenues within our other settlement services business declined $10&nbsp;million (3%), which
principally reflects a $17&nbsp;million decline due to lower volumes also consistent with the
expected decline in mortgage refinancing volume, partially offset by a $7&nbsp;million gain
recorded on the sale of certain non-core assets in first quarter 2004.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Operating expenses within this segment declined approximately $175&nbsp;million in 2004 primarily
due to the decline in refinancing activity discussed above.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">As previously discussed, we completed the spin-off of our mortgage, fleet leasing and appraisal
operations on January&nbsp;31, 2005 in a tax-free distribution of one share of PHH common stock
per every twenty shares of Cendant common stock held on January&nbsp;19, 2005. We have entered
into a mortgage origination venture with PHH to continue to participate in the earnings generated
from originating mortgages for customers of our real estate brokerage and relocation businesses.
PHH will manage this venture, which is expected to commence operations in mid-2005. We expect to
record a non-cash impairment charge in first quarter 2005 to reflect any difference between the
carrying values and market values of these businesses. We currently anticipate that such non-cash
charge will be in the range of $535&nbsp;million to $590&nbsp;million. Approximately one-third of
this charge will be allocated to continuing operations and approximately two-thirds to
discontinued operations, reflecting the relative values of the mortgage and fleet businesses,
respectively, and the fact that the mortgage business will not be presented as discontinued
operations. We do not anticipate recording a tax benefit associated with this charge.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Revenues and EBITDA increased $359&nbsp;million (14%) and $81&nbsp;million (13%), respectively, in
2004 compared with 2003.</DIV>


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Net sales of vacation ownership interests (&#147;VOIs&#148;) in our timeshare resorts increased $91&nbsp;million
in 2004, an 8% increase over 2003 despite the hurricanes that hit North America and the
Caribbean during the third quarter of 2004, which negatively impacted VOI sales in our
southeastern properties in the second half of 2004. The net increase in VOI sales in our
timeshare resorts was primarily driven by an 11% increase in the average price per VOI sales
transaction as well as a $46&nbsp;million increase in upgrade sales at our Trendwest resort
properties, partially offset by a 7% reduction in tour flow and a $24&nbsp;million reduction in
the recognition of VOI deferred revenues related to resort properties under construction.
Revenues and certain related costs recognized on VOI sales at resort properties under
construction are done so using the percentage of completion method of accounting and accordingly,
are deferred and recognized in future periods as the resort properties are completed. The number
of tours in 2004 was negatively impacted by Do Not Call legislation, which became effective in
October&nbsp;2003 and reduced telemarketers&#146; ability to call consumers at home unless a preexisting
relationship existed. We continue to take actions to mitigate the unfavorable impact on tour flow
from the legislation by introducing new sales initiatives designed to improve sales efficiencies.
During 2004, we sold certain of our timeshare resort properties and recognized gains on sale of $7&nbsp;million.
Additionally, incremental resort management fees of $11&nbsp;million were generated
through increased rental revenues on unoccupied units as well as growth in the number of units
under management during 2004. Revenue also increased $15&nbsp;million, while EBITDA declined $17&nbsp;million
in 2004, primarily as a result of consolidating our largest timeshare receivable
securitization structures during third quarter 2003 and year-over-year growth in our contract
receivables portfolio. The consolidation of the securitization structures resulted in the
recognition of interest revenues on contract receivables and interest expense incurred on the
debt funding of such contracts instead of applying gain on sale accounting to such
securitizations, prior to consolidation. Accordingly, as a result of the consolidation, as well
as the year-over-year growth in the contract receivables portfolio, interest revenue generated in
2004 exceeded the interest revenue recognized and the gain on sale accounting applied to
securitizations in 2003. EBITDA, however, was negatively impacted by the absence of gain on sale
accounting in 2004, partially offset by the net interest income recognized in 2004 in connection
with the consolidation and subsequent growth of the contract receivable portfolio.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Exchange and subscription fee revenues within our timeshare exchange business increased $24&nbsp;million

<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">effects of which were felt throughout the remainder of the year.
Such growth was primarily driven by (i)&nbsp;a 4% increase in the average number of worldwide
subscribers, (ii)&nbsp;a 5% increase in the average subscription price per member and (iii)&nbsp;a
6% increase in the average exchange fee, partially offset by a 2% reduction in exchange
transaction volume. Timeshare points and rental transaction revenue (rentals of unused timeshare
inventory) grew $24&nbsp;million (28%) driven principally by an 18% increase in points and rental
transaction volume and a 14% increase in the average price per rental transaction. Revenue trends
reflect the expected shift in the RCI timeshare membership base toward a greater mix of points
members from traditional one-week timeshare members. Points transactions are those executed by
points members for other than a standard, one-week stay at an RCI timeshare property. Rental
transactions are rentals of unused timeshare inventory to RCI members and non-members. In
addition, our timeshare exchange business generated incremental revenue of $9&nbsp;million due to
an increase in travel-related services provided to customers of our international membership
business.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Royalties and marketing and reservation fund revenues within our lodging franchise operations
increased $14&nbsp;million (4%) in 2004 primarily due to a 5% increase in revenue per available
room and a 4&nbsp;basis point increase in the net effective royalty rate, partially offset by a 4%
reduction in room count. These changes reflect quality control initiatives implemented in 2003
whereby we terminated from our franchise system certain properties that were not meeting required
standards and tightened requirements for properties not meeting their financial obligations to
us. We continue to focus on quality and required standards, however we expect property
terminations to moderate in 2005. Additionally, in fourth quarter 2003 we launched TripRewards, a
loyalty program that enables customers to earn rewards when staying at Cendant&#146;s lodging brand
hotels or when purchasing services or products from program partners. The TripRewards program
enables us to earn fees on revenues generated by our franchisees from TripRewards members. The
program contributed $18&nbsp;million of incremental revenue during 2004, which was substantially
utilized for marketing expenditures to promote our lodging brands, to fund the cost of rewards
earned by customers and to administrate the program.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">In May&nbsp;2004, we completed the acquisition of Landal GreenParks, a Dutch vacation rental company
specializing in the rental of privately-owned vacation homes located on European holiday parks.
During 2004, Landal contributed $113&nbsp;million to revenues and $22&nbsp;million to EBITDA. In
October&nbsp;2004, we completed the acquisition of Canvas Holidays Limited, a tour operator based in
Scotland, providing camping holidays located on 100 campsites throughout Europe (principally in
France) to British and Northern European consumers. During 2004, Canvas Holidays contributed $6&nbsp;million
to revenues and $1&nbsp;million to EBITDA. See Note&nbsp;5 to our Consolidated
Financial Statements for more detail regarding these acquisitions. Apart from the Landal and
Canvas Holidays acquisitions, revenues at our European vacation rental companies increased $15&nbsp;million
in 2004 substantially due to a favorable impact on revenues from foreign currency
exchange rate fluctuations, which were substantially offset in EBITDA by the unfavorable impact
of exchange rate movements on expenses.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Operating, marketing and administrative expenses within the Hospitality segment, excluding
expenses generated by Landal and Canvas Holidays and other expense variances discussed separately
above, increased approximately $135&nbsp;million in 2004 principally reflecting higher variable
costs incurred to support increased revenues and increased costs associated with prior period
acquisitions in our vacation rental business, partially offset by favorable cost of sales and
commissions as a percentage of related VOI revenues in our timeshare business and favorable bad
debt expense period-over-period related to the settlement of a lodging franchisee receivable
during 2004 that had been previously reserved for during 2003.

November&nbsp;2004. The operating results of Orbitz were included from the acquisition date forward
and contributed revenues of $37&nbsp;million and an EBITDA loss of $5&nbsp;million to 2004 results.
The EBITDA loss incurred by Orbitz is partly reflective of integration costs incurred to combine
the technology platforms and operations of our Orbitz, CheapTickets and Travelport businesses to
form one common platform and expand our travel distribution capabilities. We intend to maintain
and promote the Orbitz, CheapTickets, and Travelport businesses as differentiated travel brands
in the leisure and corporate travel sectors, while integrating the technology and infrastructure

<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">second half of 2005. In addition, five other subsidiaries specializing in online travel and travel packaging and
consolidation, which were acquired in 2003 and 2004, impacted the year-over-year comparison as
their operating results were included from their acquisition dates forward. Such acquisitions
collectively contributed incremental revenue and EBITDA of $70&nbsp;million and $10&nbsp;million,
respectively, to the 2004 results.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Based on the aforementioned acquisition of Orbitz combined with our existing travel businesses
and also factoring in (i)&nbsp;the February&nbsp;2005 acquisition of&nbsp;ebookers, an online European
travel service provider, and (ii)&nbsp;the pending acquisition of Gullivers Travel Associates, a
wholesaler of hotels, destination services, travel packages and group tours and online provider
of lodging and destination services, expected to close in April, 2005, we believe that we have
strengthened our position as a global travel intermediary. Our strategic focus has been to
further penetrate corporate and consumer online channels which we are accomplishing through
strategic acquisitions and shifting some of our existing offline travel agency bookings to the
on-line channel. We have expanded our operations within the travel industry such that in addition
to our role as an &#147;order taker&#148;, or transaction processor, primarily serving offline travel
agencies via their use of the Company&#146;s electronic global distribution system (&#147;GDS&#148;) services,
we have also assumed a role as an &#147;order maker&#148;, or transaction generator, which is based on
direct customer relationships.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Galileo, our subsidiary that provides GDS services to the travel industry, generated $32&nbsp;million
of incremental worldwide air booking fees in 2004 as international air booking fees
increased $58&nbsp;million (7%), while domestic air booking fees decreased $26&nbsp;million (7%).
The increase in international air booking fees was driven by a 7% increase in the effective yield
on such bookings and a 1% increase in booking volumes, which rose to 164.8&nbsp;million segments
for 2004. The yield increase partially resulted from a greater number of premium booking
transactions that allow customers additional itinerary options. International booking volume in
2004 was suppressed by reduced travel in Europe during the second half of 2004, which was due in
part to labor uncertainties surrounding an air carrier in Italy with whom our Galileo subsidiary
conducts business, which was resolved in late 2004. International air bookings represented
approximately two thirds of our total air bookings during 2004 and 2003.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">The reduction in domestic air booking fees was driven by a 10% decline in the effective yield
partially offset by a 3% increase in booking volumes, which reached 84.0&nbsp;million segments in
2004. The effective yield decline and increase in volume on domestic air bookings is consistent
with our pricing program with major U.S.&nbsp;carriers in order to gain access to all public fares
made available by the participating airlines. Additionally, revenues and EBITDA include a $5&nbsp;million
reduction in subscriber fees resulting from fewer travel agencies leasing computer
equipment from us during 2004 compared with 2003 and a $9&nbsp;million decrease in information
services revenue, which are primarily sales of competitive airline fare information.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Commensurate with our strategic focus to further penetrate online channels in the travel
industry, including shifting some of our offline travel agency bookings to the online channel,
online net revenues grew $38&nbsp;million (100%) organically (excluding the impact of
acquisitions) in 2004 compared with 2003 driven by a 26% increase in online gross bookings
substantially within our CheapTickets.com website while our offline travel agency net revenues
decreased $31&nbsp;million. The growth in online gross bookings was attributable to improved site
functionality leading to increased conversion, enhanced content, which included additional hotel
offerings in the online market, and more visitors resulting from increased marketing efforts.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Excluding the impact of the aforementioned acquisitions, expenses within this segment increased
approximately $20&nbsp;million in 2004. Expense increases year-over-year included (i)&nbsp;$21&nbsp;million
of higher commission expenses, primarily due to a greater number and mix of bookings
during 2004 in countries with higher commission rates, (ii)&nbsp;$18&nbsp;million of increased
market incentive costs, used in promoting our services to travel agencies, (iii)&nbsp;$11&nbsp;million
of expense related to airline fare guarantees and (iv)&nbsp;$9&nbsp;million of increased
bad debt expense, the majority of which was related to receivables from airlines in bankruptcy.
This was partially offset by cost savings from expense reductions, including network
communication and maintenance and installation expense savings due, in part, to reduced
subscriber volume. In addition, there was a net reduction in salary and benefit-related expenses
in 2004 due in part, to the favorable impact in 2004 from benefit-plan amendments that occurred
in 2003 and cost benefits realized in 2004 from shifting our offline travel agency operations to
online channels, which included the closure of certain call centers.

2004 compared with 2003.</DIV>


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Revenue generated by our Cendant Car Rental Group (comprised of Avis car rental and Budget car
and truck rental operations) increased $84&nbsp;million (2%).


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Avis car rental revenues increased $80&nbsp;million (3%) in 2004 which was comprised of a $55&nbsp;million
(2%) increase in car rental time and mileage (&#147;T&#038;M&#148;) revenue and a $25&nbsp;million (9%)
increase in ancillary revenues. The revenue change is inclusive of favorable foreign currency
exchange rate fluctuations internationally which positively impacted revenue by $34&nbsp;million,
but was principally offset in EBITDA by the effect of such exchange rate movements on expenses.
The increase in T&#038;M revenues was principally driven by a 3% increase in the number of days an
Avis vehicle was rented. The increase in ancillary revenues was due in part to higher gasoline
revenues, which resulted from increased gas prices in 2004 compared with 2003. The impact of the
increase in gasoline prices on revenues was more than offset in EBITDA by a lower profit margin
on gas in 2004 compared with 2003.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Budget car rental revenues declined $2&nbsp;million in 2004, which was comprised of a $7&nbsp;million
(1%) increase in car rental T&#038;M revenue and a $9&nbsp;million (5%) reduction in other
ancillary revenues. The increase in T&#038;M revenue was driven by a 6% increase in car rental days,
which was partially offset by a 5% reduction in T&#038;M revenue per day. This reflects, in part, the
resulting impact of our strategic decision to reposition the Budget car rental brand by reducing
the cost structure and pricing to be more competitive with other leisure-focused car rental
brands. We have also made efforts to enhance the profitability of the Budget brand by reducing
higher-risk rentals to drivers under 25&nbsp;years of age and enhanced verification of drivers&#146;
licenses. The decline in ancillary revenues was principally comprised of lower surcharge fees
from youthful renters and reductions in revenues generated from counter sales of insurance, which
were substantially offset in EBITDA by a corresponding reduction in incentives paid to counter
representatives.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Pricing at both our Avis and Budget car rental brands during 2004 was negatively impacted by
competitive conditions in the car rental industry as a result of higher industry-wide fleet
levels, which we believe was caused by enhanced incentives offered by car manufacturers. However,
such manufacturer incentives also resulted in lower fleet costs, which significantly offset the
EBITDA impact of lower pricing. The revenue changes for Budget are inclusive of favorable foreign
currency exchange rates aggregating $10&nbsp;million, which was principally offset in EBITDA by
the opposite impact of foreign currency exchange rates on expenses.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Budget truck rental revenues increased $6&nbsp;million (1%) in 2004 comprised of a $10&nbsp;million
(2%) increase in T&#038;M revenue and a $4&nbsp;million (6%) reduction in other ancillary revenues. The
additional Budget truck rental T&#038;M revenue reflects a 5% reduction in rental days offset by a 7%
increase in T&#038;M per day. During 2004, we reduced the average Budget truck fleet by 9% compared
with the average fleet size in 2003, which reflects our efforts to focus on higher utilization of
newer and more efficient trucks.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Wright Express, our fuel card subsidiary, recognized incremental revenues of $32&nbsp;million
(20%) in 2004 compared with 2003. This growth was driven by a combination of new customers,
increased usage of the fuel card product and higher fuel prices. As previously discussed, we
completed the initial public offering of Wright Express on February&nbsp;22, 2005.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">In February&nbsp;2004, we completed the acquisition of First Fleet Corporation, a national provider of
fleet management services to companies that maintain private truck fleets. The operating results
of First Fleet were included from the acquisition date forward and contributed revenues and
EBITDA of $212&nbsp;million and $9&nbsp;million, respectively, to 2004 results. Apart from this
acquisition, revenue from our fleet leasing operations increased $52&nbsp;million primarily due to
an increase in vehicle depreciation expense, which is billed to clients and therefore has no
impact on EBITDA. In addition, revenue and EBITDA were favorably impacted by $5&nbsp;million as a
result of additional fees and commissions earned on vehicle maintenance service contracts. As
previously discussed, we completed the spin-off of our mortgage, fleet leasing and appraisal
operations on January&nbsp;31, 2005 in a tax-free distribution of PHH&nbsp;common stock and expect

approximately $6&nbsp;million on a revenue increase of $168&nbsp;million. The favorable profit
margin primarily resulted from continued operating efficiencies realized in connection with the
successful integration of Budget, increased internet reservation activity resulting in reduced
call volume and associated costs and commissions and favorable insurance costs as a result of the
reduction in higher-risk Budget car rentals, as discussed above.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I><B>Marketing Services</B></I>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Revenues and EBITDA increased $275&nbsp;million (22%) and $45&nbsp;million (15%), respectively, in
2004 compared with 2003. Effective July&nbsp;1, 2003, we consolidated TRL Group pursuant to the
provisions of FIN&nbsp;46. Therefore, in 2004, revenues and EBITDA for 2004 reflect the results of
TRL Group for twelve months, whereas revenues and EBITDA for 2003 reflect the results of TRL
Group for six months. In 2004, TRL Group (after eliminations of intercompany revenues and
expenses) contributed incremental revenues and EBITDA of $240&nbsp;million and $82&nbsp;million,
respectively, for the period January&nbsp;1, 2004 through June&nbsp;30, 2004. Apart from the
consolidation of TRL Group, revenues for the Marketing Services segment increased $35&nbsp;million
while EBITDA decreased $37&nbsp;million in 2004 compared with 2003.</DIV>


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Revenue generated by our individual membership business decreased $53&nbsp;million primarily due
to the expected decline in the membership base retained by us in connection with the original
outsourcing of our individual membership business (members acquired prior to July&nbsp;2001) to TRL
Group in July&nbsp;2001 and the decline in the TRL Group membership base (members acquired from
marketing campaigns between July&nbsp;2001 and January&nbsp;2004) as a result of the January&nbsp;2004 amendment
to our contractual relationship with TRL Group, Inc. (see Note&nbsp;22 to our Consolidated
Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion regarding this transaction). The declines in
both run-off membership bases resulted in a year-over-year revenue reduction of $121&nbsp;million.
This reduction was partially offset by $68&nbsp;million of new membership revenue as a result of
our marketing to attract new members subsequent to the January&nbsp;2004 amendment whereby we began
marketing to new members under the Trilegiant tradename.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">As a result of the January&nbsp;2004 amendment, our membership base will continue to grow as we
realize the benefits from our marketing efforts to solicit new members, while TRL Group&#146;s
membership base will continue to shrink as they no longer have the ability to solicit new
members. The revenue generated from our increasing membership base generally is not recognized
until after the member trial period has expired and then is recognized ratably over the life of
the membership. As a result, during 2004, we recognized $166&nbsp;million of EBITDA losses
resulting from marketing expenses incurred to solicit new members beginning in January&nbsp;2004 for
which we expect to realize revenues in future periods. Further, we experienced an unfavorable
impact on EBITDA of $26&nbsp;million resulting from reduced revenues for the membership base
retained by us in connection with the original outsourcing of our individual membership business
to TRL Group in July&nbsp;2001 that was partially mitigated by a net reduction in expenses from
servicing fewer members. In addition, as a result of no longer incurring marketing expenses to
solicit new members as of January&nbsp;&nbsp;30, 2004, TRL Group EBITDA increased $108&nbsp;million
during the second half of 2004 as compared to the same period in 2003.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Revenues in our insurance and loyalty operations include $21&nbsp;million of favorable foreign
currency exchange movements, which benefited EBITDA $10&nbsp;million, after including the
unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates on expenses. EBITDA in our insurance and
loyalty operations was negatively impacted by $25&nbsp;million related to a verdict rendered in
connection with a contractual dispute with a third party insurance partner. EBITDA in 2004 also
includes $20&nbsp;million of additional amortization of deferred costs in 2004. EBITDA benefited $9&nbsp;million
in 2004 from cost reductions and restructuring activities undertaken by our
international operations in 2003.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Revenue and EBITDA also benefited by $42&nbsp;million of gains recognized in connection with the
termination of two contractual relationships with third party marketing partners. In third
quarter 2004, we received $34&nbsp;million in connection with the early termination of a
contractual relationship with a third party marketing partner that was originally expected to
extend beyond 2005. TRL Group had provided services for this marketing partner
in 2002 in exchange for royalties related to the success of the marketing program. TRL Group and the
marketing partner

<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">disputed certain aspects of the marketing agreement and a settlement was
reached in September&nbsp;2004 that provided for early termination of the agreement. However, the
favorable impact of the early termination was partially offset by the absence of royalties
generated under this contractual relationship of $8&nbsp;million in the fourth quarter of 2004 as
compared to the same period in 2003. We also recognized $16&nbsp;million in 2004 in connection
with the early termination of a contractual relationship with a third party marketing partner
whereby we marketed card protection services to the marketing partner&#146;s customers and paid
commissions to the marketing partner based on the membership fees that we collected.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Revenue and EBITDA for 2004 also includes a $25&nbsp;million gain on the sale of commission rights
related to our long term care insurance business. In June&nbsp;2003, we discontinued the marketing and
sale of long term preferred care insurance policies; however, we continued to derive commission
revenues pursuant to agreements with the insurance carriers that issued the policies we
previously sold. In fourth quarter 2004, we recognized a $25&nbsp;million gain in connection with
the sale of the majority of the commission rights associated with the policies we sold prior to
June&nbsp;2003.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I><B>Corporate and Other</B></I>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Revenues increased $11&nbsp;million and the EBITDA loss decreased from $38&nbsp;million in 2003 to
$6&nbsp;million in 2004.</DIV>


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Revenues and EBITDA were favorably impacted in 2004 by $37&nbsp;million of additional realized
gains on the sale of Homestore stock, partially offset by a $30&nbsp;million gain recognized in
2003 on the sale of our equity investment in Entertainment Publications, Inc. Revenue and EBITDA
also reflect $21&nbsp;million and $13&nbsp;million, respectively, of incremental earnings on a
credit card marketing program under which we earn fees based on a percentage of credit card
spending. Partially offsetting this revenue increase is $15&nbsp;million of incremental
intersegment revenue eliminations in 2004 due to increased intercompany business activities.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">EBITDA was also favorably impacted year-over-year by (i)&nbsp;a $44&nbsp;million reduction in
securities-related litigation charges in 2004 compared with 2003 principally resulting from a
credit of $60&nbsp;million in 2004 relating to previously established liabilities for severance
and other termination benefits for which we no longer believe we are liable, partially offset by
ongoing investigation costs relating to the discovery in 1998 of accounting irregularities in
former CUC businesses and (ii)&nbsp;a credit of $12&nbsp;million in 2004 relating to the
termination of a lease on more favorable terms than originally estimated. These favorable EBITDA
variances were partially offset by a $35&nbsp;million increase in incentive-based compensation
expenses.

and is proceeding according to plan.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">In addition to the contributions made by the aforementioned acquired businesses, revenues and
expenses also increased during 2003 from (i)&nbsp;organic growth in our real estate services
businesses, especially our real estate brokerage and mortgage businesses (even after adjusting
for the $275&nbsp;million non-cash provision for impairment of our mortgage servicing rights
asset, which we recorded in 2002 and discuss in greater detail below under &#147;Mortgage Services&#148;)
and (ii)&nbsp;the consolidation of TRL Group, which contributed incremental revenues and expenses
(after elimination entries) of $200&nbsp;million and $205&nbsp;million, respectively. The growth in
our mortgage and real estate brokerage businesses also contributed to the increase in total
expenses, as we incurred additional expenses to support the continued high level of mortgage loan
production, related servicing activities and home sale transactions. The increases in total
expenses were partially offset by a reduction of $231&nbsp;million in acquisition and integration
related costs primarily due to the amortization in 2002 of the pendings and listings intangible
asset acquired as part of the acquisition of NRT, which was amortized over the closing period of
the underlying contracts (approximately five months). In addition, total expenses benefited by a
$92&nbsp;million reduction in litigation and related charges. Our overall effective tax rate
decreased to 33.2% for 2003 from 33.4% for 2002 primarily due to the utilization of capital loss
carryforwards and lower taxes on foreign earnings, partially offset by an increase in state
taxes, taxes on the redemption of our $375&nbsp;million mandatorily redeemable preferred interest
and other non-deductible items. As a result of the above-mentioned items, income from continuing
operations increased $421&nbsp;million (42%).

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Revenues and EBITDA increased approximately $1.3&nbsp;billion (33%) and $90&nbsp;million (11%),
respectively, in 2003 compared with 2002, reflecting growth across all of our real estate
businesses.</DIV>


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">We acquired NRT (inclusive of its settlement services business, which is now included in our
settlement services business within the Mortgage Services segment) on April&nbsp;17, 2002 and, in
addition, NRT acquired real estate brokerage businesses subsequent to our ownership. The
operating results of NRT and its significant acquisitions were included from their acquisition
dates forward and, therefore, contributed approximately $1.0&nbsp;billion of revenues and an
EBITDA decline of $26&nbsp;million during the Pre-Anniversary period in 2003 (does not include the
operating results of NRT&#146;s settlement services business, which is reported within the Mortgage
Services segment). The EBITDA decline is reflective of the seasonality of the real estate
brokerage business, whereby the operating results are typically weakest in the early part of the
calendar year and strengthen in the second and third quarters.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Excluding the impact of NRT&#146;s brokerage acquisitions, NRT generated incremental net revenues of
$298&nbsp;million, a 10% increase in the comparable post-acquisition periods in 2003 versus 2002.
The increase in NRT&#146;s revenues was substantially comprised of incremental commission income on
home sale transactions, primarily due to a 10% increase in the average price of homes sold. Real
estate agent commission expenses also increased $180&nbsp;million as a result of the incremental
revenues earned on home sale transactions.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Our real estate franchise business generated $429&nbsp;million of royalty and marketing fund
revenues during 2003 as compared with $443&nbsp;million in 2002. The 2002 amount includes $66&nbsp;million
of revenues received from NRT, our wholly-owned real estate brokerage firm, prior to our
acquisition on April&nbsp;17, 2002, at which time NRT was our largest franchisee. Excluding the
impact of the acquisition, royalty and marketing fund revenues increased $52&nbsp;million (14%),
which was principally driven by a 7%&nbsp;increase in volume of home sale transactions and a 9%&nbsp;increase
in the average price of homes sold. NRT continues to pay royalties to our real estate franchise

2002 through December&nbsp;31, 2002 and for the entire fiscal year ended December&nbsp;31, 2003,
which approximated $201&nbsp;million and $288&nbsp;million, respectively, are eliminated in
consolidation and therefore have no impact on this segment&#146;s revenues or EBITDA.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Revenue within this segment also benefited by a change during 2003 in the presentation of a
revenue stream generated by our relocation business to conform to the presentation used by
similar larger-scale businesses within our Mortgage Services segment. Such change resulted in an
increase of $17&nbsp;million in revenues. There was no impact to EBITDA from this change in
presentation.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Prior to our acquisition of NRT in 2002, NRT paid our real estate franchise business $9&nbsp;million
in real estate referral fees and a $16&nbsp;million termination fee related to a franchise
agreement under which NRT operated brokerage offices under our ERA&nbsp;real estate brand. We also
had a preferred stock investment in NRT that generated dividend income of $10&nbsp;million in 2002
before we acquired NRT.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Excluding the impact from our acquisition of NRT, NRT&#146;s significant acquisitions and NRT&#146;s real
estate agent commission expenses (discussed above), operating and administrative expenses within
this segment increased approximately $37&nbsp;million compared to 2002 primarily due to increased
home sale transactions.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B><I>Mortgage Services</I></B>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Revenues and EBITDA increased $733&nbsp;million (98%) and $350&nbsp;million, respectively, in 2003
compared with 2002 principally due to a significant increase in mortgage loan production, which
was partially offset by an increase in amortization of the MSR asset as comparatively lower
interest rates during 2003 resulted in record levels of mortgage refinancing activity.</DIV>


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Revenues from mortgage loan production increased $433&nbsp;million (49%) in 2003 compared with the
prior year and were derived from growth in our fee-based mortgage origination operations and a 56%&nbsp;increase
in the volume of loans that we sold. We sold approximately $59.5&nbsp;billion of
mortgage loans in 2003 compared with approximately $38.1&nbsp;billion in 2002, generating
incremental production revenues of $330&nbsp;million. In addition, production revenues generated
from our fee-based mortgage origination activity increased $103&nbsp;million (41%) as compared
with 2002. Total mortgage loans closed increased approximately $24.4&nbsp;billion (41%) to
approximately $83.7&nbsp;billion in 2003, comprised of a $21.9&nbsp;billion (57%) increase in
closed loans to be securitized and a $2.5&nbsp;billion (12%) increase in closed loans that were
fee-based. Refinancings increased approximately $18.1&nbsp;billion (59%) to approximately $48.7&nbsp;billion
and purchase mortgage closings grew approximately $6.3&nbsp;billion (22%) to
approximately $35.0&nbsp;billion.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Net revenues from servicing mortgage loans increased $112&nbsp;million primarily due to the
absence in 2003 of a $275&nbsp;million non-cash provision for impairment of our MSR asset recorded
in 2002. Declines in interest rates at such time resulted in increases to our current and
estimated future loan prepayment rates and a corresponding provision for impairment against the
value of our MSR asset. Apart from this impairment charge, net servicing revenues declined $163&nbsp;million
primarily due to a period-over-period increase in MSR amortization and provision for
impairment (recorded net within revenues) of $246&nbsp;million, partially offset by $48&nbsp;million
of incremental gains from hedging and other derivative activities. The increase in MSR
amortization and provision for impairment is a result of the high levels of refinancings and
related mortgage loan prepayments that occurred in 2003 due to low mortgage interest rates during
2003. The incremental gains from hedging and other derivative activities resulted from our
strategies to protect earnings in the event that there was a decline in the value of our MSR
asset, which can be caused by, among other factors, reductions in interest rates, as such
reductions tend to increase borrower prepayment activity. In addition, recurring servicing fees
increased $33&nbsp;million (8%) driven by a 16%&nbsp;period-over-period increase in the average
servicing portfolio, which rose to $122.9&nbsp;billion in 2003.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Interest rates had risen from their lows in the earlier part of 2003 and, as a result, in fourth
quarter 2003 mortgage refinancing volume and resulting net production revenues comparatively
declined. This decline in mortgage production revenues had been partially offset by an increase
in revenues from mortgage servicing activities. Historically, mortgage production and mortgage
servicing operations have been counter-cyclical in nature and represented a naturally offsetting
relationship. Additionally, to supplement this relationship, we have maintained a

<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">comprehensive, non-speculative mortgage risk management program to further mitigate the impact of fluctuations
in interest rates on our operating results.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Revenues also benefited from our acquisition of NRT&#146;s settlement services business on April&nbsp;17,
2002. The operating results of NRT&#146;s settlement services business were included from the
acquisition date forward and, therefore, contributed $66&nbsp;million of revenues and $5&nbsp;million
of EBITDA during the Pre-Anniversary period. Additionally, during 2003, we merged our
pre-existing settlement services businesses with and into the larger-scale settlement services
business of NRT (both of which are included in this segment). Upon combining such businesses, we
changed certain accounting presentations used by our pre-existing businesses to conform to the
presentations used by NRT. Such change resulted in an increase of $53&nbsp;million in revenues.
Excluding the acquisition of NRT&#146;s settlement services business and this change in presentation,
our settlement services business generated incremental revenues of $65&nbsp;million compared with
2002. Title, appraisal and other closing fees all increased due to higher volumes, consistent
with the growth in the mortgage origination markets through the first nine months of 2003, as
well as cross-selling initiatives.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Operating and administrative expenses within this segment increased approximately $261&nbsp;million
compared to 2002 primarily due to the direct costs incurred in connection with increased
mortgage loan production and related servicing activities.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B><I>Hospitality Services</I></B>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Revenues and EBITDA increased $343&nbsp;million (16%) and $8&nbsp;million (1%), respectively, in
2003 compared with 2002. We completed the acquisitions of Trendwest, a leading vacation ownership
company, in June&nbsp;2002 (90% was acquired in April&nbsp;2002); Equivest Finance, Inc. in February&nbsp;2002;
and several European vacation rental companies during 2002. The operating results of the acquired
companies were included from the acquisition dates forward and therefore were incremental for the
portions of 2003 that were pre-acquisition periods in 2002. Accordingly, Trendwest, Equivest, and
the acquired vacation rental companies contributed incremental revenues of $169&nbsp;million, $8&nbsp;million
and $53&nbsp;million, respectively, and EBITDA of $23&nbsp;million, $2&nbsp;million and
$15&nbsp;million, respectively, in 2003 compared with 2002. In February&nbsp;2003, we acquired the
common interests of FFD&nbsp;Development Company, LLC (&#147;FFD&#148;), the primary developer of timeshare
inventory for our Fairfield Resorts subsidiary. The operating results of FFD were included from
the acquisition date forward and were not significant to our segment results subsequent to our
acquisition. Prior to our acquisition, we owned a preferred stock investment in FFD, which
accrued a dividend, and we also received additional fees from FFD for providing various support
services. Accordingly, prior to our acquisition, FFD contributed revenues and EBITDA of $16&nbsp;million
and $4&nbsp;million, respectively, to 2002 results.</DIV>


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Excluding the impact from acquisitions described above, revenues in 2003 increased $129&nbsp;million
(6%) while EBITDA declined $28&nbsp;million (5%) and the EBITDA margin (EBITDA as a
percentage of revenues) dropped from 29% in 2002 to 25% in 2003. The reduction in EBITDA margin
was driven principally by a shift in the mix of business operations comprising segment results in
2003 compared with 2002 and a reduction in travel demand during 2003 due to the military conflict
in Iraq as well as economic pressures, which contributed to suppressing volumes within certain of
our hospitality businesses.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Despite a challenging travel environment, revenues from sales of VOIs in our timeshare sales and
marketing business increased $103&nbsp;million in 2003, an 11%&nbsp;increase over 2002. This
increase was driven primarily by a 4%&nbsp;increase in tour flow and a 3%&nbsp;increase in the
average revenue generated per tour at our timeshare resort sites. The growth in our timeshare
sales and marketing businesses positively impacted the segment results and also contributed to a
lower year-over-year segment EBITDA margin, as this business typically operates with lower
margins than our lodging franchise and timeshare exchange businesses, which have greater
operating leverage. Net interest income generated from the financing extended to VOI buyers
decreased $8&nbsp;million as the effects of growth in the loan portfolio were more than offset by
the impact of consolidating our principal timeshare securitization structure in September&nbsp;2003
and, at such time, no longer recording gains on the sale of receivables to such entity (see Note&nbsp;17
to our Consolidated Financial Statements). Timeshare subscription and exchange fee
revenues within our timeshare exchange business increased $36&nbsp;million (8%), primarily due to
a 13%&nbsp;increase in the average fee per exchange, which was partially offset by a 3%&nbsp;reduction
in the volume of exchange

<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">transactions. The increase in the average exchange fee
includes a favorable yield on increased rentals of excess RCI&nbsp;vacation interval inventory to
RCI&nbsp;members in 2003 compared with 2002.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Royalties and marketing and reservation fund revenues within our lodging franchise operations
declined $8&nbsp;million (2%) in 2003 due to a 5%&nbsp;decline in the number of weighted average
rooms available following our decision to terminate from our franchise system certain properties
that were not meeting required standards. However, such quality control initiatives also
contributed to an increase in the occupancy levels and average daily room rates at our lodging
brands, and, as a result, revenue per available room increased 2%&nbsp;period-over-period and
partially offset the impact on royalties from the reduction in available rooms. Our lodging
franchise business and our franchisees were unfavorably impacted by the weaker travel
environment, as previously discussed, and as a result, during 2003, we recorded an incremental $6&nbsp;million
of non-cash expenses related to the doubtful collectability of certain franchisee
receivables. In addition, although revenues and EBITDA were nominally impacted on a consolidated
basis, preferred alliance revenues within this segment declined $19&nbsp;million in 2003 due to a
change in the allocation of such revenues. Revenues received from preferred vendors in 2002
substantially benefited the Hospitality Services segment whereas in 2003, the benefits of such
revenues extended to business units within other reportable segments. Excluding acquisitions,
operating and administrative expenses within this segment increased approximately $130&nbsp;million
in 2003 principally due to increased timeshare sales-related expenses, including marginal
expense increases on higher sales volumes, higher product costs on developed timeshare inventory
and an increased investment in marketing spending to enhance tour flow.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B><I>Travel Distribution Services</I></B>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Revenues and EBITDA declined $36&nbsp;million (2%) and $67&nbsp;million (13%), respectively, in
2003 compared with 2002. Like other industry participants, this segment was unfavorably impacted
by weak global travel demand during 2003. Travel demand in 2003 was negatively affected by
various factors, including the military conflict in Iraq and terrorist threat alerts, continuing
economic pressures and SARS concerns in the Asia-Pacific region and other parts of the world.
Such factors suppressed bookings and revenues across our travel distribution businesses, but
primarily impacted international travel volumes.</DIV>


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Galileo worldwide air booking fees decreased $71&nbsp;million (6%) primarily due to a 10% decline
in international GDS&nbsp;booking volumes, partially offset by domestic GDS&nbsp;booking volumes,
which stabilized in 2003 compared with 2002. Galileo acquired certain European national
distribution companies&nbsp;(&#147;NDCs&#148;) during 2002. NDCs are independent organizations that market
and sell Galileo global distribution and computer reservation services to travel agents and other
subscribers. The NDC&nbsp;acquisitions contributed incremental subscriber fee revenues and EBITDA
of $29&nbsp;million and $12&nbsp;million, respectively, in 2003. During the summer of 2002, we also
acquired two other companies that supply reservation and distribution services to the hospitality
industry. The operating results of such companies were included from the acquisition dates
forward and collectively contributed revenue of $24&nbsp;million with a nominal EBITDA impact
during 2003.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">In April&nbsp;2003, we completed the acquisition of Trip Network&nbsp;Inc., an online travel agent that
operated the online travel services business of Cheap Tickets. From the acquisition date forward,
Trip Network generated $30&nbsp;million of revenues and had an EBITDA loss of $23&nbsp;million in
2003. In addition, principally as a result of our ownership of Trip Network, an incremental $15&nbsp;million
of intercompany segment revenues were eliminated in 2003, most of which were Trip
Network revenues earned from Galileo for airline bookings made by Trip Network using Galileo&#146;s GDS&nbsp;System.
Our online booking volumes grew 58% in 2003 compared with 2002, primarily due to (i)&nbsp;a
shift in travel bookings from the traditional off-line channels to online channels, (ii)&nbsp;an
increase in online travel bookings; and (iii)&nbsp;increased merchant model hotel bookings
where we, as a travel distributor, obtain access to content from travel suppliers at a
pre-determined price and sell the content, either individually or in a package, to travelers at
retail prices that we determine with little or no risk of inventory loss. Additionally, revenues
from our off-line travel agency business declined $24&nbsp;million in 2003, as we accelerated our
shift to the online channel. The results of our online and off-line travel agency operations are
reflective of the general industry decline in travel demand during 2003, as previously discussed,
reductions in commission rates paid by airlines, the lack of reduced-rate air inventory
availability and a decline in travel-related clubs (which we service). Such results also reflect
our investment in the marketing and administration of our online travel services business, which
we believe represents a significant opportunity for future growth.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">The EBITDA impact of lower GDS and travel agency revenues was partially offset by a corresponding
decline in variable expenses, reductions in retiree medical costs as a result of post-retirement
plan amendments and other net reductions in operating expenses from segment-wide re-engineering
and cost containment initiatives implemented in 2002 and 2003. These operating expense reductions
helped mitigate the negative impact of the weak travel environment that existed during 2003.
Additionally, EBITDA in 2003 was favorably impacted by $8&nbsp;million in connection with a
contract termination settlement during first quarter 2003.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B><I>Vehicle Services</I></B>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Revenues and EBITDA increased $1,577&nbsp;million (37%) and $34&nbsp;million (8%), respectively, in
2003 compared with 2002 primarily due to our November&nbsp;2002 acquisition of substantially all of
the domestic assets, as well as selected international operations, of the vehicle rental business
of Budget Group, Inc. Budget&#146;s operating results, including integration costs, were included from
the acquisition date forward and contributed incremental revenues of $1,585&nbsp;million with an
EBITDA decline of $2&nbsp;million in 2003. Excluding the impact of Budget, segment revenues
declined $8&nbsp;million (less than&nbsp;1%), while EBITDA increased $36&nbsp;million (9%) in 2003,
which is primarily attributable to reduced car rental demand, offset by increased pricing, at
Avis and favorable results at our Wright Express fuel card services subsidiary.</DIV>


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Avis domestic car rental revenues declined $91&nbsp;million (4%) in 2003 compared with 2002. The
net reduction in domestic car rental revenues at Avis was primarily due to a 7%&nbsp;period-over-period
reduction in the total number of car rental days. This was partially offset by
a 2% increase in time and mileage revenue per rental day reflecting an increase in pricing, which
has minimal associated incremental costs. In addition, EBITDA, period-over-period, includes
favorable program-related interest costs of $33&nbsp;million on the financing of vehicles due to
lower interest rates and $35&nbsp;million of lower program-related depreciation expense on
vehicles due to a different mix of vehicles in Avis&#146; fleet bearing a lower cost in 2003 compared
with 2002. This favorable impact on EBITDA was substantially offset by incremental
vehicle-related net expenses and other operating costs. The increase in net expenses includes
incremental maintenance and damage costs, higher vehicle license and registration fees and
unfavorable conditions in the used car market in 2003 compared with 2002 for vehicles that did
not meet the eligibility criteria under our manufacturers repurchase program. However, the
percentage of Avis&#146; fleet that was determined ineligible for manufacturer repurchase decreased to
1.7% in 2003 from 2.7% in 2002. Revenues from Avis&#146; international operations increased $60&nbsp;million
due to increased transaction volume and the favorable impact to revenues of exchange
rates in Canada, Australia and New Zealand, which was principally offset in EBITDA by the
unfavorable impact on expenses.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Wright Express, our fuel card services subsidiary, recognized incremental revenues of $30&nbsp;million
(24%) in 2003 compared with the prior year. The organic growth was driven by a
combination of the addition of new customers and an increase in usage of Wright Express&#146;
proprietary fuel card product. Higher gasoline prices also contributed to the revenue growth,
since Wright Express earns a percentage of total gasoline purchases by its clients.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B><I>Marketing Services</I></B>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Revenues increased $61&nbsp;million (5%) and EBITDA declined $75&nbsp;million (20%) in 2003
compared with 2002. Effective July&nbsp;1, 2003, pursuant to the provisions of FIN&nbsp;46, we
consolidated TRL&nbsp;Group. TRL&nbsp;Group (on a stand-alone basis before elimination of
intercompany transactions with our retained membership business) contributed revenues of $241&nbsp;million
and an EBITDA loss of $8&nbsp;million subsequent to consolidation in 2003. Apart from the
consolidation of TRL&nbsp;Group, revenues and EBITDA declined $180&nbsp;million and $67&nbsp;million,
respectively, reflecting, as expected, the continued attrition of the membership base
retained by us in connection with the outsourcing of our individual membership business to TRL&nbsp;Group.
However, the unfavorable impact of reduced revenues on EBITDA was mitigated by a net
reduction in expenses from servicing fewer members. A smaller membership base resulted in a net
revenue reduction of $194&nbsp;million (net of $26&nbsp;million of increased royalty income from TRL&nbsp;Group),
which was partially offset in EBITDA by net favorable membership operating and
marketing expenses of $111&nbsp;million. As a result of the consolidation of TRL&nbsp;Group, we
eliminated $34&nbsp;million of intercompany revenues within this segment in 2003, which was
substantially comprised of royalty and lease payments made from TRL&nbsp;Group to our pre-existing
membership business subsequent to the consolidation of TRL&nbsp;Group on July&nbsp;1, 2003. For a
more detailed discussion of our relationship with TRL&nbsp;Group and the consolidation thereof as
a result of FIN&nbsp;46, see Note&nbsp;22 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Additionally, in January&nbsp;2004, we made modifications to the existing relationship with TRL&nbsp;Group. See Note&nbsp;22
to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed account of such modifications.</DIV>


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Partially offsetting the impact of the attrition in our retained membership business was growth
in our insurance-wholesale-related operations and the favorable impact of foreign currency
exchange rates on the revenues of our international membership business (which was principally
offset in EBITDA by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates on expenses). Revenues from
insurance-wholesale-related operations increased $13&nbsp;million as a result of favorable claims
experience period-over-period and increased insurance premium collections. Additionally, in
second quarter 2003, we ceased marketing and selling new long-term care policies within our
long-term preferred care business, but will continue servicing the existing in-force block of
policy holders. This resulted in a reduction in revenue of $9&nbsp;million with a nominal impact
to EBITDA. In 2003, EBITDA was also impacted by a $7&nbsp;million charge for actions taken in
third quarter 2003 at our international membership business, which included the closure and
consolidation of certain facilities and a reduction in staff in the United Kingdom.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B><I>Corporate and Other</I></B>


<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Revenues and EBITDA increased $4&nbsp;million and $162&nbsp;million, respectively, in 2003 compared
with 2002. Revenues and EBITDA in 2003 include a $30&nbsp;million gain in connection with the sale
of our equity investment in Entertainment Publication, Inc. during first quarter 2003. Also, we
earned revenues in both 2003 and 2002 in connection with credit card marketing programs whereby
we earn revenues based on a percentage of credit card spending. Additionally, we recognized
expenses as cardholders earned points based on credit card usage. We generated $20&nbsp;million of
incremental revenues and incurred $19&nbsp;million of additional point-related liabilities during
2003 in connection with these programs. Partially offsetting the revenue increases were $42&nbsp;million
of incremental intersegment revenue eliminations in 2003 due to increased intercompany
business activities.</DIV>


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">EBITDA was favorable year-over-year principally due to a $92&nbsp;million net reduction in
securities-related litigation charges (litigation charges less insurance recoveries) in 2003
compared with 2002 principally as a result of the absence in 2003 of litigation settlements and
accruals established in 2002 in connection with all remaining CUC-related securities litigation.
Also contributing to the favorable EBITDA change was a $33&nbsp;million reduction in bonus
expenses and other incentive-based compensation. In addition, EBITDA was favorably impacted by a
greater absorption of overhead expenses by our reportable operating segments during 2003 compared
with 2002 principally due to revenue growth at our business units (expenses are allocated on a
percentage of revenue basis) and expense allocations in 2003 to companies acquired during 2002.
Partially offsetting favorable EBITDA was a $10&nbsp;million accrual recorded in 2003 to revise
our original estimate of costs to exit a facility in connection with the previous outsourcing of
our data center operations.

<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">We present separately the financial data of our management and mortgage programs. These programs
are distinct from our other activities since the assets are generally funded through the issuance
of debt that is collateralized by such assets. Specifically, in our vehicle rental, relocation,
and vacation ownership and rental businesses, assets under management and mortgage programs are
funded through borrowings under asset-backed funding or other similar arrangements. Additionally,
during 2004, in our former fleet management, mortgage services and fuel card businesses, assets
under management and mortgage programs were funded through borrowings under asset-backed funding
arrangements or unsecured borrowings at our PHH subsidiary. Such borrowings are classified as
debt under management and mortgage programs. The income generated by these assets is used, in
part, to repay the principal and interest associated with the debt. Cash inflows and outflows
relating to the generation or acquisition of such assets and the principal debt repayment or
financing of such assets are classified as activities of our management and mortgage programs. We
believe it is appropriate to segregate the financial data of our management and mortgage programs
because, ultimately, the source of repayment of such debt is the realization of such assets.

goodwill primarily resulting from the acquisitions of Orbitz, Sotheby&#146;s and several other
strategic businesses in 2004 (see Note&nbsp;5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements) and (iii)&nbsp;an
increase of $354&nbsp;million in trademarks primarily due to our acquisition of Orbitz and
our purchases of Marriott International Inc.&#146;s interest in Two Flags Joint Venture LLC and the
exclusive rights to the international Ramada tradename (see Note&nbsp;6 to our Consolidated
Financial Statements). Such increases were partially offset by (i)&nbsp;a decrease of $248&nbsp;million

detailed discussion), (ii)&nbsp;a $556&nbsp;million decrease in assets of discontinued operations

primarily due to (i)&nbsp;our repurchase of $763&nbsp;million of the senior notes component of our

senior convertible contingent notes into shares of Cendant common stock during first quarter
2004, (iii)&nbsp;the redemption of $804&nbsp;million of our 3 7/8%&nbsp;convertible senior

increase in fuel card receivables resulting from a combination of new customers,
increased usage of the fuel card product and higher fuel prices and (vi)&nbsp;a $168&nbsp;million
increase in program cash. Such increases were partially offset by (i)&nbsp;a $527&nbsp;million
decrease in mortgage loans held for sale due to decreased mortgage loan origination volume in
2004 and the differences in the timing of loan sales and (ii)&nbsp;a decrease of $237&nbsp;million
in the derivative asset related to our MSR asset, the majority of which was offset by a decrease
in the derivative liability related to our MSR asset, which is classified within other
liabilities under management and mortgage programs on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Liabilities under management and mortgage programs increased primarily due to (i)&nbsp;an increase

creation of consumer notes receivable and the acquisition of timeshare properties related to our

<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">During 2004, we generated approximately $1.5&nbsp;billion less cash from operating activities
compared with the corresponding period in 2003. This change principally reflects increased
working capital needs and the activities of our management and mortgage programs primarily
resulting from (i)&nbsp;$964&nbsp;million less cash generated by our mortgage business, reflecting
both timing differences between the receipt of cash from the sale of previously originated
mortgage loans and the origination of new mortgage loans and an overall decline in mortgage
production and (ii)&nbsp;the utilization of $271&nbsp;million more cash by our timeshare business
in connection with the origination and collection of timeshare assets, including the development
of timeshare properties. Cash flows related to our management and mortgage programs may fluctuate
significantly from period to period due to the timing of the underlying transactions (i.e.,
timing of mortgage loan origination versus sale). Partially offsetting these changes were
stronger operating results in 2004.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">During 2004, we used approximately $1.4&nbsp;billion more cash for investing activities in
comparison with 2003. This change principally reflects (i)&nbsp;the use of approximately $1.1&nbsp;billion
more cash to acquire vehicles for our vehicle rental and fleet leasing businesses and (ii)&nbsp;the
utilization of approximately $1.4&nbsp;billion more cash to fund acquisitions, the
majority of which relate to our core travel and real estate businesses. These incremental cash
expenditures were partially offset by $772&nbsp;million of net proceeds received on the sale of
Jackson Hewitt in second quarter 2004 and $61&nbsp;million of proceeds received on the sale of
other non-core businesses during 2004. In addition, our mortgage services business utilized $347&nbsp;million
less cash primarily associated with its MSR asset and related risk management
activities. Capital expenditures, which remained relatively consistent year-over-year, were $469&nbsp;million
in 2004. We anticipate aggregate capital expenditure investments for 2005 to be in
the range of $400&nbsp;million to $450&nbsp;million.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">We used approximately $1.9&nbsp;billion less cash for financing activities during 2004 when
compared with 2003. Such change principally reflects the activities of our management and
mortgage programs, which generated $568&nbsp;million of cash in 2004 compared with using
approximately $1.5&nbsp;billion of cash in 2003. This change principally reflects greater
borrowings at our car rental and fleet leasing businesses to support the acquisition of vehicles
partially offset by the repayment of $350&nbsp;million of medium-term notes in our mortgage business.
We also received $863&nbsp;million of proceeds in connection with the settlement of the forward
purchase contract component of our former Upper DECS securities whereby we issued approximately 38&nbsp;million
shares of Cendant common stock. These cash inflows were partially offset by (i)&nbsp;$575&nbsp;million
of incremental debt reduction activities, (ii)&nbsp;$333&nbsp;million of dividend
payments to our shareholders and (iii)&nbsp;$233&nbsp;million of additional share repurchase
activity. See &#147;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#151;Financial Obligations&#148; for a detailed discussion
of financing activities during 2004.

<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Our liquidity position may be negatively affected by unfavorable conditions in any one of the
industries in which we operate. Additionally, our liquidity as it relates to management programs
could be adversely affected by (i)&nbsp;the deterioration in the performance of the underlying
assets of such programs and (ii)&nbsp;the impairment of our ability to access the principal
financing program for our vehicle rental subsidiaries if General Motors Corporation or Ford Motor
Company should not be able to honor its obligations to repurchase a substantial number of our
vehicles. Access to our credit facilities may be limited if we were to fail to meet certain
financial ratios. We do not believe that our credit ratings are likely to fall below investment
grade. Additionally, we monitor the maintenance of required financial ratios and, as of December&nbsp;31,
2004, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under our credit and
securitization facilities.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Currently, our debt is rated &#147;Baa1&#148; by Moody&#146;s Investors Service, &#147;BBB&#148; by Standard and Poor&#146;s
and &#147;BBB&#043;&#148; by Fitch Ratings. Standard&nbsp;&#038; Poor&#146;s and Fitch Ratings have assigned a &#147;positive
outlook&#148; and a &#147;stable outlook&#148; to Cendant&#146;s credit ratings, respectively. Moody&#146;s Investors
Service has Cendant&#146;s credit ratings under review for a possible downgrade. A security rating is
not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and is subject to revision or withdrawal by
the assigning rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other
rating.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B><I>Critical Accounting Policies</I></B>



<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">In presenting our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported
therein. Several of the estimates and assumptions we are required to make relate to matters that
are inherently uncertain as they pertain to future events. However, events that are outside of
our control cannot be predicted and, as such, they cannot be contemplated in evaluating such
estimates and assumptions. If there is a significant unfavorable change to current conditions, it
could result in a material adverse impact to our consolidated results of operations, financial
position and liquidity. We believe that the estimates and assumptions we used when preparing our
financial statements were the most appropriate at that time. Presented below are those accounting
policies that we believe require subjective and complex judgments that could potentially affect
reported results. However, the majority of our businesses operate in environments where we are
paid a fee for a service performed, and therefore the results of the majority of our recurring
operations are recorded in our financial statements using accounting policies that are not
particularly subjective, nor complex.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Mortgage Servicing Rights. </I>A mortgage servicing right is the right to receive a portion of the
interest coupon and fees collected from the mortgagor for performing specified mortgage servicing
activities. The value of mortgage servicing rights is estimated based upon an internal valuation
that reflects management&#146;s estimates of expected future cash flows considering prepayment
estimates (developed using a third party model described below), our historical prepayment rates,
portfolio characteristics, interest rates based on interest rate yield curves, implied volatility
and other economic factors. More specifically, we incorporate a probability weighted Option
Adjusted Spread (&#147;OAS&#148;) model to generate and discount cash flows for the MSR valuation. The OAS
model generates numerous interest rate paths then calculates the MSR cash flow at each monthly
point for each interest rate path and discounts those cash flows back to the current period. The
MSR value is determined by averaging the discounted cash flows from each of the interest rate
paths. The interest rate paths are generated with a random distribution centered around implied
forward interest rates, which are determined from the interest rate yield


<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt">65</DIV>

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">curve at any given point of time. As of December&nbsp;31, 2004, the implied forward interest rates project an
increase of approximately 26&nbsp;basis points in the yield of the 10-year Treasury Note over the
next 12&nbsp;months. Changes in the yield curve will result in changes to the forward rates
implied from that yield curve.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">As noted above, a key assumption in our estimate of the MSR valuation is forecasted prepayments.
We use a third party model to forecast prepayment rates at each monthly point for each interest
rate path in the OAS model. The prepayment forecast is based on historical observations of
prepayment behavior in similar circumstances. The prepayment forecast incorporates loan
characteristics (e.g., loan type and note rate) and factors such as recent prepayment experience,
previous refinance opportunities and estimated levels of home equity to determine the prepayment
forecast at each monthly point for each interest rate path.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">To the extent that fair value is less than carrying value at the individual strata level (which
is based upon product type and interest rates of underlying mortgage loans), we would consider
the portfolio to have been impaired and record a related charge. Reductions in interest rates
different than those used in our models could cause us to use different assumptions in the MSR
valuation, which could result in a decrease in the estimated fair value of our MSR asset,
requiring a corresponding reduction in the carrying value of the asset. To mitigate this risk, we
use derivatives that generally increase in value as interest rates decline and conversely decline
in value as interest rates increase. Additionally, as interest rates decrease, we have
historically experienced increased production revenue resulting from a greater level of
refinancings, which over time has historically mitigated the impact on earnings of the decline in
our MSR asset.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Changes in the estimated fair value of the mortgage servicing rights based upon variations in the
assumptions (e.g., future interest rate levels, implied volatility, prepayment speeds) cannot be
extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumptions to the change in fair value
may not be linear. Changes in one assumption may result in changes to another, which may magnify
or counteract the fair value sensitivity analysis and would make such an analysis not meaningful.
Additionally, further declines in interest rates due to a weakening economy and geopolitical
risks, which result in an increase in refinancing activity or changes in assumptions, could
adversely impact the valuation. The carrying value of our MSR asset was approximately $1.6&nbsp;billion
as of December&nbsp;31, 2004 and the total portfolio that we were servicing approximated
$143.1&nbsp;billion as of December&nbsp;31, 2004 (refer to Note&nbsp;7 to our Consolidated Financial
Statements for a detailed discussion of the effect of any changes to the value of this asset
during 2004, 2003 and 2002). The effects of certain adverse potential changes in the estimated
fair value of our MSR asset are detailed in Note&nbsp;17 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Financial Instruments. </I>We estimate fair values for each of our financial instruments, including
derivative instruments. Most of these financial instruments are not publicly traded on an
organized exchange. In the absence of quoted market prices, we must develop an estimate of fair
value using dealer quotes, present value cash flow models, option pricing models or other
conventional valuation methods, as appropriate. The use of these fair value techniques involves
significant judgments and assumptions, including estimates of future interest rate levels based
on interest rate yield curves, prepayment and volatility factors, and an estimation of the timing
of future cash flows. The use of different assumptions may have a material effect on the
estimated fair value amounts recorded in the financial statements, which are disclosed in Note&nbsp;24
to our Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, hedge accounting requires that at
the beginning of each hedge period, we justify an expectation that the relationship between the
changes in fair value of derivatives designated as hedges compared to changes in the fair value
of the underlying hedged items will be highly effective. This effectiveness assessment, which is
performed quarterly, involves an estimation of changes in fair value resulting from changes in
interest rates and corresponding changes in prepayment levels, as well as the probability of the
occurrence of transactions for cash flow hedges. The use of different assumptions and changing
market conditions may impact the results of the effectiveness assessment and ultimately the
timing of when changes in derivative fair values and the underlying hedged items are recorded in
earnings. See Item&nbsp;7a. &#147;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk&#148; for a
discussion of the effect of hypothetical changes to these assumptions.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Goodwill. </I>We have reviewed the carrying value of our goodwill as required by Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (&#147;SFAS&#148;) No.&nbsp;142, &#147;Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,&#148; by
comparing the carrying value of our reporting units to their fair value and determined that the
carrying amount of our reporting units did

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">not exceed their respective fair value. When
determining fair value, we utilized various assumptions, including projections of future cash
flows. A change in these underlying assumptions will cause a change in the results of the tests
and, as such, could cause fair value to be less than the respective carrying amount. In such
event, we would then be required to record a charge, which would impact earnings. We will
continue to review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if
circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">We provide a wide range of consumer and business services and, as a result, our goodwill is
allocated among many diverse reporting units. Accordingly, it is difficult to quantify the impact
of an adverse change in financial results and related cash flows, as such change may be isolated
to a small number of our reporting units or spread across our entire organization. In either
case, the magnitude of an impairment to goodwill, if any, cannot be estimated. However, our
businesses are concentrated in a few industries and, as a result, an adverse change to any of
these industries will impact our consolidated results and may result in impairment of our
goodwill. The aggregate carrying value of our goodwill was approximately $11.9&nbsp;billion at
December&nbsp;31, 2004. Refer to Note&nbsp;6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more
information on goodwill.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Income Taxes. </I>We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between
the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. We
regularly review our deferred tax assets to assess their potential realization and establish a
valuation allowance for portions of such assets that we believe will not be ultimately realized.
In performing this review, we make estimates and assumptions regarding projected future taxable
income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the
implementation of tax planning strategies. A change in these assumptions could cause an increase
or decrease to our valuation allowance resulting in an increase or decrease in our effective tax
rate, which could materially impact our results of operations.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Additionally, our income tax returns are periodically examined by various tax authorities. We
establish reserves for tax treatments when, despite our belief that the treatments are fully
supportable, certain treatments are likely to be challenged and that we may not succeed. We
adjust our reserves upon the closing of a tax audit, which in some cases can occur several years
following the related transaction or the filing of the tax return under examination, or other
changes in facts and circumstances that indicate an adjustment may be necessary (including
subsequent rulings and interpretations by tax authorities or court decisions on similar matters).
Changes to the reserves could materially impact our results of operations.

income taxes.

<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">We assess our market risk based on changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates
utilizing a sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity analysis measures the potential impact in
earnings, fair values and cash flows based on a hypothetical 10% change (increase and decrease)
in interest and currency rates.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">The fair values of mortgage loans, commitments to fund mortgages and mortgage-backed securities
are determined from market sources. The fair values of relocation receivables and equity advances
on homes approximate carrying values due to the short-term nature of these assets. We use a
discounted cash flow model in determining the fair values of timeshare receivables, mortgage
servicing rights and our retained interests in securitized assets. The primary assumptions used
in determining fair value are prepayment speeds, estimated loss rates and discount rates. In
determining the fair value of mortgage servicing rights, the model also utilizes credit losses
and mortgage servicing revenues and expenses as primary assumptions. In addition, for commitments
to fund mortgages, the borrower&#146;s propensity to close their mortgage loan under the commitment is
used as a primary assumption. For mortgage loans, commitments to fund mortgages, forward delivery
contracts and options, we rely on market sources in determining the impact of interest rate
shifts. We also utilize a probability weighted option-adjusted spread model to determine the
impact of interest rate shifts on mortgage servicing rights. The primary assumptions in this
model are the implied market volatility of interest rates and prepayment speeds and the same
primary assumptions are used in determining fair value.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">We use a duration-based model in determining the impact of interest rate shifts on our debt
portfolio, certain other interest bearing liabilities and interest rate derivatives portfolios.
The primary assumption used in these models is that a 10% increase or decrease in the benchmark
interest rate produces a parallel shift in the yield curve across all maturities.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">We use a current market pricing model to assess the changes in the value of the U.S.&nbsp;dollar
on foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and derivatives. The primary
assumption used in these models is a hypothetical 10% weakening or strengthening of the U.S.&nbsp;dollar
against all our currency exposures at December&nbsp;31, 2004, 2003 and 2002.

assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on management&#146;s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating management&#146;s assessment, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as
we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the
supervision of, the company&#146;s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons
performing similar functions, and effected by the company&#146;s board of directors, management, and
other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that (1)&nbsp;pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of the company; (2)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary
to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance
with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)&nbsp;provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the company&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the
possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due
to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any
evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future
periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">In our opinion, management&#146;s assessment that the Company maintained effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all material respects,
based on the criteria established in <I>Internal Control&#151;Integrated Framework </I>issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also in our opinion, the
Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December&nbsp;31, 2004, based on the criteria established in <I>Internal Control&#151;Integrated
Framework </I>issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the Company&#146;s consolidated balance sheet as of December&nbsp;31, 2004 and
the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders&#146; equity, and cash flow for the year
ended December&nbsp;31, 2004, and our report dated February&nbsp;28, 2005 expressed an unqualified
opinion on those financial statements and included an explanatory paragraph relating to the
revision of earnings per share calculations for all prior periods presented to include the
dilutive effect of certain contingently convertible debt securities.

<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Cendant Corporation:


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cendant Corporation and
subsidiaries (the &#147;Company&#148;) as of December&nbsp;31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated
statements of income, stockholders&#146; equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December&nbsp;31, 2004. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company&#146;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements
based on our audits.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,
the consolidated financial position of the Company as of December&nbsp;31, 2004 and 2003, and the
consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December&nbsp;31, 2004, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">As discussed in Note&nbsp;2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has revised
earnings per share calculations for all prior periods presented to include the dilutive effect of
certain contingently convertible debt securities. Also, as discussed in Note&nbsp;2, on January&nbsp;1,
2003, the Company adopted the fair value method of accounting for stock-based
compensation, and during 2003, the Company adopted the consolidation provisions for variable
interest entities.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt">We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial
reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2004, based on the criteria established in <I>Internal
Control&#151;Integrated Framework </I>issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission and our report dated February&nbsp;28, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on
management&#146;s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial
reporting and an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over
financial reporting.

<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts and transactions of
Cendant Corporation and its subsidiaries (&#147;Cendant&#148;), as well as entities in which Cendant
directly or indirectly has a controlling financial interest (collectively, the &#147;Company&#148;). For
more detailed information regarding the Company&#146;s consolidation policy, refer to Note&nbsp;2&#151;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. In presenting the Consolidated Financial
Statements, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and
related disclosures. Estimates, by their nature, are based on judgment and available
information. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain
reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to conform to the current year
presentation.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt"><I>Management and Mortgage Programs. </I>The Company&#146;s Consolidated Financial Statements present
separately the financial data of the Company&#146;s management and mortgage programs. These
programs are distinct from the Company&#146;s other activities since the assets are generally
funded through the issuance of debt that is collateralized by such assets. Specifically, in
the Company&#146;s vehicle rental, fleet management, relocation, mortgage services and vacation
ownership and rental businesses, assets under management and mortgage programs are funded
largely through borrowings under asset-backed funding arrangements and unsecured borrowings at
the Company&#146;s PHH subsidiary. Such borrowings are classified as debt under management and
mortgage programs. The income generated by these assets is used, in part, to repay the
principal and interest associated with the debt. Cash inflows and outflows relating to the
generation or acquisition of such assets and the principal debt repayment or financing of such
assets are classified as activities of the Company&#146;s management and mortgage programs. The
Company believes it is appropriate to segregate the financial data of its management and
mortgage programs because, ultimately, the source of repayment of such debt is the realization
of such assets.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">On June&nbsp;25, 2004, the Company completed an initial public offering (&#147;IPO&#148;) for the sale of
100% of its ownership interest in Jackson Hewitt Tax Service Inc. (&#147;Jackson Hewitt&#148;) and on May&nbsp;22,
2002, the Company sold its car parking facility business, National Car Parks (&#147;NCP&#148;).
Pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (&#147;SFAS&#148;) No.&nbsp;144, &#147;Accounting for
the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,&#148; the account balances and activities of
Jackson Hewitt and NCP have been segregated and reported as a discontinued operation for all
periods presented. See Note&nbsp;3&#151;Discontinued Operations for more detailed information
regarding the disposition of these businesses.

<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt"><B><I>Repatriation of Foreign Earnings. </I></B>In December&nbsp;2004, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) issued FASB Staff Position No.&nbsp;FAS&nbsp;109-2, &#147;Accounting and Disclosure
Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation
Act of 2004&#148; (&#147;FSP&nbsp;No.&nbsp;109-2&#148;). The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the &#147;Act&#148;),
which became effective October&nbsp;22, 2004, provides a one-time dividends received deduction
on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a U.S.&nbsp;taxpayer, provided certain
criteria are met. The Company may apply the provision of the Act to qualifying earnings
repatriations through December&nbsp;31, 2005. FSP&nbsp;No.&nbsp;109-2 provides accounting and
disclosure guidance for the repatriation provision. As permitted by FSP&nbsp;No.&nbsp;109-2,
the Company will not complete its evaluation of the repatriation provisions until a
reasonable duration following the publication of clarifying language on key elements of the
Act by Congress or the Treasury Department. Accordingly, the Company has not recorded any
income tax expense or benefit for amounts that may be repatriated under the Act. The range of
unremitted earnings the Company is considering for possible repatriation under the Act is $0
to $555&nbsp;million, which would result in additional estimated income tax expense of $0 to
$42&nbsp;million. Currently, the Company does not record deferred tax liabilities on
unremitted earnings of its foreign subsidiaries, as such subsidiaries reinvest such
undistributed earnings indefinitely.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt"><B><I>Effect of Contingently Convertible Instruments on Diluted Earnings Per Share. </I></B>In September
2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force reached a consensus on Issue No.&nbsp;04-8, &#147;The Effect
of Contingently Convertible Instruments on Diluted Earnings per Share&#148; (&#147;EITF&nbsp;04-8&#148;),
which requires that diluted earnings per share include the effect of any contingently
convertible debt securities regardless of whether the market price trigger had been satisfied
during the period. As required, the Company adopted the provisions of EITF&nbsp;04-8 as of
December&nbsp;31, 2004 and revised diluted earnings per share for all prior periods presented
to include the effect of convertible debt securities that were outstanding during such
periods and not ultimately settled in cash. The adoption of EITF&nbsp;04-8 reduced previously
reported diluted earnings per share for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2003 and 2002 by
$0.02 and $0.01, respectively. See Note&nbsp;4&#151;Earnings per Share for further information.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt"><B><I>Loan&nbsp;Commitments. </I></B>On March&nbsp;9, 2004, the United States Securities and Exchange
Commission (&#147;SEC&#148;) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin&nbsp;No.&nbsp;105&#151;Application of
Accounting Principles to Loan&nbsp;Commitments (&#147;SAB&nbsp;105&#148;). SAB&nbsp;105 summarizes the
views of the SEC&nbsp;staff regarding the application of generally accepted accounting
principles to loan commitments accounted for as derivative instruments. The SEC staff
believes that in recognizing a loan commitment, entities should not consider expected future
cash flows related to the associated servicing of the loan until the servicing asset has been
contractually separated from the underlying loan by sale or securitization of the loan with
the servicing retained. The provisions of SAB&nbsp;105 are applicable to all loan commitments
accounted for as derivatives and entered into subsequent to March&nbsp;31, 2004. The adoption
of SAB&nbsp;105 did not have a material impact on the Company&#146;s consolidated results of
operations, financial position or cash flows, as the Company&#146;s preexisting accounting
treatment for such loan commitments was consistent with the provisions of SAB&nbsp;105.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt"><FONT style="font-variant: SMALL-CAPS"><B>Changes in Accounting Policies During 2003</B></FONT>



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt"><B><I>Consolidation Policy. </I></B>On January&nbsp;17, 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No.&nbsp;46,
&#147;Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities&#148; (&#147;FIN&nbsp;46&#148;). Such Interpretation
addresses the consolidation of variable interest entities (&#147;VIEs&#148;), including special purpose
entities (&#147;SPEs&#148;), that are not controlled through voting interests or in which the equity
investors do not bear the residual economic risks and rewards. The provisions of FIN&nbsp;46
were effective immediately for transactions entered into by the Company subsequent to January&nbsp;31,
2003 and became effective for all other transactions as of July&nbsp;1, 2003.
However, in October&nbsp;2003, the FASB permitted companies to defer the July&nbsp;1, 2003
effective date to December&nbsp;31, 2003, in whole or in part. On December&nbsp;24, 2003, the
FASB issued a complete replacement of FIN&nbsp;46 (&#147;FIN&nbsp;46R&#148;), which clarified certain
complexities of FIN&nbsp;46. The Company adopted FIN&nbsp;46R in its entirety as of December&nbsp;31,
2003 even though adoption for non-SPEs was not required until March&nbsp;31, 2004.

<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">In connection with the implementation of FIN&nbsp;46, the Company consolidated TRL&nbsp;Group,
Inc. (&#147;TRL&nbsp;Group&#148;) (formerly known as Trilegiant Corporation) and Bishop&#146;s Gate
Residential Mortgage Trust (&#147;Bishop&#146;s Gate&#148;) effective July&nbsp;1, 2003 through the
application of the prospective transition method. Additionally, the Company deconsolidated
Cendant Rental Car Funding (AESOP)&nbsp;LLC (&#147;Cendant Rental Car Funding&#148;) in connection with
its adoption of FIN&nbsp;46R on December&nbsp;31, 2003. The consolidation of TRL&nbsp;Group
resulted in a non-cash charge of $293&nbsp;million (both before and after tax) recorded on July&nbsp;1,
2003 as a cumulative effect of accounting change, which represented the negative
equity of TRL&nbsp;Group and is comprised of assets and liabilities of $205&nbsp;million and $498&nbsp;million,
respectively. See Note&nbsp;22&#151;TRL Group, Inc. for more information regarding TRL&nbsp;Group.
The consolidation of Bishop&#146;s Gate did not result in the recognition of a cumulative
effect of accounting change, nor did the deconsolidation of Cendant Rental Car Funding. See
Note&nbsp;16&#151;Debt Under Management and Mortgage Programs and Borrowing Arrangements for more
complete information regarding Bishop&#146;s Gate and Cendant Rental Car Funding.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt"><I>New Policy. </I>In connection with FIN&nbsp;46R, when evaluating an entity for consolidation, the
Company first determines whether an entity is within the scope of FIN&nbsp;46R and if it is
deemed to be a VIE. If the entity is considered to be a VIE, the Company determines whether it
would be considered the entity&#146;s primary beneficiary. The Company consolidates those VIEs for
which it has determined that it is the primary beneficiary. Generally, the Company will
consolidate an entity not deemed either a VIE or qualifying special purpose entity (&#147;QSPE&#148;)
upon a determination that its ownership, direct or indirect, exceeds fifty percent of the
outstanding voting shares of an entity and/or that it has the ability to control the financial
or operating policies through its voting rights, board representation or other similar rights.
For entities where the Company does not have a controlling interest (financial or operating),
the investments in such entities are classified as available-for-sale securities or accounted
for using the equity or cost method, as appropriate. The Company applies the equity method of
accounting when it has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and
financial policies of an investee in accordance with APB Opinion No.&nbsp;18, &#147;The Equity
Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock.&#148;



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt"><I>Previous Policy. </I>Prior to the adoption of FIN&nbsp;46 and FIN&nbsp;46R, the Company did not
consolidate SPE and SPE-type entities unless the Company retained both control of the assets
transferred and the risks and rewards of those assets. Additionally, non-SPE-type entities
were only consolidated if the Company&#146;s ownership exceeded fifty percent of the outstanding
voting shares of an entity and/or if the Company had the ability to control the financial or
operating policies of an entity through its voting rights, board representation or other
similar rights.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt"><B><I>Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. </I></B>On July&nbsp;1, 2003, the Company adopted SFAS
No.&nbsp;149, &#147;Amendment of Statement&nbsp;133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities.&#148; Such standard amends and clarifies the accounting for derivative instruments,
including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging
activities under SFAS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;133, &#147;Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities.&#148; The impact of adopting this standard was not material to the Company&#146;s results of
operations or financial position.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt"><B><I>Stock-Based Compensation. </I></B>Prior to January&nbsp;1, 2003, the Company measured its stock-based
compensation using the intrinsic value approach under Accounting Principles Board (&#147;APB&#148;)
Opinion No.&nbsp;25, as permitted by SFAS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;123, &#147;Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation.&#148; Accordingly, the Company did not recognize compensation expense upon the
issuance of stock options to employees because the option terms were fixed and the exercise
price equaled the market price of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. The
Company complied with the provisions of SFAS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;123 by providing pro forma
disclosures of net income and related per share data giving consideration to the fair value
method provisions of SFAS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;123.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">On January&nbsp;1, 2003, the Company adopted the fair value method of accounting for
stock-based compensation provisions of SFAS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;123, which is considered by the FASB
to be the preferable accounting method for stock-based employee compensation. The Company also
adopted SFAS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;148, &#147;Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation&#151;Transition and
Disclosure,&#148; in its entirety on January&nbsp;1, 2003, which amended SFAS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;123 to

awards over their vesting periods based upon the fair value of the award on the date of grant.
As the Company elected to use the prospective transition method, the Company&#146;s Consolidated
Statements of Income for 2004 and 2003 reflect stock-based compensation expense only for
employee stock awards that were granted or modified subsequent to December&nbsp;31, 2002. The

the Company had applied the fair value based method to all outstanding employee stock awards

<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt"><I>Real Estate Franchise. </I>The Company franchises its real estate brokerage franchise systems to
the owners of independent real estate brokerage businesses. The Company provides operational
and administrative services to franchisees, which are designed to increase franchisee revenue
and profitability. Such services include advertising and promotions, referrals, training and
volume purchasing discounts. Franchise revenue principally consists of royalty and marketing
fees from the Company&#146;s franchisees. The royalty received is primarily based on a percentage
of the franchisee&#146;s commissions and/or gross revenue. Royalty and marketing fees are accrued
as the underlying franchisee revenue is earned (upon close of the home sale transaction).
Annual rebates given to certain franchisees on royalty fees are recorded as a reduction to
revenue and are accrued for in direct proportion to the recognition of the underlying gross
franchise revenue. Franchise revenue also includes initial franchise fees, which are paid by
new franchisees and are recognized by the Company as revenue when all material services or
conditions relating to the sale have been substantially performed (generally when a franchised
unit opens for business).



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt"><I>Real Estate Brokerage. </I>As an owner-operator of real estate brokerages, the Company assists
home buyers and sellers in listing, marketing, selling and finding homes. Real estate
commissions earned by the Company&#146;s real estate brokerage business are recorded as revenue on
a gross basis upon the closing of a real estate transaction (i.e., purchase or sale of a
home). The commissions that the Company pays to real estate agents, which approximated $3.5&nbsp;billion,
$2.9&nbsp;billion and $2.0&nbsp;billion during 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively,
are recorded as a component of operating expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt"><I>Relocation. </I>The Company provides relocation services to corporate and government clients for
the transfer of their employees. Such services include the purchasing and/or selling of a
transferee&#146;s home, providing home equity advances to transferees (generally guaranteed by the
corporate client), expense processing, arranging household goods moving services and other
related services. The Company earns revenues from fees charged to corporate and government
clients for the performance of these services and recognizes such revenue as services are
provided. Additionally, the Company earns interest income on the funds it advances to the
transferring employee, which is recorded ratably as earned up until the point of repayment by
the client.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">Based on client agreements, the Company negotiates for the ultimate sale of the transferring
employee&#146;s home. The gain or loss on sale is generally borne by the corporate client. However,
in limited circumstances, the Company will assume the risk of loss on the sale of the
transferring employee&#146;s home. The fees earned in these transactions are recorded on a gross
basis with associated costs recorded within expenses. These fees are recognized as services
are provided. The Company also earns revenue from referral services provided to real estate
brokers and other third-party service providers. The Company recognizes the referral fees from
real estate brokers at the time its obligations are complete. For services where the Company
pays a third-party provider on behalf of its clients, the Company earns a referral fee or
commission, which is recognized at the time of completion of services.

through a variety of marketing techniques, including relationships with corporations, affinity
groups, financial institutions and real estate brokerage firms. The Company may also purchase
mortgage loans originated by third parties. Upon the closing of a residential mortgage loan

<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">in the mortgage industry). Mortgage loans held for sale represent those mortgage loans originated or purchased
by the Company and pending sale to permanent investors. The Company primarily sells its
mortgage loans to government-sponsored entities. Upon sale, the servicing rights and
obligations of the underlying mortgage loans are generally retained by the Company. A mortgage
servicing right (&#147;MSR&#148;) is the right to receive a portion of the interest coupon and fees
collected from the mortgagor for performing specified mortgage servicing activities, which
consist of collecting loan payments, remitting principal and interest payments to investors,
holding escrow funds for payment of mortgage-related expenses such as taxes and insurance, and
otherwise administering the Company&#146;s mortgage loan servicing portfolio.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">Loan origination and commitment fees paid by the borrower in connection with the origination
of mortgage loans and certain direct loan origination costs are deferred until such loans are
sold to investors. Mortgage loans pending sale are recorded on the Company&#146;s Consolidated
Balance Sheets at the lower of cost or market value on an aggregate basis. Sales of mortgage
loans are generally recorded on the date a loan is delivered to an investor. Gains or losses
on sales of mortgage loans are recognized based upon the difference between the selling price
and the allocated carrying value of the related mortgage loans sold. The capitalization of the
MSRs also occurs upon sale of the underlying mortgages into the secondary market. Upon initial
recording of the MSR asset, the total cost of loans originated or acquired is allocated
between the MSR asset and the mortgage loan without the servicing rights based on relative
fair values. Servicing revenues comprise several components, including recurring servicing
fees, ancillary income and the amortization of the MSR asset. Recurring servicing fees are
recognized upon receipt of the coupon payment from the borrower and recorded net of guaranty
fees. Costs associated with loan servicing are charged to expense as incurred. The MSR asset
is amortized over the estimated life of the related loan portfolio in proportion to projected
net servicing revenues. Such amortization is recorded as a reduction of net servicing revenue
in the Consolidated Statements of Income.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">The MSR asset is routinely evaluated for impairment, but at least on a quarterly basis. For
purposes of performing its impairment evaluation, the Company stratifies its portfolio on the
basis of product type and interest rates of the underlying mortgage loans. The Company
measures impairment for each stratum by comparing estimated fair value to the carrying amount.
Fair value is estimated based upon an internal valuation that reflects management&#146;s estimates
of expected future cash flows considering prepayment estimates (developed using a third party
model described below), the Company&#146;s historical prepayment rates, portfolio characteristics,
interest rates based on interest rate yield curves, implied volatility and other economic
factors. The Company uses a third party model to forecast prepayment rates used in the
development of its expected future cash flows. The prepayment forecast is based on historical
observations of prepayment behavior in similar periods comparing current mortgage interest
rates to the mortgage interest rates in the Company&#146;s servicing portfolio and incorporates
loan characteristics (e.g., loan type and note rate) and factors such as recent prepayment
experience, previous refinance opportunities and estimated levels of home equity. Temporary
impairment is recorded through a valuation allowance in the period of occurrence as a
reduction of net revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company periodically
evaluates its MSR asset to determine if the carrying value before the application of the
valuation allowance is recoverable. When the Company determines that a portion of the asset is
not recoverable, the asset and the previously designated valuation allowance are reduced to
reflect the write-down.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt"><I>Settlement Services. </I>The Company provides title and closing services, which include title
search procedures for title insurance policies, home sale escrow and closing services
(including ordering appraisal, flood and credit reports). Title agency revenues are recorded
at the time a home sale transaction or refinancing closes. Appraisal fees are recognized as
revenue when the services are performed, which are often prior to the home sale transaction.

<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt"><I>Lodging Franchise. </I>The Company franchises its eight lodging franchise systems to independent
hotel owners. The Company provides operational and administrative services to franchisees,
which include access to a national reservation system, national advertising and promotional
campaigns, co-marketing programs, referrals, training and volume purchasing discounts.
Franchise revenue principally consists of royalties, as

<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">well as marketing and reservation fees, which are primarily based on a percentage of the franchisee&#146;s gross room revenue.
Royalty, marketing and reservation fees are accrued as the underlying franchisee revenue is
earned. Franchise revenue also includes initial franchise fees, which are recognized as
revenue when all material services or conditions relating to the sale have been substantially
performed (generally when a franchised unit opens for business).



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt"><I>Timeshare Exchange. </I>As a provider of timeshare vacation exchange services, the Company enters
into affiliation agreements with resort property owners/developers to allow owners of
timeshare interests to trade their interests with other subscribers. Timeshare exchange
revenue principally consists of exchange fees and subscription revenue. Exchange fees are
recognized as revenue when the exchange request has been confirmed to the subscribing members.
Subscription revenue represents the fees from subscribing members. The Company records
subscription revenue as deferred income on its Consolidated Balance Sheets and recognizes it
on a straight-line basis over the subscription period during which delivery of publications
and other services are provided to the subscribing members. Marketing and advertising costs
are generally expensed as incurred; commissions paid on subscriptions are deferred and
amortized over the life of the subscription.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt"><I>Timeshare Sales and Marketing. </I>The Company sells and markets vacation ownership interests and
provides consumer financing to individuals purchasing vacation ownership interests. Vacation
ownership interests sold by the Company consist of either undivided fee simple interests or
point-based vacation credits. The Company recognizes sales of vacation ownership interests on
a full accrual basis for fully constructed inventory after a binding sales contract has been
executed, a 10% minimum down payment has been received, the statutory rescission period has
expired and receivables are deemed collectible. During periods of construction, subsequent to
the preliminary construction phase and upon assurance that the property will not revert to a
rental property, the Company recognizes revenues using the percentage-of-completion method of
accounting. For percentage-of-completion accounting, the preliminary stage is deemed to be
complete when the engineering and design work is complete, the construction contracts have
been executed, the site has been cleared, prepared and excavated and the building foundation
is complete. The completion percentage is determined by the proportion of real estate
inventory and certain sales and marketing costs incurred to total estimated costs. These
estimated costs are based upon historical experience and the related contractual terms. The
remaining revenue and related costs of sales, including commissions and direct expenses, are
deferred and recognized as the remaining costs are incurred. Until a contract for sale
qualifies for revenue recognition, all payments received are accounted for as deposits.
Commissions and other direct costs related to the sale are deferred until the sale is
recorded. If a contract is cancelled before qualifying as a sale, non-recoverable expenses and
deposits forfeited are charged and credited to the current period, respectively.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt"><I>Vacation Rental. </I>The Company earns commissions from the rental of holiday accommodations to
consumers on behalf of third party property owners. Commission revenue is generally recognized
in the period that the rental reservation is made, net of expected cancellations. The Company
also earns rental fees in connection with properties it owns or leases under capital leases.
Rental revenue is recognized when the Company substantially fulfills its obligations under the
related rental agreements.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt"><B><I>Travel Distribution Services</I></B>



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">The Company provides global distribution and computer reservation services, offers retail
consumer and corporate travel agency services through its online travel agencies and provides
travel marketing information to airline, car rental and hotel clients. The Company provides
scheduling and ticketing services and fare and other information to travel agencies, Internet
travel sites, corporations and individuals to assist them with the placement of airline, car
rental and hotel reservations. Such services are provided through the use of a computerized
reservation system. The Company also provides airline, car rental, hotel and other travel
reservation and fulfillment services to members of its timeshare exchange programs and members
of certain Trilegiant programs. Further, the Company provides hotels, car rental businesses
and tour/leisure travel operators, including Internet travel companies, with access to

time of pick-up for car bookings and at the time of check-out for hotel bookings. Revenues
generated from leased equipment charges to system subscribers are recognized over the term of
the contract at contracted rates. Revenues generated from the Company&#146;s online travel agencies
are recorded when the reservation is made and secured with a credit card, net of estimated
future cancellations for air revenues, and when travel is completed for non-air bookings
(either on receipt of commissions or on notification of entitlement).

<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt"><I>Vehicle Rental Business. </I>The Company operates and franchises the Avis and Budget rental
systems, providing vehicle rentals to business and leisure travelers. Revenue from vehicle
rentals is recognized over the period the vehicle is rented. Franchise revenue principally
consists of royalties, as well as marketing fees, received from the Company&#146;s franchisees in
conjunction with vehicle rental transactions. Royalty and marketing fees are accrued as the
underlying franchisee revenue is earned (generally over the rental period of a vehicle).



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt"><I>Leased Vehicle Business. </I>The Company provides fleet management services to corporate clients
and government agencies. These services include management and leasing of vehicles and other
fee-based services for clients&#146; vehicle fleets. The Company leases vehicles primarily to
corporate fleet users under open-end operating and direct financing lease arrangements where
the customer bears substantially all of the vehicle&#146;s residual value risk. In limited
circumstances, the Company leases vehicles under closed-end leases where the Company bears all
of the vehicle&#146;s residual value risk. The lease term under the open-end lease agreement
provides for a minimum lease term of twelve months and after the minimum term, the lease may
be continued at the lessee&#146;s election for successive monthly renewals. For operating leases,
lease revenues, which contain a depreciation component, an interest component and a management
fee component, are recognized based on the lease term of the vehicle, which encompasses the
minimum lease term and the month-to-month renewals. For direct financing leases, lease revenue
contains an interest component, which is recognized using an interest method based on the
lease term of the vehicle, which encompasses the minimum lease term and the month-to-month
renewals. Amounts charged to the lessees for interest are determined in accordance with the
pricing supplement to the respective lease agreement and are generally calculated on a
floating rate basis and can vary month to month in accordance with changes in the floating
rate index. Amounts charged to lessees for interest may also be based on a fixed rate that
would remain constant for the life of the lease. Amounts charged to the lessees for
depreciation are typically based on the straight-line depreciation of the vehicle over its
expected lease term. Management fees are recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of
the lease. Revenue for other services is recognized when such services are provided to the
lessee.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">The Company also sells certain of its leases to a syndicate of third party banks and
individual financial institutions. When the Company sells such portfolios, it is selling the
underlying vehicles and assigning any rights to the leases, including future leasing revenues,
to the syndicating institution. Upon transfer of title and assignment of rights associated
with the lease, the Company records the proceeds from the sale as revenue and recognizes an
expense for the unamortized cost of the vehicles sold. Under certain syndication agreements,
the Company retains some residual risk in connection with the fair value of the vehicle at
lease termination. During 2004, the Company recorded $150&nbsp;million of lease syndication
revenue within its Consolidated Statement of Income.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt"><I>Fuel Card Business. </I>The Company provides payment processing and information management
services to the vehicle fleet industry. The Company earns revenue by processing payments to
major oil companies, fuel retailers and vehicle maintenance providers on behalf of the
Company&#146;s customers and the customers of the Company&#146;s strategic relationships. The Company
enters into agreements with the major oil companies, fuel retailers and vehicle maintenance
providers for the acceptance of purchases of products and services by the customers serviced
by the Company, and the terms and conditions of the fees assessed by the Company for
processing these payments. The fee charged to the major oil company, fuel retailer or vehicle
maintenance provider is generally based upon a percentage of the amount purchased by the
customers serviced by the

payment to the major oil company, fuel retailer or vehicle maintenance provider or for the
amount purchased by the Company&#146;s customer or the customer of the Company&#146;s strategic
relationships and recorded as payment processing revenue at the time the transaction is
captured. Revenue for other services is generally recognized as the Company fulfills its
contractual service obligations.

<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt"><I>Loyalty/Insurance Marketing. </I>The Company markets and administers insurance products,
primarily accidental death and dismemberment insurance, and provides services such as checking
account enhancement packages, various financial products and discount programs, to financial
institutions, which, in turn, provide these services to their customers. Commissions received
from the sale of checking account enhancement packages, various financial products and
discount programs are recognized as revenue ratably over the period during which services are
provided. Commission revenues received from the carrier for accidental death and dismemberment
insurance and other insurance products are received and recognized during the underlying
policy period. For the accidental death and dismemberment insurance product, the Company also
receives a share of the excess of premiums paid to insurance carriers less claims experience
to date, claims incurred but not reported, reinsurance costs and carrier administrative fees.
The Company&#146;s share of this excess is accrued based on claims experience to date, including an
estimate of claims incurred but not reported.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt"><I>Individual Membership. </I>The Company provides consumers a variety of membership programs
offering discounted products and services in areas such as retail shopping, auto, dining,
travel, home improvement and credit information. The Company generally recognizes membership
revenue when associated membership fees are no longer subject to refund, or ratably over the
membership period for membership fees that are subject to a pro-rata refund. Revenues
generated from monthly memberships are recognized in the month the membership fees are earned.

<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">Vehicles are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. The initial cost of the vehicles
is net of incentives and allowances from vehicle manufacturers.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt"><I>Rental Vehicles. </I>The Company acquires the majority of its rental vehicles pursuant to
repurchase programs established by automobile manufacturers. Under these programs, the
manufacturers agree to repurchase vehicles at a specified price and date, subject to certain
eligibility criteria (such as car condition and mileage requirements). These contractual
guaranteed residual values are intended to equal the net book value of the vehicles on the
date of return to the manufacturers, thereby minimizing any gain or loss on the sale of the
vehicles. The Company records depreciation expense for any expected deficiency in the
contracted guaranteed residual values due to excessive wear or damages. At December&nbsp;31,
2004, the Company estimates that the difference between the contracted guaranteed residual
value and the actual amount to be received from the manufacturers is $61&nbsp;million. Such
amount will be depreciated in a manner consistent with the depreciation charges to be taken
over the anticipated remaining holding period.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">Rental vehicles are depreciated on a straight-line basis giving consideration to the
contractual guaranteed residual values and the number of months between the original purchased
date of the vehicle and the expected sale date of the vehicle back to the manufacturers. For
2004, 2003 and 2002, rental vehicles were depreciated at rates ranging from 7% to 26%&nbsp;per
annum with the objective of minimizing any gain or loss on the sale of the vehicles. Upon
disposal of the vehicles, depreciation expense is adjusted for any difference between the net
proceeds from the sale and the remaining book value. As market conditions change, the Company
adjusts its depreciation rates prospectively, over the remaining holding period, to reflect
these changes in market conditions.

<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">The Company&#146;s provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability method,
under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated based upon the temporary
differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities
using currently enacted tax rates. The Company&#146;s deferred tax assets are recorded net of a
valuation allowance when, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than
not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in
future periods. Decreases to the valuation allowance are recorded concurrently as reductions
to the Company&#146;s provision for income taxes while increases to the valuation allowance result
in additional provision. However, if the valuation allowance is adjusted in connection with an
acquisition, such adjustment is recorded concurrently through goodwill rather than the
provision for income taxes. The realization of the Company&#146;s deferred tax assets, net of the
valuation allowance, is primarily dependent on estimated future taxable income. A change in
the Company&#146;s estimate of future taxable income may require an addition or reduction to the
valuation allowance.

securitizations of residential mortgage loans, with the exception of mortgage servicing rights
(the accounting for which is described above under &#147;Revenue Recognition&#151;Mortgage&#148;), are
classified as available-for-sale mortgage-backed securities and recorded as a component of
other assets under management and mortgage programs within the Company&#146;s Consolidated Balance
Sheets. The retained interests from the Company&#146;s securitizations of timeshare receivables are
classified as trading securities and recorded within timeshare-related assets under management
and mortgage programs on the Company&#146;s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Gains or losses relating
to the assets securitized are allocated between such assets and the retained interests based
on their relative fair values on the date of sale. The Company estimates fair value of
retained interests based upon the present value of expected future cash flows, which is
subject to the prepayment risks, expected credit losses and interest rate risks of the sold
financial assets. See Note&nbsp;17&#151;Securitizations for more information regarding these

<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">other-than-temporary impairment of its investment in
Homestore, and its proportionate share of Homestore&#146;s losses, the Company&#146;s investment in
Homestore was recorded at zero at December&nbsp;31, 2002 and 2001.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">The Company&#146;s ability to influence Homestore was predicated upon its ownership percentage of
Homestore common stock, previous representation by Company management on the board of
directors of Homestore and the existence of contractual agreements that were entered into as
part of the sale of the Company&#146;s former Internet real estate portal, move.com. With respect
to the Company&#146;s ability to influence Homestore due to the existence of the contractual
agreements, the Company&#146;s initial relationship originated on June&nbsp;30, 1998 when it and
RealSelect, the predecessor to Homestore, entered into a four year listing license agreement,
whereby the Company, among other things, licensed to RealSelect the exclusive rights to
display the listings of the CENTURY&nbsp;21, ERA and Coldwell Banker brands on the realtor.com
website. The exclusive listing license was extended an additional 40&nbsp;years as part of the
October&nbsp;26, 2000 Master Operating Agreement entered into between the Company and
Homestore. The Company has never had a direct or indirect controlling financial interest in
Homestore.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">The Company&#146;s representative on Homestore&#146;s board of directors resigned his seat and, in
August&nbsp;2003, the Company modified and/or terminated many of the contractual agreements it
maintained with Homestore. Specifically, Homestore no longer has the exclusive rights to
display the listings of the company&#146;s CENTURY&nbsp;21, ERA and Coldwell Banker brands on its
realtor.com website. The Company&#146;s ownership interest on the date that these contractual
agreements were modified and/or terminated was approximately 15.2%. Due to the above-mentioned
changes, in 2003, the Company changed the method by which it accounts for this investment from
the equity method to an available-for-sale marketable security since it no longer had the
ability to influence Homestore. The carrying value of the investment on the date of this
change was zero due to the impairment previously discussed. During 2004 and 2003, the Company
recorded unrealized losses of $19&nbsp;million and unrealized gains of $81&nbsp;million,
respectively, in connection with changes in the stock price of Homestore, which is recorded
within other comprehensive income on the Company&#146;s Consolidated Balance Sheet at December&nbsp;31,
2004 and December&nbsp;31, 2003. The Company sold 9.8&nbsp;million shares of Homestore
during 2004 and recognized gains of $40&nbsp;million within net revenues on its Consolidated
Statement of Income. During 2003, the Company sold one million shares of Homestore and
recognized gains of $4&nbsp;million within net revenues on its Consolidated Statement of Income.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">As of December&nbsp;31, 2004, the Company owned approximately 7.3&nbsp;million shares of
Homestore stock, which approximated a 5% ownership interest.

accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation, recorded as a component of
non-program related depreciation and amortization on the Consolidated Statements of Income, is
computed utilizing the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related
assets. Amortization of leasehold improvements, also recorded as a component of non-program
related depreciation and amortization, is computed utilizing the straight-line method over the
estimated benefit period of the related assets or the lease term, if shorter. Useful lives are
generally 30&nbsp;years for buildings, from 3 to 20&nbsp;years for leasehold improvements, from
3 to 8&nbsp;years for capitalized software and from 3 to 7&nbsp;years for furniture, fixtures
and equipment.

is required to assess goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually,
or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. The Company
assesses goodwill for such impairment by comparing the carrying value of its reporting units
to their fair values. The Company&#146;s reporting units are one level below the Company&#146;s
reportable operating segments, with the exception of the Mortgage Services and Travel
Distribution Services segments. The Company&#146;s Hospitality Services segment has four reporting

flows and incorporates assumptions that it believes marketplace participants would utilize.
When available and as appropriate, the Company uses comparative market multiples and other
factors to corroborate the discounted cash flow results. Indefinite-lived intangible assets
are tested for impairment and written down to fair value, as required by SFAS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;142.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">The Company performed its initial goodwill impairment assessment on January&nbsp;1, 2002 in
connection with the adoption of SFAS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;142 and determined that the carrying amounts
of its reporting units did not exceed their respective fair values. Accordingly, the initial
implementation of this standard on January&nbsp;1, 2002 did not impact the Company&#146;s results of
operations during 2002. Subsequent to the initial assessment, the Company performed its review
annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicated impairment may have occurred, and
during 2004, 2003 and 2002, determined that no such impairment had occurred.

<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">As required by SFAS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;144, if circumstances indicate an impairment may have
occurred, the Company evaluates the recoverability of its long-lived assets including
amortizing intangible assets, by comparing the respective carrying values of the assets to the
current and expected future cash flows, on an undiscounted basis, to be generated from such
assets. Property and equipment is evaluated separately within each business.

<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">The Consolidated Balance Sheets include approximately $411&nbsp;million and $380&nbsp;million of
liabilities with respect to self-insured public liability and property damage as of December&nbsp;31,
2004 and 2003, respectively. The current portion of such amounts is included within
accounts payable and other current liabilities and the non-current portion is included in
other non-current liabilities. The Company estimates the required liability of such claims on
an undiscounted basis utilizing an actuarial method that is based upon various assumptions
which include, but are not limited to, the Company&#146;s historical loss experience and projected
loss development factors. The required liability is also subject to adjustment in the future
based upon the changes in claims experience, including changes in the number of incidents
(frequency)&nbsp;and change in the ultimate cost per incident (severity).



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">In addition, at December&nbsp;31, 2004 and 2003, the Consolidated Balance Sheets include
liabilities of approximately $200&nbsp;million and $190&nbsp;million, respectively, relating to
health and welfare, workers&#146; compensation and other benefits the Company provides to its
employees. The Company estimates the liability required for such benefits based on actual
claims outstanding and the estimated cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date.
These amounts are included within accounts payable and other current liabilities on the
Company&#146;s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

exceptions. SFAS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;153 amends APB Opinion No.&nbsp;29 by eliminating the exception
that required nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets be recorded on a carryover
basis. The provisions of SFAS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;153 are effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges
occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June&nbsp;15, 2005. The Company will adopt the
provisions of SFAS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;153, as required.

<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt"><B><I>Timeshare Transactions. </I></B>In December&nbsp;2004, the FASB issued SFAS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;152, &#147;Accounting
for Real Estate Time-Sharing Transactions,&#148; in connection with the previous issuance of the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants&#146; Statement of Position No.&nbsp;04-2,
&#147;Accounting for Real Estate Time-Sharing Transactions&#148; (&#147;SOP&nbsp;04-2&#148;). Based on the guidance
provided by SOP&nbsp;04-2, SFAS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;152 amends SFAS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;66, &#147;Accounting for
Sales of Real Estate,&#148; and SFAS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;67, &#147;Accounting for Costs and Initial Rental
Operations of Real Estate Projects.&#148; SOP&nbsp;04-2, which was also issued in December&nbsp;2004, is
effective for fiscal years beginning after June&nbsp;15, 2005 and modifies several current
accounting practices. SOP&nbsp;04-2 impacts the revenue recognition of certain sales
transactions by clarifying down payment requirements for these types of transactions in
addition to reclassifying net rental proceeds associated with developer owned inventory, as a
reduction of cost of sales. SOP&nbsp;04-2 also clarifies how incentives offered to buyers of
timeshare credits should be considered when determining when revenue is recognizable, as well
as the expenses that can be considered in a company&#146;s deferred revenue calculation.
Additionally, SOP 04-2 requires that bad debt expense be recognized as a reduction to revenue,
rather than as an operating expense, which is the Company&#146;s current practice. The Company
expects to adopt the provisions of SOP 04-2 effective January&nbsp;1, 2006 as a cumulative
effect of a change in accounting principle and is currently assessing the impact of such
adoption. While the Company anticipates a negative adjustment to earnings, it is evaluating
actions that will mitigate such impact. There is no expected impact to cash flow from the
adoption.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt"><B><I>Stock-Based Compensation. </I></B>In December&nbsp;2004, the FASB issued SFAS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;123R, &#147;Share
Based Payment,&#148; which eliminates the alternative to measure stock-based compensation awards
using the intrinsic value approach permitted by APB No.&nbsp;25 and by SFAS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;123.
The Company is required to adopt the provisions of SFAS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;123R on July&nbsp;1, 2005.
As previously discussed, on January&nbsp;1, 2003, the Company adopted the fair value method of
accounting for stock-based compensation provisions of SFAS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;123 and the
transitional provisions of SFAS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;148. As a result, the Company has been recording
stock-based compensation expense since January&nbsp;1, 2003 for employee stock awards that were
granted or modified subsequent to December&nbsp;31, 2002. The Company&#146;s current practice with
respect to forfeitures is to recognize the related benefit upon forfeiture of the award. Upon
adoption of SFAS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;123R, the Company will be required to recognize compensation
expense net of estimated forfeitures upon the issuance of the award. The Company expects to
record a cumulative effect of accounting change to reflect this change in methodology.
Although the Company has not yet completed its assessment of adopting SFAS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;123R,
it does not believe that such adoption will significantly affect its earnings, financial
position or cash flows.

fair values, which may be significant, will be recorded by the Company as further adjustments

operations of all its acquired businesses and expects to incur costs relating to such
integrations. These costs may result from integrating operating systems, relocating employees,
closing facilities, reducing duplicative efforts and exiting and consolidating other
activities. These costs will be recorded on the Company&#146;s Consolidated Balance Sheets as
adjustments to the purchase price or on the Company&#146;s Consolidated Statements of Income as
expenses, as appropriate.

revision upon receipt of final analyses and information. The Company continues to gather
information and work with its third party experts concerning the valuation of its assets
acquired and liabilities assumed (including its identified intangible assets and their
associated lives).



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt"><I>Trilegiant Loyalty Solutions. </I>On January&nbsp;30, 2004, the Company acquired Trilegiant Loyalty
Solutions, Inc. (&#147;TLS&#148;), a wholly-owned subsidiary of TRL&nbsp;Group, for approximately $20&nbsp;million
in cash. TLS offers wholesale loyalty enhancement services primarily to credit card
issuers. The Company has been consolidating the results of TLS (as a component of TRL Group)
since July&nbsp;1, 2003 pursuant to FIN&nbsp;46. This acquisition resulted in goodwill of $7&nbsp;million,
none of which is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Such goodwill was
assigned to the Company&#146;s Marketing Services segment, with the balance assigned to
identifiable intangible assets having finite lives. Management believes that this acquisition
enables the Company to build long-term, measurable customer loyalty through the development of
value-added programs.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt"><I>Sotheby&#146;s International Realty. </I>On February&nbsp;17, 2004, the Company acquired the domestic
residential real estate brokerage operations of Sotheby&#146;s International Realty and obtained
the rights to create a Sotheby&#146;s International Realty franchise system pursuant to an
agreement to license the Sotheby&#146;s International Realty brand in exchange for a license fee to
Sotheby&#146;s Holdings, Inc., the former parent of Sotheby&#146;s International Realty. Such license
agreement has a 50-year initial term and a 50-year renewal option. The total cash purchase
price for these transactions was approximately $100&nbsp;million. These transactions resulted
in goodwill (based on the preliminary allocation of the purchase price) of $51&nbsp;million,
all of which is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Such goodwill was assigned to the
Company&#146;s Real Estate Franchise and Operations segment. Management believes that this
acquisition enhances the Company&#146;s role in the market place as a premier real estate brokerage
firm and increases exposure to high net worth families throughout the United States.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt"><I>First Fleet Corporation. </I>On February&nbsp;27, 2004, the Company acquired First Fleet
Corporation (&#147;First Fleet&#148;), a national provider of fleet management services to companies
that maintain private truck fleets, for approximately $26&nbsp;million, including $4&nbsp;million
of contingent consideration payable in first quarter 2005 and net of cash acquired of
$10&nbsp;million. This acquisition resulted in goodwill (based on the preliminary allocation of
the purchase price) of $26&nbsp;million, none of which is expected to be deductible for tax
purposes. Such goodwill was assigned to the Company&#146;s Vehicle Services segment. Management
believes this acquisition enhances the Company&#146;s position as a leading provider of leasing and
services to truck fleets.

content throughout Europe and the Asia Pacific region, for approximately $88&nbsp;million,
including $38&nbsp;million of contingent consideration payable in first quarter 2005 and net of

preliminary allocation of the purchase price) of $87&nbsp;million, none of which is expected to

Distribution Services segment. Management believes that this acquisition enhances the
Company&#146;s growing global travel portfolio and accelerates the planned international expansion
of its online travel offerings.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt"><I>Landal GreenParks. </I>On May&nbsp;5, 2004, the Company acquired Landal GreenParks (&#147;Landal&#148;), a
Dutch vacation rental company that specializes in the rental of privately owned vacation homes
located in European holiday parks, for approximately $81&nbsp;million in cash, net of cash
acquired of $22&nbsp;million. As part of this acquisition, the Company also assumed
approximately $78&nbsp;million of debt. This acquisition resulted in goodwill of $45&nbsp;million
(based on the preliminary allocation of the purchase price as of December&nbsp;31,
2004), of which approximately $10&nbsp;million is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
Management believes that this acquisition offers the Company both increased access to the
important Dutch and German consumer markets as well as rental properties in high demand
locations.

through its wholly-owned subsidiary, NRT Incorporated (&#147;NRT&#148;), for approximately $115&nbsp;million
in cash. The acquisition of real estate brokerages by NRT is a core part of its growth
strategy. In addition, the Company acquired 35 other individually non-significant businesses,
primarily car rental licensees, during 2004 for aggregate consideration of approximately $179&nbsp;million
in cash. The goodwill resulting from the preliminary allocations of the purchase
prices of these acquisitions aggregated $185&nbsp;million and was allocated as follows:

Fairfield.

Network, Inc. (&#147;Trip Network&#148;) through the conversion of its preferred stock investment and,
on April&nbsp;1, 2003, the Company acquired all of the remaining common stock for $4&nbsp;million
in cash. To determine the goodwill to be recorded in connection with this acquisition,
the Company&#146;s basis in Trip Network was adjusted for $2&nbsp;million of transaction-related

brokerages by NRT is a core part of its growth strategy. The Company also acquired 10 other

<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">These acquisitions were not significant to the Company&#146;s results of operations, financial
position or cash flows on a pro forma basis individually or in the aggregate.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt"><FONT style="font-variant: SMALL-CAPS"><B>2002 Acquisitions</B></FONT>



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt"><I>NRT Incorporated. </I>On April&nbsp;17, 2002, the Company acquired all of the outstanding common
stock of NRT, the largest residential real estate brokerage firm in the United States, for $230&nbsp;million.
The acquisition consideration was funded through an exchange of 11.5&nbsp;million
shares of CD common stock then-valued at $216&nbsp;million, which included approximately 1.5&nbsp;million
shares of CD common stock then-valued at $30&nbsp;million in exchange for existing
NRT options. As part of the acquisition, the Company also assumed approximately $320&nbsp;million
of NRT debt, which was subsequently repaid. Prior to the acquisition, NRT operated as
a joint venture between the Company and Apollo Management, L.P. that acquired independent real
estate brokerages, converted them to one of the Company&#146;s real estate brands and operated them
under the brand pursuant to two 50-year franchise agreements with the Company. Management
believes that NRT as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company will be a more efficient
acquisition vehicle and achieve greater financial and operational synergies. The acquisition
of NRT resulted in goodwill of approximately $1.6&nbsp;billion, of which $160&nbsp;million is
expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Such goodwill was assigned to the Company&#146;s Real
Estate Franchise and Operations segment.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt"><I>Trendwest Resorts, Inc. </I>On April&nbsp;30, 2002, the Company acquired approximately 90% of the
outstanding common stock of Trendwest Resorts, Inc. (&#147;Trendwest&#148;) for $849&nbsp;million,
approximately $804&nbsp;million of which was in CD common stock (approximately 42.6&nbsp;million
shares). As part of the acquisition, the Company assumed $89&nbsp;million of Trendwest debt, of
which $78&nbsp;million was subsequently repaid. The Company purchased the remaining 10% of the
outstanding Trendwest shares in a merger on June&nbsp;3, 2002 for approximately 4.8&nbsp;million
shares of CD common stock aggregating $87&nbsp;million. The minority interest recorded in
connection with Trendwest&#146;s results of operations between April&nbsp;30, 2002 and June&nbsp;3,
2002 was not material. Trendwest markets, sells and finances vacation ownership interests.
Management believes that this acquisition will provide the Company with significant geographic
diversification and global presence in the timeshare industry. The acquisition of Trendwest
resulted in goodwill of $687&nbsp;million, none of which is expected to be deductible for tax
purposes. Such goodwill was assigned to the Company&#146;s Hospitality Services segment.

<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt"><I>Budget Group, Inc. </I>On November&nbsp;22, 2002, the Company acquired substantially all of the
domestic assets of the vehicle rental business of Budget Group, Inc. (&#147;Budget&#148;), as well as
selected international operations, for approximately $109&nbsp;million in cash plus $44&nbsp;million
of transaction costs and expenses. As part of the acquisition, the Company also
assumed approximately $2.4&nbsp;billion of Budget&#146;s asset-backed vehicle related debt, which
the Company subsequently repaid. Management believes that Budget is a complementary fit with
its other leisure services through its hotel, timeshare and travel distribution companies. The
acquisition of Budget resulted in goodwill of $439&nbsp;million, of which approximately $355&nbsp;million
is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Such goodwill was assigned to the
Company&#146;s Vehicle Services segment.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt"><I>Other. </I>Subsequent to the Company&#146;s acquisition of NRT on April&nbsp;17, 2002, NRT acquired 20
other residential real estate brokerage operations for approximately $399&nbsp;million,
including Arvida Realty Services for approximately $160&nbsp;million and The DeWolfe Companies
for approximately $146&nbsp;million. The acquisition of real estate brokerages by NRT is a core
part of its growth strategy. The Company also acquired 16 other non-significant businesses
during 2002 for aggregate consideration of approximately $573&nbsp;million in cash, including
(i)&nbsp;Equivest Finance, Inc., a timeshare developer, for approximately $98&nbsp;million; (ii)&nbsp;three
European distribution partners of our Galileo subsidiary for approximately $125&nbsp;million;
(iii)&nbsp;Novasol AS, a marketer of privately owned vacation properties in Europe,
for approximately $66&nbsp;million and (iv)&nbsp;11 other businesses for approximately $247&nbsp;million
primarily within the Hospitality and Travel Distribution segments. None of these
acquisitions were significant to the Company&#146;s results of operations or financial position
individually or in the aggregate.

<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">The principal cost reduction opportunity resulting from these exit activities is the
relocation of the corporate headquarters of Budget. In connection with this initiative, the
Company has relocated selected Budget employees, terminated other Budget employees and
abandoned certain facilities primarily related to reservation processing and administrative
functions. As a result, the Company incurred severance and other personnel costs related to
the termination or relocation of employees, as well as facility-related costs primarily
representing future lease payments for abandoned facilities. The adjustments recorded during
2003 represent the finalization of estimates made at the time of acquisition. The Company
formally communicated the termination of employment to approximately 1,800 employees,
representing a wide range of employee groups, and as of December&nbsp;31, 2004, the Company had
terminated substantially all of these employees. The Company anticipates that the majority of
the remaining facility related costs will be paid through 2007.

<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt"><I>Amortization of Pendings and Listings. </I>During 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company amortized $16&nbsp;million,
$20&nbsp;million and $256&nbsp;million of its contractual pendings and listings
intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisitions of NRT, Trendwest and other
real estate brokerages. Of the 2003 and 2002 amounts, approximately $17&nbsp;million and $235&nbsp;million,
respectively, related to the acquisitions of NRT and its subsequent acquisitions
of real estate brokerage businesses, while $3&nbsp;million and $21&nbsp;million, respectively,
related to the acquisition of Trendwest. The Company segregated the pendings and listings
amortization to enhance the comparability of its results of operations since these intangible
assets are amortized over a short period of time (generally four to five months).



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt"><I>Other. </I>During 2004, 2003, and 2002, the Company incurred other acquisition and integration
related costs of $5&nbsp;million, $34&nbsp;million and $29&nbsp;million, respectively. The 2004
amount is comprised of $17&nbsp;million of costs primarily associated with the integration of
Budget&#146;s information technology systems with the Company&#146;s platform, the integration of Orbitz
and the integration of real estate brokerages acquired by NRT, partially offset by the
reversal of a previously established $12&nbsp;million accrual, which resulted from the
termination of a lease on more favorable terms than originally anticipated. The 2003 amount
primarily related to the integration of Budget&#146;s information technology systems into the
Company&#146;s platform and revisions to the Company&#146;s original estimate of costs to exit a
facility in connection with the outsourcing of its data operations. The 2002 amount primarily
related to the acquisition and integration of NRT.

<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">The MSR asset is subject to substantial interest rate risk as the mortgage notes underlying
the asset permit the borrowers to prepay the loans. Therefore, the value of the MSR asset
tends to diminish in periods of declining interest rates (as prepayments increase) and
increase in periods of rising interest rates (as prepayments decrease). The Company primarily
uses a combination of derivative instruments to offset expected changes in fair value of its
MSR asset that could affect reported earnings. Beginning in 2004, the Company designated the
full change in fair value of its MSR asset as the hedged risk and, as a result, discontinued
hedge accounting treatment until such time that the documentation required to support the
assessment of hedge effectiveness on a full fair value basis could be completed. During 2004,
all of the derivatives associated with the MSR asset were designated as freestanding
derivatives. The net activity in the Company&#146;s derivatives related to mortgage servicing

<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">The Company also receives marketing and reservation fees primarily from its lodging
franchisees and marketing fees from its real estate franchisees, which are calculated based on
a specified percentage of gross room revenues or based on a specified percentage of gross
closed commissions earned on the sale of real estate, subject to certain minimum and maximum
payments. Such fees totaled $212&nbsp;million, $206&nbsp;million and $202&nbsp;million during
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and were included within service fees and membership
revenues on the Consolidated Statements of Income. As provided for in the franchise agreements
and generally at the Company&#146;s discretion, all of these fees are to be expended for marketing
purposes and, in the case of lodging and car rental franchisees, the operation of a
centralized brand-specific reservation system for the respective franchisees. Such fees are
controlled by the Company until disbursement.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">In connection with ongoing fees the Company receives from its franchisees pursuant to the
franchise agreements, the Company is required to provide certain services, such as training,
marketing and the operation of reservation systems.

Canadian third parties. The Company repurchases the leased vehicles and then leases such
vehicles under direct financing leases to the Canadian third parties. The Canadian third
parties retain the lease rights and prepay all the lease payments except for an agreed upon
amount, which is typically 7.0% of the total lease payments. The total subordinated interest
under these leasing arrangements, as recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December&nbsp;31,
2004 and 2003, was $29&nbsp;million and $27&nbsp;million, respectively. The Company

<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">The Company&#146;s income tax returns are periodically examined by various tax authorities. The
Company is currently under audit by several tax authorities, including the Internal Revenue
Service (&#147;IRS&#148;). In connection with these and future examinations, certain tax authorities,
including the IRS, may raise issues and impose additional assessments. The Company regularly
evaluates the likelihood of additional assessments resulting from these examinations and
establishes reserves, through the provision for income taxes, for potential amounts that may
result therefrom. Once established, reserves are adjusted as information becomes available or
when an event requiring a change to the reserve occurs. The resolution of tax matters could
have a material impact on the Company&#146;s effective tax rate and results of operations.

were redeemed throughout 2004, 2003 and 2002 and, as of December&nbsp;31, 2004, there were no
outstanding contingently convertible debt securities.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">During 2004, the Company converted the remaining zero coupon senior convertible contingent
notes, approximating $430&nbsp;million, into approximately 22&nbsp;million shares of Cendant
common stock (see Note&nbsp;19&#151;Stockholders&#146; Equity for more detailed information).
Additionally, the Company redeemed the remaining zero coupon convertible debentures,
approximating $7&nbsp;million, and the remaining 3<SUP style="font-size: 80%; vertical-align: top;">7</SUP>/<SUB style="font-size: 80%; vertical-align: bottom;">8</SUB>%&nbsp;convertible senior debentures,
approximating $804&nbsp;million, for $811&nbsp;million in cash. During 2003, the Company
redeemed $850&nbsp;million of its zero coupon convertible debentures and $396&nbsp;million of
its 3<SUP style="font-size: 80%; vertical-align: top;">7</SUP>/<SUB style="font-size: 80%; vertical-align: bottom;">8</SUB>%&nbsp;convertible senior debentures for approximately $1.2&nbsp;billion in cash. In
connection with such redemptions, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of approximately $31&nbsp;million.
During 2002, the Company redeemed $821&nbsp;million in accreted value of its zero
coupon senior convertible contingent notes, with a carrying value of $517&nbsp;million, and $143&nbsp;million
of its zero coupon convertible debentures for $689&nbsp;million in cash. In
connection with such redemptions, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $41&nbsp;million,
which included a write-off of $12&nbsp;million related to deferred financing costs.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">Additionally, during 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company recorded $1&nbsp;million, $10&nbsp;million
and $17&nbsp;million, respectively, of amortization relating to the zero coupon senior
convertible contingent notes, which were issued at a discount to par reflecting a 2.5% annual
non-cash interest rate. Such amounts are included within non-program interest expense on the
Consolidated Statements of Income.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">The Company concluded that it was not required to separately account for the conversion
features of its contingently convertible securities as embedded derivatives. However, the 3<SUP style="font-size: 80%; vertical-align: top;">7</SUP>/<SUB style="font-size: 80%; vertical-align: bottom;">8</SUB>%&nbsp;convertible senior debentures also contained an upward interest adjustment, which was

<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">At December&nbsp;31, 2003, the Company had 17&nbsp;million Upper DECS outstanding. The Upper
DECS were a hybrid instrument consisting of both equity linked and debt securities. Each Upper
DECS consisted of both a senior note and a forward contract to purchase shares of CD common
stock. The senior note was owned by the holder but pledged to the Company as collateral for
the forward purchase contracts. Holders could only sell the senior note if they pledged a
treasury security or cash to replace the senior note as collateral. The senior note component
of the Upper DECS initially provided interest at an annual rate of 6.75% but was successfully
remarketed on May&nbsp;10, 2004, as discussed above. The Company did not receive any proceeds
from the remarketing. Rather, the proceeds generated from the remarketing were utilized to
purchase a portfolio of U.S.&nbsp;Treasury securities, which was pledged to the Company as
collateral for the forward purchase contracts that also formed a part of the Upper DECS and
that required holders of the Upper DECS to purchase shares of Cendant common stock on August&nbsp;17,
2004. The forward purchase contracts settled on August&nbsp;17, 2004, pursuant to the
terms of such contracts, and the Company issued 38&nbsp;million shares of common stock in
exchange for $863&nbsp;million in cash (See Note&nbsp;19&#151;Stockholders&#146; Equity).

<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt"><I>Cendant Rental Car Funding. </I>Cendant Rental Car Funding was established by the Company as a
bankruptcy remote special purpose limited liability company that issues private placement
notes and uses the proceeds from such issuances to make loans to a wholly-owned subsidiary of
the Company, AESOP Leasing LP (&#147;AESOP Leasing&#148;) on a continuing basis. AESOP Leasing is
required to use these proceeds to acquire or finance the acquisition of vehicles used in the
Company&#146;s rental car operations. Prior to December&nbsp;31, 2003, both Cendant Rental Car
Funding and AESOP Leasing were consolidated by the Company and, as such, the intercompany
transactions between these two entities were eliminated causing only the third-party debt
issued by Cendant Rental Car Funding and the vehicles purchased by AESOP Leasing to be
presented within the Company&#146;s Consolidated Financial Statements. However, in connection with
the adoption of FIN&nbsp;46R, the Company determined that it was not the primary beneficiary of
Cendant Rental Car Funding. Accordingly, the Company deconsolidated Cendant Rental Car Funding
on December&nbsp;31, 2003. As a result, AESOP Leasing&#146;s obligation to Cendant Rental Car
Funding is reflected as related party debt on the Company&#146;s Consolidated Balance Sheet as of
December&nbsp;31, 2004 and 2003. The Company also recorded an asset within vehicle-related, net

<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">Balance Sheet at December&nbsp;31, 2004 and 2003, which represented the equity issued by Cendant Rental Car Funding to
the Company. The vehicles purchased by AESOP Leasing remain on the Company&#146;s Consolidated
Balance Sheet as AESOP Leasing continues to be consolidated by the Company. Such vehicles and
related assets, which approximate $6.0&nbsp;billion, collateralize the debt issued by Cendant
Rental Car Funding and are not available to pay the obligations of the Company.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">The business activities of Cendant Rental Car Funding are limited primarily to issuing
indebtedness and using the proceeds thereof to make loans to AESOP Leasing for the purpose of
acquiring or financing the acquisition of vehicles to be leased to the Company&#146;s rental car
subsidiary and pledging its assets to secure the indebtedness. As the deconsolidation of
Cendant Rental Car Funding occurred on December&nbsp;31, 2003, the income statement and cash
flow activity of the Company are not impacted for 2003. Beginning on January&nbsp;1, 2004, the
results of operations and cash flows of Cendant Rental Car Funding are no longer reflected
within the Company&#146;s Consolidated Financial Statements.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">Borrowings under the Cendant Rental Car Funding program primarily represent floating rate term
notes with a weighted average interest rate of 3% for both 2004 and 2003.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt"><I>Other. </I>Borrowings under the Company&#146;s other vehicle rental programs represent amounts issued
under financing facilities that provide for the issuance of notes to support the acquisition
of vehicles used in the Company&#146;s international vehicle rental operations under its Avis and
Budget brands. The debt issued, which is collateralized by approximately $1.0&nbsp;billion of
underlying vehicles and related assets, primarily represents floating rate bank loans and
commercial paper for which the weighted average interest rate was 3% and 2% for 2004 and 2003,
respectively.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt"><B><I>Vehicle Management Program</I></B>



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">Borrowings under the Company&#146;s vehicle management program primarily represent amounts issued
under a domestic financing facility that provides for the issuance of variable rate term notes
and variable funding notes to unrelated third parties ($3.1&nbsp;billion and $2.7&nbsp;billion
at December&nbsp;31, 2004 and 2003, respectively) and the issuance of preferred membership
interests to an unconsolidated related party ($398&nbsp;million and $408&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31,
2004 and 2003, respectively). The variable rate notes and preferred membership
interests were issued to support the acquisition of vehicles used in the Company&#146;s fleet
leasing operations. The debt issued is collateralized by approximately $4.0&nbsp;billion of
leased vehicles and related assets, which are not available to pay the obligations of the
Company. The titles to all the vehicles collateralizing the debt issued under this program are
held in a bankruptcy remote trust and the Company acts as a servicer of all such vehicles. The
bankruptcy remote trust also acts as lessor under both operating and financing lease
agreements. The debt issued by this program primarily represents floating rate term notes for
which the weighted average interest rate was 3% and 2% for 2004 and 2003, respectively.

<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">Borrowings under the Company&#146;s mortgage program represent issuances by Bishop&#146;s Gate. Bishop&#146;s
Gate is a bankruptcy remote SPE that is utilized to warehouse mortgage loans originated by the
Company&#146;s mortgage business prior to their sale into the secondary market, which is customary
practice in the mortgage industry. The debt issued by Bishop&#146;s Gate is collateralized by
approximately $1.4&nbsp;billion of underlying mortgage loans and related assets. The mortgage
loans are serviced by the Company and recorded within mortgage loans held for sale on the
Company&#146;s Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December&nbsp;31, 2004 and 2003. Prior to the
adoption of FIN&nbsp;46, sales of mortgage loans to Bishop&#146;s Gate were treated as off-balance
sheet sales. The activities of Bishop&#146;s Gate are limited to (i)&nbsp;purchasing mortgage loans
from the Company&#146;s mortgage subsidiary, (ii)&nbsp;issuing commercial paper or other debt
instruments and/or borrowing under a liquidity agreement to effect such purchases, (iii)&nbsp;entering
into interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk and certain non-credit related
market risk on the purchased mortgage loans, (iv)&nbsp;selling and securitizing the acquired
mortgage loans to third parties and (v)&nbsp;engaging in certain related transactions. The
assets of Bishop&#146;s Gate are not available to pay the obligations of the Company. The debt
issued by Bishop&#146;s Gate primarily represents term notes for which the weighted average
interest rate was 2% for both 2004 and 2003.

entities&#148;) are bankruptcy remote SPEs that are utilized to securitize timeshare receivables
generated from financing the sale of vacation ownership interests by the Company&#146;s timeshare
businesses. The debt issued by the Timeshare Funding entities, which approximated $911&nbsp;million
and $774&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, is
collateralized by approximately $1.2&nbsp;billion of underlying timeshare receivables and
assets. The timeshare receivables are serviced by the Company and recorded within
timeshare-related assets under management and mortgage programs on the Company&#146;s Consolidated
Balance Sheet as of December&nbsp;31, 2004 and 2003. Prior to September&nbsp;1, 2003, sales of
timeshare receivables to the Timeshare Funding entities were treated as off-balance sheet
sales, as these entities were structured as bankruptcy remote QSPEs pursuant to SFAS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;140
&#147;Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of
Liabilities,&#148; and, therefore, excluded from the scope of FIN&nbsp;46. However, on September&nbsp;1,
2003, the underlying structures of the Timeshare Funding entities were amended in a manner
that resulted in these entities no longer meeting the criteria to qualify as QSPEs.
Consequently, the Company began consolidating the account balances and activities of the
Timeshare Funding entities on September&nbsp;1, 2003 pursuant to FIN&nbsp;46. The activities of
the Timeshare Funding entities are limited to (i)&nbsp;purchasing timeshare receivables from
the Company&#146;s timeshare subsidiaries, (ii)&nbsp;issuing debt securities and/or borrowing under
a conduit facility to effect such purchases and (iii)&nbsp;entering into derivatives to hedge
interest rate exposure. The assets of the Timeshare Funding entities are not available to pay
the obligations of the Company. The debt issued under the Timeshare Funding entities primarily
represents fixed rate and floating rate term notes for which the weighted average interest
rate was 3% for both 2004 and 2003.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt"><I>Other. </I>At December&nbsp;31, 2004, amounts outstanding under the Company&#146;s other timeshare
programs represent borrowings of $425&nbsp;million under an asset-linked facility and $137&nbsp;million
of bank debt. The asset-linked facility, which was entered into by the Company in
2004, has a three-year term, bears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 62.5&nbsp;basis points and
supports the creation of consumer notes receivable and the acquisition of timeshare properties
related to the Company&#146;s timeshare development business. These borrowings are collateralized
by approximately $1.3&nbsp;billion of timeshare-related assets, which are recorded within
assets under management and mortgage programs on the Company&#146;s Consolidated Balance Sheet. At
December&nbsp;31, 2003, borrowings under the Company&#146;s other timeshare program represent bank
debt. The weighted average interest rate on these borrowings was 3% for both 2004 and 2003.

LLC (&#147;Apple Ridge&#148;). Apple Ridge is a bankruptcy remote SPE that is utilized to securitize
relocation receivables generated from advancing funds to clients of the Company&#146;s relocation
business. The debt issued by Apple Ridge is collateralized by underlying relocation
receivables, which are serviced by the Company, and related assets aggregating $491&nbsp;million
at December&nbsp;31, 2004. These relocation receivables and related assets are recorded
within assets under management and mortgage programs on the Company&#146;s Consolidated Balance
Sheet as of December&nbsp;31, 2004 and 2003. Prior to November&nbsp;26, 2003, sales of
relocation receivables to Apple Ridge were treated as off-balance sheet sales, as this entity

However, on November&nbsp;26, 2003, the underlying structure of Apple Ridge was amended in

SFAS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;140. Consequently, the Company began consolidating the account balances and

consolidation, the Company recognized gains upon the sale of relocation receivables to Apple
Ridge. However, such gains were not material for the period January&nbsp;1, 2003 through
November&nbsp;25, 2003 and for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2002. The activities of Apple

interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 50&nbsp;basis points. In addition, the Company is required
to pay a per annum facility fee of 12.5&nbsp;basis points under this facility and a per annum
utilization fee of approximately 12.5&nbsp;basis points if usage under the facility exceeds 33%
of aggregate commitments. In the event that the credit ratings assigned to PHH by nationally
recognized debt rating agencies are downgraded to a level below PHH&#146;s ratings as of December&nbsp;31,
2004, the interest rate and facility fees are subject to a maximum upward adjustment
of approximately 75.0 and 12.5&nbsp;basis points, respectively.

mortgage programs contain restrictive covenants, including restrictions on dividends paid to
the Company by certain of its subsidiaries and indebtedness of material subsidiaries, mergers,

maintenance of certain financial ratios. At December&nbsp;31, 2004, the Company was in

the exception of specific mortgage loans that are sold with recourse, the investors have no

<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">Additionally, in 2001, the Company sold timeshare receivables to multiple bankruptcy remote
QSPEs retaining the servicing rights and a subordinated interest. As these entities are QSPEs
and precluded from consolidation pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles, the
debt issued by these entities and the collateralizing assets, which are serviced by the
Company, are not reflected on the Company&#146;s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The assets of these
QSPEs are not available to pay the Company&#146;s obligations. Additionally, the creditors of these
QSPEs have no recourse to the Company&#146;s credit. However, the Company has made representations
and warranties customary for securitization transactions, including eligibility
characteristics of the receivables and servicing responsibilities, in connection with the
securitization of these assets. Sales of timeshare receivables to these entities after 2001
were insignificant since substantially all timeshare receivables were securitized during such
years through the Timeshare Funding entities, which are consolidated on the Company&#146;s
Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December&nbsp;31, 2004 and 2003. Presented below is detailed
information as of December&nbsp;31, 2004 for these QSPEs (to which timeshare receivables were
sold prior to the establishment of the Timeshare Funding entities):

<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">These sensitivities are hypothetical and presented for illustrative purposes only. Changes in
fair value based on a 10% variation in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because
the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear.
Also, the effect of a variation in a particular assumption is calculated without changing any
other assumption; in reality, changes in one assumption may result in changes in another,
which may magnify or counteract the sensitivities. Further, this analysis does not assume any
impact resulting from management&#146;s intervention to mitigate these variations.

<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">During 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company recognized pre-tax gains of $228&nbsp;million, $850&nbsp;million
and $493&nbsp;million, respectively, related to the securitization of residential
mortgage loans. During 2003, the Company recognized pre-tax gains of $39&nbsp;million on the
securitization of timeshare receivables through the Timeshare Funding entities (prior to the
Company&#146;s consolidation thereof on September&nbsp;1, 2003), which were calculated using the
following key economic assumptions: 7-15% prepayment speed; 7.0-7.6 weighted average life (in
years); 15% discount rate; 9.5-13.7% anticipated credit losses. During 2002, the Company
recognized pre-tax gains of $43&nbsp;million on the securitization of timeshare receivables
through the Timeshare Funding entities, which were calculated using the following key economic
assumptions: 7.7-13% prepayment speed; 6.0-7.4 weighted average life (in years); 15% discount
rate; 9-14.7% anticipated credit losses. Gains recognized on the securitization of relocation
receivables were not material during 2003 and 2002. All gains on the securitization of
financial assets are recorded within net revenues on the Company&#146;s Consolidated Statements of
Income.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">The Company has made representations and warranties customary for securitization transactions,
including eligibility characteristics of the mortgage loans, timeshare receivables, and
relocation receivables and servicing responsibilities, in connection with the securitization
of these assets. See Note&nbsp;18&#151;Commitments and Contingencies.

<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">Other than those within the Company&#146;s vehicle rental, vacation rental and vehicle management
programs, for which the future minimum lease payments have been reflected in Note&nbsp;16&#151;Debt
Under Management and Mortgage Programs and Borrowing Arrangements, commitments under capital
leases are not significant. During 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company incurred total rental
expense of $779&nbsp;million, $722&nbsp;million and $518&nbsp;million, respectively, inclusive of
contingent rental expense of $97&nbsp;million, $93&nbsp;million and $69&nbsp;million in 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively, principally based on car rental volume. Included within the
Company&#146;s total rental expense for 2004, 2003 and 2002 are fees paid by the Company in
connection with agreements with airports that allow the Company to conduct its car rental
operations on-site. Such agreements require the Company to guarantee a minimum amount of fees
to be paid to the airports regardless of the amount of revenue generated by the on-site car
rental operations. The Company has also included the future minimum payments to be made in
connection with these guarantees in the above table.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt"><B><I>Commitments to Purchase Vehicles</I></B><br>
The Company maintains agreements with vehicle manufacturers whereby the Company is required to
purchase approximately $5.6&nbsp;billion of vehicles from these manufacturers during 2005. The
Company&#146;s featured suppliers for the Avis and Budget brands are General Motors Corporation and
Ford Motor Company, respectively. The purchase of such vehicles is financed through the
issuance of debt under management and mortgage programs in addition to cash received upon the
sale of vehicles primarily under repurchase programs.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt"><B><I>Other Purchase Commitments</I></B><br>
In the normal course of business, the Company makes various commitments to purchase goods or
services from specific suppliers, including those related to capital expenditures. None of the
purchase commitments made by the Company as of December&nbsp;31, 2004 (aggregating
approximately $2.0&nbsp;billion) was individually significant with the exception of the
Company&#146;s commitments under service contracts for information technology (aggregating $1.1&nbsp;billion,
of which $155&nbsp;million relates to 2005) and telecommunications (aggregating $371&nbsp;million,
of which $127&nbsp;million relates to 2005). These purchase obligations extend
through 2011 and 2008, respectively.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt"><B><I>Contingencies</I></B><br>
The June&nbsp;1999 disposition of the Company&#146;s fleet businesses was structured as a tax-free
reorganization and, accordingly, no tax provision was recorded on a majority of the gain.
However, pursuant to an interpretive ruling, the IRS has subsequently taken the position that
similarly structured transactions do not qualify as tax-free reorganizations under the
Internal Revenue Code Section&nbsp;368(a)(1)(A). If upon final determination, the transaction
is not considered a tax-free reorganization, the Company may have to record a tax charge of up
to $270&nbsp;million, depending upon certain factors. Any cash payments that would be made in
connection with this charge are not expected to be significant, as the Company would use its
net operating losses as an offset to the charge. Notwithstanding the IRS interpretive ruling
and the inherent difficulties in predicting a

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">


<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">final outcome, the Company believes that based
upon the facts and analysis of the tax law, it is more likely than not that its position would
be sustained upon litigation of the matter.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">The Company is involved in litigation asserting claims associated with accounting
irregularities discovered in 1998 at former CUC business units outside of the principal common
stockholder class action litigation. While the Company has an accrued liability of
approximately $65&nbsp;million recorded on its Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December&nbsp;31,
2004 for these claims based upon its best estimates, it does not believe that it is
feasible to predict or determine the final outcome or resolution of these unresolved
proceedings. An adverse outcome from such unresolved proceedings could be material with
respect to earnings in any given reporting period. However, the Company does not believe that
the impact of such unresolved proceedings should result in a material liability to the Company
in relation to its consolidated financial position or liquidity.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">The Company is also involved in litigation related to a breach of contract claim regarding a
subsidiary of its Marketing Services segment related to an exclusive agreement to market
insurance products. On February&nbsp;4, 2005, a verdict was rendered against the Company for
which the Company recorded a net charge of $25&nbsp;million ($17&nbsp;million, after tax) within
operating expenses on its Consolidated Statement of Income for 2004. The Company has not made
a determination regarding a potential appeal of the verdict and related judgment.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">In addition to the matters discussed above, the Company is also involved in claims, legal
proceedings and governmental inquiries related to contract disputes, business practices,
environmental issues and other commercial, employment and tax matters. Such matters include
but are not limited to: (i)&nbsp;various suits brought against our Trilegiant subsidiary by
individual consumers seeking monetary and/or injunctive relief relating to the marketing of
Trilegiant&#146;s membership programs and inquiries from state regulatory authorities related to
such programs and (ii)&nbsp;claims by the purchaser of a business formerly owned by Avis. The
Company believes that it has adequately accrued for such matters as appropriate or, for
matters not requiring accrual, believes that they will not have a material adverse effect on
its results of operations, financial position or cash flows based on information currently
available. However, litigation is inherently unpredictable and, although the Company believes
that its accruals are adequate and/or that it has valid defenses in these matters, unfavorable
resolutions could occur, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s results
of operations or cash flows in a particular reporting period.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt"><B><I>Standard Guarantees/Indemnifications</I></B><br>
In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into numerous agreements that contain
standard guarantees and indemnities whereby the Company indemnifies another party for breaches
of representations and warranties. In addition, many of these parties are also indemnified
against any third party claim resulting from the transaction that is contemplated in the
underlying agreement. Such guarantees or indemnifications are granted under various
agreements, including those governing (i)&nbsp;purchases, sales or outsourcing of assets or
businesses, (ii)&nbsp;leases of real estate, (iii)&nbsp;licensing of trademarks, (iv)&nbsp;development
of timeshare properties, (v)&nbsp;access to credit facilities and use of
derivatives, (vi)&nbsp;sales of mortgage loans, (vii)&nbsp;issuances of debt or equity
securities, (viii)&nbsp;licensing of computer software and (ix)&nbsp;GDS subscriber services.
The guarantees or indemnifications issued are for the benefit of the (i)&nbsp;buyers in sale
agreements and sellers in purchase agreements, (ii)&nbsp;landlords in lease contracts, (iii)&nbsp;franchisees
in a licensing agreements, (iv)&nbsp;developers in timeshare development
agreements, (v)&nbsp;financial institutions in credit facility arrangements and derivative
contracts, (vi)&nbsp;purchasers and insurers of the loans in sales of mortgage loans, (vii)&nbsp;underwriters
in debt or equity security issuances and (viii)&nbsp;travel agents or other users
in GDS subscriber services. While some of these guarantees extend only for the duration of the
underlying agreement, many survive the expiration of the term of the agreement or extend into
perpetuity (unless subject to a legal statute of limitations). There are no specific
limitations on the maximum potential amount of future payments that the Company could be
required to make under these guarantees, nor is the Company able to develop an estimate of the
maximum potential amount of future payments to be made under these guarantees as the
triggering events are not subject to predictability. With respect to certain of the
aforementioned guarantees, such as indemnifications of landlords against third party claims
for the use of

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">


<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">real estate property leased by the Company, the Company maintains insurance
coverage that mitigates any potential payments to be made.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">The Company also provides guarantees for the benefit of landlords in lease contracts where the
lease was assigned to a third party due to the sale of a business which occupied the leased
facility. These guarantees extend only the duration of the underlying lease contract. The
maximum potential amount of future payments that the Company may be required to make under
these guarantees is approximately $25&nbsp;million in the aggregate. If the Company were
required to make payments under these guarantees, it would have similar recourse against the
tenant (third party to which the lease was assigned).



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt"><B><I>Other Guarantees</I></B><br>
The Company&#146;s timeshare businesses provide guarantees to certain owners&#146; associations for
funds required to operate and maintain timeshare properties in excess of assessments collected
from owners of the timeshare interests. The Company may be required to fund such excess as a
result of unsold Company-owned timeshare interests or failure by owners to pay such
assessments. These guarantees extend for the duration of the underlying service agreements
(which approximate one year and are renewable on an annual basis) or until a stipulated
percentage (typically 80% or higher) of related timeshare interests are sold. The maximum
potential future payments that the Company could be required to make under these guarantees
was approximately $170&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2004. The Company would only be
required to pay this maximum amount if none of the owners assessed paid their maintenance
fees. Any fees collected from the owners of the timeshare interests would reduce the maximum
potential amount of future payments to be made by the Company. Additionally, should the
Company be required to fund the deficit through the payment of any owners&#146; fees under these
guarantees, the Company would be permitted access to the property for its own use and may use
that property to engage in revenue producing activities, such as advertising or rental.
Historically, the Company has not been required to make material payments under these
guarantees as the fees collected from owners of timeshare interests have been sufficient to
support the operation and maintenance of the timeshare properties. As of December&nbsp;31,
2004, the liability recorded by the Company in connection with these guarantees was
approximately $5&nbsp;million.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">The Company coordinates numerous events for its franchisees and thus reserves a number of
venues with certain minimum guarantees, such as room rentals at hotels local to the conference
center. However, such room rentals are paid by each individual franchisee. If the franchisees
do not meet the minimum guarantees, the Company is obligated to fulfill the minimum guaranteed
fees. These guarantees extend into 2008 and the maximum potential amount of future payments
that the Company may be required to make under such guarantees is approximately $17&nbsp;million.
The Company would only be required to pay this maximum amount if none of the
franchisees conducted their planned events at the reserved venues. Historically, the Company
has not been required to make material payments under these guarantees. As of December&nbsp;31,
2004, the liability recorded by the Company in connection with these guarantees was not
significant.

During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2004, the Company used $756&nbsp;million of available
cash and $567&nbsp;million of proceeds primarily received in connection with option exercises
to repurchase approximately $1.3&nbsp;billion (approximately 58&nbsp;million shares) of Cendant
common stock under its common stock repurchase program. During the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2003, the Company used $644&nbsp;million of available cash and $446&nbsp;million of proceeds
primarily received in connection with option exercises to repurchase approximately $1.1&nbsp;billion
(approximately 65&nbsp;million shares) of Cendant common stock under its common stock

<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt"><B><I>Share Issuances</I></B><br>
As previously discussed in Note&nbsp;15&#151;Long-term Debt and Borrowing Arrangements, during first
quarter 2004, the Company announced its intention to redeem its $430&nbsp;million outstanding
zero coupon senior convertible contingent notes for cash. As a result, holders had the right
to convert their notes into shares of Cendant common stock. Virtually all holders elected to
convert their notes. Accordingly, the Company issued approximately 22&nbsp;million shares in
exchange for approximately $430&nbsp;million in notes (carrying value) during February&nbsp;2004.
The Company used the cash that otherwise would have been used to redeem these notes to
repurchase shares in the open market.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">On August&nbsp;17, 2004, the forward purchase contracts that formed a portion of the Company&#146;s
Upper DECS securities settled pursuant to the terms of such contracts. Accordingly, the
Company issued approximately 38&nbsp;million shares in exchange for $863&nbsp;million in cash
and recorded an increase of $863&nbsp;million to stockholders&#146; equity.

As discussed in Note&nbsp;15&#151;Long Term Debt and Borrowing Arrangements, during 2004, the
Company redeemed its 3<SUP style="font-size: 80%; vertical-align: top;">7</SUP>/<SUB style="font-size: 80%; vertical-align: bottom;">8</SUB>%&nbsp;convertible senior debentures for cash. However, holders could
have elected to convert each $1,000&nbsp;par value debenture into 41.58&nbsp;shares of Cendant
common stock (33.4&nbsp;million shares in the aggregate). In order to offset a portion of the
dilution that would have occurred if the holders elected to convert their debentures, the
Company purchased call spread options on April&nbsp;30, 2004 covering 16.3&nbsp;million of the
33.4&nbsp;million shares issuable upon conversion. The call spread options, which expired
unexercised in fourth quarter 2004, and which cost $23&nbsp;million, were accounted for as a
capital transaction and included as a component of stockholders&#146; equity.

<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">The Company may grant stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted shares and
restricted stock units (&#147;RSUs&#148;) to its employees, including directors and officers of the
Company and its affiliates. Beginning in 2003, the Company changed the method by which it
provides stock-based compensation to its employees by significantly reducing the number of
stock options granted and instead, issuing RSUs as a form of compensation. The Company is
authorized to grant up to 418&nbsp;million shares of its common stock under its active stock
plans and at December&nbsp;31, 2004, approximately 150&nbsp;million shares were available for
future grants under the terms of these plans.

Stock options generally have a ten-year term, and those granted prior to 2004 vest ratably
over periods ranging from two to five years. In 2004, the Company adopted performance and time
vesting criteria for stock option grants. The predetermined performance criteria determine the
number of options that will ultimately vest and are based on the growth of the Company&#146;s
earnings and cash flows over the vesting period of the respective award. The number of options
that will ultimately vest may range from 0% to 200% of the base award. Vesting occurs over a
four-year period, but cannot exceed 25% of the base award in each of the three years following
the grant date. The Company&#146;s policy is to grant options with exercise prices at then-current
fair market value. The annual activity of the Company&#146;s CD common stock option plans consisted

previously granted with exercise prices greater than or equal to $15.1875. In connection with
such action, approximately 43&nbsp;million options (with a weighted average exercise price of
$19.08), substantially all of which were scheduled to become exercisable by January&nbsp;2004,
became exercisable as of August&nbsp;27, 2002. In addition, the post-employment exercise period
for the modified options was reduced from one year to thirty days. However, if the employee

officers were not eligible for this modification. In accordance with the provisions of the
FASB Interpretation No.&nbsp;44, &#147;Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock
Compensation (an Interpretation of APB Opinion No.&nbsp;25),&#148; there was no charge associated
with this modification since none of the modified options had intrinsic value because the

price of the modified options.

normal course of business during 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $6.90, $5.19 and $8.43, respectively.
The weighted-average grant-date fair value of Cendant common stock options granted in
connection with acquisitions made during 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $9.49, $3.89 and $11.35,

Cendant common stock options granted in 2004, 2003 and 2002:

RSUs granted by the Company entitle the employee to receive one share of Cendant common stock
upon vesting. RSUs granted in 2003 vest ratably over a four-year term. In 2004, the Company
adopted performance and time vesting criteria for RSU grants. The predetermined performance
criteria determine the number of RSUs that will ultimately vest and are based on the growth of
the Company&#146;s earnings and cash flows over the vesting period of the respective award. The
number of RSUs that will ultimately vest may range from 0% to 200% of the base award. Vesting
occurs over a four period, but cannot exceed 25% of the base award in each of the three years
following the grant date.

deferred compensation balance is recorded on the Company&#146;s Consolidated Balance Sheets as a
reduction to additional paid-in capital and approximated $301&nbsp;million and $73&nbsp;million

compensation balance to expense over the remaining vesting periods of the respective RSUs and

<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">In 2002, the Company formed Two Flags Joint Venture LLC (&#147;Two Flags&#148;) through the contribution
of its domestic Days Inn trademark and related license agreements. The Company did not
contribute any other assets to Two Flags. The Company then sold 49.9999% of Two Flags to
Marriott in exchange for the contribution to Two Flags of the domestic Ramada trademark and
related license agreements. The Company retained a 50.0001% controlling equity interest in Two
Flags. Both Marriott and the Company had the right, but were not obligated, to cause the sale
of Marriott&#146;s interest at any time after March&nbsp;1, 2004 for approximately $200&nbsp;million,
which represented the projected fair market value of Marriott&#146;s interest at such time. On April&nbsp;1,
2004, the Company exercised its right to purchase Marriott&#146;s interest in Two Flags for
approximately $200&nbsp;million. In connection with such transaction, the Company assumed a
note payable of approximately $200&nbsp;million, which was paid in September&nbsp;2004. As a result,
the Company now owns 100% of Two Flags and has exclusive rights to the domestic Ramada and
Days Inn trademarks and the related license agreements.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">Prior to April&nbsp;1, 2004, the Company consolidated Two Flags and, as a result, Marriott&#146;s
equity interest in Two Flags, which approximated $100&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2003,
was recorded as minority interest (within accounts payable and other current liabilities) on
the Company&#146;s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Pursuant to the terms of the venture, the Company
and Marriott shared income from Two Flags on a substantially equal basis. For the period
January&nbsp;1, 2004 through April&nbsp;1, 2004 (the date on which the Company purchased
Marriott&#146;s interest) and for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2003 and 2002, the Company
recorded pre-tax minority interest expense of $6&nbsp;million, $25&nbsp;million and $20&nbsp;million,
respectively, in connection with Two Flags.

<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">On January&nbsp;30, 2004, Trilegiant Corporation changed its legal name to TRL Group, Inc.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">From July&nbsp;2, 2001 to January&nbsp;30, 2004, TRL Group operated membership-based clubs and
programs and other incentive-based loyalty programs through an outsourcing arrangement with
Cendant whereby Cendant licensed TRL Group the right to market products to new members
utilizing certain assets of Cendant&#146;s individual membership business. Accordingly, Cendant
collected membership fees from, and was obligated to provide services to, members of its
individual membership business that existed as of July&nbsp;2, 2001, including their renewals,
and TRL Group provided fulfillment services for these members in exchange for a servicing fee
paid by Cendant. Furthermore, TRL Group collected the membership fees from, and was obligated
to provide membership benefits to, any members who joined the membership-based clubs and
programs and all other incentive programs subsequent to July&nbsp;2, 2001 and recognized the
related revenue and expenses. Accordingly, similar to Cendant&#146;s franchise businesses, Cendant
received a royalty from TRL Group on all revenue generated by TRL Group&#146;s new members (those
who joined TRL&#146;s clubs as a result of TRL Group&#146;s marketing efforts occurring between July
2001 and January&nbsp;2004). The assets licensed to TRL Group included various tradenames,
trademarks, logos, service marks and other intellectual property relating to its membership
business.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">


<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">During 2003, Cendant performed a strategic review of the TRL Group membership business,
Cendant&#146;s existing membership business and Cendant&#146;s loyalty/insurance marketing business,
which provides enhancement packages for financial institutions and marketing for accidental
death and dismemberment insurance and certain other insurance products. Upon completion of
such review, Cendant concluded that it could achieve certain revenue and expense synergies by
combining its loyalty/insurance marketing business with the new-member marketing performed by
TRL Group. Additionally, as a result of the adoption of FIN&nbsp;46, the Company had been
consolidating the results of TRL Group since July&nbsp;1, 2003 even though it did not have
managerial control of the entity. Therefore, in an effort to achieve the revenue and expense
synergies identified in Cendant&#146;s strategic review and to obtain managerial control over an
entity whose results were being consolidated, Cendant and TRL Group agreed to amend their
contractual relationship by terminating the contractual rights, intellectual property license
and third party administrator arrangements that Cendant had previously entered into with TRL
Group in 2001.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">In connection with this new relationship, Cendant (i)&nbsp;terminated leases of Cendant assets
by TRL Group, (ii)&nbsp;terminated the original third party administration agreement, (iii)&nbsp;entered
into a new third party administration agreement whereby Cendant performs fulfillment
services for TRL Group, (iv)&nbsp;leased certain TRL Group fixed assets from TRL Group, (v)&nbsp;offered
employment to substantially all of TRL Group&#146;s employees and (vi)&nbsp;entered into
other incidental agreements. These contracts were negotiated on an arm&#146;s-length basis and have
terms that Cendant&#146;s management believes are reasonable from an economic standpoint and
consistent with what management would expect from similar arrangements with non-affiliated
parties. None of these agreements had an impact on the Company&#146;s Consolidated Financial
Statements as the Company continues to consolidate TRL Group subsequent to this transaction.
In connection with the transaction, the parties agreed to liquidate and dissolve TRL Group in
an orderly fashion when and if the number of TRL Group members decreases below 1.3&nbsp;million,
provided that such dissolution may not occur prior to January&nbsp;2007. Cendant paid $13&nbsp;million
in cash on January&nbsp;30, 2004 for the contract termination, regained exclusive
access to the various tradenames, trademarks, logos, service marks and other intellectual
property that it had previously licensed to TRL Group for its use in marketing to new members
and now has managerial control of TRL Group through its majority representation on the TRL
Group board of directors. TRL Group continues to service and collect membership fees from its
members to whom it marketed through January&nbsp;29, 2004, including their renewals. Cendant
provides fulfillment services (including collecting cash, paying commissions, processing
refunds, providing membership services and benefits and maintaining specified service level
standards) for TRL Group&#146;s members in exchange for a servicing fee. TRL Group no longer has
the ability to market to new members; rather, Cendant now markets to new members under the
Trilegiant tradename. Immediately following consummation of this transaction, Cendant owned
approximately 43% of TRL Group on a fully diluted basis and as of December&nbsp;31, 2004,
Cendant&#146;s equity ownership interest in TRL Group approximated 45% on a fully diluted basis.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">On January&nbsp;30, 2004, TRL Group had net deferred tax assets of approximately $121&nbsp;million,
which were mainly comprised of net operating loss carryforwards expiring in years
2021, 2022 and 2023. These deferred tax assets were fully reserved for by TRL Group through a
valuation allowance, as TRL Group had not been able to demonstrate future profitability due to
the large marketing expenditures it incurred (new member marketing has historically been TRL
Group&#146;s single largest expenditure). However, given the fact that TRL Group would no longer
incur marketing expenses (as they no longer have the ability to market to new members as a
result of this transaction), TRL Group determined that it was more likely than not that it
would generate sufficient taxable income (as it would continue to recognize revenue from TRL
Group&#146;s existing membership base in the form of renewals and the lapsing of the refund
privilege period) to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards within the statutory
periods. Accordingly, TRL Group reversed the entire valuation allowance of $121&nbsp;million in
January&nbsp;2004, which resulted in a reduction to the Company&#146;s consolidated tax provision during
2004 of $121&nbsp;million, with a corresponding increase in consolidated net income. The $13&nbsp;million
cash payment the Company made to TRL Group was also recorded by the Company as a
component of its provision for income taxes line item on the Consolidated Statement of Income
for 2004 and partially offsets the $121&nbsp;million reversal of TRL Group&#146;s valuation
allowance.

<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">During 2004, TRL Group contributed revenues of $468&nbsp;million and expenses of $279&nbsp;million
(on a stand-alone basis before eliminations of intercompany entries in consolidation).
Reflected within such amounts is $34&nbsp;million of revenue recorded during third quarter 2004
relating to the early termination of a contractual relationship with a third party marketing
partner, originally expected to extend beyond 2005. TRL Group had provided services for this
marketing partner in 2002 in exchange for royalties related to the success of the marketing
program. TRL Group and the marketing partner disputed certain aspects of the marketing
agreement and a settlement was reached in September&nbsp;2004 that provided for early termination
of the agreement.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">For the period July&nbsp;1, 2003 through December&nbsp;31, 2003 (post consolidation), TRL Group
contributed revenues and expenses of $241&nbsp;million and $256&nbsp;million, respectively (on a
stand-alone basis before eliminations of intercompany entries in consolidation). The
consolidation of TRL Group resulted in a non-cash charge of $293&nbsp;million ($0.27&nbsp;per
diluted share) recorded on July&nbsp;1, 2003 as a cumulative effect of accounting change. The
results for 2003 further reflect revenues and expenses recorded by the Company for the period
January&nbsp;1, 2003 through June&nbsp;30, 2003 (prior to the consolidation of TRL Group) in
connection with the outsourcing arrangement. The Company recorded revenues of $33&nbsp;million
(representing royalties, licensing and leasing fees and travel agency fees) and net expenses
of $76&nbsp;million (relating to fulfillment services and the amortization of the marketing
advance made in 2001) for such period.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">Cendant&#146;s maximum exposure to loss as of December&nbsp;31, 2004 as a result of its involvement
with TRL Group was substantially limited to the advances and loans made to TRL Group, as well
as any receivables due from TRL Group (collectively aggregating $33&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31,
2004), as such amounts may not be recoverable if TRL Group were to cease operations.
The creditors of TRL Group have no recourse to Cendant&#146;s credit and the assets of TRL Group
are not available to pay Cendant&#146;s obligations. Cendant is not obligated or contingently
liable for any debt incurred by TRL Group.

The Company sponsors several defined contribution savings plans that provide certain eligible
employees of the Company an opportunity to accumulate funds for retirement. The Company
matches the contributions of participating employees on the basis specified by the plans. The
Company&#146;s cost for contributions to these plans was $80&nbsp;million, $71&nbsp;million and $62&nbsp;million
during 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt"><B><I>Defined Benefit Pension Plans</I></B><br>
The Company sponsors domestic non-contributory defined benefit pension plans, which cover
certain eligible employees. The majority of the employees participating in these plans are no
longer accruing benefits. Additionally, the Company sponsors contributory defined benefit
pension plans in certain foreign subsidiaries with participation in the plans at the
employees&#146; option. Under both the domestic and foreign plans, benefits are based on an
employee&#146;s years of credited service and a percentage of final average compensation or as
otherwise described by the plan. As of December&nbsp;31, 2004 and 2003, the aggregate projected
benefit obligation of these plans was $549&nbsp;million and $499&nbsp;million, respectively, and
the aggregate fair value of the plans&#146; assets was $383&nbsp;million and $337&nbsp;million,
respectively. Accordingly, the plans were underfunded by $166&nbsp;million and $162&nbsp;million
as of December&nbsp;31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, primarily due to the downturn in the
financial markets and a decline in interest rates. However, the net pension liability recorded
by the Company (primarily as a component of other non-current liabilities) as of December&nbsp;31,
2004 and 2003 approximated $160&nbsp;million and $159&nbsp;million, respectively, of which
approximately $112&nbsp;million and $94&nbsp;million, as of December&nbsp;31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively, represents additional minimum pension liability recorded as a charge to other
comprehensive income. The Company&#146;s policy is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet minimum
funding requirements as set forth in employee benefit and tax laws plus such additional
amounts the Company determines to be appropriate. During 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company
recorded pension expense of $9&nbsp;million, $16&nbsp;million and $9&nbsp;million, respectively.

offset by $5&nbsp;million of expense) and post-retirement expense of $7&nbsp;million,
respectively, related to these plans. The $23&nbsp;million of post-retirement income recorded

<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">Following is a description of the Company&#146;s risk management policies.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt"><B><I>Foreign Currency Risk</I></B><br>
The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts to manage its exposure to changes in
foreign currency exchange rates associated with its foreign currency denominated receivables
and forecasted royalties, forecasted earnings of foreign subsidiaries and forecasted foreign
currency denominated acquisitions. The Company primarily hedges its foreign currency exposure
to the British pound, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar and Euro. The majority of forward
contracts utilized by the Company do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under SFAS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;133.
The fluctuations in the value of these forward contracts do, however, largely
offset the impact of changes in the value of the underlying risk that they are intended to
economically hedge. Forward contracts that are used to hedge certain forecasted royalty
receipts and forecasted disbursements up to 12&nbsp;months are designated and do qualify as
cash flow hedges. The amount of gains or losses reclassified from other comprehensive income
to earnings resulting from ineffectiveness or from excluding a component of the forward
contracts&#146; gain or loss from the effectiveness calculation for cash flow hedges during 2004,
2003 and 2002 was not material. The impact of these forward contracts was not material to the
Company&#146;s results of operations or financial position, nor is the amount of gains or losses
the Company expects to reclassify from other comprehensive income to earnings over the next 12
&nbsp;months.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt"><B><I>Interest Rate Risk</I></B><br>
&nbsp;<BR>
<I>Mortgage Servicing Rights. </I>The Company&#146;s mortgage servicing rights asset is subject to
substantial interest rate risk as the mortgage notes underlying the MSR asset permit the
borrower to prepay the loan. Therefore, the value of the MSR asset tends to diminish in
periods of declining interest rates (as prepayments increase) and increase in periods of
rising interest rates (as prepayments decrease). The Company uses a combination of derivative
instruments (including option contracts and interest rate swaps) and other investment
securities to offset potential changes in fair value on its MSR asset that could affect
reported earnings. These derivatives are designated as freestanding derivatives in 2004 and as
either freestanding derivatives or fair value hedging instruments in 2003 and 2002, and
recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded to current earnings. The change in
fair value for the hedged portion of the MSR asset in 2003 and 2002 is also recorded to
current earnings.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">During 2004, 2003 and 2002, the net impact of the Company&#146;s derivative activity related to its
MSR asset after giving effect to the offsetting changes in fair value of the MSR asset was a
gain of $117&nbsp;million, $163&nbsp;million and $115&nbsp;million, respectively. The 2003 amount
consists of gains of $155&nbsp;million to reflect the ineffective portion of the fair value
hedges and gains of $8&nbsp;million resulting from the component of the derivatives&#146; fair value
excluded from the assessment of effectiveness (as such amount relates to freestanding
derivatives). The 2002 amount consists of gains of $48&nbsp;million to reflect the ineffective
portion of the fair value hedges and gains of $67&nbsp;million resulting from the component of
the derivatives&#146; fair value excluded from the assessment of effectiveness (as such amount
relates to freestanding derivatives).



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt"><I>Other Mortgage Related Assets. </I>The Company&#146;s other mortgage-related assets are subject to
interest rate risk created by (i)&nbsp;its commitments to finance mortgages to borrowers who
have applied for loan funding and

<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">(ii)&nbsp;loans held in inventory awaiting sale into the
secondary market. The Company uses derivative instruments (including futures, options and
forward delivery contracts) to economically hedge its commitments to fund mortgages.
Commitments to fund mortgages and related hedges are classified and accounted for as
freestanding derivatives. Accordingly, these positions are recorded at fair value with changes
in fair value recorded to current earnings and generally offset the fair value changes
recorded relating to the underlying assets. During 2004, 2003 and 2002, the net impact of
these freestanding derivatives was a net gain (loss)&nbsp;of $5&nbsp;million, ($10)&nbsp;million and
$14&nbsp;million, respectively. Such amounts are recorded within net revenues in the
Consolidated Statements of Income.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">Interest rate and price risk stemming from loans held in inventory awaiting sale into the
secondary market (which are classified on the Company&#146;s Consolidated Balance Sheets as
mortgage loans held for sale) may be hedged with mortgage forward delivery contracts. These
forward delivery contracts fix the forward sales price which will be realized in the secondary
market and thereby substantially eliminate the interest rate and price risk to the Company.
Such forward delivery contracts are either classified and accounted for as fair value hedges
or freestanding derivatives. During 2004 and 2003, the net impact of these derivatives, after
giving effect to changes in fair value of the underlying loans, was a gain (loss)&nbsp;of $17&nbsp;million
and ($20)&nbsp;million, respectively (the impact was not material during 2002). Such
amounts are recorded within net revenues on the Consolidated Statements of Income.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt"><I>Debt. </I>The debt used to finance much of the Company&#146;s operations is also exposed to interest
rate fluctuations. The Company uses various hedging strategies and derivative financial
instruments to create a desired mix of fixed and floating rate assets and liabilities.
Derivative instruments currently used in these hedging strategies include swaps and
instruments with purchased option features. The derivatives used to manage the risk associated
with the Company&#146;s fixed rate debt were designated as either fair value hedges or freestanding
derivatives. The fair value hedges were perfectly effective resulting in no net impact on the
Company&#146;s results of operations during 2004, 2003 and 2002, except to create the accrual of
interest expense at variable rates. The freestanding derivatives, which existed only during
2004, had a nominal impact on the Company&#146;s results of operations during 2004. During 2004,
2003 and 2002, the Company terminated certain of its fair value hedges, which resulted in cash
gains (losses)&nbsp;of ($9)&nbsp;million, $200&nbsp;million and $65&nbsp;million, respectively. Such
gains (losses)&nbsp;are deferred and being recognized over future periods as a component of
interest expense. During 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company recorded $33&nbsp;million, $50&nbsp;million
and $14&nbsp;million, respectively, of such amortization.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">The derivatives used to manage the risk associated with the Company&#146;s floating rate debt
included freestanding derivatives and derivatives designated as cash flow hedges. In
connection with its cash flow hedges, the Company recorded net gains (losses)&nbsp;of $31&nbsp;million,
$36&nbsp;million and $(8)&nbsp;million during 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, to
other comprehensive income. The after-tax amount of gains reclassified from other
comprehensive income to earnings resulting from ineffectiveness or from excluding a component
of the derivatives&#146; gain or loss from the effectiveness calculation for cash flow hedges was $8&nbsp;million
during 2004. Such gains or losses were insignificant in 2003 and 2002. The amount
of losses the Company expects to reclassify from other comprehensive income to earnings during
the next 12&nbsp;months is not material. These freestanding derivatives had a nominal impact on
the Company&#146;s results of operations in 2004. In 2003 and 2002 the Company recorded gains
(losses)&nbsp;of $(8)&nbsp;million and $2&nbsp;million, respectively, related to freestanding
derivatives.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt"><B><I>Credit Risk and Exposure</I></B><br>
The Company is exposed to counterparty credit risks in the event of nonperformance by
counterparties to various agreements and sales transactions. The Company manages such risk by
evaluating the financial position and creditworthiness of such counterparties and for
requiring collateral in instances in which financing is provided. The Company mitigates
counterparty credit risk associated with its derivative contracts by monitoring the amount for
which it is at risk with each counterparty to such contracts, periodically evaluating
counterparty creditworthiness and financial position, and where possible, dispersing its risk
among multiple counterparties.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">As of December&nbsp;31, 2004, there were no significant concentrations of credit risk with any
individual counterparty or groups of counterparties other than risks related to the Company&#146;s
repurchase agreements

Accounting Policies) and airline customers of the Company&#146;s Travel Distribution segment.
Concentrations of credit risk associated with receivables are considered minimal due to the
Company&#146;s diverse customer base. With the exception of the financing provided to customers of
its timeshare and mortgage businesses, the Company does not normally require collateral or
other security to support credit sales.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt"><FONT style="font-variant: SMALL-CAPS"><B>Fair Value</B></FONT>



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">The fair value of financial instruments is generally determined by reference to market values
resulting from trading on a national securities exchange or in an over-the-counter market. In
cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based on estimates using
present value or other valuation techniques, as appropriate. The carrying amounts of cash and
cash equivalents, restricted cash, available-for-sale securities, accounts receivable, program
cash, relocation receivables and accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair
value due to the short-term maturities of these assets and liabilities. The carrying amounts
and estimated fair values of all financial instruments at December&nbsp;31, are as follows:

<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">In addition to the Company&#146;s relationship with TRL Group (discussed in Note&nbsp;22&#151;TRL Group,
Inc.) and Homestore (discussed in Note&nbsp;2&#151;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies), the
Company maintained related party relationships with certain other entities. The impact of
these relationships on the Company&#146;s Consolidated Financial Statements is discussed below.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">The Company&#146;s Consolidated Statements of Income for 2003 and 2002 include $1&nbsp;million and $8&nbsp;million,
respectively, of related party revenue derived from Trip Network prior to the
Company&#146;s acquisition in 2003. The Company&#146;s Consolidated Statements of Income for 2003 and
2002 include $1&nbsp;million and $11&nbsp;million, respectively, of related party revenue and $1&nbsp;million
and $20&nbsp;million, respectively, of related party expenses derived from FFD
prior to the Company&#146;s acquisition in 2003. Also reflected in the Company&#146;s Consolidated
Statement of Income for 2002 is $101&nbsp;million of related party revenue (including $66&nbsp;million
of royalty and marketing fees) and $7&nbsp;million of related party expense derived
from NRT prior to the Company&#146;s acquisition in 2002. Trip Network, FFD and NRT have been
included in the Company&#146;s consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial
position since their acquisition dates (see Note&nbsp;5&#151;Acquisitions for further detail).
Additionally, the Company&#146;s Consolidated Statement of Income for 2003 includes a gain of
approximately $30&nbsp;million in connection with the disposition of a common equity ownership
interest in Entertainment Publications.

<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">Provided below is selected unaudited quarterly financial data for 2004 and 2003. Certain
amounts relating to first quarter 2004 and 2003 have been revised from those previously
reported in order to present Jackson Hewitt as a discontinued operation (see Note&nbsp;3&nbsp;&#151;
Discontinued Operations). The underlying diluted per share information is calculated from the
weighted average common and common stock equivalents outstanding during each quarter, which
may fluctuate based on quarterly income levels, market prices and share repurchases.
Therefore, the sum of the quarters&#146; per share information may not equal the total year amounts
presented on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Additionally, the diluted share amounts
presented below for 2003 have been revised to include the effect of convertible debt
securities that were outstanding during 2003, pursuant to EITF 04-8 (see Note&nbsp;2&#151;Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies).

<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt"><B><I>PHH Spin-off</I></B><br>
On January&nbsp;31, 2005, the Company completed the spin-off of its mortgage, fleet leasing and
appraisal businesses in a tax-free distribution of PHH common stock to its stockholders. The
Company distributed one share of PHH common stock for every twenty shares of Cendant common
stock outstanding as of January&nbsp;19, 2005. The distribution resulted in the issuance of
approximately 52.7&nbsp;million shares of PHH common stock. On February&nbsp;1, 2005, PHH common
stock began regular-way trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol &#147;PHH.&#148;



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">In connection with the spin-off of PHH, the Company expects to record a non-cash impairment
charge to reflect any difference between PHH&#146;s carrying value and PHH&#146;s market value. The
Company anticipates that such non-cash charge will be in the range of $535&nbsp;million to $590&nbsp;million
(based on currently available information). Approximately one-third of this
charge will be allocated to continuing operations and approximately two-thirds to discontinued
operations, reflecting the relative values of the mortgage and fleet businesses, respectively,
and the fact that the mortgage business will not be accounted for as a discontinued operation.
The Company does not anticipate recording a tax benefit associated with this charge.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt"><B><I>Wright Express Initial Public Offering</I></B><br>
On February&nbsp;22, 2005, the Company disposed of 100% of its ownership interest in its fuel
card subsidiary, Wright Express, in an initial public offering for approximately $1.0&nbsp;billion.
The Company received approximately $690&nbsp;million of proceeds in connection with
the offering and a special dividend of approximately $300&nbsp;million.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt"><B><I>Relocation Financing Program</I></B><br>
On February&nbsp;1, 2005, the Company restructured its relocation financing program through the
issuance of a series of variable funding notes with availability of up to $550&nbsp;million.
The notes are prepayable, bear interest at variable rates and are secured by receivables
originated by the Company&#146;s relocation business. In connection with such restructuring, Apple
Ridge Funding, LLC, the issuer of the notes, changed its name to Cendant Mobility
Client-Backed Relocation Receivables Funding LLC.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt"><B><I>Share Repurchases</I></B><br>
During January and February&nbsp;2005, the Company repurchased 6.5&nbsp;million shares of its common
stock at an average price of $22.52 for aggregate cash of approximately $147&nbsp;million. As
of February&nbsp;28, 2005, the Company had $737&nbsp;million of availability under its
Board-approved repurchase program.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt"><B><I>Declaration of Dividend</I></B><br>
On January&nbsp;24, 2005, the Company&#146;s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend
of $0.09&nbsp;per common share, payable March&nbsp;15, 2005 to stockholders of record February&nbsp;28,
2005.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt"><B><I>Asset-Backed Note&nbsp;Issuance</I></B><br>
On February&nbsp;25, 2005, the Company issued $750&nbsp;million of asset-backed notes under its
vehicle rental program. Such notes consisted of (i)&nbsp;$325&nbsp;million of three-year fixed
rate notes bearing interest at 4.3%, (ii)&nbsp;$300&nbsp;million of three-year floating rate
notes currently bearing interest at 4.3% and (iii)&nbsp;$125&nbsp;million of five-year floating
rate notes currently bearing interest at 4.6%.



<P align="justify" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt"><B><I>Acquisition of ebookers plc.</I></B><br>
On February&nbsp;28, 2005, the Company acquired ebookers for approximately $350&nbsp;million,
net of cash acquired. The Company also assumed approximately $30&nbsp;million of debt in
connection with this acquisition.
