During 2005, we continued the process of simplifying our
business mix to focus solely on our core real estate and travel
businesses, a process we began in 2004. In connection with this
process, in 2005, we continued to execute the four-phase
strategic realignment plan to divest our non-core businesses. In
the first phase, completed on June&nbsp;25, 2004, we disposed of
our Jackson Hewitt tax preparation services business in an
initial public offering. In the second phase, completed on
January&nbsp;31, 2005, we spun-off our mortgage, appraisal and
fleet management businesses through the distribution of a
dividend to our stockholders of all of the shares of common
stock of PHH Corporation. In the third phase, completed on
February&nbsp;22, 2005, we disposed of our Wright Express fuel
card business in an initial public offering, and in connection
with the disposition, we received $964&nbsp;million in cash. In
the fourth and final phase of our strategic realignment plan, we
disposed of our Marketing Services division, including our
Progeny Marketing Innovations, Trilegiant, Trilegiant Loyalty
Solutions and Cims businesses, on October&nbsp;17, 2005 for
approximately $1.7&nbsp;billion in cash (approximately
$1.8&nbsp;billion of gross proceeds). For more information
regarding the disposition of our Marketing Services division,
please see &#147;Discontinued Operations&#148; below.

Following completion of the strategic realignment plan, on
October&nbsp;23, 2005, our Board of Directors approved a plan to
separate our company into four independent, publicly traded
companies, one each for our Real Estate Services, Hospitality
(including Timeshare Resorts), Travel Distribution and Vehicle
Rental businesses (the &#147;Separation Plan&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt;color: #000000; background: #ffffff; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-bottom: 0; ">
We expect the separation to be effected through three 100%
spin-offs, and we currently expect to complete the spin-offs of
the Real Estate Services and Hospitality companies in the second
quarter and third quarter of 2006, respectively, followed by the
spin-off of the Travel Distribution company in October of 2006.
Each of the spin-offs is expected to be tax-free for Cendant and
its shareholders. Following each distribution, Cendant
shareholders will own 100% of the common stock of the company
being distributed. In connection with the Separation Plan, the
four companies are expected to enter into certain agreements
governing their relationships following the separation,
including the assumption of certain contingent liabilities of
Cendant.

The four new companies will be led by teams primarily drawn from
Cendant&#146;s current senior leadership. Henry R. Silverman
will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Real Estate
Services company, with Richard A. Smith serving as Vice Chairman
and President. The Hospitality company will be headed by Stephen
P. Holmes as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Ronald L.
Nelson will lead the Vehicle Rental company as its Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer with F. Robert Salerno serving as
President. The Travel Distribution company is currently
conducting a search for a new Chief Executive Officer, which
role is being filled on an interim basis by Mr.&nbsp;Nelson.
Each of the new companies&#146; Board of Directors will be
composed of a diverse group of experienced directors, with a
majority of independent directors.

Consummation of the proposed separation is subject to a number
of uncertainties and conditions precedent, including final
approval by Cendant&#146;s Board of Directors, receipt of a tax
opinion of counsel, receipt of solvency opinions, and the filing
and effectiveness of registration statements with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the &#147;Commission&#148; or the
&#147;SEC&#148;). Also, the separation is subject to the
completion of applicable refinancings of Cendant&#146;s
corporate debt on terms acceptable to Cendant. For more

franchisor of real estate brokerages and our brands are among
the most well known and established real estate brokerage brands
in the real estate industry. In the United States, during 2005,
brokers operating under one of our franchised brands represented

single family home sale transactions that involved a broker. Our

We derive substantially all of our real estate franchising
revenues from royalty fees received under long-term franchise
agreements with our franchisees. Our franchisees pay us fees for
the right to operate under one of our trademarks and access to
the systems and tools provided by our real estate franchise
systems. In addition, we provide our franchisees with
educational materials which contain recommended methods,
specifications and procedures for operating the franchise,
continuous training programs and assistance and a national
marketing program and related services. We operate and maintain
an Internet-based reporting system for our franchisees which
allows them to electronically transmit listing information,
transactions, and other relevant reporting data. We also own and
operate web sites for each of our brands. We offer our
franchisees the opportunity to sell ancillary services such as
title insurance and escrow services as a way to enhance their
business and to increase our cross-selling initiative. In
addition, each brand focuses on technology initiatives. In 2005,
we began rolling out SearchRouter, which delivers to franchisees
all local listings from all real estate companies in a
particular area, and LeadRouter, which delivers Internet
consumer leads directly to a sales associate&#146;s cellular
phone in real time.

Generally, the franchise agreements have a term of ten years and
require the franchisees to pay us an initial franchise fee up to
$25,000, plus, upon the receipt of any commission income, a
royalty fee, in most cases, equal to 6% of such income. Each of
our franchise systems (other than Coldwell Banker Commercial)
offers a volume incentive program that returns a portion of the
royalties paid. Each franchisee (other than our company owned
franchisees) is eligible to receive a volume incentive upon the
satisfaction of certain conditions. The amount of the volume
incentive varies depending upon the franchisee&#146;s annual
gross revenue subject to royalty payments for the prior calendar
year. Under the current form of franchise agreements, the
maximum volume incentive varies for each franchise system and
ranges from 2% to 3% of gross revenues. Franchisees are also
required to make monthly contributions to national advertising
funds maintained for the creation and development of
advertising, public relations and programs promoting our brands.

In addition to offices owned and operated by our franchisees, we
own and operate approximately 1,000 of the Coldwell Banker, ERA,
Coldwell Banker Commercial and Sotheby&#146;s International
Realty offices through our NRT subsidiary. NRT pays intercompany
royalty fees of approximately 6% of its commission income plus
marketing fees to our real estate franchise business in
connection with its operation of these offices, which fees are
recognized as income or expense at the applicable business unit
level and eliminated in the consolidation of our businesses. As
such, NRT is the largest contributor to each of our franchise
system&#146;s national advertising funds under which NRT
operates.

In the United States, we employ a direct franchising model
whereby we contract with and provide services directly to
independent owner-operators. In other parts of the world, we
generally employ either a master franchise model, whereby we
contract with a qualified, experienced third party to build a
franchise enterprise in such third party&#146;s country or
region, or a direct franchising model.

We also offer service providers an opportunity to market their
products to our brokers, sales associates and their customers
through our Preferred Alliance program. To participate in this
program, service providers generally pay us an initial fee,
subsequent commissions based upon our franchisees&#146;, or
sales associates&#146;, usage of the preferred alliance vendors
or both. PHH Mortgage, our former mortgage business, is the only
Cendant-endorsed provider of mortgages for customers of our
franchisees. We receive a marketing fee for promotion in
connection with our endorsement.

<B>Competition.</B> Competition among the national real estate
brokerage brand franchisors to grow their franchise systems is
intense. Our largest national competitors in this industry
include, but are not limited to, Prudential, GMAC Real Estate
and RE/ MAX real estate brokerage brands. In addition, a real
estate broker may choose to affiliate with a regional chain or
choose not to affiliate with a franchisor but to remain
independent. We believe that competition for the sale of
franchises in the real estate brokerage industry is based
principally upon the perceived value and quality of the brand
and services offered to franchisees.

The ability of our real estate brokerage franchisees to compete
is important to our prospects for growth. The ability of an
individual franchisee to compete may be affected by the quality
of its sales associates, the location of its office, the
services provided to its sales associates, the number of
competing offices in the vicinity, its affiliation with a
recognized brand name, community reputation and other factors. A
franchisee&#146;s success may also be affected by general,
regional and local economic conditions. The potential negative
effect of these conditions on our results of operations is
generally reduced by virtue of the diverse geographical
locations of our franchisees. At December&nbsp;31, 2005, our
combined real estate franchise systems had approximately 9,200
brokerage offices in the United States and approximately 15,000
offices worldwide. The real estate franchise systems have
offices in 59 countries and territories in North and South
America, Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia.

Through our subsidiary, NRT Incorporated, we own and operate a

largest U.S.&nbsp;residential real estate brokerage firm and
operates under our franchise brands, principally Coldwell
Banker, ERA and Sotheby&#146;s International Realty, as well as
proprietary brands that we own, but do not franchise, such as
the Corcoran Group. We have nearly 1,100&nbsp;company owned
brokerage offices, approximately 9,000 employees and over 64,000
sales associates working with these company owned offices.

Our real estate brokerage business derives revenue primarily
from sales commissions, which we receive at the closing of real
estate transactions. Sales commissions usually range from 5% to
7% of the home sale price. In transactions in which we act as a
broker for solely the buyer or the seller, the seller&#146;s
broker typically instructs the closing agent to pay the
buyer&#146;s broker a portion of the sales commission. Sales
associates generally receive between 50% and 80% of the
commissions payable to us.

When we assist the seller in a real estate transaction, our
sales associates generally provide the seller with a full
service marketing program, which may include developing a direct
marketing plan for the property, assisting the seller in pricing
the property and preparing it for sale, listing it on multiple
listing services, advertising the property (including on web
sites), showing the property to prospective buyers, assisting
the seller in sale negotiations, and assisting the seller in
preparing for closing the transaction. When we assist the buyer
in a real estate transaction, our sales associates generally
assist the buyer in locating specific properties that meet the
buyer&#146;s personal and financial specifications, show
properties to the buyer, assist the buyer in sales negotiations
(where permissible) and assist the buyer in preparing for
closing the transaction.

NRT has a dedicated group of professionals whose function is to
identify, evaluate and complete acquisitions of residential real
estate brokerages. In the ordinary course of business, we

As a full service real estate brokerage company, we promote the
complementary services of our relocation and title and
settlement services business, in addition to the services of PHH
Home Loans, our home mortgage venture with PHH Corporation. We
formed PHH Home Loans, LLC (the &#147;mortgage venture&#148;),
in connection with the spin-off of our former mortgage business,
for the purpose of originating and selling mortgage loans
primarily sourced through our residential real estate brokerage
and relocation businesses. We own 49.9% of the mortgage venture.
The mortgage venture has a
<FONT style="white-space: nowrap">50-year</FONT> term, subject
to earlier termination upon the occurrence of certain events or
at our election at any time after January&nbsp;31, 2012 by
providing two years&#146; notice to PHH. PHH may terminate the
venture upon the occurrence of certain events or, at its option,
after January&nbsp;31, 2030. All mortgage loans originated by
the mortgage venture are sold to PHH Mortgage or other third
party investors, and PHH Home Loans does not hold any mortgage
loans for investment purposes or perform servicing functions for
any loans it originates. Accordingly, we have no mortgage
servicing rights asset risk. PHH Home Loans is the exclusive
recommended provider of mortgages for NRT.

<B>Competition.</B> The real estate brokerage industry is highly
competitive, particularly in the metropolitan areas in which NRT
operates. In addition, the industry has relatively low barriers
to entry for new participants, including participants pursuing
non-traditional methods of marketing real estate, such as
Internet-based listing services. Companies compete for sales and
marketing business primarily on the basis of services offered,
reputation, personal contacts, and brokerage commissions. NRT
competes primarily with franchisees of local and regional real
estate franchisors; franchisees of our brands and of other
national real estate franchisors, such as the RE/ MAX, GMAC Real
Estate and Prudential real estate brokerage brands; regional
independent real estate organizations, such as Weichert Realtors

such as ZipRealty; and smaller niche companies competing in
local areas.

Under relocation services contracts with our clients, home sale
services are divided into two types, &#147;at risk&#148; and
&#147;no risk.&#148; Approximately 88% of our home sale services
are provided under &#147;no risk&#148; contracts. Under these
contracts, the client pays a fee for the relocation service and
is responsible for payment of all direct expenses associated
with the home sale. Such expenses include, but are not limited
to, appraisal, inspection and real estate brokerage commissions.
The client also bears the risk of loss on the sale of the
transferee&#146;s home. We pay all of these expenses and
generally fund them on behalf of the client. When we fund these
expenses, the client then reimburses us for those costs, and for
interest charges on the advanced money. This limits our exposure
on &#147;no risk&#148; home sales to the credit risk of our
corporate clients rather than to the potential fluctuations in
the real estate market or to the creditworthiness of the
individual transferring employee. Due to the credit quality of
our corporate clients and our history with such losses, we
believe such risk is minimal.

For all U.S.&nbsp;federal government agency clients and a
limited number of corporate clients, we provide an &#147;at
risk&#148; home sale service in conjunction with the other
services we provide. These &#147;at risk&#148; transactions
represent approximately 12% of our total homesale transactions.
The &#147;at-risk&#148; fee for these transactions is a fixed
fee based on a percentage of the value of the underlying
property, and is significantly larger than the fee under the
&#147;no risk&#148; home sale service because we pay for all
direct expenses (acquisition, selling and carrying costs)
associated with the home sale, including potential losses on the
sale of the home. We do not speculate in the real estate market
nor is it our intention to profit on any appreciation in home
values. Since we move to dispose of the homes at risk
immediately following acquisition, we limit our exposure to
fluctuations in home values. Net resale losses as a percentage
of the purchase price of &#147;at risk&#148; homes has averaged
approximately 2% over the last three years.

Under all relocation
services contracts (regardless of whether the client utilizes

limited to costs to move household goods, mortgage origination
points, temporary living and travel expenses. We process all of
these expenses and generally fund them on behalf of the client.
When we fund these expenses, the client reimburses us for those
costs plus interest charges on the advanced money. The exposure
for the non-home sale related direct expenses is limited to the
credit risk of the corporate clients. We have experienced
virtually no credit losses, net of recoveries, over the last
three years.

Substantially all of our contracts with our relocation clients

Under both types of contracts, we augment client fees by earning
commissions from the real estate brokers, van lines and other
suppliers who provide services to the transferring employee. The
commissions earned are used to offset relocation program costs
and reduce the fees we charge our clients. We have created the
Mobility Broker Network, which is a network of real estate
brokers consisting of our company owned brokerage operations,
some of our franchisees who have chosen to become members and
independent real estate brokers. Member brokers of the Mobility
Broker Network receive referrals from our relocation services
business in exchange for a referral fee. The Mobility Broker
Network closed over 70,000 properties in 2005. We derive about
6% of our relocation revenue from referrals within our Mobility
Broker Network.

We act in the capacity of a title agent and sell title insurance
to property buyers and mortgage lenders. We issue title
insurance policies on behalf of large national underwriters and
through our title insurance venture called Censtar as well as
through a wholly owned underwriter, Title&nbsp;Resources
Guaranty Company. These policies are issued by our wholly and
partially owned agency operations that are licensed in
37&nbsp;states and Washington,&nbsp;D.C., with physical
locations in 24&nbsp;states. For policies issued through our
agency operations, we typically are liable only for the first
$5,000 of loss for such policies on a per claim basis.

Virtually all lenders require their borrowers to obtain title
insurance policies at the time mortgage loans are made on real
property. Title insurance policies state the terms and
conditions upon which a title underwriter will insure title to
real property. Such policies are issued on the basis of a
preliminary report or commitment. Such reports are prepared
after, among others, a search of public records, maps and other
relevant documents to ascertain title ownership and the
existence of easements, restrictions, rights of way, conditions,
encumbrances or other matters affecting the title to, or use of,
real property. To facilitate the preparation of preliminary
reports, copies of public records, maps and other relevant
historical documents are compiled and indexed in a title plant.
We subscribe to title information services provided by title
plants owned and operated by independent entities to assist us
in the preparation of preliminary title reports. In addition, we
own, lease or participate with other title insurance companies
or agents in the cooperative operation of such plants.

The terms and conditions upon which the real property will be
insured are determined in accordance with the standard policies
and procedures of the title underwriter. When our title agencies
sell title insurance, the title search and examination function
is performed by the agent. The title agent and underwriter split
the premium. The amount of such premium &#147;split&#148; is
determined by agreement between the agency and underwriter, or
is promulgated by state law. We have entered into underwriting
agreements with various underwriters which state the conditions
under which we may issue a title insurance policy on their
behalf.

Our lodging business derives a majority of its revenues from
franchise fees, which are composed of royalty fees and
marketing/reservation fees. The royalty fees are intended to
cover the use of our trademarks, our operating expenses, such as
expenses incurred for franchise services, including quality
assurance, administrative support and design and construction
advice, and to provide us with operating profits. The
marketing/reservation fees are intended to reimburse us for
expenses associated with providing certain other franchise
services, such as a central reservations system, national
advertising and marketing programs and certain training programs.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt;color: #000000; background: #ffffff; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-bottom: 0; ">
We use the marketing/reservation fees that franchisees pay to us
to promote our brands through media advertising, direct mail,
direct sales, promotions and publicity. Although the majority of
funds contributed by the franchisees of any one particular brand
are used to promote that brand, a share of the funds is
allocated to support the cost of multibrand promotional efforts
and to our sales and marketing department, which includes, among
others, our worldwide sales, public relations, loyalty and
direct marketing teams.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt;color: #000000; background: #ffffff; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-bottom: 0; ">
In the United States, United Kingdom and Ireland, we employ a
direct franchising model whereby we contract with and provide
services and reservations directly to independent
owner-operators. In other parts of the world, we generally
employ either a master franchise model, whereby we contract with
a qualified, experienced third party to build a franchise
enterprise in such third party&#146;s country or region, or a
direct franchising model. Our standard domestic franchise
agreement grants a franchisee the right to non-exclusive use of
our franchise system in the operation of a single hotel at a
specified location, typically for a period of 15 to
20&nbsp;years, with certain rights to the franchisor and
franchisee to terminate the franchise agreement before the
conclusion of the agreement&#146;s term under certain
circumstances, such as upon designated anniversaries of the
hotel&#146;s opening or the date of the agreement. We employ a
national franchise sales force that we compensate in part
through commissions.

We book rooms on behalf of our franchised hotels by telephone,
through the Internet and through global distribution systems in
addition to business generated from the use of our trademarks.
We maintain contact centers in Canada and South Dakota that
handle bookings generated through our toll-free brand numbers.
These centers are supplemented by outsourced call center support
in the Philippines. We maintain numerous brand web sites to
process online room reservations, and we process reservations
generated by travel agents and third-party Internet booking
sources, including Orbitz.com and CheapTickets.com. We also
provide direct connections between our central reservations
system and travel agencies and third-party Internet booking
sources. The majority of room nights are sold by our franchisees
on a walk-in basis or through calls made directly to their
hotels. We believe that this is attributable to the strength of
our lodging brands.

The TripRewards program, which was introduced in 2003, is the
lodging industry&#146;s largest loyalty program based on the
number of participating hotels. With more than 40 partners that
participate in the TripRewards program, TripRewards offers its
members options to accumulate points by staying in hotels
franchised under one of our nine lodging brands, renting Avis
and Budget rental cars and purchasing everyday products and
services from our various partners. When staying at hotels
franchised under one of our brands, TripRewards members may
elect to earn airline miles or rail points instead of TripReward
points. TripRewards members have more than 270 options to redeem
their points. Members, for example, may redeem their points for
hotel stays, airline tickets, resort vacations, electronics,
sporting goods, movie and theme park tickets and gift
certificates. TripRewards currently has more than four million
members.

Competition among the national lodging brand franchisors to grow
their franchise systems is intense. Our largest national lodging
brand competitors are the Holiday Inn and Best Western brands
and Choice Hotels, which franchises various brands, including
the Comfort Inn, Quality Inn and Econo Lodge brands. Our Wyndham
brand competes with brands in the upscale and upper upscale
segments of the lodging market, including Marriott, Hilton and
Starwood. Our Days Inn, Super&nbsp;8, Howard Johnson,
Travelodge, and Knights Inn brands compete with brands in the
economy segment of the lodging market. Our Wingate Inn, Ramada,
Howard Johnson and AmeriHost Inn brands compete with brands in
the middle segment of the lodging market.

We believe that competition for the sale of franchises in the
lodging industry is based principally upon the perceived value
and quality of the brand and of the services offered to
franchisees. We believe that the perceived value of a brand name
to prospective franchisees is, to some extent, a function of the
success of the brand&#146;s existing franchisees. We believe
that prospective franchisees value a franchise based upon their
view of the relationship between the costs, including costs of
affiliation and conversion and future charges, to the benefits,
including potential for increased revenue and profitability and
the reputation of the franchisor.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt;color: #000000; background: #ffffff; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-bottom: 0; ">
The ability of an individual franchisee to compete may be
affected by the location and quality of its property, the number
of competing properties in the vicinity, community reputation
and other factors. A franchisee&#146;s success may also be
affected by general, regional and local economic conditions. The
potential negative effect of these conditions on our results of
operations is substantially reduced by virtue of the diverse
geographical locations of our franchised properties.

In 2005, we combined our vacation exchange and vacation rental
businesses to form the Vacation Network Group, which is the
largest vacation exchange company in the world and a leading
global marketer of European vacation rental accommodations. The
Vacation Network Group has access to 55,000
vacation properties (with exclusive access to nearly all such
properties) for specified periods around the world and
serves leisure bound families with vacation exchange and rental
products. The properties available through our Vacation Network
Group include villas and cottages, bungalow parks and
campgrounds, vacation ownership condominiums and hotel suites,
city apartments and second homes, fractional private residences
and luxury destination clubs. The Vacation Network Group has 30
vacation accommodation brands and 50 worldwide offices.

Our Vacation Network Group primarily derives its revenues from
fees from the vacation exchange and rental businesses. Our
vacation exchange business, or RCI, charges its subscribers and
members an exchange fee for each transaction in addition to
annual subscription fees for the Endless Vacation magazine or
annual vacation exchange program dues, as applicable. Our
vacation rental business charges fees in the form of booking
fees or markups on income earned from booking vacation rentals.
Such fees generally range from approximately 25% to 50% of the
gross rent charged or pre-markup gross rent charged, as
applicable. Our vacation rental business also derives revenues
from travel insurance sales in Europe, transportation fees,
property management fees and
<FONT style="white-space: nowrap">on-site</FONT> revenue from
ancillary services.

RCI operates three worldwide exchange programs that have a
customer base of vacation owners who are generally well traveled
and affluent and want flexibility and variety in their travel
plans each year. RCI&#146;s three programs, which serve owners
of vacation ownership interests at affiliated resorts, are the
RCI Weeks exchange program, the RCI Points exchange program and
The Registry Collection exchange program.

RCI Weeks is the world&#146;s largest vacation ownership
exchange network based on the number of subscribers and
exchanges. The RCI Weeks exchange program provides subscribers
with the flexibility to trade vacation weeks in units at their
resorts for vacation weeks of comparable value in other resorts
or accommodations.

RCI Points is a global points-based exchange network. RCI Points
allocates points to vacation ownership intervals that
subscribers cede to the exchange program. An
&#147;interval&#148; is a portion of the use rights associated
with a vacation ownership interest (typically one week). Under
the RCI Points exchange program, subscribers may redeem their
points for the use of vacation properties in the exchange
program or for products other than the use of vacation
properties. Subscribers, for example, may redeem their points
for items such as airfare, car rentals, cruises, hotels and
other accommodations. When points are redeemed for these
services, RCI has the right to recoup the expense of providing
the services by renting the use of vacation properties for which
the subscribers could have redeemed their points.

The Registry Collection is a network of upscale or luxury
vacation accommodations, fractional ownership resorts,
condo-hotels and luxury yachts. Through The Registry Collection
exchange program, members can trade their vacation ownership
intervals through the use of credits for affiliated fractional
properties, other luxury assets, such as yachts and game lodges,
and a select set of timeshare properties that meet the Registry
Collection quality standards. The members of The Registry
Collection often own greater than two-week interests in
affiliated resorts.

We acquire subscribers and members, as applicable, of our three
worldwide exchange programs indirectly. For our two largest
programs (RCI Weeks and RCI Points) an affiliated resort
developer buys an RCI Endless Vacations magazine subscription
for purchasers of vacation ownership interests that entitles the
vacation ownership purchaser to receive periodicals and
directories published by RCI and to exchange vacation ownership
intervals for other intervals in the applicable RCI exchange
network for a stated period of time for an additional fee. For
our third program, (The Registry Collection), an affiliated
resort developer submits an enrollment application for the
purchaser of vacation ownership interests to become a member and
pays the initial annual dues. In most cases, subscription
renewals are paid directly by the member.

Our RCI subsidiary also provides consulting and advisory
services to affiliated resort developers and others for the
development and management of tourism related real estate,
loyalty programs, in-house and outsourced travel agency services
and third-party vacation club services. Our third-party vacation
club business consists of private label exchange clubs that RCI
operates and manages for certain of its larger affiliates. Club
management is a growing trend in the timeshare industry and a
growing piece of RCI&#146;s business. Approximately 90% of the
third-party clubs are points-based.

and the largest marketer of European vacation rental properties
(based on number of properties) with over 51,000 properties
worldwide under contract, which generally belong to unaffiliated
property owners. The properties that we market for rental are
principally privately owned villas, cottages, bungalows,
apartments and stationary caravans located in vacation parks. In
addition to these properties, we also market excess inventory
from our vacation exchange business, from developers of
timeshare resorts and from other sources. Rental properties are
marketed under proprietary brand names such as English Country
Cottages, French Life, Cuendet, Novasol, Canvas Holidays, Landal
GreenParks, CondoRental Network and Holiday Network and through
select private label arrangements.

Croatia, Eastern European countries and the Pacific Rim.
Property owners enter into one year, evergreen or multi-year
contracts with our vacation rental subsidiaries that market the
over 51,000&nbsp;rental properties in our portfolio. Our
vacation rental business also has an ownership interest in, or a
long-term rental commitment for, approximately 9% of the
properties in our rental portfolio. Through RCI, our vacation
rental business also has relationships with approximately 4,000
affiliated resorts and over three million owners of vacation
ownership interests. Most of our rental activity takes place in
Europe, the United States and Mexico, although we have the
ability to acquire and rent inventory in over 100 countries.

The Vacation Network Group services its customers primarily
through global call centers. The requests that we receive at our
global call centers are handled by our vacation guides, who are
highly skilled at fulfilling our customers&#146; requests for
vacation exchanges and rentals. When our customers&#146; primary
choices are unavailable in periods of high demand, our guides
offer the next nearest match in order to fulfill the
customers&#146; needs. Call centers are and are expected to
continue to be the Vacation Network Group&#146;s primary
distribution channel. Given the interest of some of our
customers in doing transactions on the Internet, we invest in
online technologies to ensure that our customers receive the
same level of service online that we provide through our call
centers. As our online distribution channel improves, customers
may shift from transacting business through our call centers to
transacting business online. As transacting business online
becomes more popular, we expect to experience cost savings at
our call centers.

Most customers of the Vacation Network Group book their
reservations eight to 15&nbsp;weeks in advance of their
departure date. Approximately 50% of departure dates fall during
the summer; therefore, most bookings are made during the first

some consumers have begun to book accommodations closer to their

Our timeshare business includes the sales and marketing of
vacation ownership interests, property management services to
property owners&#146; associations, consumer financing in
connection with the purchase by individuals of vacation
ownership interests and the development of timeshare resorts. We
have the largest timeshare business in the world as measured by
the numbers of timeshare resorts, timeshare units and owners of
vacation ownership interests. We operate our timeshare resorts
business through our two subsidiaries Fairfield Resorts, Inc.
and Trendwest Resorts, Inc. Although we operate Fairfield and
Trendwest as separate brands, we have integrated a majority of
the business functions of Fairfield and Trendwest, including
consumer finance, information technology, certain staff
functions, product development and certain marketing activities.
We believe that our timeshare subsidiaries are complementary in
terms of property locations, servicing and sales and marketing
operations. Our timeshare resorts business derives a majority of
its revenues from sales of vacation ownership interests and
derives other revenues from consumer financing and property
management. We have over 140 timeshare resorts in the United
States, Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean and the South Pacific that
represent more than 17,000 individual timeshare units and over
750,000 owners of vacation ownership and other real estate
interests. From time to time, we also sell home lots and other
real estate interests at our resorts.

Fairfield markets and sells vacation ownership interests in
Fairfield&#146;s portfolio of resorts and uses a points-based
reservation system called FairShare Plus to provide owners with
flexibility as to resort location, length of stay, unit type and
time of year. Fairfield is involved in the development of the
resorts in which Fairfield markets and sells vacation ownership
interests. Fairfield also often acts as a property manager of
the resorts in which Fairfield markets and sells vacation
ownership interests.

The vacation ownership interests that Fairfield markets and
sells consist of fixed weeks and undivided interests. A fixed
week entitles an owner to ownership and usage rights with
respect to a unit for a specific week of each year, whereas an
undivided interest entitles an owner to ownership and usage
rights that are not restricted to a particular week of the year.
These vacation ownership interests each constitute a deeded
interest in real estate and on average sold for approximately
$16,000 in 2005. From time to time, we also sell home lots and
other real estate interests at our resorts, however, this is not
a significant part of our business. Of the more than 750,000
owners of vacation ownership and other real estate interests in
Fairfield and Trendwest resorts as of December&nbsp;31, 2005,
approximately 500,000 owners held interests in Fairfield resorts.

Owners of vacation ownership interests pay annual maintenance
fees to the property owners&#146; associations responsible for
managing the applicable resorts. The annual maintenance fee
associated with the average vacation ownership interest
purchased ranges from approximately $300 to $650. These fees
generally are used to replace and renovate furnishings, pay for
operating costs, pay maintenance and cleaning costs, pay
management fees and expenses and cover taxes (in some states),
insurance and other related costs. Fairfield, as the owner of
unsold inventory at resorts, also pays maintenance fees to
property owners&#146; associations in accordance with the legal
requirements of the state in which the resort is located.

The property owners&#146; associations at Fairfield&#146;s
resorts typically contract with Fairfield, or an affiliate of
Fairfield, to manage the property. The manager oversees
maintenance of the physical structures, refurbishment of
individual units, maintenance and management of common areas and
recreational facilities and accounting for the property
owners&#146; associations. At some established sites, however,
the property owners&#146; associations have entered into
management contracts with professional management companies
other than Fairfield or its affiliates.

Fairfield uses a points-based internal reservation system called
FairShare Plus to provide owners with flexibility as to resort
location, length of stay, unit type and time of year. Owners of
vacation ownership interests in Fairfield resorts may elect, and
with respect to certain resorts are obligated, to participate in
FairShare Plus.

Owners who participate in FairShare Plus assign their rights to
use fixed weeks and undivided interests to a trust in exchange
for the right to reserve in the internal reservation system. The
number of points that a member receives as a result of the
assignment to the trust, and the number of points required to
take a particular vacation, is set forth on a published schedule
and varies depending on the resort location, length of stay,
unit type and time of year requested. Reservations are subject
to availability. Fairfield offers various programs that provide
existing owners with the opportunity to acquire additional
vacation ownership interests to increase the number of points
they can use.

Depending on the vacation ownership interest, Fairfield not only
offers owners the option to make reservations through FairShare
Plus, but also offers owners the opportunity to exchange their
vacation ownership interests through our subsidiary, RCI, or
through Interval International, a third party exchange company.

Trendwest markets and sells vacation ownership interests and
provides owners with flexibility as to resort location, length
of stay, unit type and time of year through WorldMark, The Club
and WorldMark, South Pacific Club, which we refer to
collectively as the Clubs. The vacation ownership interests that
Trendwest markets and sells consist of vacation credits
associated with resorts owned by the Clubs. Trendwest is
involved in the development of the resorts in which Trendwest
markets and sells vacation ownership interests. In addition to
developing resorts and marketing and selling vacation ownership
interests in the Clubs, Trendwest acts as the manager of the
Clubs.

Trendwest South Pacific, Pty. Ltd., a subsidiary of Trendwest,
conducts sales, marketing and resort development activities in
the South Pacific. Trendwest South Pacific is currently the
largest timeshare business in Australia, with approximately

Vacation credits in the Clubs are vacation ownership interests
that entitle the owner of the credits to reserve units at the
resorts owned by the Clubs. The Clubs own, operate and manage
the vacation properties that Trendwest develops and deeds to the
Clubs. In exchange for deeding the properties to the Clubs,
Trendwest receives the exclusive right to sell the vacation
credits associated with the properties and to retain the

proceeds from the sales. Although vacation credits do not
constitute deeded interests in real estate, vacation credits are
regulated in most jurisdictions by the same agency that
regulates timeshare programs evidenced by deeded interests in
real estate. As of December&nbsp;31, 2005, there were over
250,000 vacation credit owners, and, in 2005, the average
purchase by a new owner of vacation credits was approximately

Trendwest marketed and sold vacation ownership interests were
primarily located in the Western United States, Canada, Mexico
and the South Pacific and consisted of 69 resorts that
represented approximately 4,700&nbsp;units. Of the Trendwest
resorts and units, Trendwest South Pacific has a total of 12
resorts and over 400&nbsp;units. In 2005, Trendwest further
expanded the properties it markets to include properties in
Seattle, Washington, Sydney, Australia and New Zealand. In 2006,
Trendwest expects to expand the properties it markets to include
properties in Southeast Asia and additional properties in Canada.

Owners of vacation credits pay annual maintenance fees to the
Clubs. The annual maintenance fee associated with the average
vacation ownership interest purchased is approximately $480. The
maintenance fee that an owner pays is based on the number of the
owner&#146;s vacation credits. Trendwest has a minimal ownership
interest in both Clubs that results from Trendwest&#146;s
ownership of unsold vacation credits in the Clubs, and, as the
owner of unsold vacation credits, Trendwest pays maintenance
fees to the Clubs. The maintenance fees generally are used to
replace and renovate furnishings, pay maintenance and cleaning
costs, pay management fees and expenses and cover taxes,
insurance and other related costs.

The Clubs have entered into management agreements with Trendwest
that provide for Trendwest to act as the exclusive manager and
servicing agent of the vacation ownership programs. As manager
and servicing agent, Trendwest oversees the property management
and service of the resorts and performs certain administrative

provides for automatic one-year and five-year renewals,
respectively, unless such renewal is denied by a majority of the
voting power of the owners (excluding Trendwest).

Both Fairfield and Trendwest employ diverse marketing methods
and media to encourage prospective purchasers to attend sales
presentations. Typical marketing methods include vacation
packages, in-person solicitation and solicitation of resort

Internet marketing, affinity marketing and outbound
telemarketing. Although Fairfield and Trendwest are separate
brands, Fairfield and Trendwest obtain referrals from our
lodging and vehicle rental businesses.

In response to rules implemented by the U.S.&nbsp;Federal Trade
Commission concerning the creation and maintenance of national
&#147;do not call&#148; and &#147;do not fax&#148; registries,
Trendwest and Fairfield have developed and implemented plans to
block phone numbers listed on the registry and instituted new
procedures for preventing unsolicited telemarketing calls.
Following implementation of policies related to &#147;do not
call&#148; and &#147;do not fax&#148; regulation, Trendwest
experienced a decrease in tours by prospective owners at its
sales centers compared to periods prior to implementation of the
regulation. As a result of such regulation, Fairfield and

We are one of the largest vehicle rental operators in the world,
operating under two leading brands, Avis and Budget. We operate
Avis and Budget as separate brands, with differentiated
positioning, service and pricing. Avis is a leading supplier to
the business travel segment and Budget is a leading brand in
leisure travel. We perform certain administrative and
operational functions for both Avis and Budget on a combined
basis; these shared functions include fleet management, sales,
finance, tax, information systems and reservation services
through our contact centers. Furthermore, we provide Avis and
Budget locations with access to the Wizard System, our online
computer system, which is used by these locations for
(i)&nbsp;global reservations processing, (ii)&nbsp;rental
agreement generation and administration, and (iii)&nbsp;fleet

Avis and Budget rent a wide variety of makes and models of cars,
nearly all of which are the current or previous year&#146;s
models. We generally accept reservations only for a class of
vehicles. We rent cars on a daily, weekend, weekly, monthly or
multi-month basis, with rental charges computed on a limited or
unlimited mileage rate, or on a time rate plus a mileage charge.
Our rates vary at different locations depending on local
conditions and other competitive and cost factors. While cars
are usually returned to the locations from which they are
rented, we also allow one-way rentals from and to certain
locations. In addition to revenue from vehicle rentals and
franchisee royalties, we generate revenue from Avis and Budget
customers through the sale of optional products and services
such as supplemental equipment (such as child seats and ski
racks), loss damage waivers, additional/supplemental liability
insurance, personal accident/effects insurance and gas service
option and fuel service charges.

is comprised of approximately 3,000 locations. We own and
operate approximately 1,200 Avis car rental locations in both
airport and non-airport (downtown and suburban) locations in the
United States, Canada, Puerto Rico, the U.S.&nbsp;Virgin

Avis business generated total vehicle rental revenue of
approximately $3.2&nbsp;billion, of which approximately 85% (or
$2.7&nbsp;billion) was derived from U.S.&nbsp;operations. In
addition, we franchise the Avis System to independent business
owners in approximately 850 locations throughout the United
States, Canada, Latin America and the Asia Pacific region. In
2005, approximately 95% of the Avis System rental revenue in the
United States was generated by locations owned by us or operated
for us under agency arrangements with independent contractors
and the remainder was generated by locations operated by
independent franchisees. Independent franchisees generally pay
fees based either on total time and mileage charges or total

We also maintain strong relationships with the travel industry.
Avis offers customers the ability to earn frequent traveler
points with virtually all the major airlines. Avis is also
affiliated with the frequent traveler programs of various hotel
companies including Cendant&#146;s hotel brands, the Hilton
Hotels Corporation, Hyatt Corporation, and Starwood Hotels and
Resorts Worldwide, Inc. These arrangements provide various
incentives to program participants and cooperative marketing
opportunities for Avis and the airlines and hotels. We also have
an arrangement with Cendant&#146;s lodging and timeshare brands
and other hotel and airline companies whereby lodging customers
who are making reservations by telephone may be transferred to
Avis if they desire to rent a vehicle. Special customer offers
are also made available through various online portals such as
Orbitz and Travelocity. In addition, we have marketing
relationships with other companies looking to provide their
customers with value-added benefits such as American Express
Travel Related Services Company, Inc. and Sears, Roebuck and
Co., through which we offer incentives to rent from Avis. We
expect that our current marketing relationships with
Cendant&#146;s lodging brands and Orbitz will continue after the
completion of the Separation Plan through agreements to be
entered into in connection with the transaction.

who rent trucks to move household goods on either a one-way or
local basis. The light commercial sector consists of a wide
range of businesses that rent light to medium-duty trucks, which
we define as trucks having a gross vehicle weight of less than
26,000 pounds, for a variety of commercial applications. In
2005, our Budget truck rental business generated total vehicle
rental revenue of approximately $546&nbsp;million.

vehicles over the next three years. We generally hold a vehicle
in our domestic fleet for an average of approximately nine
months. For model year 2005, approximately 98.6% of our domestic
fleet vehicles were subject to repurchase programs. Under these

We maintain our airport locations through concession agreements
with various airport authorities that typically require the
payment of concession fees. In general, concession fees for
airport locations are based on a percentage of total
commissionable revenue (as determined by each airport
authority), subject to minimum annual guaranteed amounts.
Concessions are typically awarded by airport authorities every
three to five years based upon competitive bids. Our concession
agreements with the various airport authorities generally impose
certain minimum operating requirements, provide for relocation
in the event of future construction and provide for abatement of
the minimum annual guarantee in the event of extended low
passenger volume.

The vehicle rental industry is characterized by intense price
and service competition. In any given location, we and our
franchisees may encounter competition from national, regional
and local companies. Nationally, Avis&#146; principal competitor
is The Hertz Corporation and Budget&#146;s principal competitors
are Alamo Rent-A-Car, LLC and Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group,
Inc. for car rental, and U-Haul International, Inc. and Penske
Truck Leasing Corporation for truck rental. However, both Avis
and Budget also compete with each of these car rental companies
and with National Car Rental System, Inc. and Enterprise
Rent-A-Car Company. In addition, Avis and Budget compete with a
large number of smaller regional and local vehicle rental
companies throughout the country.

Competition in the U.S.&nbsp;vehicle rental operations business
is based primarily upon price, reliability, national
distribution, vehicle offerings, usability of booking systems,
ease of rental and return and other elements of customer
service. In addition, competition is influenced strongly by
advertising, marketing and brand reputation.

For our Avis and Budget businesses, the third quarter of the
year, which covers the summer vacation period, represents the
peak season for vehicle rentals. We increase our fleet size in
the summer months to accommodate, and benefit from, seasonal
changes in demand. Any occurrence that disrupts travel patterns
during the summer period could have a greater adverse effect on
Avis&#146; and Budget&#146;s annual performance than in other
periods. The first and fourth quarters are generally the weakest
financial quarters for the Avis and Budget Systems. In 2005, our
average monthly combined Avis and Budget domestic car rental
fleet, excluding franchisees, ranged from a low of approximately
267,800 vehicles in January to a high of approximately 367,700
vehicles in July. Rental utilization for the combined Avis and
Budget car rental fleet, which is based on the number of hours
vehicles are rented compared to the total number of hours
vehicles are available for rental, ranged from 66.8% in December
to 79.6% in August and averaged 75.5% for all of 2005.

Approximately 72% of TDS&#146;s revenue was generated by the B2B
businesses in 2005. Our B2B businesses primarily generate
revenue by charging travel suppliers booking fees for travel
products distributed through Galileo, fees for the distribution
of travel products through GTA, license, support and maintenance
based fees for our reservation based business and fees for other
travel services we provide.

Our B2C businesses primarily generate revenue by earning
commissions, service fees and incentive fees from consumers,
travel suppliers and travel content distributors, such as global

advertising fees from our online travel web sites.

In 2003, TDS was primarily an &#147;order taker&#148;, or
transaction processor for travel suppliers and travel agencies,
as TDS generated most of its revenue from our Galileo business.
In 2004, TDS focused on improving its position as an &#147;order
maker,&#148; or a direct provider of travel services to
consumers, acquiring Orbitz in the United States, as well as the
Flairview Travel business, which operates HotelClub.com and
RatesToGo.com. We continued our efforts to gain scope and
geographic reach in 2005 as an &#147;order maker&#148; by
acquiring Gullivers Travel Associates, OctopusTravel and
ebookers. Through these efforts, we believe that we have
attained the desired scope and geographic reach as a direct
seller of travel products and services that is necessary to
reach a much larger portion of the traveling population around
the world.

Through Galileo, we provide electronic global distribution
system (&#147;GDS&#148;) services for the travel industry using
sophisticated computerized reservation systems. Travel suppliers
such as airlines, hotel companies and car rental companies
store, display, manage and sell their products and services
through our GDS system. In the aggregate, Galileo provides GDS
services in approximately 130 countries to travel agencies and
other subscribers at approximately 52,000 locations. Our Galileo
subscribers are able to access schedule and fare information,
book reservations and issue tickets for nearly 500 airlines
through desktop systems and Internet-based connectivity.

We generate the vast majority of our Galileo revenue from
booking fees paid by travel suppliers. In 2005, we generated
approximately 93% of this booking fee revenue from airlines.
Other Galileo revenue sources include advertising revenue paid
by travel suppliers. In 2005, we generated approximately 70% of
our Galileo revenue from booking fees outside the United States.
Our travel agency subscribers represent a significant source of
bookings that result in booking fees payable by travel
suppliers, such as airlines, to Galileo. Bookings generated by
our five largest travel agency subscribers constituted
approximately 16% of the bookings made through Galileo in 2005.
Galileo also provides subscribers with information and booking
capabilities covering approximately 23 car rental companies,
approximately 260 hotel companies with approximately 63,000
properties and approximately 430 tour companies and major cruise
lines throughout the world. In 2005, Galileo processed
approximately 283&nbsp;million bookings.

We market, distribute and support our GDS products and services
for subscribers primarily through our internal sales and
marketing organizations (&#147;SMOs&#148;) throughout the world.
Our SMOs accounted for approximately 73% of our 2005 bookings.
In regions not supported directly by our SMOs, we provide our
products and services through our relationships with independent
national distribution companies (&#147;NDCs&#148;), which are
typically independently owned and operated by a local
travel-related business in the related country. Each NDC is
responsible for maintaining the relationship with subscribers in
its territory and providing ongoing customer support. We pay
each NDC a commission based upon the booking fees generated in

our bookings in 2005.

The global travel industry remains sensitive to the effects of
military conflict, terrorist threat alerts, continuing economic
pressures, pandemics and natural disasters, such as the
hurricanes that occurred in the Gulf Coast in the United States
in 2005. The continuing sensitivity to security, economic and
environmental concerns has given rise to greater volatility in
the travel industry. In addition, several major airlines have
experienced liquidity problems. Airlines, such as
U.S.&nbsp;Airways, Delta, Northwest and ATA, have sought, and
others may seek, bankruptcy protection. Therefore, the risk of
non-payment of GDS fees from travel suppliers could increase.
United Air Lines, Inc. (&#147;United&#148;), one of our largest
travel suppliers utilizing Galileo, emerged from bankruptcy
during the first quarter of 2006. Travel activity could be
further reduced if any of these conditions continue or
resurface, which could negatively impact our travel distribution
business.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt;color: #000000; background: #ffffff; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-bottom: 0; ">
In addition, many travel suppliers are focusing their efforts to
distribute more of their inventory directly to travelers,
particularly through their own web sites, bypassing GDSs and
travel agencies. Additional growth in supplier direct bookings
may reduce the overall market for third party GDS enabled
distribution. Further, travel suppliers continue to seek
reductions in third party distribution costs. Galileo entered
into a number of agreements with United States based airlines
such as United, American Airlines, U.S.&nbsp;Airways, Northwest
and Continental primarily in 2003, as part of its Preferred
Fares Select program and over the past three years has entered
into similar agreements with international carriers such as
British Airways, Swiss Air, Lufthansa, Scandinavian Airlines,
KLM, VLM Airlines and Qantas. Under these agreements, in return
for Galileo&#146;s agreement to charge reduced booking fees,
carriers provide Galileo with the same content which the carrier
makes publicly available elsewhere. Our U.S.&nbsp;agreements
generally expire in 2006 and our international agreements expire
over the next three years. Failure to renew or extend these
agreements in a timely manner and/or under similar terms and
conditions could negatively impact our results.

New providers have also entered the distribution marketplace,
offering direct connect solutions to carriers which enable
distribution directly between a carrier and travel agent or
corporation. Meaningful market penetration of such technology
providers could negatively impact our results by reducing the
number of bookings made through Galileo.

A number of carriers, generally known as low-cost airline
carriers, do not participate fully or at all with GDSs generally
and Galileo specifically. Additional growth of such carriers may
adversely impact Galileo&#146;s revenues.

On April&nbsp;1, 2005, we completed the acquisition of Donvand
Limited, which operates under the name of Gullivers Travel
Associates (&#147;GTA&#148;), for approximately
$1.2&nbsp;billion in cash (approximately $1.1&nbsp;billion net
of cash acquired) inclusive of transaction costs and expenses.
This acquisition also included OctopusTravel.com, which is
described in more detail in the &#147;B2C Businesses&#148;
section below. GTA is a leading wholesaler of accommodation,
ground travel and sightseeing products to travel agents who
resell to tour groups and independent travelers, servicing more
than 26,000 groups in 2005 and up to an average of 34,000
individuals per day. GTA operates through 32 offices across 24
countries, selling travel products in over 140 countries,
including the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia
and Australia. The addition of the GTA business significantly
increased our travel agency distribution capabilities and hotel
content offerings to travel agencies throughout the world. We
intend to cross sell Galileo services to customers of GTA. In
addition, we intend to expand GTA&#146;s customer base by
offering GTA&#146;s enhanced hotel content to Galileo&#146;s
travel agent subscribers and customers of our B2C businesses. We
are currently integrating the management, sales and
administrative functions of Galileo and GTA to more closely
align their offerings into a single business.

alternative travel product distribution channels which bypass
GDSs. These include travel suppliers that operate their own
computerized reservation systems on their own web sites,
technology providers that offer travel suppliers direct connect
solutions (which enable distribution directly between a travel
supplier and a travel agent or corporations) and certain
low-cost airline carriers who do not utilize a GDS distribution
channel. In addition, travelers are increasingly using the
Internet to make their own bookings, thereby shifting business
away from the traditional travel agency community.

Competition to attract and retain travel agency subscribers is
intense. As a result, we and other GDSs offer incentives to
travel agency subscribers if they achieve certain productivity

payments could result in the loss of some travel agency

<B>Franchise Regulation.</B> The Federal Trade Commission (the
&#147;FTC&#148;), various state laws and regulations and the
laws of jurisdictions outside the United States regulate the
offer and sale of franchises. The FTC requires that franchisors
make extensive written disclosure in a prescribed format to
prospective franchisees but does not require registration. The
state laws that affect our franchise businesses regulate the
offer and sale of franchises, the termination, renewal and
transfer of franchise agreements and the provision of loans to
franchisees as part of the sales of franchises. Currently,
19&nbsp;states have laws that require registration or disclosure
in connection with franchise offers and sales.

In addition, 20&nbsp;states currently have &#147;franchise
relationship&#148; laws that limit the ability of franchisors to
terminate franchise agreements or to withhold consent to the
renewal or transfer of these agreements. While our franchising
operations have not been materially adversely affected by such
existing regulation, we cannot predict the effect of any future
federal or state legislation or regulation.

Our franchisors may engage in certain lending transactions
common in their respective industries and provide loans to
franchisees as part of the sale of the franchise. Such
transactions may require the franchisor to register under a law
in California governing business lenders. Loans made by our
hotel franchise subsidiaries allow the hotel franchisors to be
exempt from such registration. Loans made for the benefit of our
real estate franchise subsidiaries are not exempt, and as a
result, one of our subsidiaries, which is a registered lender
under such law, makes those loans to real estate franchisees in
California.

<B>Real Estate Regulation.</B> The federal Real Estate
Settlement Procedures Act (&#147;RESPA&#148;) and state real
estate brokerage laws restrict payments which real estate
brokers, title agencies, mortgage brokers and other settlement
service providers may receive or pay in connection with the
sales of residences and referral of settlement services (e.g.,
mortgages, homeowners insurance and title insurance). Such laws
may to some extent restrict preferred alliance and other
arrangements involving our real estate franchise, real estate
brokerage, settlement services and relocation businesses.
Currently, there are local efforts in certain states, which
could limit referral fees to our relocation business. In
addition, with respect to our real estate brokerage, relocation
and title and settlement services businesses, RESPA and similar
state laws require timely disclosure of certain relationships or
financial interests with providers of real estate settlement
services.

federal, state and local laws and regulations that contain
general standards for and prohibitions on the conduct of real
estate brokers and sales associates, including those relating to

states, title insurance rates are either promulgated by the
state or are required to be filed with each state by the agent
or underwriter, and some states promulgate the split of title
insurance premiums between the agent and underwriter. States
sometimes unilaterally lower the insurance rates relative to
loss experience and other relevant factors. States also require
title agencies and title underwriters to meet certain minimum
financial requirements for net worth and working capital. In
addition, each of our insurance underwriters is subject to a
holding company act in its state of domicile, which regulates,
among other matters, investment policies and the ability to pay
dividends. As an insurance company, TRGC is subject to insurance
company regulation, including maintaining minimum capital

<B>Privacy and Data Collection Regulation.</B> The collection
and use of personal data of our customers and our ability to
contact potential customers via telephone or facsimile, unless
we have a preexisting relationship with customers, are governed
by privacy laws and regulations enacted in the United States and
in other jurisdictions around the world. Privacy regulations
continue to evolve and on occasion may be inconsistent from one
jurisdiction to another. Many states have introduced legislation
or enacted laws and regulations that require strict compliance
with standards for data collection and protection of privacy and
provide for penalties for failure to notify consumers when such
standards are breached, even by third parties. The FTC adopted
&#147;do not call&#148; and &#147;do not fax&#148; regulations
in October 2003. In compliance with such regulations, our
affected businesses have developed and implemented plans to
block phone numbers listed on the &#147;do not call&#148; and
&#147;do not fax&#148; registries and have instituted new
procedures for preventing unsolicited telemarketing calls. In
response to &#147;do not call&#148; and &#147;do not fax&#148;

solicitation laws, may limit our ability to solicit new
customers or to market additional products or services to
existing customers. In addition, some of our business units use
sweepstakes and contests as part of their marketing and
promotional programs. These activities are regulated primarily
by state laws that require certain disclosures, financial
support and assurances that the prizes will be available to the
winners. We are also aware of, and are actively monitoring the
status of, certain proposed state legislation related to privacy
and email marketing. It is unclear at this point what effect, if
any, such state legislation may have on our businesses.
California, in particular, has enacted legislation that requires
enhanced disclosure on Internet web sites regarding consumer
privacy and information sharing among affiliated entities. We
cannot predict whether these laws will affect our practices with
respect to customer information and inhibit our ability to
market our products and services nor can we predict whether
other states will enact similar laws.

<B>Persons with Disabilities Regulation.</B> The Americans with
Disabilities Act, or ADA, requires public accommodations, such
as lodging and restaurant facilities, to (i)&nbsp;offer
facilities without discriminating against persons with
disabilities, (ii)&nbsp;offer auxiliary aids and services to
persons with hearing, vision or speech disabilities who would
benefit from such services without fundamentally altering the
nature of the goods or services offered and (iii)&nbsp;remove
barriers to mobility or communication to the extent readily
achievable. The United States Department of Justice published
&#147;Standards for Accessible Design&#148; and
&#147;Accessibility Guidelines,&#148; collectively referred to
as ADAAG, that, among other things, prescribe a specified number
of handicapped accessible hotel rooms, assistive devices for
hearing, speech and visually impaired persons and general
standards of design applicable to all areas of facilities. The
ADAAG specifies the minimum hotel room design and layout
criteria for handicapped accessible hotel rooms. Any newly
constructed facility (first occupied after January&nbsp;26,
1993) must comply with ADAAG and be readily accessible to and
useable by persons with disabilities. The owner of each facility
and its contractors are responsible for ADA and ADAAG compliance.

We are subject to extensive regulation by states&#146;
departments of commerce and/or real estate and international
regulatory agencies in locations where our resorts are located
or where we market and sell vacation ownership interests. Many
states regulate the marketing and sale of vacation ownership
interests, and the laws of such states generally require a
designated state authority to approve a timeshare public report,
which is a detailed offering statement describing the resort
operator and all material aspects of the resort and the sale of
vacation ownership interests. In addition, the laws of most
states in which we sell vacation ownership interests grant the
purchaser of such an interest the right to rescind a contract of
purchase at any time within a statutory rescission period, which
generally ranges from three to 15&nbsp;days, depending on the
state.

<B>Vacation Exchange Regulation.</B> We are subject to statutes
in certain states that regulate vacation exchange services and

vacation exchange business is not generally subject to state
statutes governing the development of vacation ownership
properties and the sale of vacation ownership interests, such
statutes directly affect the members and resorts that
participate in our vacation exchange programs. These statutes,
therefore, indirectly affect our vacation exchange business. In
addition, several states and localities are attempting to enact
or have enacted laws or regulations that impose or would impose
taxes on exchange guests similar to local transient occupancy
taxes. While most such attempts to enact these taxes have
failed, a few isolated resort destinations have imposed such
exchange taxes.

<B>Internet Regulation.</B> We must also comply with laws and

An increasing number of laws and regulations apply directly to
the Internet and commercial online services. For example,
<FONT style="white-space: nowrap">e-mail</FONT> activities are
subject to the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited
Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003, or the CAN-SPAM Act. The
CAN-SPAM Act regulates the sending of unsolicited, commercial
electronic mail by requiring the sender to (i)&nbsp;include an
identifier that the message is an advertisement or solicitation
if the recipient did not expressly agree to receive electronic
mail messages from the sender, (ii)&nbsp;provide the recipient
with an online opportunity to decline to receive further
commercial electronic mail messages from the sender and
(iii)&nbsp;list a valid physical postal address of the sender.
The CAN-SPAM Act also prohibits predatory and abusive electronic
mail practices and electronic mail with deceptive headings or
subject lines. Moreover, there is currently great uncertainty
whether or how existing laws governing issues such as property
ownership, sales and other taxes, libel and personal privacy
apply to the Internet and commercial online services. It is
possible that laws and regulations may be adopted to address
these and other issues. Further, the growth and development of
the market for online commerce may prompt calls for more
stringent consumer protection laws.

New laws or different applications of existing laws would likely
impose additional burdens on companies conducting business

and the generation, storage, transportation and off-site
treatment or disposal of solid or liquid wastes. We operate 446
Avis and Budget locations at which petroleum products are stored
in underground or above ground tanks. We have instituted an
environmental compliance program designed to ensure that these
tanks are in compliance with applicable technical and
operational requirements, including the replacement and upgrade
of underground tanks to comply with the December 1998
Environmental Protection Agency upgrade mandate and periodic
testing and leak monitoring of underground storage tanks. We
believe that the locations where we currently operate are in
compliance, in all material respects, with such regulatory
requirements.

of loss damage waivers. To date, 24&nbsp;states have enacted
legislation which requires disclosure to each customer at the
time of rental that damage to the rented vehicle may be covered
by the customer&#146;s personal automobile insurance and that
loss damage waivers may not be necessary. In addition, New York
permits the sale of loss damage waivers at a capped rate per day

Because our vehicle rental business has captive insurance
companies, we are also subject to regulation under the insurance

are subsidiaries of insurance holding companies to register and
file certain reports including information concerning their
capital structure, ownership, financial condition and general
business operations with the state regulatory authority, and
require prior regulatory agency approval of changes in control
of an insurer and inter-corporate transfers of assets within the
holding company structure. Such insurance statutes also require
that we obtain limited licenses to sell optional insurance
coverage to our customers at the time of rental.

&#147;franchise relationship laws&#148; or &#147;business
opportunity laws&#148; that limit the ability of franchisors to
terminate franchise agreements or to withhold consent to the
referral or transfer of these agreements. While we believe that
our franchising operations are in compliance with such existing
regulations, we cannot predict the effect any existing or future
legislation or regulation may have on our business operation or
financial condition.

Our real estate brokerage business, our relocation business, our
title and settlement service business, our timeshare resorts
business and the businesses of our real estate franchisees must
comply with the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act
(&#147;RESPA&#148;). RESPA and comparable state statutes, among
other things, restrict payments which real estate brokers,
agents and other settlement service providers may receive in
connection with the referral of business to other settlement
services providers in connection with closing of real estate
transactions. Such laws may to some extent restrict preferred
vendor arrangements involving our franchisees and our company
owned brokerage business. Additionally, as noted above, our
title and settlement services and relocation businesses must
comply with RESPA and similar state insurance and other laws.
RESPA and similar state laws require timely disclosure of
certain relationships or financial interests that a broker has
with providers of real estate settlement services. There is a
risk that interpretations will be adopted in the future that
could make compliance more difficult or expensive. There is also
a risk that a change in current laws could permit the entrance
of new competitors, some of which may have greater resources
than we do. In September 2005, the Justice Department filed a
lawsuit against the National Association of Realtors, of which
our company owned brokerages and franchisees are members,
asserting that certain adopted rules regarding the sharing of
online property listings between real estate brokers in the
marketplace are anti-competitive. The Justice Department
contends that the rules give an unfair advantage to traditional
brokers at the expense of

Our timeshare resorts business is subject to extensive
regulation by the states and countries in which our resorts are
located and in which our timeshare properties are marketed and
sold. In addition, our timeshare resorts business is subject to
federal regulation, including the federal Telemarketing Sales
Rule with its &#147;do not call&#148; and &#147;do not fax&#148;
regulations. Many states have laws and regulations regarding the
sale of timeshare properties, such as real estate licensing
laws, travel sales licensing laws, anti-fraud laws,
telemarketing laws, telephone solicitation laws, including
&#147;do not call&#148; and &#147;do not fax&#148; regulations
and restrictions on the use of predictive dialers, prize, gift
and sweepstakes laws and labor laws. Violations of certain
provisions of these laws may limit the ability of our timeshare
resorts business to market, sell and finance our timeshare
properties or to collect all, or a part of, the principal of, or
interest on, loans made to finance the purchase of our timeshare
properties by consumers.

Our GDS business is also subject to risks with respect to the
deregulation in the European Union, where currently rules are in

discriminate among GDSs could negatively impact our travel

Our B2C businesses must comply with laws and regulations
applicable to online commerce and the sale of air
transportation. Increased regulation of the Internet or air
transportation or different applications of existing laws might
slow the growth in the use of the Internet and commercial online
services, or could encumber the sale of air transportation,
which could decrease demand for our products, increase the cost
of doing business or otherwise reduce our sales and revenues.
New laws, regulations or judicial decisions may impose on us
additional risks and costs of operations. In addition, our
domestic B2C businesses may be affected by the position being
taken by several state and local tax authorities that taxes they
impose on hotel occupancies apply to the compensation we receive
for hotel reservations booked under our merchant model and not
just to the amounts ultimately paid to the hotel. While we do
not believe that our fees are subject to these taxes, if any or
all of the jurisdictions rule that our domestic B2C businesses
are subject to these taxes (either retroactively, prospectively
or both), it could increase our costs or decrease demand for our
products.

In addition, regulatory authorities have relatively broad
discretion to grant, renew and revoke licenses and approvals and
to implement regulations. Accordingly, such regulatory
authorities could prevent or temporarily suspend us from
carrying on some or all of our activities or otherwise penalize
us if our practices were found not to comply with the then
current regulatory or licensing requirements or any

Our failure to comply with any of these requirements or

Some travel suppliers are seeking to decrease their reliance on
travel distributors, including GDSs such as Galileo. Travel
suppliers may give advantages to travel distributors in which
they have an economic stake or may create or expand commercial
relationships with online and traditional travel agencies that
work with travel suppliers to directly book travel with those
suppliers. Many airlines, hotels, car rental companies and
cruise operators have established their own travel distribution
web sites. Several suppliers have formed joint ventures that
offer multi-supplier travel distribution web sites. From time to
time, travel suppliers offer advantages, such as bonus miles,
lower transaction fees, priority waitlist clearance,
<FONT style="white-space: nowrap">e-ticketing</FONT> or
discounted prices, when their products and services are
purchased from these supplier-related web sites. Some of these
offerings are not available to unrelated travel distributors, or
those travel distributors must provide lower distribution
pricing in exchange for access to the offerings. In addition,
the airline industry has experienced a shift in segment share
from full-service carriers to low-price carriers. Some low-cost
carriers do not distribute their tickets through our GDS or
through other third-party travel distributors.

In addition, a new breed of competitors is entering the online

companies and <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">start-ups</FONT>
are attempting to enter the online travel marketplace by
leveraging search technology to aggregate travel search results

We rely on participating carrier agreements with our U.S. and
international airline suppliers, such as our Preferred Fares
Select agreements in the United States and similar agreements
abroad, and these agreements contain terms that provide
discounted pricing. None of these arrangements is exclusive and
airline suppliers could enter into, and in some cases may have
entered into, similar agreements with our competitors. In
addition, the agreements we have with our U.S. and international
airline suppliers will expire by their terms in 2006 and over
the next three years, respectively, unless they are extended or
replaced, which we cannot guarantee will occur.

We cannot assure you that our arrangements with our travel
suppliers will remain in effect on current or similar terms,
that the net impact of future pricing options will not adversely
impact revenue, or that any of these suppliers will continue to
supply us with the same level of access to inventory of travel
offerings in the future. Because our major airline relationships
represent such a large part of our business, the loss of any of
these relationships, including due to the bankruptcy of an
airline, could have a material negative impact on our business.
If our access to inventory or features is affected, or our
ability to offer their inventory on comparatively favorable
economic terms is diminished, it could have a material adverse
effect on the business, financial condition or results of
operations of our travel distribution businesses.

<B><I>We face risks of increased fleet costs, both generally and

Vehicle depreciation represents approximately 26% of our
aggregate expenses and can vary from year to year based on the
prices at which we are able to purchase and dispose of rental
vehicles. During 2005, 2004 and 2003, 98.0%, 98.6% and 99.6%,
respectively, of the cars purchased for our domestic car fleet
were the subject of agreements requiring automobile
manufacturers to repurchase them. We refer to cars subject to
such agreements as &#147;program cars&#148;. Under these
repurchase programs, automobile manufacturers agree to
repurchase cars at a specified price during a specified time
period, typically subject to certain car condition and mileage
requirements. Repurchase programs, therefore, enable us to
determine, in advance, our depreciation expense, which is a
significant cost factor in our car rental operations. Repurchase
programs, therefore, limit the risk to us that the market value
of a car at the time of its disposition will be less than its
estimated residual (or depreciated) value at such time.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt;color: #000000; background: #ffffff; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-bottom: 0; ">
There can be no assurance that the automobile manufacturers will
continue to sell cars to us subject to repurchase programs at
all or on terms consistent with past practice. Should the
percentage of our car rental fleet subject to repurchase
programs decrease, we would expect to bear increased risk
relating to the residual market value of our car rental fleet
and car depreciation, which could have a material adverse effect
on our results of operations and financial condition. Under such
a circumstance, we would have to find an alternate method of
disposition of the additional non-program cars, which could
significantly increase our overall fleet expenses and decrease
our proceeds on sales. The overall cost of cars subject to
repurchase programs could also increase if the manufacturers
were to make changes to these programs, particularly if such
changes were to result in a decrease in the repurchase price
without a corresponding decrease to the original purchase price.
Repurchase programs also generally provide us with flexibility
to reduce the size of our fleet rapidly in response to an
economic downturn or changes in demand by returning cars sooner
that originally expected. This flexibility may be reduced in the
future to the extent the percentage of program cars in our car
rental fleet decreases or this feature of repurchase programs is
altered.

As of December&nbsp;31, 2005, 63% and 21% of our program cars
were manufactured by General Motors Corporation and Ford Motor
Company, respectively. A default on any repurchase agreement,
particularly with respect to GM or Ford, might also leave us
with a substantial unpaid claim against the manufacturer with
respect to program cars that were sold and returned to the car
manufacturer but for which we were not paid, as well as
potential additional expenses if the prices at which we were
able to dispose of program cars were less than the specified
prices under the repurchase program. Any increased risk with
respect to the likelihood of these defaults could also impact
our ability to finance the purchase of cars to maintain our car
rental fleet.

November&nbsp;15, 2002, Cendant and Richard A. Smith, one of our
officers, were added as defendants in a purported class action.
The 26 other defendants in such action include Homestore.com,
Inc., certain of its officers and directors and its auditors.
Such action was filed on behalf of persons who purchased stock
of Homestore.com (an Internet-based provider of residential real
estate listings) between January&nbsp;1, 2000 and
December&nbsp;21, 2001. The complaint in this action alleges
violations of Sections&nbsp;10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act
based on purported misconduct in connection with the accounting
of certain revenues in financial statements published by
Homestore during the class period. On March&nbsp;7, 2003, the
court granted our motion to dismiss lead plaintiff&#146;s claim
for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted
and dismissed the complaint, as against us and Mr.&nbsp;Smith,
with prejudice. On March&nbsp;8, 2004, the court entered final
judgment, thus allowing for an appeal to be made regarding its
decision dismissing the complaint against Cendant,
Mr.&nbsp;Smith and others. Oral argument of the appeal took
place on February&nbsp;6, 2006.

regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.11&nbsp;per common share,
payable March&nbsp;14, 2006 to stockholders of record as of
February&nbsp;27, 2006. Our Board has also determined to suspend
any further cash dividends in anticipation of our plan to
distribute to Cendant stockholders the stock of our Real Estate
Services, Hospitality Services (including the current Timeshare
Resorts segment) and Travel Distribution Services companies in
the second, third and fourth quarters of 2006, respectively. The
dividend policies relating to each of the entities to be
distributed by Cendant will be determined by the Boards of
Directors of such companies, and are expected to take into
account each new company&#146;s capitalization and credit rating.

we acquired NRT Incorporated and Trendwest Resorts, Inc., which
resulted in goodwill of approximately $1.6&nbsp;billion and
$687&nbsp;million, respectively. If we had acquired NRT and
Trendwest on January&nbsp;1, 2002, net revenues, income from
continuing operations and net income would have been
approximately $12.3&nbsp;billion, $658&nbsp;million and
$798&nbsp;million, respectively, on a pro forma basis during
2002. In 2001, we acquired Avis Group Holdings, Inc. and Galileo
International, Inc., which resulted in goodwill of approximately
$1.9&nbsp;billion and $2.0&nbsp;billion, respectively. If we had
acquired Avis, Galileo, NRT and Trendwest on January&nbsp;1,
2001, net revenues, income from continuing operations and net
income would have been approximately $11.1&nbsp;billion,
$204&nbsp;million and $451&nbsp;million, respectively, on a pro
forma basis during 2001. Pro forma results for 2002 and 2001
each include $221&nbsp;million of amortization expense relating
to acquired pendings and listings intangible assets. Due to the
short-term amortization period of the pendings and listings
intangible asset, the amortization of this asset would impact

$285&nbsp;million and $108&nbsp;million in 2005, 2004, 2003,
2002 and 2001, respectively. See Note&nbsp;5 to our Consolidated
Financial Statements for a detailed description of the charges
recorded in 2005, 2004 and 2003. The 2002 charges primarily
related to the amortization of our contractual pendings and
listings intangible assets related to the acquisition of NRT and
its subsequent acquisitions of real estate brokerage businesses.
The 2001 charges primarily related to the outsourcing of
Galileo&#146;s global distribution system, desktop support and

of our travel agency business with Galileo&#146;s computerized
reservation system.

$425&nbsp;million ($256&nbsp;million, after tax) associated with
our Travel Distribution businesses (see Note&nbsp;2 to our
Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion
of this charge). We also incurred a non-cash impairment charge
of $180&nbsp;million recorded in January 2005 to reflect a
portion of the difference between the carrying value and market
value of PHH as a result of the spin-off (see
Note&nbsp;24&#151;Spin-off of PHH&nbsp;Corporation).

In 2005, we recorded $50&nbsp;million of restructuring and
transaction-related charges, of which $47&nbsp;million was
incurred as a result of restructuring activities undertaken

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (&#147;SFAS&#148;)
No.&nbsp;142, &#147;Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.&#148;
Accordingly, our results of operations for 2001 reflect the
amortization of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets,
while our results of operations for 2005, 2004, 2003 and 2002 do
not reflect such amortization. Had we applied the

In 2005, we continued the strategic realignment we commenced in
early 2004, which was undertaken to simplify our business model
through exiting non-core businesses or businesses that produced
volatility to our earnings inconsistent with our business model
and the remainder of our core businesses. We began this
strategic realignment by completing the initial public offering
of Jackson Hewitt Tax Service Inc. in June 2004, raising
$772&nbsp;million of cash, and acquiring Orbitz, Inc., an online
travel company, for approximately $1.3&nbsp;billion in November
2004. We completed the spin-off of our former mortgage, fleet
leasing and appraisal businesses in a tax-free distribution of
the common stock of PHH Corporation to our stockholders in
January 2005. In February 2005, we completed an initial public
offering of Wright Express Corporation, raising
$964&nbsp;million of cash, and acquired ebookers plc, a travel
agency, for $454&nbsp;million. We then completed the
acquisitions of Gullivers Travel Associates and Octopus Travel
Group Limited (collectively &#147;Gullivers&#148;), a wholesaler
and global online travel company, in April 2005 for
approximately $1.2&nbsp;billion, and in October 2005, we
completed the sale of our Marketing Services division, which was
comprised of our former individual membership and
loyalty/insurance marketing businesses, for approximately
$1.7&nbsp;billion of cash (approximately $1.8&nbsp;billion of
gross proceeds), representing the culmination of our strategic
realignment.

In connection with the completion of this strategic realignment,
our management team and Board of Directors, with the aid of
financial and legal advisors, performed a comprehensive review
of the growth opportunities and current market valuations for
each of our core businesses. As a result of this review, during
fourth quarter 2005, our Board of Directors approved a plan to
separate Cendant into four independent, publicly traded
companies:

We believe that this strategy provides the greatest opportunity
for our businesses and brands to achieve their full potential.
Additionally, we anticipate that the separation of our core
businesses will facilitate a clearer understanding and more
precise market valuation of each of these businesses.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt;color: #000000; background: #ffffff; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-bottom: 0; ">
The separation is expected to be effected through three
spin-offs and is expected to be tax-free for Cendant and its
shareholders. We expect to incur material costs in connection
with executing this plan (during 2005 these costs amounted to
$16&nbsp;million).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt;color: #000000; background: #ffffff; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-bottom: 0; ">
We currently expect the spin-off of the new Real Estate Services
company to occur in second quarter 2006 followed by the spin-off
of the new Hospitality Services company in third quarter 2006.
The new Travel Distribution company is expected to be spun-off
in October 2006. There can be no assurances, however, that the
plan of separation will be completed. Completion of the
contemplated separation is subject to various risks. For a
discussion of these risks, see &#147;Item&nbsp;1A&#151;Risk
Factors.&#148;

In the meantime, our management team remains committed to
increasing shareholder value. In 2005, we used approximately
$1.1&nbsp;billion of cash, net of proceeds from option
exercises, to repurchase our common stock and $423&nbsp;million
of cash to pay dividends. We expect to continue to repurchase
shares within the confines of our repurchase program.
Additionally, our first quarter 2006 dividend payment of
11&nbsp;cents per share has already been approved by our Board
of Directors. The Board has suspended any further cash dividends
for the remainder of 2006 in anticipation of our separation
plan. The dividend policies relating to each of the new publicly
traded companies will be determined by the Boards of Directors
of such companies.

Finally, we remain focused on growing profitability within each
of these new companies before and after the separation. To this
end, we have established transition teams that are principally
responsible for planning, organizing and implementing the series
of transition services and other agreements that are going to be
necessary to support the individual companies. With these teams
in place, our operating executives remain focused on delivering
profitability and positioning our businesses for long-term
growth.

Discussed below are our consolidated results of operations and
the results of operations for each of our reportable segments.
Generally accepted accounting principles require us to segregate
and report as discontinued operations for all periods presented
the account balances and activities of Jackson Hewitt, our
former fleet leasing and appraisal businesses, Wright Express,
and our former Marketing Services division. Although we no
longer own our former mortgage business, we cannot classify such
business as a discontinued operation due to our participation in
a mortgage origination venture that was established with PHH in
connection with our spin-off of PHH in January 2005.

The reportable segments presented below represent our operating
segments for which separate financial information is available
and which is utilized on a regular basis by our chief decision
maker to assess performance and to allocate resources. In
identifying our reportable segments, we also consider the nature
of services provided by our operating segments. Management
evaluates the operating results of each of our reportable
segments based upon revenue and &#147;EBITDA,&#148; which is
defined as income from continuing operations before non-program
related depreciation and amortization, non-program related
interest, amortization of pendings and listings, income taxes
and minority interest. Our presentation of EBITDA may not be
comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies.

Net revenues and total expenses increased approximately
$1.5&nbsp;billion (9%) and $2.2&nbsp;billion (15%),
respectively, in 2005 as compared with 2004, reflecting organic
revenue growth across all our segments, particularly within our
Vehicle Rental and Real Estate Services segments, the
acquisitions of strategic businesses subsequent to
January&nbsp;1, 2004 and other items discussed below, including
a $425&nbsp;million non-cash impairment charge recorded within
our Travel Distribution Services segment and a $180&nbsp;million
non-cash valuation charge associated with our spin-off of PHH in
January 2005.

The largest contributor to organic revenue growth year-over-year
was our Vehicle Rental segment, reflecting strong demand at both
our domestic and international operations. We experienced
greater time and mileage revenue principally as a result of a
14%&nbsp;increase in the number of days a car was rented
domestically and a 17%&nbsp;increase in the number of days a car
was rented internationally. Our Real Estate Services segment
also experienced strong organic revenue growth year-over-year
primarily as a result of a 14%&nbsp;increase in the average
price of home sales at our brokerage business, partially offset
by a 7%&nbsp;decrease in the number of homesale transactions.
Revenues at our Timeshare Resorts segment also grew organically
principally driven by a 9% increase in tour flow, a
6%&nbsp;increase in revenue per guest and increased consumer
finance income. Organic growth at our Hospitality Services
segment resulted from an 8%&nbsp;increase in organic revenue per
available room within our lodging business, as well as a
5%&nbsp;increase in worldwide subscribers and a
21%&nbsp;increase in points and rental transaction volume within
our vacation exchange business. We also experienced moderate
organic revenue growth within our Travel Distribution Services
business primarily due to a 23%&nbsp;increase in online gross
bookings. Expenses increased throughout all of our core
operating segments as a result of organic growth primarily to
support additional volume, higher vehicle costs and additional
marketing investments. Apart from organic growth, the strategic
businesses we acquired subsequent to January&nbsp;1, 2004
contributed to the year-over-year increase in net revenues and
total expenses as follows:

Partially offsetting these revenue and expense increases was the
absence of eleven months of revenues generated and expenses
incurred by our former mortgage business, which was disposed of
on January&nbsp;31, 2005. Our former mortgage business
contributed $656&nbsp;million and $584&nbsp;million of revenues
and expenses, respectively, to our results during the period
February&nbsp;1, 2004 through December&nbsp;31, 2004.

The increase in total expenses also reflects the following
charges recorded during 2005: (i)&nbsp;a $425&nbsp;million
($256&nbsp;million, after tax) non-cash impairment charge
associated with our travel distribution businesses (see
Note&nbsp;2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a
detailed discussion of this charge), (ii)&nbsp;a
$180&nbsp;million non-cash impairment charge relating to the PHH
spin-off, (iii)&nbsp;charges aggregating $50&nbsp;million
primarily relating to restructuring activities undertaken
following the PHH spin-off and initial public offering of Wright
Express and (iv)&nbsp;$16&nbsp;million of charges incurred in
connection with our plan to separate Cendant into four
independent, public companies. Partially offsetting these
charges is a decrease of $74&nbsp;million in interest expense
primarily relating to the reversal of $73&nbsp;million of
accrued interest associated with the resolution of amounts due
under a litigation settlement reached in 1999, as well as an
overall reduction in debt extinguishment costs incurred in 2004,
which were partially offset by $21&nbsp;million of interest
expense recorded in fourth quarter 2005 as a result of a legal
settlement related to a claim against a business we acquired in
2001. Our effective tax rate for continuing operations was 35.2%
and 32.9% for 2005 and 2004, respectively. The change in the
effective tax rate for 2005 was primarily due to the
non-deductibility of the valuation charge associated with the
PHH spin-off and a one-time tax expense associated with the
planned repatriation of foreign earnings, which was partially
offset by a tax benefit related to changes in tax basis
differences in assets of foreign subsidiaries and a tax rate
differential associated with the non-cash impairment charge
recorded within our Travel Distribution Services segment. As a
result of the above-mentioned items, income from continuing
operations decreased $496&nbsp;million (36%).

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt;color: #000000; background: #ffffff; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-bottom: 0; ">
Income from discontinued operations decreased $492&nbsp;million,
which primarily reflects (i)&nbsp;a decrease of $64&nbsp;million
due to net income generated by Jackson Hewitt prior to its
disposition in June 2004 (since its results were included for
six months in 2004 but not at all in 2005), (ii)&nbsp;a decrease
of $117&nbsp;million due to net income generated by our former
fleet leasing and appraisal businesses (since their results were
included for twelve months in 2004 but only one month in 2005
and due to a $24&nbsp;million tax-related charge recorded in
2005), (iii)&nbsp;a decrease of $54&nbsp;million due to net
income generated by Wright Express (since its results were
included for twelve months in 2004 but only through
February&nbsp;22, 2005 in 2005), and (iv)&nbsp;a decrease of
$257&nbsp;million in net income generated by our Marketing
Services division, which principally reflects the reversal of a
tax valuation allowance of $121&nbsp;million in January 2004, a
$30&nbsp;million charge recorded during 2005 in connection with
a breach of contract claim and the absence in 2005 of
$41&nbsp;million of income recorded in 2004 in connection with
the early termination of two contractual relationships with
third party marketing partners and the sale of commission rights
associated with long-term preferred care insurance policies that
were previously sold.

The net gain we recognized on the disposal of discontinued
operations increased $255&nbsp;million year-over-year, which
includes a $581&nbsp;million gain recognized in connection with
the sale of our former Marketing Services division during 2005
and a $184&nbsp;million gain recognized during 2005 in
connection with the initial public offering of Wright Express,
partially offset by (i)&nbsp;a $308&nbsp;million non-cash
impairment charge and $4&nbsp;million of transaction costs
relating to the PHH spin-off and (ii)&nbsp;the absence of a
$198&nbsp;million gain recognized in connection with the June
2004 sale of Jackson Hewitt. In 2005, we also recorded a
$14&nbsp;million ($8&nbsp;million, after tax) non-cash charge to
reflect the cumulative effect of accounting change as a result
of our adoption of FASB Interpretation No.&nbsp;47,
&#147;Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement
Obligations&#148; in fourth quarter 2005.

Royalty revenue within our real estate franchise business
increased $57&nbsp;million (13%) in 2005 as compared with 2004.
Such growth was primarily driven by a 14% increase in the
average price of homes sold and by a 2%&nbsp;increase in the
number of homesale transactions from our third-party
franchisees. The 14% period-over period increase in average
price is reflective of the supply of, and the demand for, homes
in previous quarters, resulting in an overall increase in the
sales prices of homes across the nation. This trend has
moderated recently as industry-wide inventory levels have
increased and the balance between supply and demand has returned
to more normalized levels. Consistent with our growth strategy,
we also earned $7&nbsp;million of additional revenue in
connection with the license of the Sotheby&#146;s brand name in
certain countries or international regions. In addition to
royalties received from our third-party franchisees,
NRT&nbsp;Incorporated, our wholly-owned real estate brokerage
firm, continues to pay royalties to our real estate franchise
business. However, these intercompany royalties, which
approximated $369&nbsp;million and $341&nbsp;million during 2005
and 2004, respectively, are eliminated in consolidation and
therefore have no impact on this segment&#146;s revenues or
EBITDA.

Revenues within our real estate brokerage business increased
$481&nbsp;million (9%) in 2005 as compared with 2004. Such
increase is partially attributable to significant acquisitions
made by NRT during or subsequent to January&nbsp;1, 2004, which
together contributed incremental revenues and EBITDA of
$249&nbsp;million and $23&nbsp;million, respectively, to 2005
operating results. Apart from these acquisitions, NRT&#146;s
revenues increased $232&nbsp;million (4%) in 2005 as compared
with 2004. This increase was substantially comprised of higher
commission income earned on homesale transactions, which was
primarily driven by a 14% increase in the average price of homes
sold, partially offset by a 7%&nbsp;decline in the number of
homesale transactions. The 14%&nbsp;period-over-period increase
in average price is reflective of the supply of, and demand for,
homes in previous quarters, resulting in an overall increase in
the sales prices of homes across the nation. This trend has
moderated recently as industry-wide inventory levels have
increased and the balance between supply and demand has returned

Revenues from our relocation services business increased
$30&nbsp;million (6%) during 2005 as compared with 2004. Such

Revenues increased $187&nbsp;million (14%), while EBITDA
decreased $11&nbsp;million (2%), in 2005 compared with 2004
reflecting revenue growth across all our Hospitality businesses;
however, the EBITDA comparison was negatively impacted by costs
incurred to combine the operations of our vacation exchange and
rental businesses, a favorable settlement recorded in second
quarter 2004 related to a lodging franchisee receivable and the
inclusion in 2005 results of a highly seasonal business, which we
acquired in May 2004 and, therefore, was not included in the
comparable prior year period (all of which are discussed in

The operating results of our lodging business reflect the
acquisitions of Wyndham Worldwide in October 2005 and Ramada
International in December 2004. The operating results of Wyndham
have been included in our results for three of the twelve months
of 2005, but none of 2004. The operating results of Ramada have
been included in our results for the entire twelve months of
2005, but only for one month of 2004. Accordingly, Wyndham and
Ramada contributed incremental revenues of $29&nbsp;million and
$14&nbsp;million, respectively, and EBITDA of $2&nbsp;million
each to 2005 results. Included within the $29&nbsp;million of
revenue generated by Wyndham is approximately $25&nbsp;million
related to reimbursable expenses, which has no impact on EBITDA.
These acquisitions also added approximately 32,000 rooms, which
is approximately&nbsp;6% of the total weighted average rooms
available within our lodging franchise system during 2005. Apart

(ii)&nbsp;$16&nbsp;million of incremental revenues generated by
our TripRewards loyalty program during 2005 and (iii)&nbsp;a
$7&nbsp;million gain recognized on the sale of a lodging-related
investment during 2005. The $16&nbsp;million increase in
royalty, marketing and reservation fund revenues primarily
resulted from an 8%&nbsp;increase in revenue per available room
(&#147;RevPAR&#148;), partially offset by a 4%&nbsp;decrease in
weighted average rooms available. The RevPAR increase reflects
(i)&nbsp;increases in both price and occupancy principally
attributable to an overall improvement in the economy lodging
segment in which our hotel brands primarily operate,
(ii)&nbsp;the termination of underperforming properties
throughout 2004 that did not meet our required quality standards
or their financial obligations to us and (iii)&nbsp;the
strategic assignment of personnel to field locations designed to
assist franchisees in improving their hotel operating
performance. The decrease in weighted average rooms available
reflects our termination of underperforming properties, as
discussed above, the expiration of franchise agreements and
certain franchisees exercising their right to terminate their
agreement.

Revenues within our vacation exchange business increased
$37&nbsp;million (6%) during 2005 due to a $17&nbsp;million (4%)
increase in exchange and subscription fee revenues and a
$24&nbsp;million (22%) increase in other timeshare points and
rental transaction revenues, partially offset by a
$4&nbsp;million decrease in other transactional revenues. The
increase in exchange and subscription fee revenues in 2005 was
primarily driven by a 5%&nbsp;increase in the average number of
worldwide subscribers and a 6%&nbsp;increase in the average
exchange fee, partially offset by a 4%&nbsp;decrease in exchange
transaction volumes. The increase in other timeshare points and
rental transaction revenues during 2005 was principally driven
by a 21%&nbsp;increase in points and rental transaction volume,
partially offset by a 1%&nbsp;decrease in the average price per
rental transaction. The decrease in other transactional revenues
in 2005 was primarily due to the absence of travel-related
commission fees and higher cancellation fees received in 2004.
Revenue trends reflect the continued shift in the RCI timeshare
membership base toward a greater mix of points members from
traditional one-week timeshare members.

Within our vacation rental business, we acquired Landal
GreenParks and Canvas Holidays Limited, which are both European
vacation rental businesses, in May 2004 and October 2004,
respectively. The operating results of Landal have been included
in our results for the entire twelve months in 2005 but for only
eight months in 2004. The operating results of Canvas have been
included in our results for the entire twelve months in 2005 but
for only three months in 2004. Accordingly, Landal and Canvas
contributed incremental revenues of $41&nbsp;million and
$25&nbsp;million, respectively, and incremental EBITDA (loss)
earnings of ($5)&nbsp;million and $6&nbsp;million, respectively,
during 2005. The decline in EBITDA at Landal primarily reflects
the fact that Landal&#146;s results in 2004 do not include its
seasonally weakest quarter, as it was not acquired until May
2004. Apart from these acquisitions, revenues at our European
vacation rental companies increased $12&nbsp;million due to the
conversion of a franchised park to a managed park as we
previously received only a franchise fee and now have the full
benefit of revenue generated by this park. This revenue increase
was offset by incremental revenue deferred in 2005 on the rental
of camping properties, which will be recognized in 2006 upon
arrival of campsite customers.

EBITDA further reflects an increase of approximately
$95&nbsp;million (11%) in operating, marketing and
administrative expenses (excluding the impact of the
acquisitions discussed above) principally resulting from
(i)&nbsp;$20&nbsp;million of higher bad debt expense primarily
due to the absence of a favorable $15&nbsp;million settlement
recorded in 2004 related to a lodging franchisee receivable,
(ii)&nbsp;$16&nbsp;million of costs incurred to combine the
operations of our vacation exchange and rental businesses,
(iii)&nbsp;$16&nbsp;million of marketing-related expenses
primarily related to marketing initiatives within our vacation

initiatives, (v)&nbsp;$11&nbsp;million of incremental expenses
associated with the conversion of a franchised park to a managed
park, as discussed above, (vi)&nbsp;$10&nbsp;million of variable

$13&nbsp;million of expenses incurred during 2005 to account for

Net sales of vacation ownership interests (&#147;VOIs&#148;) at
our timeshare resorts business increased $133&nbsp;million (11%)
in 2005 despite the Gulf Coast hurricanes. Such increase was
principally driven by a 9%&nbsp;increase in tour flow and a
6%&nbsp;increase in revenue per guest. This revenue increase
includes a $27&nbsp;million decrease in higher margin upgrade
sales at our Trendwest resort properties due to special upgrade
promotions conducted during 2004 undertaken to mitigate the
negative impact on tour flow from the Do Not Call legislation.
Tour flow, as well as revenue per transaction, benefited in 2005
from our expanded presence in premium destinations such as
Hawaii, Las Vegas and Orlando. Tour flow was also positively
impacted by the opening of new sales offices, our strategic
focus on new marketing alliances and increased local marketing
efforts.

Revenue and EBITDA also increased $58&nbsp;million and

incremental net interest income earned on our contract
receivables primarily due to (i)&nbsp;growth in the consolidated
portfolio without corresponding increases in net borrowing costs
and (ii)&nbsp;more favorable valuation adjustments in 2005 to
our retained interest in securitized contract receivables.
Revenue and EBITDA comparisons further benefited from an
$11&nbsp;million gain recorded in 2005 in connection with the
disposal of a parcel of land that was no longer consistent with
our development plans, partially offset by the absence of a

mileage (&#147;T&#38;M&#148;) revenue and a $115&nbsp;million
(18%) increase in ancillary revenues. The increase in T&#38;M
revenues was principally driven by a 14% increase in the number
of days a car was rented, partially offset by a 3% decrease in
T&#38;M revenue per day. The increase in rental days reflects,
in part, our strategic decision to implement more competitive
pricing in the second half of 2004. This program was continued
into the first half of 2005 when we instituted a price increase
in response to rising fleet costs. Accordingly, T&#38;M revenue
per day decreased&nbsp;3% during 2005 when compared with 2004
but increased by six percentage points in third quarter 2005
when compared with second quarter 2005 and by one percentage
point in fourth quarter 2005 when compared with third quarter

of 2005. Pricing was also negatively impacted during 2005 by
competitive conditions in the domestic car rental industry
resulting from higher industry-wide fleet levels, which we
believe were caused by enhanced incentives offered by car
manufacturers in prior periods. Fleet depreciation increased
$173&nbsp;million (20%) in 2005 primarily due to (i)&nbsp;an
increase of 14%&nbsp;in the average size of our domestic rental
fleet and (ii)&nbsp;reductions to manufacturer incentives
received on our 2005 model year inventory (which was in
utilization during 2005) as compared with those received on our
2004 model year inventory (which was in utilization during
2004). The $115&nbsp;million increase in ancillary revenues was
due primarily to (i)&nbsp;a $48&nbsp;million increase in airport
concession and vehicle licensing revenues, (ii)&nbsp;a
$29&nbsp;million increase in gasoline revenues and (iii)&nbsp;a
$38&nbsp;million increase in counter sales of insurance and
other items. EBITDA from our domestic car rental operations also
reflects (i)&nbsp;$179&nbsp;million of additional expenses
primarily associated with increased car rental volume and fleet
size, including vehicle maintenance and damage costs,
commissions, shuttling costs and funding costs on vehicle
purchases, (ii)&nbsp;$51&nbsp;million of increased expenses
associated with higher airport concession and vehicle licensing
fees, (iii)&nbsp;$39&nbsp;million of increased expenses

(iv)&nbsp;$29&nbsp;million of additional vehicle interest
expense incurred to grow our fleet size,
(v)&nbsp;$12&nbsp;million of incremental expenses relating to
the estimated damages caused by the hurricanes experienced in
the Gulf Coast in 2005, which primarily included the impairment
of rental cars, some of which may be recovered in future

Revenues generated by our international car rental operations
increased $126&nbsp;million (24%) due to an $86&nbsp;million
(22%) increase in car rental T&#38;M revenue and a
$40&nbsp;million (28%) increase in ancillary revenues. The
increase in T&#38;M revenues was principally driven by a
17%&nbsp;increase in the number of days a car was rented and a
4%&nbsp;increase in T&#38;M revenue per day. The increase in
ancillary revenues was due primarily to a $12&nbsp;million
increase in airport concession and vehicle licensing revenues.
The favorable effect of incremental T&#38;M revenues was
partially offset in EBITDA by $43&nbsp;million of increased
fleet depreciation and related costs and $34&nbsp;million of
higher operating expenses, both principally resulting from
increased car rental volume and an increase of 21% in the
average size of our international rental fleet to support such
volume. Additionally, EBITDA reflects a $10&nbsp;million
increase in expenses associated with higher airport concession
and vehicle licensing fees. The increase in revenue generated by
our international car rental operations includes the effect of
favorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations of
$28&nbsp;million, which was principally offset in EBITDA by the
opposite impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations
on expenses.

Budget truck rental revenues increased $28&nbsp;million (5%) in
2005 primarily representing an $18&nbsp;million (4%) increase in
T&#38;M revenue, which reflects a 3% increase in T&#38;M per day

T&#38;M revenue, EBITDA was also favorably impacted by a
$13&nbsp;million credit relating to a refinement made during
2005 in how we estimate repair and refurbishment costs of our
truck fleet. We also recognized a $7&nbsp;million credit
relating to an adjustment of our self-insurance reserve for
public liability and property damage as a result of more
favorable claims experience as indicated by an actuarial valuation of our
self-insurance obligation, which is performed annually. The
favorable impact on EBITDA was offset by
(i)&nbsp;$32&nbsp;million of incremental fleet depreciation and

Revenues increased $641&nbsp;million (36%) and EBITDA decreased
$366&nbsp;million, respectively, in 2005 compared with 2004,
reflecting the inclusion of revenues and expenses from recent
acquisitions. However, the EBITDA comparison was negatively
impacted by a $425&nbsp;million impairment charge principally
associated with our online consumer travel businesses, as well
as $28&nbsp;million of integration costs associated with
acquisitions.

In November 2004, we completed the acquisition of Orbitz, and in
2005, we acquired Gullivers (April 2005), ebookers (February
2005) and another online travel business. The operating results
of these companies have been included in our results from their
respective acquisition dates forward and therefore were
incremental to our results during 2005. Accordingly, Orbitz,
Gullivers, ebookers and the other online travel business
contributed incremental revenues of $343&nbsp;million,
$209&nbsp;million, $94&nbsp;million and $11&nbsp;million,
respectively, and EBITDA earnings (losses) of $65&nbsp;million,
$46&nbsp;million, ($30)&nbsp;million and $5&nbsp;million,
respectively, prior to the allocation of the $425&nbsp;million
impairment charge discussed below. In addition, effective
January&nbsp;1, 2005, we transferred our membership travel
business to the discontinued Marketing Services segment. As a
result, revenue and EBITDA of $55&nbsp;million and
$9&nbsp;million, respectively, generated by such operations in
2004 were absent from this segment&#146;s results in the same
period in 2005. Apart from these acquisitions and the transfer
of the membership travel business, revenue increased
$39&nbsp;million (2%) and EBITDA decreased $443&nbsp;million.

Galileo and our supplier services businesses, which primarily
provide global distribution services to the travel industry,
experienced an overall $2&nbsp;million increase in revenues,
primarily driven by a $36&nbsp;million (3%) increase in
worldwide air booking fees and $10&nbsp;million (4%) of
additional ancillary revenue, which were substantially offset by
a $44&nbsp;million (31%) decline in subscriber fees. The
increase in air booking fees was comprised of a $43&nbsp;million
(5%) increase in international air booking fees, partially
offset by an $8&nbsp;million (2%) decrease in domestic air
booking fees. The increase in international air booking fees was
principally driven by 3%&nbsp;higher booking volumes, which
totaled 170&nbsp;million segments during 2005 and which
primarily resulted from an increase in travel demand within the
Middle East and the Asia/Pacific regions, offset in part by a
decline in demand in Europe. The $8&nbsp;million decrease in
domestic air booking fees was driven by an 8%&nbsp;decline in
the effective yield on such bookings, partially offset by a
6%&nbsp;increase in booking volumes, which totaled
89&nbsp;million segments during 2005. The domestic volume
increase and effective yield decline are consistent with our
pricing program with major U.S.&nbsp;carriers, which was
designed to gain access to all public fares made available by
the participating airlines. International air bookings
represented approximately two-thirds of our total air bookings
during 2005. The $44&nbsp;million reduction in subscriber fees
reflects the continuing trend of fewer travel agencies leasing
computer equipment from us during 2005 compared with 2004. The
$10&nbsp;million of additional ancillary revenue includes higher
fees earned on outsourcing arrangements where we provide
technology services for certain airlines.

Apart from the acquisitions described above, revenues generated
from our online and traditional travel agency businesses
increased $37&nbsp;million (19%) primarily due to a
23%&nbsp;increase in online gross bookings, principally at our
Cheaptickets.com website. We believe this increase is primarily
attributable to improved site functionality, which resulted in
greater conversion rates, and enhanced content.

EBITDA further reflects an increase of approximately
$480&nbsp;million in expenses (excluding the impact of the
aforementioned acquisitions and the transfer of the membership
travel business) primarily resulting from a $425&nbsp;million
impairment charge principally associated with our online travel
businesses (see Note&nbsp;2 to our Consolidated Financial
Statements for a detailed discussion of this charge). The
remaining increase in expenses primarily resulted from;
(i)&nbsp;the absence in 2005 of a $42&nbsp;million expense
reduction realized in 2004 in connection with a benefit plan
amendment, (ii)&nbsp;$29&nbsp;million of incremental employee
severance costs, including $12&nbsp;million of executive
severance, $7&nbsp;million related to the integration of
recently acquired businesses and $10&nbsp;million related to
restructuring actions taken to reduce staff levels in some of
our online travel businesses and the realignment of our global
sales force, (iii)&nbsp;$21&nbsp;million of higher commissions
attributable to higher booking volumes, principally in the
Middle East and Asia/ Pacific regions and a greater mix of
booking volumes in higher commission rate countries
(iv)&nbsp;$19&nbsp;million of additional expenses associated
with developing enhanced technology and other project
initiatives. Such amounts were partially offset by (i)&nbsp;a
$42&nbsp;million reduction in costs primarily realized at our
Cheaptickets.com and Lodging.com businesses, as a result of
integration efforts executed domestically, including the
migration of technology to a common platform and
(ii)&nbsp;$14&nbsp;million of expense savings on network
communications and equipment maintenance and installation due,
in part, to reduced volume within the Galileo subscriber
business where travel agents lease computer equipment from us.

Revenues and EBITDA decreased $654&nbsp;million and
$278&nbsp;million, respectively, in 2005 compared with 2004. As
a result of the spin-off of PHH, 2005 results include only one
month of activity while 2004 consisted of twelve months. Our
former mortgage operations generated revenue and EBITDA of
$656&nbsp;million and $102&nbsp;million, respectively, for the
eleven-month period ended December&nbsp;31, 2004. For the month
of January, revenue increased $2&nbsp;million and EBITDA
decreased $176&nbsp;million in 2005 compared with 2004. The
EBITDA reduction was primarily due to an expected non-cash
impairment charge of $180&nbsp;million recorded in January 2005
to reflect a portion of the difference between the carrying
value and initial market value of PHH as a result of the
spin-off.

In connection with the spin-off, we formed a venture with PHH to
continue to participate in the earnings generated from
originating mortgages for customers of our real estate brokerage
and relocation business. We own 49.9% of the venture and PHH
owns 50.1%. Amounts recorded during 2005 within our Real
Estate Services segment were not material as the venture
did not become operational until fourth quarter 2005. PHH
manages this venture and retains all risk related to the
mortgage servicing asset.

Revenues and EBITDA were unfavorably impacted in 2005 by a
$22&nbsp;million reduction to realized gains on the sale of
Homestore stock during 2005 compared with 2004 and a
$13&nbsp;million reduction in earnings on a credit card
marketing program under which we earn fees based on a percentage
of credit card spending. Such amounts were partially offset by a
$15&nbsp;million reduction in intersegment revenue eliminations
in 2005 due to decreased intercompany business activities and
$5&nbsp;million of incremental revenues earned in 2005 under
agreements where we provide certain transitional administrative
services to businesses we recently sold or distributed
(including Jackson Hewitt, our former fleet leasing and mortgage
business and our former marketing services division).

EBITDA was further unfavorably impacted year-over-year by
(i)&nbsp;the absence of a $60&nbsp;million credit recorded in
2004 in connection with previously established liabilities for
severance and other termination benefits for which we no longer
believed we were liable, (ii)&nbsp;$16&nbsp;million in expenses
recorded during 2005 in connection with our separation plan and

termination of a lease on more favorable terms than originally

Net revenues increased approximately $1.3&nbsp;billion (8%) in
2004 as compared with 2003 due principally to growth in our core
residential real estate and travel businesses, which also
contributed to the increase in total expenses to support the
increased volume of underlying transactions. The acquisitions of
several strategic businesses, primarily within the real estate
and travel verticals in 2004 (which are discussed in greater
detail below), also contributed to the increases in revenues and
expenses, as their results are included from their respective
acquisition dates forward. These increases were partially offset
by an expected decline in both revenues generated and expenses
incurred by our mortgage business, as expected, due to reduced
mortgage refinancing activity experienced industry-wide.
Additionally offsetting the above-mentioned increases in
expenses was a reduction of $93&nbsp;million in interest expense
during 2004, which principally reflected a decrease in losses
incurred in connection with our early extinguishments of debt
and an overall reduction in our outstanding debt, as well as
$26&nbsp;million of interest received in connection with a
federal tax refund. In addition, we recorded a net credit of
$33&nbsp;million during 2004 in connection with the resolution
of certain legal matters relating to the 1998 discovery of
accounting irregularities in the former business units of CUC
International, Inc., whereas we incurred $11&nbsp;million of
expense during 2003. Such change principally reflects
$60&nbsp;million of previously established liabilities relating
to severance and other termination benefits for which we no
longer believe we are liable, partially offset by additional
costs related to the ongoing investigations into the CUC
accounting irregularities. Our overall effective tax rate was
32.9% and 32.2% for 2004 and 2003, respectively. The difference
in the effective tax rates is primarily due to the absence in
2004 of the utilization of capital loss carryforwards in 2003,
partially offset by a reduction to our tax contingency reserve
primarily resulting from audit settlements in 2004 and taxes on
the redemption of our mandatorily redeemable preferred interest
in 2003. As a result of the above-mentioned items, income from
continuing operations increased $201&nbsp;million (17%).

Income from discontinued operations increased $218&nbsp;million,
reflecting (i)&nbsp;an increase of $29&nbsp;million in net
income generated by Jackson Hewitt prior to its disposition,
(ii)&nbsp;an increase of $27&nbsp;million in net income
generated by our former fleet leasing and appraisal businesses,
(iii)&nbsp;an increase of $14&nbsp;million in net income
generated by Wright Express and (iv)&nbsp;an increase of
$148&nbsp;million in net income generated by our Marketing
Services division, which principally reflects the reversal of a
tax valuation allowance of $121&nbsp;million in January 2004,
and $41&nbsp;million of income recorded in 2004 in connection
with the early termination of two contractual relationships with
third party marketing partners and a gain on the sale of
commission rights associated with long-term preferred care
insurance policies that were previously sold, partially offset
by a $13&nbsp;million cash payment the Company made to TRL Group
in connection with the January 2004 contract termination (see
Note&nbsp;26&#151;TRL Group, Inc.). We also recorded a net gain
on the disposal of Jackson Hewitt of $198&nbsp;million in second
quarter 2004 in connection with the initial public offering in
June 2004. In 2003, we recorded a non-cash charge of
$293&nbsp;million to reflect the cumulative effect of accounting
change in relation to the consolidation of TRL Group (see
Note&nbsp;26&#151;TRL Group, Inc.), as required by FASB
Interpretation No.&nbsp;46, &#147;Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities.&#148;

Revenues and EBITDA increased $983&nbsp;million (18%) and

Our real estate franchise business generated $499&nbsp;million
of royalties and marketing fund revenues during 2004 as compared
with $429&nbsp;million during 2003, an increase of
$70&nbsp;million (16%). Such growth was primarily driven by a
13% increase in the average price of homes sold and an 8%
increase in the number of homesale transactions, partially
offset by an increase in volume incentives paid to our largest
independent brokers. In addition to royalties received from our
third-party franchise affiliates, NRT, our wholly-owned real
estate brokerage firm, continues to pay royalties to our real
estate franchise business. However, these intercompany
royalties, which approximated $341&nbsp;million and
$288&nbsp;million for 2004 and 2003, respectively, are
eliminated in consolidation and therefore have no impact on this
segment&#146;s revenues or EBITDA.

NRT made acquisitions of various real estate brokerage
businesses during 2004 and 2003 for which the operating results
have been included from their acquisition dates forward.
NRT&#146;s significant acquisitions, including Sotheby&#146;s
International Realty, contributed $223&nbsp;million and
$16&nbsp;million of incremental revenues and EBITDA,
respectively, to the operating results for 2004. Excluding the
impact of these significant acquisitions, NRT generated
incremental revenues of $669&nbsp;million in 2004, a 15%
increase over 2003. This increase was substantially comprised of
higher commission income earned on homesale transactions, which
was substantially driven by a 16% increase in the average price
of homes sold. The 16% year-over-year increase in average price
was driven by an overall industry-wide increase in the market
prices of homes and stronger volume of higher-priced homesales
in 2004 compared with 2003. Commission expenses paid to real
estate agents increased $471&nbsp;million as a result of the
incremental revenues earned on homesale transactions as well as
a higher average commission rate paid to real estate agents in
2004 due to variances in the geographic mix of homesales and the
progressive nature of agent commission schedules.

Revenues and EBITDA increased $244&nbsp;million (22%) and
$75&nbsp;million (19%), respectively, in 2004 compared with
2003. In May 2004, we completed the acquisition of Landal
GreenParks. During 2004, Landal contributed $113&nbsp;million to
revenues and $22&nbsp;million to EBITDA. In October 2004, we
completed the acquisition of Canvas Holidays Limited. During
2004, Canvas Holidays contributed $6&nbsp;million to revenues
and $1&nbsp;million to EBITDA. See Note&nbsp;5 to our
Consolidated Financial Statements for more detail regarding
these acquisitions. Apart from the Landal and Canvas Holidays
acquisitions, revenues at our European vacation rental companies
increased $15&nbsp;million in 2004 substantially due to a
favorable impact on revenues from foreign currency exchange rate
fluctuations, which were substantially offset in EBITDA by the
unfavorable impact of exchange rate movements on expenses.

Royalties and marketing and reservation fund revenues within our
lodging franchise operations increased $14&nbsp;million (4%) in
2004 primarily due to a 5% increase in revenue per available
room and a 4&nbsp;basis point increase in the net effective
royalty rate, partially offset by a 4% reduction in room count.
These changes reflect quality control initiatives implemented in
2003 whereby we terminated from our franchise system certain
properties that were not meeting required standards and
tightened requirements for properties not meeting their
financial obligations to us. Additionally, in fourth quarter
2003 we launched TripRewards, a loyalty program that enables
customers to earn rewards when staying at Cendant&#146;s lodging
brand hotels or when purchasing services or products from
program partners. The TripRewards program enables us to earn
fees on revenues generated by our franchisees from TripRewards
members. The program contributed $18&nbsp;million of incremental
revenue during 2004, which was substantially offset in EBITDA by
increased marketing expenditures to promote our lodging brands,
the funding of the cost of rewards earned by customers and
program administrative expenses.

Exchange and subscription fee revenues within our vacation
exchange business increased $24&nbsp;million (6%) during 2004
despite the hurricanes that hit North America and the Caribbean
during the third quarter of 2004, the effects of which were felt
throughout the remainder of the year. Such growth was primarily
driven by (i)&nbsp;a 4% increase in the average number of
worldwide subscribers, (ii)&nbsp;a 5% increase in the average
subscription price per member and (iii)&nbsp;a 6% increase in
the average exchange fee, partially offset by a 2% reduction in
exchange transaction volume. Timeshare points and rental
transaction revenue (rentals of unused timeshare inventory) grew
$24&nbsp;million (28%) driven principally by an 18% increase in
points and rental transaction volume and a 14% increase in the
average price per rental transaction. Revenue trends reflect the
expected shift in the membership base toward a greater mix of
points members from traditional one-week timeshare members. In
addition, our vacation exchange business generated incremental
revenue of $9&nbsp;million due to an increase in travel-related
services provided to customers of our international membership
business.

Net sales of VOIs in our timeshare resorts increased
$91&nbsp;million in 2004, an 8% increase over 2003 despite the
hurricanes that hit North America and the Caribbean during the
third quarter of 2004, which negatively impacted VOI sales in
our southeastern properties in the second half of 2004. The net
increase in VOI sales in our timeshare resorts was primarily
driven by an 11% increase in the average price per VOI sales
transaction as well as a $46&nbsp;million increase in upgrade
sales at our Trendwest resort properties, partially offset by a
7% reduction in tour flow and a $24&nbsp;million reduction in
the recognition of VOI deferred revenues related to resort
properties under construction. Revenues and certain related
costs recognized on VOI sales at resort properties under
construction are done so using the percentage of completion
method of accounting and accordingly, are deferred and
recognized in future periods as the resort properties are
completed. The number of tours in 2004 was negatively impacted
by Do Not Call legislation, which became effective in October
2003 and reduced telemarketers&#146; ability to call consumers
at home unless a preexisting relationship existed. During 2004,
we sold certain of our timeshare resort properties and
recognized gains on sale of $7&nbsp;million. Additionally,
incremental resort management fees of $11&nbsp;million were
generated through increased rental revenues on unoccupied units
as well as growth in the number of units under management during
2004. Revenue also increased $15&nbsp;million, while EBITDA
declined $17&nbsp;million in 2004, primarily as a result of
consolidating our largest timeshare receivable securitization
structures during third quarter 2003 and year-over-year growth
in our contract receivables portfolio. The consolidation of the
securitization structures resulted in the recognition of
interest revenues on contract receivables and interest expense
incurred on the debt funding of such contracts instead of
applying gain on sale accounting to such securitizations, prior
to consolidation. Accordingly, as a result of the consolidation,
as well as the year-over-year growth in the contract receivables
portfolio, interest revenue generated in 2004 exceeded the
interest revenue recognized and the gain on sale accounting
applied to securitizations in 2003. EBITDA, however, was
negatively impacted by the absence of gain on sale accounting in
2004, partially offset by the net interest income recognized in
2004 in connection with the consolidation and subsequent growth
of the contract receivable portfolio.

which was comprised of a $55&nbsp;million (2%) increase in car
rental T&#38;M revenue and a $42&nbsp;million (9%) increase in
ancillary revenues. The increase in T&#38;M revenues was
principally driven by a 3% increase in the number of days an
Avis vehicle was rented. The $42&nbsp;million increase in
ancillary revenues was due primarily to (i)&nbsp;a
$17&nbsp;million increase in airport concession and vehicle
licensing revenue, (ii)&nbsp;a $10&nbsp;million increase in
gasoline revenues, which resulted from increased gas prices in
2004, and (iii)&nbsp;a $15&nbsp;million increase in counter
sales of insurance and other items. The overall revenue change
of $97&nbsp;million is also inclusive of favorable foreign
currency exchange rate fluctuations internationally which
positively impacted revenue, but was principally offset in

Pricing at both our Avis and Budget car rental brands during
2004 was negatively impacted by competitive conditions in the
car rental industry as a result of higher industry-wide fleet
levels, which we believed were caused by enhanced incentives
offered by car manufacturers. However, such manufacturer
incentives also resulted in lower fleet costs, which
significantly offset the EBITDA impact of lower pricing.

T&#38;M revenue reflects a 5% reduction in rental days offset by
a 7% increase in T&#38;M per day. During 2004, we reduced the
average Budget truck fleet by 9% compared with the average fleet

$26&nbsp;million (7%). The increase in international air booking
fees was driven by a 7% increase in the effective yield on such
bookings and a 1% increase in booking volumes, which rose to
164.8&nbsp;million segments for 2004. The yield increase
partially resulted from a greater number of premium booking
transactions that allow customers additional itinerary options.
International booking volume in 2004 was suppressed by reduced
travel in Europe during the second half of 2004, which was due
in part to labor uncertainties surrounding an air carrier in
Italy with whom our Galileo subsidiary conducts business, which
was resolved in late 2004. International air bookings
represented approximately two thirds of our total air bookings
during 2004 and 2003. The reduction in domestic air booking fees
was driven by a 10% decline in the effective yield partially
offset by a 3% increase in booking volumes, which reached
84.0&nbsp;million segments in 2004. The effective yield decline
and increase in volume on domestic air bookings is consistent
with our pricing program with major U.S.&nbsp;carriers in order
to gain access to all public fares made available by the
participating airlines. Additionally, revenues and EBITDA
include a $5&nbsp;million reduction in subscriber fees resulting
from fewer travel agencies leasing computer equipment from us
during 2004 compared with 2003 and a $9&nbsp;million decrease in
information services revenue, which are primarily sales of
competitive airline fare information.

Commensurate with our strategic focus to further penetrate
online channels in the travel industry, including shifting some
of our offline travel agency bookings to the online channel,
online net revenues grew $38&nbsp;million (100%) organically
(excluding the impact of acquisitions) in 2004 compared with
2003 driven by a 26% increase in online gross bookings
substantially within our CheapTickets.com website while our
offline travel agency net revenues decreased $31&nbsp;million.

Excluding the impact of the aforementioned acquisitions,
expenses within this segment increased approximately
$20&nbsp;million in 2004. Expense increases year-over-year
included (i)&nbsp;$21&nbsp;million of higher commission
expenses, primarily due to a greater number and mix of bookings
during 2004 in countries with higher commission rates,
(ii)&nbsp;$18&nbsp;million of increased market incentive costs,
used in promoting our services to travel agencies,
(iii)&nbsp;$11&nbsp;million of expense related to airline fare
guarantees and (iv)&nbsp;$9&nbsp;million of increased bad debt
expense, the majority of which was related to receivables from
airlines in bankruptcy. This was partially offset by cost
savings from expense reductions, including network communication
and maintenance and installation expense savings due, in part,
to reduced subscriber volume. In addition, there was a net
reduction in salary and benefit-related expenses in 2004 due in
part, to the favorable impact in 2004 from benefit-plan
amendments that occurred in 2003 and cost benefits realized in
2004 from shifting our offline travel agency operations to
online channels, which included the closure of certain call
centers.

Revenues and EBITDA decreased $325&nbsp;million (32%) and
$205&nbsp;million (68%), respectively, in 2004 compared with
2003 primarily due to the expected decline in refinancing
activity experienced industry wide, partially offset by
increased revenues from mortgage servicing activities. Mortgage
refinancing closings were approximately $30.8&nbsp;billion (63%)
lower in 2004 than in 2003. Refinancing activity is sensitive to
interest rate changes relative to borrowers&#146; current
interest rates and typically increases when interest rates fall
and decreases when interest rates rise. The year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2003 was marked by historically high
refinancing activity, which decreased the propensity for
borrowers to refinance during 2004. This factor along with
increased competitive pricing pressures due to lower industry
volumes caused revenue from mortgage loan production to
decrease. Typically, as refinancing activity declines, borrower
prepayments also decline, which generally resulted in an
increase in the value of the mortgage servicing rights
(&#148;MSR&#148;) asset, all other factors being equal.

Mortgage production revenue in any given year was driven by a
mix of mortgage loans closed and mortgage loans sold. The
following chart presents our production revenues from originated
mortgage loans held for sale (which are generated at the time of

outsourced mortgage origination functions for a fee (which was

servicing mortgage loans. This increase reflects (i)&nbsp;a
$320&nbsp;million net reduction in amortization expense and
provision for impairment related to our MSR asset, net of
derivative results, which is primarily attributable to lower
prepayment rates experienced in 2004 compared with 2003 driven

arrangements. Additionally, during 2004, in our former mortgage
services business, assets under management programs were funded
through borrowings under asset-backed funding arrangements or
unsecured borrowings at our former PHH subsidiary. Such
borrowings are classified as debt under management programs. The
income generated by these assets is used, in part, to repay the
principal and interest associated with the debt. Cash inflows
and outflows relating to the generation or acquisition of such
assets and the principal debt repayment or financing of such
assets are classified as activities of our management programs.
We believe it is appropriate to segregate the financial data of
our management programs because, ultimately, the source of
repayment of such debt is the realization of such assets.

During 2005, we generated $299&nbsp;million less cash from
operating activities in comparison with 2004. This change
principally reflects the impact of the spin-off of our former

from program activities year-over-year. Partially offsetting the
impact of the spin-off, we used less cash for operations in 2005
due to improved management of working capital.

$2.7&nbsp;billion, of which approximately $1.7&nbsp;billion
related to the sale of our former Marketing Services division

Wright Express, whereas in 2004, we received cash proceeds of

initial public offering of Jackson Hewitt) and (ii)&nbsp;the

$598&nbsp;million less cash in 2005. Such increases were
partially offset by (i)&nbsp;the use of $905&nbsp;million more
cash to acquire vehicles for our vehicle rental business
principally in connection with current and anticipated increases
in rental volumes, (ii)&nbsp;the use of $384&nbsp;million more
cash to fund acquisitions in 2005 (principally within our travel
distribution business), (iii)&nbsp;$126&nbsp;million more cash
used in connection with relocation advances and (iv)&nbsp;an
increase of $112&nbsp;million in capital expenditures during
2005. We anticipate aggregate capital expenditure investments
for 2006 to be approximately $400&nbsp;million, which does not
include approximately $150&nbsp;million of aggregate capital
expenditures to be made by the new Real Estate, Hospitality
Services and Travel Distribution companies following separation
from Cendant.

We generated $904&nbsp;million more cash from financing
activities during 2005 in comparison with 2004. Such change
principally reflects (i)&nbsp;a reduction of approximately
$1.0&nbsp;billion in cash used to settle corporate indebtedness
(including the payment of $778&nbsp;million to repurchase
$763&nbsp;million of our 6.75%&nbsp;notes in 2004 that formed a
portion of the Upper DECS and $345&nbsp;million to retire our
former 11%&nbsp;senior subordinated notes in 2004) and
(ii)&nbsp;the activities of our management programs, which
provided approximately $1.3&nbsp;billion more cash in 2005
primarily due to the spin-off of our former mortgage business
and greater borrowing

activity in our vehicle rental and relocation businesses during
2005 as compared with 2004. Such increases were partially offset
by (i)&nbsp;a decrease of $863&nbsp;million of cash generated
during 2004 from the proceeds received in connection with the
settlement of the forward purchase contract component of our
Upper DECS securities whereby we issued approximately
38&nbsp;million shares of CD common stock, (ii)&nbsp;an increase
of $304&nbsp;million in cash used for repurchases of Cendant
common stock (net of proceeds received on the issuance of
Cendant common stock) and (iii)&nbsp;$259&nbsp;million of cash
on hand at our former mortgage and fleet management businesses
that was relinquished upon the spin-off of PHH in January 2005.

We also maintain short-term borrowing facilities that are
renewable annually and provide for borrowings of up to
$535&nbsp;million within our settlement services and real estate
brokerage businesses, which are callable by the lenders at any
time. In the normal course of business, we borrow amounts under
these facilities, which we invest in high quality short-term
liquid investments. Net amounts earned under these arrangements
were not significant in 2005, 2004 or 2003 and there were no

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt;color: #000000; background: #ffffff;">
In connection with the completion of the proposed separation
plan, we expect to retire substantially all our then-outstanding
corporate indebtedness. We expect to fund this retirement with
available cash and proceeds raised from new borrowings at each
of the new Real Estate Services, Hospitality Services and Travel
Distribution companies. We also expect that our current
$3.5&nbsp;billion revolving credit facility will be terminated.
Additionally, the Vehicle Rental business is expected to
establish its own debt facilities and borrowings to augment its
existing asset-backed program.

We believe that access to our existing financing arrangements is
sufficient to meet liquidity requirements for the foreseeable
future prior to the full or partial completion of our planned
separation into four independent publicly traded companies.
Prior to, or in connection with any such separation, our
existing financing arrangements will be revised or replaced so
that our financing arrangements will remain sufficient to meet
our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. However, we can
make no assurances that any such restructuring will be completed
and we expect financing costs to increase for some, if not all,
of the new stand-alone companies.

Our liquidity position may be negatively affected by unfavorable
conditions in any one of the industries in which we operate.
Additionally, our liquidity as it relates to management
programs, could be adversely affected by (i)&nbsp;the
deterioration in the performance of the underlying assets of
such programs, (ii)&nbsp;increased costs associated with the
principal financing program for our vehicle rental subsidiaries
if General Motors Corporation or Ford Motor Company should not
be able to honor its obligations to repurchase the related
vehicles and (iii)&nbsp;the restructuring of any of our existing
financing arrangements resulting from our plan to separate into
four independent publicly traded companies. Access to our credit
facilities may be limited if we were to fail to meet certain
financial ratios or as a result of the restructuring of such
facilities resulting from our contemplated separation or under
the terms of such restructured facilities. Additionally, we
monitor the maintenance of required financial ratios and, as of
December&nbsp;31, 2005, we were in compliance with all financial
covenants under our credit and securitization facilities.

In presenting our financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles, we are required to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported
therein. Several of the estimates and assumptions we are
required to make relate to matters that are inherently uncertain
as they pertain to future events. However, events that are
outside of our control cannot be predicted and, as such, they
cannot be contemplated in evaluating such estimates and
assumptions. If there is a significant unfavorable change to
current conditions, it could result in a material adverse impact
to our consolidated results of operations, financial position
and liquidity. We believe that the estimates and assumptions we
used when preparing our financial statements were the most
appropriate at that time. Presented below are those accounting
policies that we believe require subjective and complex
judgments that could potentially affect reported results.
However, the majority of our businesses operate in environments
where we are paid a fee for a service performed, and therefore
the results of the majority of our recurring operations are
recorded in our financial statements using accounting policies
that are not particularly subjective, nor complex.

determining fair value, we utilize various assumptions,
including projections of future cash flows. A change in these
underlying assumptions will cause a change in the results of the
tests and, as such, could cause the fair value to be less than
the respective carrying amount. In such event, we would then be
required to record a charge, which would impact earnings. We
review the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite-lived
intangible assets for impairment annually, or more frequently if
circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred.

The aggregate carrying value of our goodwill and other
indefinite-lived intangible assets was approximately
$12.0&nbsp;billion and approximately $1.7&nbsp;billion,
respectively, at December&nbsp;31, 2005. These amounts reflect
the fourth quarter 2005 impairment charge recorded at our Travel
Distribution Services segment. Refer to Note&nbsp;2 to our

We provide a wide range of consumer and business services and,
as a result, our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible
assets are allocated among many diverse reporting units.
Accordingly, it is difficult to quantify the impact of an
adverse change in financial results and related cash flows, as
such change may be isolated to a small number of our reporting
units or spread across our entire organization. In either case,
the magnitude of any impairment to goodwill or other
indefinite-lived intangible assets resulting from adverse
changes cannot be estimated. However, our businesses are
concentrated in a few industries and, as a result, an adverse
change to any of these industries will impact our consolidated
results and may result in impairment of our goodwill or other
indefinite-lived intangible assets.

<I>Income Taxes.</I> We recognize deferred tax assets and
liabilities based on the differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and
liabilities. We regularly review our deferred tax assets to
assess their potential realization and establish a valuation
allowance for portions of such assets that we believe will not
be ultimately realized. In performing this review, we make
estimates and assumptions regarding projected future taxable
income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing
temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning
strategies. A change in these assumptions could cause an
increase or decrease to our valuation allowance resulting in an
increase or decrease in our effective tax rate, which could
materially impact our results of operations. Additionally, our
income tax returns are periodically examined by various tax
authorities. We establish reserves for tax treatments when,
despite our belief that the treatments are fully supportable,
certain treatments are likely to be challenged and where we may
not succeed in defending our position. We adjust our reserves
upon the closing of a tax audit, which in some cases can occur
several years following the related transaction or the filing of
the tax return under examination, or upon the occurrence of
other changes in facts and circumstances that indicate an
adjustment may be necessary (including subsequent rulings and
interpretations by tax authorities or court decisions on similar
matters). Changes to the reserves could materially impact our
results of operations.

<I>Financial Instruments.</I> We estimate fair values for each
of our financial instruments, including derivative instruments.
Most of these financial instruments are not publicly traded on
an organized exchange. In the absence of quoted market prices,
we must develop an estimate of fair value using dealer quotes,
present value cash flow models, option pricing models or other
conventional valuation methods, as appropriate. The use of these
fair value techniques involves significant judgments and
assumptions, including estimates of future interest rate levels
based on interest rate yield curves, volatility factors, and an
estimation of the timing of future cash flows. The use of
different assumptions may have a material effect on the
estimated fair value amounts recorded in the financial
statements, which are disclosed in Note&nbsp;22 to our
Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, hedge accounting
requires that at the beginning of each hedge period, we justify
an expectation that the relationship between the changes in fair
value of derivatives designated as hedges compared to changes in
the fair value of the underlying hedged items will be highly
effective. This effectiveness assessment, which is performed at
least quarterly, involves an estimation of changes in fair value
resulting from changes in interest rates, as well as the
probability of the occurrence of transactions for cash flow
hedges. The use of different assumptions and changing market
conditions may impact the results of the effectiveness
assessment and ultimately the timing of when changes in
derivative fair values and the

We use a current market pricing model to assess the changes in
the value of the U.S.&nbsp;dollar on foreign currency
denominated monetary assets and liabilities and derivatives. The
primary assumption used in these models is a hypothetical 10%
weakening or strengthening of the U.S.&nbsp;dollar against all
our currency exposures at December&nbsp;31, 2005, 2004 and 2003.

Our total market risk is influenced by a wide variety of factors
including the volatility present within the markets and the
liquidity of the markets. There are certain limitations inherent
in the sensitivity analyses presented. While probably the most
meaningful analysis, these &#147;shock tests&#148; are
constrained by several factors, including the necessity to
conduct the analysis based on a single point in time and the
inability to include the complex market reactions that normally
would arise from the market shifts modeled.

We used December&nbsp;31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 market rates on
outstanding financial instruments to perform the sensitivity
analyses separately for each of our market risk
exposures&#151;interest and currency rate instruments. The
estimates are based on the market risk sensitive portfolios
described in the preceding paragraphs and assume instantaneous,
parallel shifts in interest rate yield curves and exchange rates.

We have determined that the impact of a 10% change in interest
and foreign currency exchange rates and prices on our earnings,
fair values and cash flows would not be material. While these
results may be used as benchmarks, they should not be viewed as

    plc and Gullivers Travel Associates, which were consummated on
    February&nbsp;28, 2005 and April&nbsp;1, 2005, respectively.

    December&nbsp;31, 2005, respectively. Each of these companies,

Given the large number of businesses through which we operate
and their wide variety of information systems and processes, we
continue to modify our internal controls and procedures
throughout the organization on a fairly continuous basis in
order to improve our ability to run our businesses more

training phases related to these new systems and processes,
there may be a temporary weakening in our system of internal

Over Financial Reporting, that Cendant Corporation and
subsidiaries (the &#147;Company&#148;) maintained effective

<I>Internal Control&#151;Integrated Framework </I>issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway

maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on management&#146;s assessment and an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
management&#146;s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
company&#146;s principal executive and principal financial
officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
by the company&#146;s board of directors, management, and other
personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#146;s
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1)&nbsp;pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (3)&nbsp;provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over
financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
improper management override of controls, material misstatements
due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a
timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting
to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

In our opinion, management&#146;s assessment that the Company
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting

respects, based on the criteria established in <I>Internal
Control&#151;Integrated Framework </I>issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also in our
opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of

The Board has created a set of director independence criteria
(&#147;Director Independence Criteria&#148;) for evaluating the
independence of each of the Directors, which are more stringent
than the New York Stock Exchange (&#147;NYSE&#148;) governance
standards. In February 2006, the Board undertook its annual
review of Director independence pursuant to NYSE
Rule&nbsp;303A.02(a) and our Director Independence Criteria.
During this review, the Board reviewed whether any transactions
or relationships exist currently or during the past three years
existed between each Director and us and our subsidiaries,
affiliates and equity investors or independent auditors. The
Board also examined whether there were any transactions or
relationships between each Director and members of our senior
management or their affiliates. As a result of this review, the
Board affirmatively determined that two-thirds of the Directors
were independent under the standards set forth in our Director
Independence Criteria and by the NYSE standards.
Messrs.&nbsp;Silverman, Buckman, Holmes and Nelson, who are our
employees, and Mr.&nbsp;Edelman, who is of counsel to a law firm
that represents us and our subsidiaries from time to time, were
not deemed independent. A copy of our Director Independence
Criteria can be found in the &#147;Investor
Center&#151;Corporate Governance&#148; section of our web site

Mills and Rosenberg and Mr.&nbsp;Smith (the &#147;Audit
Committee&#148;). The Audit Committee oversees our accounting

understand fundamental financial statements. The Board has
determined that each of Ms.&nbsp;Richards and Mr.&nbsp;Smith

In 2003, the Corporate Governance Committee undertook a study of
director compensation (the &#147;Director Compensation
Review&#148;) and adopted the following guidelines for director
compensation: (i)&nbsp;compensation should fairly pay Directors
for the work and time commitment required in a company of our
size and scope; (ii)&nbsp;compensation should align Director
interests with the long-term interests of our stockholders; and
(iii)&nbsp;the structure of compensation should be simple,
transparent and easy for stockholders to understand. The
Corporate Governance Committee retained an independent
compensation consultant to assist the committee in formulating a
new compensation structure to satisfy the new guidelines and to
provide a written report verifying the reasonableness of such
new compensation structure. As a result of such undertaking, the
Corporate Governance Committee recommended, and the Board
approved, a modified Non-Employee Director compensation program
effective January&nbsp;1, 2004.

    The Annual Retainer (the &#147;Retainer&#148;) is paid on a
    quarterly basis on or near the date of regularly scheduled
    quarterly Board meetings. For 2005, $80,000 of the Retainer was
    paid in the form of Common Stock required to be deferred under a
    deferred compensation plan we maintain for the benefit of
    Non-Employee Directors (the &#147;Deferral Plan&#148;). For
    2005, a Non-Employee Director could elect to receive a portion
    or all of the balance of the Retainer in the form of shares of
    Common Stock. The number of shares of Common Stock received
    pursuant to the Common Stock portion of the Retainer or any
    other compensation paid in the form of Common Stock equaled the
    value of the compensation being paid in the form of Common
    Stock, divided by the fair market value of the Common Stock as
    of the date of grant. All amounts deferred into the Deferral
    Plan are deferred in the form of deferred stock units. Each
    deferred stock unit entitles the Non-Employee Director to
    receive one share of Common Stock immediately following such
    Director&#146;s retirement or separation of service from the
    Board for any reason. The Non-Employee Directors may not sell or
    receive value from any deferred stock unit prior to such

    <FONT style="font-size: 9pt">On April&nbsp;26, 2005, each Named
    Executive Officer (other than Mr.&nbsp;Silverman) was granted
    performance-vesting restricted stock units relating to shares of
    our common stock, par value $0.01&nbsp;per share (&#147;Common
    Stock&#148;). Upon the vesting of a unit, the Named Executive
    Officer becomes entitled to receive a share of Common Stock. Up
    to one-eighth of the units may vest on April 27 in each of 2006,
    2007, 2008 and 2009 based upon the extent to which we attain
    pre-established performance goals for fiscal year 2005 through
    the end of the most recently completed fiscal year prior to such
    business day (i.e., 25% of the units scheduled to vest each year
    will vest if performance reaches &#147;threshold&#148; levels,
    and 100% of such units will vest if performance reaches
    &#147;target&#148; levels). The performance goals relating to
    these units are based upon the &#147;total unit growth&#148; of
    the Common Stock in relation to the average historic &#147;total
    stockholder return&#148; of the S&#38;P&nbsp;500 (&#147;total
    unit growth&#148; is comprised of earnings before interest,
    taxes, depreciation and amortization, plus increases in free
    cash flow generation). Units which fail to vest in 2006, 2007
    and 2008 may become vested in later year(s) subject to our
    attainment of cumulative multi-year performance goals. In
    addition, up to one-half of the units may vest on April&nbsp;27,
    2009 based upon the extent to which we attain cumulative
    four-year pre-established performance goals. The performance
    goals relating to these units are based upon the &#147;total
    unit growth&#148; of the Common Stock in relation to the
    top-quartile average historic &#147;total stockholder
    return&#148; of the S&#38;P 500. In all cases, intermediate
    levels of vesting will occur for interim levels of performance.
    Vesting is also subject to the Named Executive Officer remaining
    continuously employed with us through the applicable vesting
    date. Each Named Executive Officer received the following number
    of performance-vesting restricted stock units (numbers reflect
    equitable adjustments made in connection with our spin-off of
    PHH Corporation): Mr.&nbsp;Silverman, 0; Mr.&nbsp;Buckman,
    149,775; Mr.&nbsp;Nelson, 399,401; Mr.&nbsp;Holmes, 249,626; and
    Mr.&nbsp;Smith, 249,626. The number of units granted to each
    Named Executive Officer was approved by the Compensation
    Committee. All units are eligible to receive cash dividend
    equivalents, which remain restricted and subject to forfeiture
    until the unit for which it was paid becomes vested. The value
    of the shares of Common Stock underlying the units as of the
    date of grant are shown in the table above and reflect a per
    unit value of $20.03, based upon the closing price of the Common
    Stock on April&nbsp;26, 2005. The value of the shares underlying
    all units held by each Named Executive Officer as of
    December&nbsp;30, 2005 (including outstanding units granted in
    2005 and prior years) reflect a per unit value of the Common
    Stock of $17.25 equaled: Mr.&nbsp;Silverman, $0;
    Mr.&nbsp;Buckman $5,231,822; Mr.&nbsp;Nelson, $9,625,586;
    Mr.&nbsp;Holmes, $7,870,123; and Mr.&nbsp;Smith, $8,002,586.

<I>Mr.&nbsp;Silverman.</I> Mr.&nbsp;Silverman was employed by us
pursuant to an employment agreement originally entered into as
of September&nbsp;30, 1991 between Mr.&nbsp;Silverman and HFS
Incorporated and amended and restated from time to time (the
&#147;Prior Silverman Agreement&#148;). Effective July&nbsp;1,
2002, we and Mr.&nbsp;Silverman entered into an Amended and
Extended Employment Agreement (the &#147;Amended Silverman
Agreement&#148;). Effective July&nbsp;28, 2003, the Amended
Silverman Agreement was amended as described below (the
&#147;First Amendment&#148;). Effective August&nbsp;20, 2004,
the Amended Silverman Agreement was amended as described below
(the &#147;Second Amendment&#148;) in order to, among other
things, reduce Mr.&nbsp;Silverman&#146;s potential
post-employment compensation and condition his annual bonus on
our attainment of financial performance goals relating to
Cendant. The Second Amendment substantially reduced
Mr.&nbsp;Silverman&#146;s potential severance and
post-employment benefits and compensation opportunities and
altered his annual bonus program to condition a substantial
portion of potential bonus payments on performance goals.
Effective January&nbsp;21, 2005, the Amended Silverman Agreement
was amended as described below (the &#147;Third Amendment&#148;)
to clarify a provision relating to the Second Amendment.

Pursuant to the Amended Silverman Agreement, Mr.&nbsp;Silverman
serves as our President, Chief Executive Officer, Chairman of
the Board and Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Board;
however, during 2004, Mr.&nbsp;Nelson assumed the position of
President. The term of employment under the Amended Silverman
Agreement expires on December&nbsp;31, 2007, subject to earlier
termination upon certain events.

The Amended Silverman Agreement provides Mr.&nbsp;Silverman with
a base salary of $3,300,000. Mr.&nbsp;Silverman has not received
a salary increase since July 2002.

Pursuant to the Amended Silverman Agreement, prior to the Second
Amendment, Mr.&nbsp;Silverman&#146;s bonus was 0.60% of our
pre-tax income as defined in the Amended Silverman Agreement,
with a limit on the bonus amount equal to $100,000&nbsp;per each
cent of our earnings per share as defined in the Amended
Silverman Agreement (&#147;Target Bonus&#148;). For 2004 and
later years, in connection with the Second Amendment, the Target
Bonus continues to apply, except that the value payable in
respect of the Target Bonus is comprised of two components:
(i)&nbsp;the Target Bonus, subject to a limit of 150% of
Mr.&nbsp;Silverman&#146;s base salary (the &#147;Capped
Bonus&#148;) plus (ii)&nbsp;the remainder of the value that
would have otherwise been payable in respect of the Target Bonus
(the &#147;Performance Based Bonus&#148;), but which is now
subject to our attainment of performance goals relating to our
Average Growth in Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share
(&#147;AGEPS&#148;) as defined in the Second Amendment. The
Performance Based Bonus will not be paid if AGEPS is less than
8% and will be paid at 100% if AGEPS equals 13% or greater.
Interim levels of payment will be made for interim levels of
AGEPS performance. To the extent the Performance Based Bonus is
paid at less than 100% in 2004, 2005 and 2006, such amounts not
earned will be carried over into future fiscal years and may be
subsequently earned by Mr.&nbsp;Silverman if in any such future
year we attain an annualized rate of AGEPS of 13% or greater
over any multi-year period. For 2005, the Capped Bonus will
equal $4,950,000 and the Performance Based Bonus will equal
$7,366,600.

The Amended Silverman Agreement provides Mr.&nbsp;Silverman with
specified benefits and perquisites no less favorable than those
provided to our other senior officers and no less favorable than
those provided to chief executive officers of comparable public
companies, including priority business use of corporate
aircraft, personal use of corporate aircraft subject to
availability and access to car service. The Amended Silverman
Agreement also provides Mr.&nbsp;Silverman with standard
corporate indemnification rights.

Prior to the First Amendment, we were required to provide
Mr.&nbsp;Silverman with term life insurance with a face amount
of $100&nbsp;million for the remainder of his life, subject to
earlier termination upon certain events. During 2003, pursuant
to the First Amendment, the Amended Silverman Agreement was
amended in order to implement a replacement life insurance
program, which meets both the requirements of the Amended
Silverman Agreement and certain provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002.

provide Mr.&nbsp;Silverman with annual option grants covering

awards during 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005.

The Amended Silverman Agreement, prior to the Second Amendment,
provided that if Mr.&nbsp;Silverman resigns his employment for
Good Reason (as defined in the Amended Silverman Agreement) or
if we terminate him without Cause (as defined in the Amended
Silverman Agreement), he will be entitled to receive a lump sum
cash payment equal to (i)&nbsp;the sum of his then current base
salary plus bonus earned in the year prior to termination,
multiplied by (ii)&nbsp;the greater of the number of years and
partial years remaining in the term of employment under the
Amended Silverman Agreement and 2.99. Pursuant to the Second
Amendment, such potential severance payment is reduced to
(i)&nbsp;the sum of his current base plus bonus earned in the
year prior to termination, multiplied by (ii)&nbsp;the number of
years and partial years remaining in the term of employment, but
in no event greater than 2.99. Further, such amount will be
reduced by a present value factor of 5% to reflect the time
value of money in receiving base salary and bonus amounts in a
lump sum at an earlier date. Mr.&nbsp;Silverman also will
receive a pro rata portion of his annual bonus in respect of the
fiscal year in which such termination occurs. In addition,
Mr.&nbsp;Silverman (and his eligible dependents) will be
entitled to continued health and welfare benefits during the
remaining term of employment (or a
<FONT style="white-space: nowrap">3-year</FONT> period, if
longer) and the vesting of any options and restricted stock.
However, we may remove Mr.&nbsp;Silverman from his position of
Chief Executive Officer (but not Chairman of the Board) without
triggering such termination provisions.

The Amended Silverman Agreement, prior to the Second Amendment,
provided that if Mr.&nbsp;Silverman&#146;s employment with us is
terminated other than due to death or for Cause (but including a
resignation for Good Reason), we would (i)&nbsp;provide him
certain benefits for life, including medical and welfare
benefits, office and clerical support, access to corporate
aircraft on terms applicable to our senior executives, access to
a car and driver, appropriate security when traveling on
business on our behalf, and reimbursement of any properly
documented business expenses (the &#147;Post Term
Benefits&#148;); and (ii)&nbsp;maintain Mr.&nbsp;Silverman as an
employee to provide such services as requested by any successor
chief executive officer and keep himself reasonably available to
us to render advice or provide services for the rest of his
life, for no more than 90&nbsp;days per year, in return for
which he would be paid $83,000&nbsp;per month (the &#147;Post
Term Consulting Services&#148;). In connection with the Second
Amendment, the term of the Post Term Consulting Services was
reduced to a period of five years. Our obligation to provide
Mr.&nbsp;Silverman with compensation and benefits pursuant to
the Post Term Consulting Services will terminate in the event
Mr.&nbsp;Silverman becomes unable or is unwilling to provide
consulting services, or in the event Mr.&nbsp;Silverman is
convicted of a felony or violates any restrictive covenants set
forth in the Amended Silverman Agreement. In addition, we
maintain the right to terminate the Post Term Consulting
Services and the compensation and benefits payable thereunder by
providing Mr.&nbsp;Silverman a lump sum cash payment equal to
the net present value of such compensation and benefits.
Further, in the event of an actual or potential change of
control of our company, Mr.&nbsp;Silverman may elect to
terminate the Post Term Consulting Services and receive such
lump sum cash payment.

plans sponsored by us until Mr.&nbsp;Smith reaches age&nbsp;75
(such benefit plan eligibility will cease if Mr.&nbsp;Smith
accepts employment with a competitor of our Real Estate Services
Division). Further, upon any such termination of employment or
upon Mr.&nbsp;Smith&#146;s resignation, each of his options
granted on or after September&nbsp;1, 1998 and prior to
December&nbsp;31, 2000 will remain outstanding until the first
to occur of the fifth anniversary of the date of such
termination and the original expiration date of such option.

<I>Other Agreements.</I> During 2003, each Named Executive
Officer (other than Mr.&nbsp;Silverman) executed a letter
agreement amending and clarifying certain terms of their
employment with us and amending their respective employment
agreements. Each letter agreement provided us with the
officer&#146;s consent to terminate the officer&#146;s existing
split dollar life insurance arrangement and provided us the
right to recoup the policy value,

capped the amount of annual bonus that would be considered in
calculating an officer&#146;s contractual severance pay (100% of
earned base salary), and limited and clarified the types of
benefits that would be provided pursuant to a contractual
severance event. We determined that these amendments were
necessary and appropriate and, in connection with the
officers&#146; agreement with these changes, we amended our
annual bonus program for the Named Executive Officers (other
than Mr.&nbsp;Silverman) to increase the bonus target to 200% of
earned base salary (175% for Mr.&nbsp;Buckman). The changes to
the annual bonus program included a shift to clear,
performance-based criteria relating to the officer&#146;s
business units, our company as a whole, capital expenditure
efficiency and personal performance measures.

<I>Officer Stock Ownership Guidelines.</I> During 2003, the
Corporate Governance Committee recommended, and the Board of
Directors approved, stock ownership guidelines requiring our
senior officers to acquire designated levels of Common Stock
over a four year period and hold such Common Stock during all
periods thereafter. The value of the Common Stock required to be
held relates to a factor of the designated officer&#146;s base
salary and position. Effective October&nbsp;15, 2007 (or, for
officers hired subsequent to such date, effective on the fourth
anniversary of their hire date), the Chief Executive Officer
will be required to hold Common Stock equal to 600% of his or
her then current annual rate of base salary; each designated
officer reporting to the Chief Executive Officer will be
required to hold Common Stock equal to 300% of his or her then
current annual rate of base salary; and each designated
Corporate Executive Vice President and each Business Unit Chief
Executive Officer will be required to hold Common Stock equal to
200% of his or her then current annual rate of base salary.

<I>Other Change of Control and Termination Provisions.</I> We
adopted a tax gross up program for a limited number of executive
officers, including each Named Executive Officer, which provides
for reimbursement of golden parachute excise taxes under
Section&nbsp;4999 of the Internal Revenue Code in the event a
future corporate event causes an excise tax liability. Certain
Named Executive Officers also have similar protections under
their employment agreements.

<I>Stock Options and Restricted Stock Units.</I> Generally, all
stock options granted to each of the Named Executive Officers

units will vest, upon the occurrence of a change of control
transaction of our company.

were amended to impose additional limitations on certain types

modify any such payments to avoid imposition of such tax to the

Our Audit Committee is responsible for appointing our
independent auditor and approving the terms of the independent
auditor&#146;s services. The Audit Committee has established a
policy for the pre-approval of all audit and permissible
non-audit services to be provided by the independent auditor, as
described below.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt;color: #000000; background: #ffffff; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-bottom: 0; ">
All services performed by the independent auditor in 2005 were
pre-approved in accordance with the pre-approval policy and
procedures adopted by the Audit Committee at its April&nbsp;22,
2005 meeting. This policy describes the permitted audit,
audit-related, tax and other services (collectively, the
&#147;Disclosure Categories&#148;) that the independent auditor
may perform. The policy requires that prior to the beginning of
each fiscal year, a description of the services (the
&#147;Service List&#148;) anticipated to be performed by the
independent auditor in each of the Disclosure Categories in the
ensuing fiscal year be presented to the Audit Committee for
approval.

Except as discussed below, any requests for audit,
audit-related, tax and other services not contemplated by the
Service List must be submitted to the Audit Committee for
specific pre-approval, irrespective of the amount, and cannot
commence until such approval has been granted. Normally,
pre-approval is provided at regularly scheduled meetings of the
Audit Committee. However, the authority to grant specific
pre-approval between meetings, as necessary, has been delegated
to the Chairman of the Audit Committee. The Chairman will update
the full Audit Committee at the next regularly scheduled meeting
for any interim approvals granted.

On a quarterly basis, the Audit Committee reviews the status of
services and fees incurred

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Cendant Corporation and subsidiaries (the &#147;Company&#148;)
as of December&nbsp;31, 2005 and 2004, and the related
consolidated statements of income, stockholders&#146; equity,
and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December&nbsp;31, 2005. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company&#146;s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt;color: #000000; background: #ffffff; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-bottom: 0; ">
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial
position of the Company as of December&nbsp;31, 2005 and 2004,
and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December&nbsp;31, 2005, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.

As discussed in Note&nbsp;2 to the consolidated financial
statements, during 2003, the Company adopted the consolidation
provisions for variable interest entities.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt;color: #000000; background: #ffffff; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-bottom: 0; ">
As discussed in Note&nbsp;1 to the consolidated financial
statements, in 2005, the Company changed the presentation of its
consolidated statements of cash flows to present separate
disclosure of the cash flows from operating, investing and
financing activities of discontinued operations and
retroactively revised the statements of cash flows for the years
ended December&nbsp;31, 2004 and 2003, for the change.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over
financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2005, based on the
criteria established in <I>Internal Control&#151;Integrated
Framework </I>issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated
February&nbsp;28, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on

    In presenting the Consolidated Financial Statements, management
    makes estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported
    and related disclosures. Estimates, by their nature, are based
    on judgment and available information. Accordingly, actual
    results could differ from those estimates. Certain
    reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to
    conform to the current year presentation. Additionally, in 2005,
    the Company has separately disclosed the operating, investing
    and financing portions of cash flows attributable to its
    discontinued operations (as described in more detail below),
    which in prior periods were reported on a combined basis as a

    <I>Discontinued Operations.</I> In June 2004, the Company
    completed an initial public offering of Jackson Hewitt Tax
    Service Inc. (&#147;Jackson Hewitt&#148;), an operator and
    franchisor of tax preparation systems and services. In January
    2005, the Company completed the spin-off of its former mortgage,
    fleet leasing and appraisal businesses in a tax-free
    distribution of the common stock of PHH Corporation
    (&#147;PHH&#148;) to the Company&#146;s stockholders. In
    February 2005, the Company completed an initial public offering
    of Wright Express Corporation, its former fuel card subsidiary,
    and in October 2005, the Company sold its former Marketing
    Services division, which was comprised of its individual
    membership and loyalty/insurance marketing businesses. Pursuant
    to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (&#147;SFAS&#148;) No.&nbsp;144, &#147;Accounting for the
    Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,&#148; the account
    balances and activities of Wright Express, the former fleet
    leasing and appraisal businesses, Jackson Hewitt and the former
    Marketing Services division have been segregated and reported as
    discontinued operations for all periods presented. The
    Company&#146;s former mortgage business cannot be classified as
    a discontinued operation due to the Company&#146;s participation
    in a mortgage origination venture that was established with PHH
    in connection with the spin-off (see Note&nbsp;24&#151; Spin-off
    of PHH Corporation for more information on the venture).
    Summarized financial data for the aforementioned disposed
    businesses are provided in Note&nbsp;3&#151; Discontinued

    <I>Management Programs.</I> The Company presents separately the
    financial data of its management programs. These programs are
    distinct from the Company&#146;s other activities since the
    assets are generally funded through the issuance of debt that is
    collateralized by such assets. Specifically, in the
    Company&#146;s vehicle rental, relocation, and vacation
    ownership and rental businesses, assets under management
    programs are funded through borrowings under asset-backed
    funding or other similar arrangements. Additionally, during
    2004, in the Company&#146;s former mortgage services business,
    assets under management programs were funded through borrowings
    under asset-backed funding arrangements or unsecured borrowings
    at its former PHH subsidiary. Such borrowings are classified as
    debt under management programs. The income generated by these
    assets is used, in part, to repay the principal and interest
    associated with the debt. Cash inflows and outflows relating to
    the generation or acquisition of such assets and the principal
    debt repayment or financing of such assets are classified as
    activities of the Company&#146;s management programs. The
    Company believes it is appropriate to segregate the financial
    data of its management programs because, ultimately, the source
    of repayment of such debt is the realization of such assets.</TD>

    <I>New Policy.</I> In connection with FIN&nbsp;46, when
    evaluating an entity for consolidation, the Company first
    determines whether an entity is within the scope of FIN&nbsp;46
    and if it is deemed to be a VIE. If the entity is considered to
    be a VIE, the Company determines whether it would be considered
    the entity&#146;s primary beneficiary. The Company consolidates
    those VIEs for which it has determined that it is the primary
    beneficiary. Generally, the Company will consolidate an entity
    not deemed either a VIE or qualifying special purpose entity
    (&#147;QSPE&#148;) upon a determination that its ownership,
    direct or indirect, exceeds fifty percent of the outstanding
    voting shares of an entity and/or that it has the ability to
    control the financial or operating policies through its voting
    rights, board representation or other similar rights. For
    entities where the Company does not have a controlling interest
    (financial or operating), the investments in such entities are
    classified as available-for-sale securities or accounted for
    using the equity or cost method, as appropriate. The Company
    applies the equity method of accounting when it has the ability
    to exercise significant influence over operating and financial
    policies of an investee in accordance with APB Opinion
    No.&nbsp;18, &#147;The Equity Method of Accounting for
    Investments in Common Stock.&#148;</TD>

    <I>Real Estate Franchise.</I> The Company franchises its real
    estate brokerage franchise systems to the owners of independent
    real estate brokerage businesses. The Company provides
    operational and administrative services to franchisees, which
    are designed to increase franchisee revenue and profitability.
    Such services include advertising and promotions, training and
    volume purchasing discounts. Franchise revenue principally
    consists of royalty and marketing fees from the Company&#146;s
    franchisees. The royalty received is primarily based on a
    percentage of the franchisee&#146;s commissions and/or gross
    commission income. Royalty fees are accrued as the underlying
    franchisee revenue is earned (upon close of the home sale
    transaction). Annual volume incentives given to certain
    franchisees on royalty fees are recorded as a reduction to
    revenue and are accrued for in relative proportion to the
    recognition of the underlying gross franchise revenue. Franchise
    revenue also includes initial franchise fees, which are paid by
    new franchisees, are generally non-refundable and are recognized
    by the Company as revenue when all material services or
    conditions relating to the sale have been substantially
    performed (generally when a franchised unit opens for business).
    The Company also earns marketing fees from its franchisees and
    utilizes such fees to fund advertising campaigns on behalf of
    its franchisees. In arrangements under which the Company does
    not serve as an agent in coordinating advertising campaigns,
    marketing revenues are accrued as the revenue is earned, which
    occurs as related marketing expenses are incurred. The Company
    does not recognize revenues or expenses in connection with
    marketing fees it collects under arrangements in which it
    functions as an agent on behalf of its franchisees.</TD>

    <I>Relocation Services.</I> The Company provides relocation
    services to corporate and government clients for the transfer of
    their employees. Such services include the purchasing and/or
    selling of a transferee&#146;s home, providing home equity
    advances to transferees (generally guaranteed by the corporate
    client), expense processing, arranging household goods moving
    services, home-finding and other related services. The Company
    earns revenues from fees charged to clients for the performance
    and/or facilitation of these services and recognizes such
    revenue on a net basis as services are provided, except for
    instances in which the Company assumes the risk of loss on the
    sale of a transferring employee&#146;s home. In such cases,
    revenues are recorded on a gross basis as earned with associated
    costs recorded within operating expenses. In the majority of
    relocation transactions, the gain or loss on the sale of a
    transferee&#146;s home is borne by the client; however, as
    discussed above, in certain instances the Company will assume
    the risk of loss. When the risk of loss is assumed, the Company
    records the value of the home on its Consolidated Balance Sheets
    within the relocation-related assets, net line item. The
    difference between the actual purchase price and proceeds
    received on the sale of the home are recorded within the
    operating expenses line item on the Company&#146;s Consolidated
    Statements of Income. The aggregate selling prices of such homes

    The Company sells and markets vacation ownership interests

    either undivided fee simple interests or point-based vacation
    credits. The Company recognizes sales of VOIs on a full accrual
    basis for fully constructed inventory after a binding sales
    contract has been executed, a 10% minimum down payment has been
    received, the statutory rescission period has expired and
    receivables are deemed collectible. During periods of
    construction, subsequent to the preliminary construction phase
    and upon assurance that the property will not revert to a rental
    property, the Company recognizes revenues using the

    accounting, the preliminary stage is deemed to be complete when
    the engineering and design work is complete, the construction
    contracts have been executed, the site has been cleared,

    The completion percentage is determined by the proportion of

    Vehicles are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation.
    The initial cost of the vehicles is net of incentives and
    allowances from vehicle manufacturers. The Company acquires the
    majority of its rental vehicles pursuant to repurchase programs
    established by automobile manufacturers. Under these programs,
    the manufacturers agree to repurchase vehicles at a specified
    price and date, subject to certain eligibility criteria (such as
    car condition and mileage requirements). The Company depreciates
    vehicles such that the net book value of the vehicles on the
    date of return to the manufacturers is intended to equal the
    contractual guaranteed residual values, thereby minimizing any
    gain or loss on the sale of the vehicles. The Company records
    depreciation expense for any expected deficiency in the
    contracted guaranteed residual values due to excessive wear or
    damages. At December&nbsp;31, 2005, the Company estimates that
    the difference between the contracted guaranteed residual value
    and the carrying value of these vehicles was $76&nbsp;million,

    Mortgage services included the origination (funding either a
    purchase or refinancing), sale and servicing of residential
    mortgage loans. Mortgage loans were originated through a variety
    of marketing techniques, including relationships with
    corporations, affinity groups, financial institutions and real
    estate brokerage firms. The Company also purchased mortgage
    loans originated by third parties. Upon the closing of a
    residential mortgage loan originated or purchased by the
    Company, the mortgage loan was typically warehoused for a period
    up to 60&nbsp;days and then sold into the secondary market
    (which is customary in the mortgage industry). Mortgage loans
    held for sale as of December&nbsp;31, 2004 represented those
    mortgage loans originated or purchased by the Company, which
    were pending sale to permanent investors. The Company primarily
    sold its mortgage loans to government-sponsored entities. Upon
    sale, the servicing rights and obligations of the underlying
    mortgage loans were generally retained by the Company. A
    mortgage servicing right (&#147;MSR&#148;) is the right to
    receive a portion of the interest coupon and fees collected from
    the mortgagor for performing specified mortgage servicing
    activities, which consisted of collecting loan payments,
    remitting principal and interest payments to investors, holding
    escrow funds for payment of mortgage-related expenses such as
    taxes and insurance, and otherwise administering the
    Company&#146;s mortgage loan servicing portfolio.</TD>

    Loan origination and commitment fees paid by the borrower in
    connection with the origination of mortgage loans and certain
    direct loan origination costs were deferred until such loans are
    sold to investors. Mortgage loans pending sale were recorded on
    the Company&#146;s Consolidated Balance Sheets at the lower of
    cost or market value on an aggregate basis. Sales of mortgage
    loans were generally recorded on the date a loan was delivered
    to an investor. Gains or losses on sales of mortgage loans were
    recognized based upon the difference between the selling price
    and the allocated carrying value of the related mortgage loans
    sold. The capitalization of the MSRs also occurred upon sale of
    the underlying mortgages into the secondary market. Upon initial
    recording of the MSR asset, the total cost of loans originated
    or acquired was allocated between the MSR asset and the mortgage
    loan without the servicing rights based on relative fair values.
    Servicing revenues comprised several components, including
    recurring servicing fees, ancillary income and the amortization
    of the MSR asset. Recurring servicing fees were recognized upon
    receipt of the coupon payment from the borrower and recorded net
    of guaranty fees. Costs associated with loan servicing were
    charged to expense as incurred. The MSR asset was amortized over
    the estimated life of the related loan portfolio in proportion
    to projected net servicing revenues. Such amortization was
    recorded as a reduction of net servicing revenue in the

    The MSR asset was routinely evaluated for impairment, but at
    least on a quarterly basis. For purposes of performing its
    impairment evaluation, the Company stratified its portfolio on
    the basis of product type and interest rates of the underlying
    mortgage loans. The Company measured impairment for each stratum
    by comparing estimated fair value to the carrying amount. Fair
    value was estimated based upon an internal valuation that
    reflects management&#146;s estimates of expected future cash
    flows considering prepayment estimates (developed using a third
    party model described below), the Company&#146;s historical
    prepayment rates, portfolio characteristics, interest rates
    based on interest rate yield curves, implied volatility and
    other economic factors. The Company used a third party model to
    forecast prepayment rates used in the development of its
    expected future cash flows. The prepayment forecast was based on
    historical observations of prepayment behavior in similar
    periods comparing current mortgage interest rates to the

    The Company&#146;s provision for income taxes is determined
    using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax
    assets and liabilities are calculated based upon the temporary
    differences between the financial statement and income tax bases
    of assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax rates. The
    Company&#146;s deferred tax assets are recorded net of a
    valuation allowance when, based on the weight of available
    evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of
    the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future
    periods. Decreases to the valuation allowance are recorded as
    reductions to the Company&#146;s provision for income taxes
    while increases to the valuation allowance result in additional
    provision. However, if the valuation allowance is adjusted in
    connection with an acquisition, such adjustment is recorded
    through goodwill rather than the provision for income taxes. The
    realization of the Company&#146;s deferred tax assets, net of
    the valuation allowance, is primarily dependent on estimated
    future taxable income. A change in the Company&#146;s estimate
    of future taxable income may require an addition or reduction to

    Gains or losses relating to the assets securitized are allocated

    The Company performs its annual impairment testing in the fourth
    quarter of each year subsequent to completing its annual
    forecasting process. In performing this test, the Company
    determines fair value using the present value of expected future

    Company determined that the carrying values of goodwill and
    certain other indefinite-lived intangible assets assigned to its

    Consequently, the Company also tested its other long-lived

    <I>Wright Express.</I> On February&nbsp;22, 2005, the Company
    completed the initial public offering of Wright Express for
    $964&nbsp;million of cash. Additionally, the Company entered
    into a tax receivable agreement with Wright Express pursuant to
    which Wright Express is obligated to make payments to the
    Company over a 15&nbsp;year term. The Company currently expects
    such payments to aggregate over $400&nbsp;million pretax. During
    2005, the Company received $15&nbsp;million in connection with
    this tax receivable agreement, which is recorded within the gain
    on disposal line item. The actual amount and timing of receipt
    of such payments are dependent upon a number of factors,
    including whether Wright Express earns sufficient future taxable
    income to realize the full tax benefit of the amortization of
    certain assets.</TD>

    $488&nbsp;million and transaction costs of $7&nbsp;million
    during first quarter 2005. Of these costs, $308&nbsp;million and
    $4&nbsp;million, respectively, were allocated to the fleet
    leasing and appraisal businesses and, therefore, recorded within

    allocated to the mortgage business are not classified as

    as of the respective acquisition dates based upon their
    estimated fair values at such dates. The results of operations
    of businesses acquired by the Company have been included in the
    Company&#146;s Consolidated Statements of Income since their
    respective dates of acquisition. The excess of the purchase
    price over the estimated fair values of the underlying assets
    acquired and liabilities assumed was allocated to goodwill. In
    certain circumstances, the allocations of the excess purchase
    price are based upon preliminary estimates and assumptions.
    Accordingly, the allocations may be subject to revision when the
    Company receives final information, including appraisals and
    other analyses. Any revisions to the fair values, which may be
    significant, will be recorded by the Company as further
    adjustments to the purchase price allocations. The Company is
    also in the process of integrating the operations of its
    acquired businesses and expects to incur costs relating to such
    integrations. These costs may result from integrating operating
    systems, relocating employees, closing facilities, reducing
    duplicative efforts and exiting and consolidating other
    activities. These costs will be recorded on the Company&#146;s
    Consolidated Balance Sheets as adjustments to the purchase price
    or on the Company&#146;s Consolidated Statements of Income as
    expenses, as appropriate.</TD>

    <I>Wyndham Worldwide.</I> On October&nbsp;11, 2005, the Company
    acquired the management and franchise business of the Wyndham
    hotel chain for $111&nbsp;million in cash. The acquisition
    includes franchise agreements, management contracts and the
    Wyndham brand, which will be used both in the Company&#146;s
    lodging and timeshare businesses. This acquisition resulted in
    goodwill (based on the preliminary purchase price) of
    $20&nbsp;million, all of which is expected to be deductible for
    tax purposes. Such goodwill was assigned to the Company&#146;s
    Hospitality Services segment. This acquisition also resulted in
    $85&nbsp;million of other intangible assets. Management believes
    that this acquisition adds an upscale brand to the
    Company&#146;s lodging portfolio and also represents the
    Company&#146;s entry into managing hotels in addition to its
    lodging franchise business.</TD>

    As part of the acquisition, the Company&#146;s management
    formally committed to various strategic initiatives primarily
    aimed at creating synergies between the cost structures of the
    Company and Gullivers, which were expected to be achieved
    through the involuntary termination of certain Gullivers
    employees. The Company formally communicated the termination of

    management, and as of December&nbsp;31, 2005, all of these

    <I>ebookers plc.</I> On February&nbsp;28, 2005, the Company
    acquired ebookers plc (&#147;ebookers&#148;), a travel agency
    with Web sites servicing 14 European countries offering a wide
    range of discount and standard price travel products including
    airfares, hotels, car rentals, cruises and travel insurance.
    Management believes that this acquisition enhances the
    Company&#146;s role in the global online travel intermediary
    space. The preliminary allocation of the purchase price is

    As part of the acquisition, the Company&#146;s management
    formally committed to various strategic initiatives primarily
    aimed at creating synergies between the cost structures of the
    Company and ebookers, which were expected to be achieved through
    the involuntary termination of certain ebookers employees and
    the termination of certain lease obligations. The Company
    formally communicated the termination of employment to
    approximately 110 employees, representing a wide range of
    employee groups, and as of December&nbsp;31, 2005, substantially
    all of these employees had been terminated. As a result of these
    actions, the Company established personnel-related and
    facility-related liabilities of $6&nbsp;million and
    $4&nbsp;million, respectively. As of December&nbsp;31, 2005,
    cash payments of $6&nbsp;million were made to reduce the
    personnel-related liability. Accordingly, as of
    December&nbsp;31, 2005, substantially all of the
    personnel-related liability costs had been paid. Additionally,
    during 2005, other adjustments of $1&nbsp;million were made to
    reduce the facility-related liability. Accordingly, the
    remaining balance for the facility-related liability as of
    December&nbsp;31, 2005 was $3&nbsp;million. The Company
    anticipates the remainder of the lease termination costs will be
    paid by 2009.</TD>

    As part of the acquisition, the Company&#146;s management
    formally committed to various strategic initiatives primarily
    aimed at creating synergies between the cost structures of the
    Company and Orbitz, which were expected to be achieved through
    the involuntarily termination of certain Orbitz employees and
    the consolidation of facilities. The Company formally
    communicated the termination of employment to approximately 40
    employees, representing a wide range of employee groups, and as
    of December&nbsp;31, 2005, the Company had terminated all of
    these employees. As a result of these actions, the Company
    established personnel-related and facility-related liabilities
    of $15&nbsp;million and $7&nbsp;million, respectively. As of
    December&nbsp;31, 2005, cash payments and other reductions of
    $14&nbsp;million and $1&nbsp;million, respectively, of which
    $6&nbsp;million and $1&nbsp;million, respectively, were recorded
    during 2005, had been made to reduce the personnel-related
    liability. As such, all personnel-related liabilities have been
    paid. No payments or reductions have been made to the
    facility-related liability; however, the Company anticipates the
    remainder of the facility-related costs will be paid by 2009.</TD>

    were incurred to integrate and combine the operations and
    Internet booking technology at the Company&#146;s Orbitz,
    ebookers, Gullivers and Cheaptickets.com businesses. The 2004

    integration of Orbitz and the integration of real estate

    a previously established $12&nbsp;million accrual, which
    resulted from the termination of a lease on more favorable terms

    and were included within service fees and membership revenues on

    purposes and, in the case of lodging and car rental franchisees,
    the operation of a centralized brand-specific reservation system

    In order to assist the franchisees of its lodging and real
    estate franchise businesses in converting to one of the
    Company&#146;s brands to assist in franchise expansion, the
    Company may, at its discretion, provide development advances to
    franchisees who are either new or who are expanding their
    operations. Provided the franchisee meets certain minimum
    operational thresholds and maintains the terms of the franchise
    agreement, all or a portion of the advances may be forgivable
    and are, therefore, amortized over the length of the underlying
    note (typically between nine and fifteen years). Otherwise,
    related principal is due and payable to the Company. In certain
    instances, the Company may earn interest on unpaid franchisee
    development advances, which was not significant during 2005,
    2004 or 2003. The balances of such development advances were
    $21&nbsp;million for the Company&#146;s lodging business at both
    December&nbsp;31, 2005 and 2004 and $69&nbsp;million and
    $59&nbsp;million for its real estate franchise business at
    December&nbsp;31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. These amounts are
    classified primarily within the other non-current assets line
    item on the Company&#146;s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Related
    amortization expense approximated $15&nbsp;million,
    $14&nbsp;million and $11&nbsp;million during 2005, 2004 and
    2003, respectively, and was recorded within the operating
    expense line item on the Company&#146;s Consolidated Statements

    call center and field locations of the Company&#146;s truck
    rental business, consolidation of processes and offices in the
    Company&#146;s real estate brokerage business and reductions in
    staff within the Travel Distribution Services and Hospitality

    the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.&#148; The American Jobs

    Although the Company believes it has appropriate support for the
    positions taken on its tax returns, the Company has recorded a
    liability for its best estimate of the probable loss on certain
    of these positions. The Company believes that its accruals for
    tax liabilities are adequate for all open years, based on its
    assessment of many factors including past experience and
    interpretations of tax law applied to the facts of each matter.
    Although the Company believes its recorded assets and
    liabilities are reasonable, tax regulations are subject to
    interpretation and tax litigation is inherently uncertain;
    therefore the Company&#146;s assessments can involve both a
    series of complex judgments about future events and rely heavily
    on estimates and assumptions. While the Company believes that
    the estimates and assumptions supporting its assessments are
    reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any
    related litigation could be materially different than that which
    is reflected in historical income tax provisions and recorded
    assets and liabilities. Based on the results of an audit or
    litigation, a material effect on our income tax provision, net
    income, or cash flows in the period or periods for which that
    determination is made could result.</TD>

    <I>Cendant Rental Car Funding.</I> Cendant Rental Car Funding
    was established by the Company as a bankruptcy remote special
    purpose limited liability company that issues private placement
    notes and uses the proceeds from such issuances to make loans to
    a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, AESOP Leasing LP
    (&#147;AESOP Leasing&#148;) on a continuing basis. AESOP Leasing
    is required to use these proceeds to acquire or finance the
    acquisition of vehicles used in the Company&#146;s rental car
    operations. Prior to December&nbsp;31, 2003, both Cendant Rental
    Car Funding and AESOP Leasing were consolidated by the Company
    and, as such, the intercompany transactions between these two
    entities were eliminated causing only the third-party debt
    issued by Cendant Rental Car Funding and the vehicles purchased
    by AESOP Leasing to be presented within the Company&#146;s
    Consolidated Financial Statements. However, in connection with
    the adoption of FIN&nbsp;46, the Company determined that it was
    not the primary beneficiary of Cendant Rental Car Funding.
    Accordingly, the Company deconsolidated Cendant Rental Car
    Funding on December&nbsp;31, 2003. As a result, AESOP
    Leasing&#146;s obligation to Cendant Rental Car Funding is
    reflected as related party debt on the Company&#146;s
    Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December&nbsp;31, 2005 and
    2004. The Company also recorded an asset within vehicle-related,
    net assets under management programs on its Consolidated Balance
    Sheet at December&nbsp;31, 2005 and 2004, which represented the
    equity issued by Cendant Rental Car Funding to the Company. The
    vehicles purchased by AESOP Leasing remain on the Company&#146;s
    Consolidated Balance Sheet as AESOP Leasing continues to be
    consolidated by the Company. Such vehicles and related assets,
    which approximate $7.5&nbsp;billion, collateralize the debt
    issued by Cendant Rental Car Funding and are not available to
    pay the obligations of the Company.</TD>

    <I>Cendant Timeshare Receivables Funding Entities (formerly, the
    Sierra Receivables Funding Entities).</I> The Cendant Timeshare
    Receivables Funding entities (the &#147;Timeshare Funding
    entities&#148;) are consolidated bankruptcy remote SPEs that are
    utilized to securitize timeshare receivables generated from
    financing the sale of vacation ownership interests by the
    Company&#146;s timeshare businesses. The debt issued by the
    Timeshare Funding entities, which approximated $1.1&nbsp;billion
    and $911&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2005 and 2004,
    respectively, is collateralized by approximately
    $1.5&nbsp;billion of underlying timeshare receivables and
    assets. The timeshare receivables are serviced by the Company
    and recorded within timeshare-related assets under management
    programs on the Company&#146;s Consolidated Balance Sheet as of
    December&nbsp;31, 2005 and 2004. Prior to September&nbsp;1,
    2003, sales of timeshare receivables to the Timeshare Funding
    entities were treated as off-balance sheet sales, as these
    entities were structured as bankruptcy remote QSPEs pursuant to
    SFAS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;140 &#147;Accounting for Transfers and
    Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of
    Liabilities,&#148; and, therefore, excluded from the scope of
    FIN&nbsp;46. However, on September&nbsp;1, 2003, the underlying
    structures of the Timeshare Funding entities were amended in a
    manner that resulted in these entities no longer meeting the
    criteria to qualify as QSPEs. Consequently, the Company began
    consolidating the account balances and activities of the

    structured as a bankruptcy remote QSPE and, therefore, excluded
    from the scope of FIN&nbsp;46. However, on November&nbsp;26,
    2003, the underlying structure of this entity was amended in a
    manner that resulted in it no longer meeting the criteria to
    qualify as a QSPE pursuant to SFAS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;140.

    In 2001, the Company sold timeshare receivables to multiple
    bankruptcy remote QSPEs retaining the servicing rights and a
    subordinated interest. As these entities are QSPEs and precluded
    from consolidation pursuant to generally accepted accounting
    principles, the debt issued by these entities and the
    collateralizing assets, which are serviced by the Company, are
    not reflected on the Company&#146;s Consolidated Balance Sheets.
    The assets of these QSPEs are not available to pay the
    Company&#146;s obligations. Additionally, the creditors of these
    QSPEs have no recourse to the Company&#146;s credit. However,
    the Company has made representations and warranties customary
    for securitization transactions, including eligibility
    characteristics of the receivables and servicing
    responsibilities, in connection with the securitization of these
    assets. Sales of timeshare receivables to these entities after
    2001 were insignificant since substantially all timeshare
    receivables were securitized during such years through the
    Timeshare Funding entities, which are consolidated on the
    Company&#146;s Consolidated Balance Sheets as of
    December&nbsp;31, 2005 and 2004. The Company&#146;s retained
    interest in the QSPEs at December&nbsp;31, 2005 is insignificant.</TD>

    may be required to fund such excess as a result of unsold
    Company-owned timeshare interests or failure by owners to pay
    such assessments. These guarantees extend for the duration of
    the underlying service agreements (which approximate one year
    and are renewable on an annual basis) or until a stipulated
    percentage (typically 80% or higher) of related timeshare
    interests are sold. The maximum potential future payments that
    the Company could be required to make under these guarantees was
    approximately $175&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2005.
    The Company would only be required to pay this maximum amount if
    none of the owners assessed paid their maintenance fees. Any
    fees collected from the owners of the timeshare interests would
    reduce the maximum potential amount of future payments to be
    made by the Company. Additionally, should the Company be
    required to fund the deficit through the payment of any
    owners&#146; fees under these guarantees, the Company would be
    permitted access to the property for its own use and may use
    that property to engage in revenue producing activities, such as
    advertising or rental. Historically, the Company has not been
    required to make material payments under these guarantees as the
    fees collected from owners of timeshare interests have been
    sufficient to support the operation and maintenance of the
    timeshare properties. As of December&nbsp;31, 2005, the
    liability recorded by the Company in connection with these
    guarantees was approximately $11&nbsp;million.</TD>

    The Company coordinates numerous events for its franchisees and

    The number of options that will ultimately vest may range from

    share of Cendant common stock upon vesting. RSUs granted in 2003
    vest ratably over a four-year term. In 2004, the Company adopted
    performance and time vesting criteria for RSU grants. The
    predetermined performance criteria determine the number of RSUs
    that will ultimately vest and are based on the growth of the
    Company&#146;s earnings and cash flows over the vesting period
    of the respective award. The number of RSUs that will ultimately
    vest may range from 0% to 200% of the base award. Vesting occurs
    over a four-year period, but cannot exceed 25% of the base award
    in each of the three years following the grant date. The annual
    activity related to the Company&#146;s RSU plan consisted of:</TD>

    The Company sponsors domestic non-contributory defined benefit

    contributory defined benefit pension plans in certain foreign

    plans, benefits are based on an employee&#146;s years of
    credited service and a percentage of final average compensation
    or as otherwise described by the plan. As of December&nbsp;31,

    The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts to manage
    its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates
    associated with its foreign currency denominated receivables and

    <I>Debt.</I> The debt used to finance much of the Company&#146;s
    operations is also exposed to interest rate fluctuations. The
    Company uses various hedging strategies and derivative financial
    instruments to create an appropriate mix of fixed and floating
    rate assets and liabilities. Derivative instruments currently
    used in these hedging strategies include swaps and instruments
    with purchased option features. The derivatives used to manage
    the risk associated with the Company&#146;s fixed rate debt were
    designated as either fair value hedges or freestanding
    derivatives. The fair value hedges were perfectly effective
    resulting in no net impact on the Company&#146;s consolidated
    results of operations during 2005, 2004 and 2003, except to
    create the accrual of interest expense at variable rates. In
    2005, the freestanding derivatives, resulted in $12&nbsp;million
    of expenses to the Company&#146;s consolidated results of
    operations. During 2004 and 2003, these derivatives had a
    nominal impact on the Company&#146;s results of operations.
    During 2004 and 2003, the Company terminated certain of its fair
    value hedges, which resulted in cash gains (losses) of
    ($9)&nbsp;million and $200&nbsp;million, respectively. Such
    gains (losses) are deferred and being recognized over the lives
    of the formerly hedged items as a component of interest expense.
    During 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company recorded

    counterparty credit risk associated with its derivative
    contracts by monitoring the amount for which it is at risk with
    each counterparty to such contracts, periodically evaluating
    counterparty creditworthiness and financial position, and where
    possible, dispersing its risk among multiple counterparties.</TD>

    As of December&nbsp;31, 2005, there were no significant
    concentrations of credit risk with any individual counterparty
    or groups of counterparties other than risks related to the
    Company&#146;s repurchase agreements with automobile
    manufacturers (see Note&nbsp;2&#151;Summary of Significant
    Accounting Policies) and airline customers of the Company&#146;s
    Travel Distribution Services segment. Concentrations of credit
    risk associated with receivables are considered minimal due to
    the Company&#146;s diverse customer base. With the exception of
    the financing provided to customers of its timeshare business,
    the Company does not normally require collateral or other
    security to support credit sales.</TD>

    The fair value of financial instruments is generally determined

    As previously discussed, on January&nbsp;31, 2005, the Company
    completed the spin-off of its former mortgage, fleet leasing and
    appraisal businesses in a tax-free distribution to the
    Company&#146;s stockholders of one share of PHH common stock per
    every twenty shares of Cendant common stock held on
    January&nbsp;19, 2005. As a result, the Company&#146;s total
    stockholders&#146; equity was reduced by approximately
    $1.65&nbsp;billion during first quarter 2005 (see the
    Consolidated Statement of Stockholders&#146; Equity).</TD>

    Pursuant to SFAS&nbsp;No.&nbsp;144, the Company was required to
    perform an impairment analysis upon completion of the PHH
    spin-off. Accordingly, the Company recorded a non-cash
    impairment charge of $488&nbsp;million in first quarter 2005, to
    reflect the difference between PHH&#146;s carrying value and
    PHH&#146;s initial market value, as determined by the average
    trading price of PHH common stock on February&nbsp;1, 2005. The
    charge was recorded as a reduction to net income with an
    offsetting increase to retained earnings since the impaired
    assets had been disposed of on January&nbsp;31, 2005. Of the
    $488&nbsp;million total charge, approximately $180&nbsp;million
    ($0.17&nbsp;per diluted share) was allocated to the mortgage
    business and, therefore, recorded within continuing operations.
    The remaining charge, approximately $308&nbsp;million
    ($0.29&nbsp;per diluted share), was allocated to the fleet
    leasing and appraisal businesses and, therefore, recorded within
    discontinued operations. There were no tax benefits recorded in
    connection with these charges as such charges are not tax
    deductible.</TD>

    Similarly, the Company incurred $7&nbsp;million of transaction
    costs during first quarter 2005 associated with the PHH
    spin-off, of which $3&nbsp;million was allocated to continuing
    operations (which is recorded within the restructuring and
    transaction-related costs line item on the Consolidated
    Statement of Income within the Mortgage Services segment) and
    $4&nbsp;million was allocated to discontinued operations (which
    is recorded within the PHH valuation and transaction-related
    charges line item on the Company&#146;s Consolidated Statement
    of Income). There were no tax benefits recorded in connection

    From July&nbsp;2, 2001 to January&nbsp;30, 2004, TRL Group
    operated membership-based clubs and programs and other
    incentive-based loyalty programs through an outsourcing
    arrangement with Cendant whereby Cendant licensed TRL Group the
    right to market products to new members utilizing certain assets
    of Cendant&#146;s individual membership business. Accordingly,
    Cendant collected membership fees from, and was obligated to
    provide services to, members of its individual membership
    business that existed as of July&nbsp;2, 2001, including their
    renewals, and TRL Group provided fulfillment services for these
    members in exchange for a servicing fee paid by Cendant.
    Furthermore, TRL Group collected the membership fees from, and
    was obligated to provide membership benefits to, any members who
    joined the membership-based clubs and programs and all other
    incentive programs subsequent to July&nbsp;2, 2001 and
    recognized the related revenue and expenses. Accordingly,
    similar to Cendant&#146;s franchise businesses, Cendant received
    a royalty from TRL Group on all revenue generated by TRL
    Group&#146;s new members (those who joined TRL&#146;s clubs as a
    result of TRL Group&#146;s marketing efforts occurring between
    July 2001 and January 2004). The assets licensed to TRL Group
    included various tradenames, trademarks, logos, service marks
    and other intellectual property relating to its membership
    business.</TD>

    During 2003, Cendant performed a strategic review of the TRL
    Group membership business, Cendant&#146;s existing membership
    business and Cendant&#146;s loyalty/insurance marketing
    business, which provided enhancement packages for financial
    institutions and marketing for accidental death and
    dismemberment insurance and certain other insurance products.
    Upon completion of such review, Cendant concluded that it could
    achieve certain revenue and expense synergies by combining its
    loyalty/insurance marketing business with the new-member
    marketing performed by TRL Group. Additionally, as a result of
    the adoption of FIN&nbsp;46, the Company had been consolidating
    the results of TRL Group since July&nbsp;1, 2003 even though it
    did not have managerial control of the entity. Therefore, in an
    effort to achieve the revenue and expense synergies identified
    in Cendant&#146;s strategic review and to obtain managerial
    control over an entity whose results were being consolidated,
    Cendant and TRL Group agreed to amend their contractual
    relationship by terminating the contractual rights, intellectual
    property license and third party administrator arrangements that
    Cendant had previously entered into with TRL Group in 2001.</TD>

    on the Company&#146;s Consolidated Financial Statements as the
    Company continues to consolidate TRL Group subsequent to this
    transaction. In connection with the transaction, the parties
    agreed to liquidate and dissolve TRL Group in an orderly fashion
    when and if the number of TRL Group members decreased below
    1.3&nbsp;million, provided that such dissolution may not occur
    prior to January 2007. Cendant paid $13&nbsp;million in cash on
    January&nbsp;30, 2004 for the contract termination, regained
    exclusive access to the various tradenames, trademarks, logos,
    service marks and other intellectual property that it had
    previously licensed to TRL Group for its use in marketing to new
    members and had managerial control of TRL Group through its
    majority representation on the TRL Group board of directors. TRL
    Group continued to service and collect membership fees from its
    members to whom it marketed through January&nbsp;29, 2004,

    (including collecting cash, paying commissions, processing
    refunds, providing membership services and benefits and
    maintaining specified service level standards) for TRL

    On January&nbsp;30, 2004, TRL Group had net deferred tax assets
    of approximately $121&nbsp;million, which were mainly comprised
    of net operating loss carryforwards expiring in years 2021, 2022
    and 2023. These deferred tax assets were fully reserved for by
    TRL Group through a valuation allowance, as TRL Group had not
    been able to demonstrate future profitability due to the large
    marketing expenditures it incurred (new member marketing has
    historically been TRL Group&#146;s single largest expenditure).
    However, given the fact that TRL Group would no longer incur
    marketing expenses (as they no longer have the ability to market
    to new members as a result of this transaction), TRL Group
    determined that it was more likely than not that it would
    generate sufficient taxable income (as it would continue to
    recognize revenue from TRL Group&#146;s existing membership base
    in the form of renewals and the lapsing of the refund privilege
    period) to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards within
    the statutory periods. Accordingly, TRL Group reversed the
    entire valuation allowance of $121&nbsp;million in January 2004,
    which resulted in a reduction to the Company&#146;s tax
    provision relating to discontinued operations during 2004 of
    $121&nbsp;million, with a corresponding increase in consolidated
    net income. The $13&nbsp;million cash payment the Company made
    to TRL Group was also recorded by the Company as a component of
    its discontinued operations&#146; provision for income taxes
    line item on the Consolidated Statement of Income for 2004 and
    partially offsets the $121&nbsp;million reversal of TRL
    Group&#146;s valuation allowance.</TD>
