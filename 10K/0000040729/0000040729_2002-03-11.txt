                                     PART I

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

General Motors Acceptance  Corporation (the "Company" or "GMAC"), a wholly-owned
subsidiary  of  General  Motors  Corporation  ("General  Motors"  or "GM"),  was
incorporated in 1997 under Delaware General Corporation Law. On January 1, 1998,
the Company merged with its  predecessor,  which was originally  incorporated in
New York in 1919.

In conducting its primary line of business,  financing,  GMAC and its affiliated
companies have a presence in 41 countries and offer a wide variety of automotive
financial  services to and through  franchised General Motors dealers throughout
the world. GMAC also offers financial  services to other automobile  dealerships
and to the customers of those  dealerships.  Additionally,  the Company provides
commercial  financing  for  real  estate,   equipment  and  working  capital  to
automobile dealerships, GM suppliers and customers of GM affiliates. The Company
also provides  commercial  financing and factoring services for companies in the
apparel,  textile,  automotive  supplier and numerous other  industries.  GMAC's
other financial services include insurance and mortgage banking. The Company had
29,390  and  28,569  employees  worldwide  as of  December  31,  2001 and  2000,
respectively.

The  Company  operates  directly  and through its  subsidiaries  and  affiliates
(including joint ventures) in which the Company or GM has equity investments. In
its principal  markets,  GMAC offers automotive  financing and other services as
described below. The Company operates its automotive  financing services outside
of the United  States  ("U.S.")  in a similar  manner,  subject to local laws or
other circumstances that may cause it to modify its procedures accordingly.  The
Company's  policies and internal controls are designed to ensure compliance with
applicable laws and regulations.

The automotive financing industry is highly competitive. The Company's principal
competitors  for  retail  financing  and  leasing  are a large  number of banks,
commercial finance  companies,  savings and loan associations and credit unions.
Wholesale  and lease  financing  competitors  are  primarily  comprised of other
manufacturers'  affiliated  finance  companies,  independent  commercial finance
companies  and  banks.  Neither  the  Company  nor  any of its  competitors  are
considered to be a dominant  force in the industry  when analyzed  individually.
The Company's ability to offer competitive financing rates, the primary basis of
competition,  is directly affected by its access to capital markets. The Company
applies a strategy of constantly  reviewing funding  alternatives to achieve its
business  goals.  The quality of  integrated  GM and GMAC  products and services
provided  to  automotive  dealerships  and their  customers  contributes  to the
Company's competitive advantages.

In the North American  automotive  business,  seasonal retail sales fluctuations
cause production levels to vary from month to month. In addition, the changeover
period related to the annual new model introduction  traditionally occurs in the
third  quarter of each  year,  causing an  unfavorable  impact on the  operating
results of automobile manufacturers. These factors produce minor fluctuations in
financing  volume,  with the second and third  quarters  of each year  generally
experiencing the strongest  activity.  However,  seasonal  variations in vehicle
deliveries  do not have a  material  impact on the  Company's  interim  results.
Quarterly financing revenue remains relatively  consistent  throughout the year,
primarily  due  to the  use  of the  straight-line  method  for  recognition  of
operating  lease revenue and the interest  method for recognition of income from
retail and lease financing  transactions as well as consistent  dealer inventory
levels.

As the financing of GM manufactured  vehicles comprises a substantial portion of
the  Company's  business,   any  protracted  reduction  or  suspension  of  GM's
production  or  sales  resulting  from  a  decline  in  demand,  work  stoppage,
governmental  action,  adverse publicity or other event could have a substantial
unfavorable  effect on the  Company's  results  of  operations.  Conversely,  an
increase in  production  or a significant  marketing  program  could  positively
impact the Company's results. Information about GM's production and sales can be
found in GM's Annual  Report on Form 10-K for the year ended  December 31, 2001,
filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS (continued)

RETAIL FINANCING

GMAC conducts its U.S. and Canadian retail automotive  financing  business under
the trade name GMAC Financial Services.  The Company provides financial services
to  customers  through  dealers who have  established  relationships  with GMAC.
Retail installment obligations for new and used products that meet GMAC's credit
standards are purchased directly from dealers.

Outside the U.S.  and Canada,  GMAC  conducts  its retail  automotive  financing
business  under various  trade names,  such as Opel Bank,  Vauxhall  Finance and
Holden Financial  Services,  primarily depending upon General Motors activity in
the country,  while also  considering  local  customs and  requirements.  Retail
automotive financing is provided in a similar manner as in the U.S., but in some
cases, GMAC enters into an installment obligation directly with the customer.

Effective  December 2001, GMAC acquired in a transfer from its parent,  GM, Saab
Financial  Services in the U.S. and Saab Finance  Limited in the United  Kingdom
("U.K."). Similar to GMAC's other operations, GMAC will provide retail financial
services under the Saab name in the U.S. and the U.K. markets.  Total assets and
total  liabilities  were  approximately  $395.0  million  and $318.0  million at
December 31, 2001, respectively.

GMAC also  provides  subprime  retail  automotive  financing  and  servicing  to
customers  in the U.S.  and Europe.  Subprime  financing in the U.S. is provided
through Nuvell Credit  Corporation  and subprime  servicing is provided  through
Nuvell Financial  Services Corp.,  wholly owned subsidiaries of GMAC. In Europe,
On:Line Financing Holdings, Ltd., a majority-owned subsidiary, provides standard
rate and used vehicle financing.

Retail  obligations  are generally  secured by lien  notation on vehicle  titles
and/or  other  forms  of  security  interest  in the  vehicles  financed.  After
satisfying local  requirements,  GMAC is generally able to repossess the vehicle
if the  installment  buyer fails to meet the  obligations  of the contract.  The
interests of both GMAC and the retail buyer are usually  protected by automobile
physical damage insurance. Collateral protection on certain vehicles is provided
by GMAC's wholly owned insurance subsidiary.

General  Motors may elect to  sponsor  retail  finance  programs  by  supporting
special retail finance rates and/or  guaranteeing  residual  values in excess of
those established by independently  published  residual value guidebooks used by
GMAC.

WHOLESALE FINANCING

Using GMAC's wholesale financing, qualifying dealers are able to finance new and
used vehicles held in inventory pending sale or lease to retail or fleet buyers.
When a dealer uses GMAC's  Wholesale  Finance  Plan to acquire  vehicles  from a
manufacturer  or other vehicle  sources,  GMAC is ordinarily  granted a security
interest in those  vehicles.  GMAC is generally able to repossess the vehicle if
the  dealer  does not pay the  amount  advanced  or fails to comply  with  other
conditions specified in the security agreement. Collateral protection on certain
vehicles is provided by GMAC's wholly owned insurance subsidiary.

TERM LOANS

GMAC  provides  term loans for real  estate,  equipment  and working  capital to
automobile dealerships, GM suppliers and customers of GM affiliates. The Company
generally  secures the loans with liens on real estate,  other dealership assets
and/or the personal guarantee of the dealer.

LEASING

In the U.S. and Canada, GMAC offers leasing plans to retail customers as well as
dealers or other  companies  that rent or lease  vehicles  to others.  GMAC also
offers various lease products in 22 other countries.

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS (continued)

LEASING (concluded)

Operating Leases
----------------
GMAC's most  successful  leasing  program,  called  SmartLease  in the U.S.  and
Canada,  is a plan in which  dealers  originate  the  leases  and offer them for
purchase by GMAC.  GMAC also offers  full-service  individual  and fleet leasing
products in Europe and Asia-Pacific.  In addition to the maintenance  management
services  directly  associated with the  full-service  lease, the Company offers
services including fleet management,  accident management,  fuel programs, title
and licensing services and short-term vehicle rental.

Under  SmartLease,  as GMAC assumes  ownership of the vehicles from the dealers,
these leases are accounted for as operating leases, with the capitalized cost of
the  vehicles  recorded as  depreciable  assets  (net  investment  in  operating
leases).  In the U.S. and Canada,  dealers are not  responsible  for  customers'
performances  during the lease periods nor for the values of the vehicles at the
time of lease  maturities.  Credit  standards for these  programs are similar to
those applied to retail financing  contracts.  The SmartLease program encourages
shorter customer  trading cycles.  At lease  termination,  GMAC either sells the
vehicle to the dealer or customer at a pre-determined price or sells the vehicle
at either a physical or Internet auction for the market price.

General  Motors may elect to  sponsor  retail  leasing  programs  by  supporting
special  lease  rates  and/or  guaranteeing  residual  values in excess of those
established by independently published residual value guidebooks used by GMAC.

Finance Leases
--------------
GMAC also offers other leasing plans directly to individual  customers and other
entities.  Under these plans, the leases are accounted for as finance leases and
the  receivables  from the customers are recorded as finance  receivables.  GMAC
does not assume ownership of the vehicles. These leasing receivables essentially
represent  installment  sales of  vehicles,  with  the  vehicles  usually  being
acquired by the customers at the end of the lease contracts.

Lease Financing
---------------
Dealers,  their  affiliates and other companies may obtain GMAC financing to buy
vehicles,  which they lease or rent to others. These leases,  sometimes referred
to as fleet leases, are categorized as finance receivables. GMAC generally has a
security  interest  in  these  vehicles  and in the  rental  payments.  However,
competitive  factors  occasionally result in a limited security interest in this
collateral.  Approximately 51 percent of GMAC's fleet financing  receivables are
covered by General Motors programs which provide a limited payment  guarantee to
participating  financing institutions as consideration for extending credit to a
fleet customer.  Under these programs,  General Motors  reimburses the financing
institution, subject to certain limitations, for losses on the sales of vehicles
that are returned to the selling dealers or repossessed.  As of January 1, 2002,
General Motors  terminated  these  programs.  Volume acquired prior to 2002 will
continue to be covered under the payment guarantee.

COMMERCIAL FINANCING

Through its  subsidiaries  GMAC  Commercial  Credit LLC and GMAC Business Credit
LLC, the Company  provides  secured  financing  in the U.S.,  U.K. and Canada to
companies  in the apparel,  textile,  automotive  supplier  and  numerous  other
industries.  Financing is provided to clients through revolving lines of credit,
term loans and the  purchase of accounts  receivable  owed to clients from their
customers    (known    as    "factoring").    The    Company    also    provides
receivable/collection  management  products  as well as  guarantees  amounts due
under  letters  of credit  issued by its  clients to their  suppliers.  Accounts
receivable and inventories are the primary security for commercial financing and
factoring products and services.

INSURANCE

GMAC  Insurance  Holdings,  Inc.  ("GMACI"),  a holding  company formed in 1997,
conducts  insurance  operations in the U.S., Canada,  Europe,  Latin America and
Asia Pacific through Motors Insurance  Corporation ("MIC"), GMAC RE Corp. ("GMAC
RE"),  Integon  Corporation  ("Integon") and other insurance  subsidiaries.  The
subsidiaries  operate and market under the GMAC  Insurance  common brand.  GMACI
insures  and  reinsures   automobile  service  contracts,   personal  automobile
insurance  coverages  ranging from preferred to non-standard  risks and selected
commercial insurance coverages.

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS (continued)

INSURANCE (concluded)

GMAC Insurance is one of the world's largest underwriters of automotive extended
service and  maintenance  contracts.  Such  contracts  offer vehicle  owners and
lessees  mechanical repair  protection and extended roadside  assistance for new
and used vehicles beyond a manufacturer's new vehicle warranty.  These contracts
are marketed  through  automobile  dealerships  and on a direct  response basis,
covering  virtually  all vehicle  makes and  models.  A  significant  portion of
vehicle service contracts cover vehicles manufactured by General Motors.

GMAC RE underwrites  diverse property and casualty risks,  primarily in the U.S.
market.  Commercial  lines  coverage is primarily  insurance for dealer  vehicle
inventories. MIC also provides collateral protection to GMAC on certain vehicles
securing GMAC retail installment contracts.

The personal lines operation  primarily  provides  physical damage and liability
insurance coverages for automobiles and motorcycles,  and also offers homeowners
and umbrella policies.  Personal lines policies are offered on a direct response
basis  through  affinity  groups,  GM-employee  programs and the  Internet,  and
through a network of approximately 11,400 independent  agencies.  Automobile and
motorcycle coverages are offered to nonstandard, standard and preferred drivers.
The personal lines group operates in 48 states and the District of Columbia.

The property casualty insurance industry is highly  competitive.  Competition in
the  property  casualty  markets  in  which  GMACI  operates  consists  of large
multi-line  companies and smaller specialty  carriers.  None of these companies,
including GMACI, holds a dominant position overall in these markets.

There are no material  seasonal  factors  that affect the  quarterly  results of
GMACI.

MORTGAGE BANKING

GMAC Mortgage Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries  ("GMACMG")  perform a wide array
of real estate financial services including the origination, purchase, financing
and servicing of residential,  commercial and multifamily mortgage loans as well
as the  issuing,  purchasing  and  selling  of  mortgage-backed  securities.  In
addition, GMACMG actively acquires mortgage servicing rights from other mortgage
bankers and  financial  institutions.  Operations of GMACMG's  various  mortgage
banking  subsidiaries are conducted through its three primary  businesses:  GMAC
Residential Holding Corp. ("GMACR");  GMAC Commercial Holding Corp.  ("GMACCH");
and Residential Funding Corporation ("RFC").

GMACR  provides  residential  real estate  services  nationwide.  These services
primarily  include the origination,  sale and servicing of first and second lien
mortgage  loans and high  loan-to-value  mortgage  loans.  GMACR  also  provides
bundled real estate  services to the consumer.  These bundled  services  include
real estate brokerage services utilizing a combination of franchised and company
owned  offices,   full  service  relocation  services,   mortgage  services  and
settlement  services.  Through GMAC Bank,  which commenced  operations in August
2001,  GMACR offers a variety of personal  financial  products to its customers,
including  consumer  deposits,  consumer  loans  and other  consumer  investment
services.  During 2001,  in  connection  with the  creation of GMAC Bank,  GMACR
became a Unitary Thrift Holding Company. GMACR also acquired a warehouse lending
operation in 2001 which provides interim  financing to mortgage  correspondents.
At  December  31,  2001,  according  to  National  Mortgage  News,  GMACR  ranks
nationally as the sixth largest servicer,  with a servicing  portfolio of $192.0
billion, and the seventh largest originator of residential mortgage loans. GMACR
originates mortgage loans by utilizing its retail branch network, direct lending
centers and correspondent/broker lender origination channels.

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS (concluded)

MORTGAGE BANKING (concluded)

GMACCH,  with a servicing  portfolio  of more than $134.6  billion,  is a global
leader in commercial and multifamily mortgage loan servicing,  loan origination,
asset  management  and  securitization  of  commercial   mortgages.   Through  a
subsidiary,  GMACCH is also one of the largest  underwriters  of multifamily tax
exempt bonds in the U.S.  GMACCH serves the domestic and global markets and is a
direct lender and correspondent for life insurance  companies and pension funds.
GMACCH  provides a wide range of  innovative  financial  products  and  services
including long-term, interim and construction financing,  appraisal services and
specialized  lending  units focused on healthcare  and  hospitality,  as well as
e-commerce  offerings  through the Internet.  GMACCH  operates 75 offices in key
United States  markets and also has  operations in Canada,  the United  Kingdom,
France,  Ireland and Japan. GMACCH has continued to diversify its operations and
grow operating revenues through strategic  domestic and international  corporate
and asset  acquisitions  focusing  on  commercial  mortgage  lending and related
services and technology  products.  In 2001, GMACCH  established GMAC Commercial
Mortgage Bank  (Ireland),  PLC in Ireland which is regulated by the Central Bank
of Ireland and  provides  GMACCH with a regulatory  platform  for entering  into
full-scale commercial mortgage banking activities in Europe.

RFC is  engaged  in  several  interrelated  business  lines  including  mortgage
securitization,  investing,  origination  and lending  operations.  RFC is a top
issuer of private-label  mortgage-backed  securities in the U.S. based on dollar
volume of  private-label  mortgage-backed  securities  issued as of December 31,
2001. RFC purchases  non-conforming,  single-family  residential  mortgages from
mortgage lenders  throughout the U.S.,  securitizes such mortgages into mortgage
pass-through  certificates,  sells the  certificates  to investors  and performs
master  servicing of these  securities  on behalf of  investors.  In addition to
prime  residential  mortgages,  RFC  also  purchases  and  securitizes  subprime
residential  mortgages,  home equity lines of credit and home improvement loans.
RFC also  provides  warehouse  lending  facilities to certain  mortgage  banking
customers  secured  principally  by mortgage  collateral,  as well as  long-term
secured lines of credit to construction  lending  project  managers and national
and regional  homebuilders.  Additionally,  RFC acquires  seasoned or distressed
mortgage  loans and other real estate for resolution or sale, as well as manages
its  own   portfolios  of  distressed   unsecured   consumer   receivables   and
mortgage-related  securities that were acquired from unrelated bond issuers. RFC
maintains 53 offices in key United States markets and also has operations in the
United Kingdom, Mexico, Japan, Brazil and the Netherlands.

The mortgage banking business is highly competitive.  GMACMG competes with other
mortgage banking  companies,  commercial  banks,  savings  associations,  credit
unions  and  other  financial  institutions  in every  aspect  of its  business,
including funding and purchasing loans from mortgage  brokers,  purchasing loans
from  correspondents,  securitizing and selling loans to investors and acquiring
loan servicing rights and origination capabilities.

Residential  mortgage  volume is  generally  subject to seasonal  trends.  These
trends reflect the general national pattern of sales and resales of homes, which
typically  peak during the spring and summer seasons and decline to lower levels
from mid-November  through February.  However, the seasonal trends do not have a
material  impact  on  GMACMG's  interim  results.  Refinancings  tend to be less
seasonal and more closely  related to changes in interest  rates. In addition to
having an effect on refinancing,  changes in interest rates affect the volume of
loan originations and acquisitions, the interest rate spread on mortgage-related
investments  and loans held for sale,  the amount of gain or loss on the sale of
loans and the value of GMACMG's servicing portfolio.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

GMAC is subject to potential liability under government  regulations and various
claims and legal actions which are pending or may be asserted against them. Some
of the pending  actions  purport to be class  actions.  The  aggregate  ultimate
liability of GMAC under these government  regulations and under these claims and
actions,  was not  determinable  at December 31,  2001.  After  discussion  with
counsel,  it is the opinion of management that such liability is not expected to
have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  the  Company's   consolidated  financial
condition, results of operations or cash flows.

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
         AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following  discussion  and analysis  provides  information  that  management
believes  to be  relevant  to an  understanding  of the  Company's  consolidated
results of operations and financial condition.  The discussion should be read in
conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The Company has identified the following  significant  accounting policies that,
as a result of the judgments, uncertainties,  uniqueness and complexities of the
underlying  accounting  standards  and  operations  involved,  could  result  in
material  changes to its  financial  condition  or results of  operations  under
different conditions or using different assumptions.

Allowance for Credit Losses
---------------------------
The allowance for credit  losses is generally  established  during the period in
which  receivables are acquired and is maintained at a level deemed  appropriate
by management based on historical and other factors that affect  collectibility.
Such  factors  include  the  historical  trends  of  repossession,  charge-offs,
recoveries  and credit  losses;  the  careful  monitoring  of  portfolio  credit
quality,  including  the  impact of  acquisitions;  and  current  and  projected
economic  and  market  conditions.  The  evaluation  of these  factors  involves
complex,  subjective judgments. Thus, changes in these factors may significantly
impact the Consolidated Financial Statements.  For example, recent deterioration
in economic  conditions in North America have  contributed to an increase in net
finance  receivable  losses and,  consequently,  an  increase in the  allowance.
Different  assumptions  or changes in  economic  circumstances  could  result in
additional  changes to the allowance for credit losses. See Notes 1, 2 and 13 in
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Investments in Operating Leases
-------------------------------
Investments in the residual values of the Company's leasing portfolio  represent
an estimate of the values of the assets at the end of the lease contract and are
initially  recorded  based  on  appraisals  and  estimates.  Management  reviews
residual values  periodically to determine that recorded amounts are appropriate
and the operating lease assets have not been impaired. In addition,  the Company
actively  manages  the  remarketing  of  off-lease   vehicles  to  maximize  the
realization  of  the  recorded  residuals.  Upon  disposal  of the  assets,  the
provision for  depreciation is adjusted for the difference  between the net book
value and the proceeds of sale or salvage.  As a result of a continued  weakness
in off-lease  residuals,  the Company has experienced a decline in proceeds upon
disposal of its vehicles at termination.  Changes in the estimation process used
to record the initial value of the residuals or the existence of other  external
factors impacting the Company's future ability to market the vehicles under then
prevailing  market  conditions  may  significantly  impact  the  realization  of
residual  values.  See  Notes 1 and 4 in the  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial
Statements.

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
         FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (concluded)

Securitization Accounting
-------------------------
The Company sells finance and mortgage loan receivables  through special purpose
entities  which then issue  asset or  mortgage-backed  securities  to private or
public investors.  The Company records a gain or loss on the sale of receivables
and  generally  retains  interests  in  the  sold  receivables,   which  include
interest-only  strips and  specific  tranches in the  securitization,  including
subordinate  tranches  subject to first loss positions,  as well as the right to
service  the  sold  receivables.  The  recognition  of a gain  or  loss  and the
valuation  of retained  interests is based on an  allocation  of the cost of the
sold  receivables  between the portion  sold and the portion  retained  based on
their  relative fair values on the date of sale.  The fair value of the retained
interests,  including  mortgage servicing rights, is estimated using the present
value of future expected cash flows, with market interest rates,  discount rates
commensurate  with the risks involved,  estimated credit losses,  credit spreads
and  prepayment  speeds  comprising  the  key  calculation   assumptions.   Such
assumptions   are   determined   utilizing   data  obtained  from  other  market
participants,   where  available.  Otherwise,  such  assumptions  are  based  on
historical  information or derived from  management's  best estimate.  Thus, the
selection of assumptions  involves  complex,  subjective  judgments which,  when
changed,  may  significantly  impact  the  financial  statements.  For  example,
throughout  most  of  2001,  interest  rates  declined,  increasing  actual  and
potential mortgage refinancing activity and resulting in reduced expected future
cash flows that support the carrying value of the Company's  mortgage  servicing
rights,  resulting in significant impairment charges. (See further discussion in
Mortgage  Operations  section of the  Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis of
Financial  Condition  and Results of  Operations.)  The  selection  of different
assumptions  used in estimating  fair value or the impact of changes in economic
circumstances  could result in additional declines in fair value to the retained
interests  in  securitizations.  See  Notes  1, 3, 6, 13 and 14 in the  Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Accounting for Derivatives and Other Contracts at Fair Value
------------------------------------------------------------
The  Company  uses  derivatives  in the normal  course of business to reduce its
exposure to  fluctuations  in interest  and foreign  currency  rates.  Effective
January 1, 2001, the Company  accounts for its  derivatives on the  Consolidated
Balance  Sheet as  assets  or  liabilities,  at fair  value in  accordance  with
Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards  ("SFAS") No. 133,  Accounting for
Derivative  Instruments and Hedging Activities,  as amended.  Such accounting is
complex,  evidenced by  significant  interpretations  of the primary  accounting
standard which  continues to evolve,  as well as the  significant  judgments and
estimates  involved in  estimating  fair value in the  absence of quoted  market
values. These estimates are based on valuation  methodologies deemed appropriate
in the  circumstances;  however,  the use of  different  assumptions  may have a
material  effect  on the  estimated  fair  value  amounts.  In  addition,  hedge
accounting  requires that the Company assess  effectiveness  between  changes in
fair value of derivatives designated as hedges compared to changes in fair value
of the underlying  hedged assets or liabilities for each reporting  period.  The
effectiveness tests involve estimation of the fair values of future transactions
as well as an evaluation of the probability of occurrence of such  transactions.
Using different assumptions and changing circumstances may impact the results of
the  effectiveness  testing  and  ultimately  the  timing  of  when  changes  in
derivative  fair values are recorded in earnings.  See Notes 1, 6, 8, 13, 14 and
17 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Insurance Losses and Loss Reserves
----------------------------------
The  liability  for losses and loss  expenses  represents  the  accumulation  of
estimates  for  reported  losses and a  provision  for losses  incurred  but not
reported, including claim adjustment expenses. Loss reserve projections are used
to estimate loss reporting  patterns,  loss payment  patterns and ultimate claim
costs.  An inherent  assumption  in such  projections  is that  historical  loss
patterns  can be used to  predict  future  patterns  with  reasonable  accuracy.
Because many variables can affect past and future loss  patterns,  the effect of
changes in such variables on the results of loss  projections  must be carefully
evaluated.  The  evaluation  of  these  factors  involves  complex,   subjective
judgments which may  significantly  impact the financial  statements.  Insurance
liabilities are,  therefore,  necessarily  based on estimates,  and the ultimate
liability may vary from such estimates.  These estimates are regularly  reviewed
by management and adjustments to such are included in income on a current basis.
See Note 12 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

</TABLE>

On a  consolidated  basis,  GMAC's return on average equity capital was 12.0% in
2001,  compared to 12.4% in 2000 and 14.7% in 1999. The Company did not pay cash
dividends to General Motors in 2001 and paid $1,377.5  million and $75.0 million
in 2000 and 1999, respectively.

In 2001,  net income from  automotive  and other  financing  operations  totaled
$1,254.9  million,  compared to $1,054.7 million earned in the prior year. Lower
market  interest rates and increased  asset levels more than offset  weakness in
off-lease residual values, higher credit losses and wider borrowing spreads that
occurred in the wake of negative rating agency  actions.  Net income in 2000 was
virtually unchanged from 1999. Increased financing volumes and asset levels were
offset by the negative  impact stemming from the higher level of market interest
rates in 2000 over 1999.

Net income from insurance  operations  totaled $200.2 million in 2001,  9.0% and
4.6% lower than 2000 and 1999 earnings, respectively. The decrease from 2000 was
due to a reduction in capital gains,  reflecting  general weakness in the equity
markets, partially offset by improved underwriting results. The increase in 2000
from 1999 was primarily due to improved  operating results and higher investment
income and capital gains.

Net income from mortgage  operations  totaled $330.8  million in 2001,  1.0% and
27.0% higher than 2000 and 1999 earnings,  respectively.  The results  reflected
strong origination volumes and  securitizations,  which kept pace with the large
run-off  of home  mortgages  that  occurred  during  periods  of high  refinance
activity.  Revenue growth during 2001  associated with strong  residential  loan
originations,  increases in the servicing  portfolio  and realized  gains on the
sale and  securitization  of mortgage  loans,  were largely offset by impairment
charges recorded on mortgage servicing rights due to higher mortgage  prepayment
experience.  Pre-tax  gains on  securitizations  of  mortgage  loans were $994.6
million, 37.6% and 65.0% higher than gains in 2000 and 1999,  respectively.  The
increase  in  2000  over  1999  performance  reflected  the  benefit  of  strong
international   growth,   lower  cost  of  servicing  and   increased   mortgage
originations during the second half of 2000.

United States New Passenger Car and Truck Deliveries

U.S.  deliveries of new GM vehicles  during 2001 were  slightly  lower than 2000
levels.  U.S. deliveries of new GM vehicles during 2000 were virtually unchanged
compared  to  1999  levels.  Financing  penetration  of  new GM  vehicle  retail
deliveries  during 2001 and 2000 grew as a result of an increase in GM-sponsored
retail incentives in each of these years.

The change in the total number of vehicles financed since 1999 can be attributed
to the Company's continued increase in special rate financing programs sponsored
by GM. Most significantly,  in the fourth quarter of 2001, GM launched the "Keep
America  Rolling"  zero percent  financing  program,  which  contributed  to the
increase  in  retail  contracts  compared  to 2000 and  1999.  The  decrease  in
operating  lease  units over that time can be  attributed  to a shift from lease
incentive  programs to special rate retail finance programs  sponsored by GM for
both the U.S. and internationally.

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
         FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

Financing Volume (concluded)

The average new vehicle retail finance contract  purchased by GMAC in the United
States during 2001 was $26,100  compared to $23,500 in 2000 and $22,300 in 1999.
The average  term for new vehicle  retail  finance  contracts  purchased  was 53
months in 2001,  compared to 55 months in 2000 and 54 months in 1999,  while the
monthly  payment on such  contracts  purchased in 2001 averaged $493 compared to
$424 in 2000 and $412 in 1999.  The  increase in the average  amount of a retail
finance  contract  purchased  was  primarily  the result of a  reduction  in the
average  customer  downpayment  and an increase in the average new vehicle  cash
price. The increase in the average monthly payment resulted from the increase in
the average amount of a retail finance contract  purchased and a shorter average
term, partially offset by a decrease in the average customer finance rate.

During 2001, the average capitalized cost for new vehicle retail operating lease
contracts  entered into in the United States was $26,100  compared to $24,300 in
2000 and $23,700 in 1999. The average term of such new vehicle retail leases was
36 months in 2001,  2000 and 1999. The average  monthly retail lease payments on
such contracts were $401 in 2001,  $358 in 2000 and $340 in 1999. The changes in
average  cost and monthly  payment  during 2001 were  mainly  attributable  to a
continued shift in volume towards more expensive vehicle models.

GMAC also provides  wholesale  financing for GM and other  dealers' new and used
vehicle  inventories.  In the United States,  wholesale  inventory financing was
provided  for  3.4  million,  3.6  million  and  3.5  million  new GM  vehicles,
representing 75.5%, 71.5% and 67.7% of all GM sales to U.S. dealers during 2001,
2000  and  1999,  respectively.   The  increase  in  wholesale  penetration  was
attributable to marketing initiatives and competitive pricing strategies offered
by the Company.

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
         FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

Financing Revenues

Financing  revenue totaled $15.1 billion in 2001,  compared to $15.5 billion and
$13.8 billion for 2000 and 1999,  respectively.  The decrease in 2001 was mainly
due to a  decline  in asset  earning  rates  during  2001,  a  decrease  in both
operating  lease  assets and  wholesale  receivables,  which  were  offset by an
increase in retail receivables. The increase in 2000 over 1999 was mainly due to
higher  average  retail,  wholesale  and  commercial  and other loan  receivable
balances.

Retail and lease financing revenue totaled $5,343.0 million in 2001, compared to
$4,773.8  million  and  $4,303.0  million for 2000 and 1999,  respectively.  The
increase in 2001 over 2000 and 1999 was mainly due to a significant  increase in
average  outstanding  retail  balances,  which  resulted from  increased  retail
financing  incentives  sponsored by GM. This was partially offset by lower asset
earning rates in 2001.

Operating lease revenue, net of depreciation,  totaled $2,484.8 million in 2001,
compared  to  $2,740.5   million  and   $2,537.5   million  in  2000  and  1999,
respectively. The decrease in 2001 was partially attributable to the decrease in
average outstanding  operating lease assets,  which was caused by the shift from
lease  incentive  programs  to special  rate retail  finance and other  programs
sponsored by GM.  Additionally,  lower realized gains from the sale of off-lease
vehicles, caused by a weakness in residual values,  contributed to the decrease.
The increase in 2000 over 1999 was primarily  attributable to increases in asset
earning  rates,  which was  partially  offset by decreases  in  operating  lease
assets.

Wholesale,  commercial  and other loan  financing  revenue  amounted to $2,371.1
million,  compared with $2,812.9  million and $2,045.7 million in 2000 and 1999,
respectively. The decrease in 2001 from 2000 was attributable to the decrease in
serviced wholesale receivables due to lower dealer inventory levels, an increase
in wholesale  securitization  activity and a decline in asset earning rates. The
increase  in  2000  from  1999  was  mainly  due to  increased  commercial  loan
receivables  due to GMAC Commercial  Credit LLC's  acquisitions of the factoring
businesses of Finova Capital Corporation.  In addition,  serviced wholesale loan
receivable  balances  increased due to higher dealer inventory levels as well as
an increase in wholesale penetration.

Pre-tax  gains on sold retail  receivables,  included in other  income,  totaled
$210.4 million during 2001 compared with $13.7 million in 2000 and $64.2 million
in 1999.  The  increase in 2001 was due to greater  securitization  volume along
with the declining interest rate environment. Retail receivables sales generally
accelerate the recognition of income on retail contracts,  net of servicing fees
and other  related  deferrals,  into the period the  receivables  are sold.  The
amount  of such  gains  is  affected  by a  number  of  factors  and may  create
variability  in  quarterly   earnings  depending  on  the  type  and  amount  of
receivables  sold and the structure used to effect the sale, as well as interest
rate levels and prevailing financial market conditions.

This  acceleration  results in the pre-tax gains  reflected above and can create
variability  in annual  earnings  depending  on the  amount,  timing and the net
margin between the average yield and  all-in-cost of the sold  receivables.  The
acceleration  also reduces  profit  potential in future  periods.  Although this
acceleration can significantly impact quarterly or year-to-year comparisons,  it
should be noted that the Company generally  recognizes  approximately 70 percent
of interest  and  discount  revenue in the first two years of a retail  contract
(reflecting the term of the underlying  contracts,  revenue  recognition methods
and  historical  prepayment  experience).  As such,  depending  on the timing of
receivables  sales in a given  year,  the net impact on annual  earnings  may be
substantially less than the gains indicated.

Financing Expenses

As noted  earlier,  net retail losses as a percentage of total average  serviced
automotive  receivables  was  0.77%,  0.62%  and  0.63% in 2001,  2000 and 1999,
respectively.  The increase was primarily due to the  deterioration  in economic
conditions in North  America.  The provision  for credit  losses,  most of which
relates to retail  receivables,  totaled  $1,346.4  million,  $551.6 million and
$403.8 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  Higher outstanding finance
receivables,  increased commercial loan loss reserves,  along with increased net
losses  due to the  deterioration  in  economic  conditions  contributed  to the
increase in the provision for credit losses.

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

INSURANCE OPERATIONS

Gross premiums written by GMACI and its subsidiaries  totaled $2,811.6  million,
$2,395.5 million and $2,231.8 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  Net
insurance  premiums  earned  totaled  $2,044.6  million in 2001,  an increase of
$160.8  million from 2000 and an increase of $250.7 million over 1999. The gross
premiums  written  increase  from 2000 was  primarily  due to  strong  volume in
mechanical  business as a result of the Oldsmobile extended service contract and
"Keep America Rolling" promotions.  Additionally,  gross and net premiums earned
increased  due  to  expanding  customer  relationships  in  assumed  reinsurance
business and strong volume in dealer vehicle inventory insurance.  The increases
from 1999 were mainly due to premium growth across all business lines.

Pre-tax  capital  gains at GMACI,  which are included in other  income,  totaled
$84.7  million for 2001, a decrease of $80.8 million from 2000 and a decrease of
$74.1  million  over  1999.  Capital  gains in 2001 were  lower  due to  general
weakness in the equity markets.  The change between 2000 and 1999 was attributed
to the timing of sales and overall market conditions.

Insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses totaled $1,711.2 million, $1,493.1
million and $1,389.9 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The increase
in 2001 from 2000 was primarily due to higher  personal lines losses  associated
with increased  vehicle repair costs,  increased  premiums written in mechanical
and  assumed  reinsurance  business  and  adverse   weather-related   losses  in
commercial  lines.  The  increase  in  2000  from  1999  was  primarily  due  to
deteriorating  losses in the personal lines' agency  business  resulting from an
increase in frequency and severity of claims,  as well as liability and personal
damage claims.

Net income from insurance  operations  totaled $200.2 million in 2001,  9.0% and
4.6% lower than 2000 and 1999 earnings, respectively. The decrease from 2000 was
due to a reduction in capital gains,  reflecting  general weakness in the equity
markets, partially offset by improved underwriting results. The increase in 2000
from 1999 was primarily due to improved  operating results and higher investment
income and capital gains.

MORTGAGE OPERATIONS

During 2001,  GMACMG continued to maintain its position as a leading real estate
financial  services  company in the United States.  Loan  origination,  mortgage
servicing  acquisitions  and  correspondent  loan volume totaled $160.8 billion,
$86.0 billion and $91.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2001,  2000 and
1999,  respectively.  The increase from 2001 over 2000 and 1999 was attributable
to volume increases  caused by declining  interest rates. The decrease from 2000
over 1999 was  attributable to volume  reduction  caused by increasing  interest
rates.  Reflecting  stronger business  activities and  acquisitions,  the GMACMG
servicing  portfolio at December 31, 2001, was $405.1  billion,  20.5% above the
$336.2 billion at December 31, 2000,  excluding $3.8 billion and $3.7 billion of
GMAC term loans at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. GMACMG ranked among
the  leading  originators  and  servicers  of both  residential  and  commercial
mortgages at December 31, 2001.

Mortgage revenue totaled $5,333.6 million, $3,907.2 million and $2,982.3 million
for the years ended December 31, 2001,  2000 and 1999,  respectively,  including
gains on securitization of mortgage loans of $994.6 million,  $722.8 million and
$602.8 million, respectively.  Revenue growth in 2001 was primarily attributable
to significantly  stronger lending volumes,  loan originations,  securitizations
and an increase in the servicing portfolio,  reflecting significant re-financing
activity  prompted by the decline in interest rates observed  throughout most of
2001. In addition,  multiple  acquisitions,  including  GMACMG's  acquisition of
Nippon Asset  Management in Japan in the second quarter of 2000,  have increased
revenues  from  other  lines of  business.  The  increase  in 2000 over 1999 was
primarily  attributable  to a large  volume  of  securitizations,  growth in the
servicing portfolio and acquisitions.

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
         FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

MORTGAGE OPERATIONS (concluded)

Net income from mortgage  operations totaled $330.8 million,  $327.4 million and
$260.5 million for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  Origination volume in the
residential  mortgage sector grew at a record pace, but the related  increase in
earnings  was  largely  offset by the  impairment  charges  recorded on mortgage
servicing  rights  due to  higher  levels of  mortgage  prepayments  and  higher
anticipated  credit  losses  affecting  the  revaluation  of  retained  interest
securities from securitizations.  As a result, net income for 2001 was virtually
unchanged  from 2000.  The increase in 2000  earnings  over 1999 was a result of
strong  international  growth,  lower cost of servicing and  increased  mortgage
originations during the second half of 2000.

Interest rates,  including those on originated loans for fifteen and thirty-year
residential mortgages,  declined throughout most of 2001. This decline increased
actual and potential mortgage refinancing activity,  resulting in a reduction in
the expected  future cash flows that support the carrying  value of the mortgage
servicing rights. As a result, the Company recorded after-tax impairment charges
of $242.5 million for the year ended  December 31, 2001.  Subsequent to December
31,  2001,  mortgage  rates  continue to remain at  historically  low levels and
prepayment activity continues at a pace similar to the pace experienced in 2001.
As a result, the Company recorded after-tax  impairment charges of $38.2 million
for the month ended January 31, 2002. If rates  continue at these low levels and
in the event  that the hedge  positions  prove to be not  fully  effective,  the
Company may experience further impairment losses.

The Company estimates the fair value of its mortgage servicing rights based upon
assumptions that market participants would use. Typically, those assumptions are
derived  from similar  transactions  which occur in the  marketplace.  Continued
industry  consolidation  and other factors have led to a substantial  decline in
relevant  market  transactions  for  certain   residential   mortgage  products,
particularly  since April 2001.  In order to improve  the  Company's  estimation
process  for  assessing  the fair  value of certain  of its  mortgage  servicing
rights, during the second quarter, the Company increased its reliance on its own
mortgage  servicing  rights  cash  flow  history  for  certain  assumptions  and
continues to use market driven earning rates, discounting factors and prepayment
models.

In the third quarter,  GMACR announced that its  wholly-owned  subsidiary,  GMAC
Bank,  a federal  savings  bank,  received its charter from the Office of Thrift
Supervision.  GMAC Bank  offers a variety  of  banking  and  personal  financial
services  products.  Along with  deposit  offerings,  GMAC Bank  originates  and
purchases  mortgage loans, as well as home equity loans and lines of credit.  At
December 31, 2001, GMAC Bank maintained total assets of $1.0 billion.  As of the
date of this filing, GMAC Bank has met all regulatory capital requirements.

In the third quarter, GMACCH provided a $563 million first mortgage loan secured
by a leasehold  interest in four  properties  in the World Trade Center  complex
(the Twin Towers and Four and Five World Trade  Center).  The mortgage  loan was
securitized  and $483  million  of the  bonds  were  sold to  investors.  GMACCH
retained $80 million of the  subordinate  bonds.  The insurance,  as required in
connection  with  GMAC's  financing,  does  not  exclude  coverage  for  acts of
terrorism.  The  insurance  is from a  consortium  of 22  large  and  well-rated
insurers.  Although current litigation is outstanding regarding the use of those
insurance  proceeds by the property owners,  GMACCH expects to fully recover its
$80 million  investment in  subordinate  bonds  associated  with the World Trade
Center.

BORROWING COSTS

The Company's worldwide cost of borrowing, including the effects of derivatives,
averaged  5.59%  for  2001,  compared  to 6.52%  and  5.67%  for 2000 and  1999,
respectively. Total borrowing costs for U.S. operations averaged 5.51% for 2001,
compared  to 6.64% and 5.66% for 2000 and 1999,  respectively.  The  decrease in
average  borrowing  costs  was  mainly  a result  of a  continued  reduction  in
short-term  market  rates  during  the year  that was  somewhat  offset by wider
borrowing spreads and increased use of term funding.

         FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

OTHER INCOME

Other  income,  including  gains and fees related to sold  finance  receivables,
totaled  $3,014.1  million for 2001,  compared to $2,376.7  million and $1,663.9
million during the comparable 2000 and 1999 periods,  respectively. The increase
in 2001 over 2000 was  primarily a result of  increased  income  from  increased
securitization  levels  of  retail  and  wholesale  receivables.   Additionally,
interest  income  increased due to the increase in cash and cash  equivalents in
2001.  The  increase in 2000 over 1999 was mainly  attributable  to increases in
interest  and  servicing  fees  earned on  receivables  due from GM,  along with
increases  in GMAC  Commercial  Credit  LLC's  factoring  commissions  and other
servicing fees. GMAC Commercial Credit LLC was acquired in July 1999,  resulting
in only six  months of income in 1999.  Additionally,  other  income  related to
sales of  receivables  in 2000  increased  mainly due to the increase in service
fees received,  due to higher  outstandings  of secured notes and an increase in
other income due to increased securitization activity.

CONSOLIDATED EXPENSES

Consolidated  interest and discount expense totaled $7,599.3  million,  $8,294.7
million and $6,526.2 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The decrease
in 2001 over 2000 was a result of decreased  borrowing costs due to lower market
interest rates,  which was partially offset by higher debt levels.  The increase
in 2000 over 1999 was due to  increased  borrowing  costs in  addition to higher
debt levels which were principally used to fund increased asset levels.

Consolidated  salaries and benefits  increased in 2001 to $1,973.4  million from
$1,865.9  million  and  $1,591.9  million  in 2000 and 1999,  respectively.  The
increase was primarily related to acquisitions and significant  growth at GMACCH
and RFC, along with higher employee benefit costs.

Consolidated  amortization  of  intangibles  totaled  $1,185.9  million,  $660.7
million and $516.9 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999,  respectively.  The increases
since 1999 were primarily  attributable to an increase in the  amortization  and
impairment of mortgage  servicing  rights.  Amortization  of mortgage  servicing
rights  increased  due to the  growth in the  servicing  portfolio  from  $336.2
billion  in 2000 to  $405.1  billion  at  year-end  2001  and the  corresponding
increase in mortgage servicing rights balance from $4.0 billion at year-end 2000
to $4.8 billion at year-end 2001.  Further,  declining interest rates throughout
most of 2001 contributed to higher loan prepayment levels,  which created higher
levels of servicing asset impairment.

Consolidated other operating expenses totaled $3,976.3 million, $3,072.5 million
and $2,410.1 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The increase in 2001
was  primarily  related to continued  growth and  acquisitions  as well as hedge
ineffectiveness at GMACMG.  The increases in 2000 over 1999 primarily  reflected
continued  growth and  acquisitions at GMACMG.  Subsequent to December 31, 2001,
mortgage prepayment  activity continues at a pace similar to 2001,  resulting in
net hedge ineffectiveness of $11.4 million after-tax through January 31, 2002.

INCOME TAXES

Consolidated  United  States,  foreign and other income taxes  totaled  $1,047.1
million,   $954.3  million  and  $960.2   million  for  2001,   2000  and  1999,
respectively.  The  effective  income tax rate for 2001 was 37.4%,  compared  to
37.3% in 2000 and 38.6% in 1999.  The  decline  from 1999 can be  attributed  to
decreases in accruals  from prior years based upon  periodic  assessment  of the
adequacy of such accruals primarily for tax liabilities of non-U.S. operations.

CONSOLIDATED ASSETS

At the end of 2001, the Company owned assets and serviced automotive receivables
totaling $220.1 billion,  an increase of $34.4 billion over year-end 2000. Total
consolidated  assets of the  Company at December  31, 2001 were $192.7  billion,
$24.2 billion above the previous year. The year-to-year increases were primarily
the  result  of  increases  in  serviced  retail  receivables,   cash  and  cash
equivalents,   mortgages  held  for  sale,   other  assets,   mortgage   lending
receivables,   mortgage  loans  held  for  investment,  due  and  deferred  from
receivable sales and mortgage  servicing rights.  These increases were partially
offset by decreases in serviced wholesale  receivables,  operating lease assets,
receivables due from GM and factored receivables.

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
         FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

CONSOLIDATED ASSETS (continued)

Consolidated  automotive  and  commercial  finance  receivables  serviced by the
Company,  including  sold  receivables,  amounted  to $130.6  billion and $112.5
billion at December 31, 2001 and 2000,  respectively.  The year-to-year increase
was  primarily  a  result  of  a  $24.3  billion  increase  in  serviced  retail
receivables,  which was partially  offset by a $5.3 billion decrease in serviced
wholesale   receivables.   Continued  increased  GM-sponsored  retail  financing
incentives contributed to the rise in serviced retail receivables.  The decrease
in serviced  wholesale  receivables  was due to lower dealer  inventory  levels.
Principal  balances of active trusts of sold  wholesale  receivables  (including
retained  subordinated  interests) increased $6.2 billion, due to the completion
of three sales in 2001.  Additionally,  outstanding  principal  balances of sold
retail  automotive  receivables  (including  retained  subordinated   interests)
increased by $3.5 billion due to the completion of five sales during 2001.

Cash and cash equivalents  totaled $10.1 billion at December 31, 2001,  compared
with $1.1 billion held at December 31, 2000.  The increase was  primarily due to
increased term funding activity during the period.

Mortgage  loans held for sale  totaled  $10.2  billion  at  December  31,  2001,
compared to $5.8 billion at December 31, 2000. The low interest rate environment
throughout   2001   contributed   to  increases  in  loan   acquisitions,   loan
originations, financings and an overall increase in mortgage loan inventory.

Other assets  totaled  $15.7  billion and $12.0 billion at December 31, 2001 and
2000, respectively.  Of the $3.7 billion increase, $1.7 billion was attributable
to the  adoption of SFAS No. 133,  Accounting  for  Derivative  Instruments  and
Hedging Activities,  which requires GMAC to reflect the fair market value of its
derivatives on the balance sheet. Other  mortgage-related  assets increased $1.4
billion from December 31, 2000 to December 31, 2001,  reflecting  increased loan
participations,   counterparty   collateral   arrangements   and   broker/dealer
receivables resulting from increased business levels in 2001.

Mortgage  lending  receivables  amounted to $4.5  billion at December  31, 2001,
compared to $3.0 billion at December 31, 2000.  The increase  relates to GMACR's
acquisition of the warehouse lending operations of GE Capital Mortgage Services,
Inc., and RFC's increased  business growth in construction,  warehouse and other
lending receivables throughout 2001.

Mortgage  loans held for  investment  totaled  $3.4  billion and $1.9 billion at
December  31,  2001  and  2000,   respectively.   The  declining  interest  rate
environment  throughout  most of 2001 was  conducive to loan  origination,  loan
refinancing and loan acquisitions.  Further, in 2001, approximately $1.7 billion
of subprime  adjustable rate mortgage loans were transferred from mortgage loans
held for sale to mortgage loans held for investment. Approximately, $1.2 billion
of these loans were securitized and accounted for as a collateralized  borrowing
arrangement.

The Company's due and deferred from finance  receivable sales (net) totaled $2.3
billion at December 31, 2001, compared to $1.2 billion at December 31, 2000. The
increase over year-end was mainly due to an increase in interest-only strips and
cash deposits held for trusts due to increased  securitization  of wholesale and
retail receivables.

Mortgage  servicing rights amounted to $4.8 billion and $4.0 billion at December
31, 2001 and 2000,  respectively.  The  increase  was  primarily  attributed  to
increases  in  loan  originations  and  acquisitions  resulting  from  declining
interest rates partially offset by impairment  charges  reflecting higher levels
of mortgage  prepayments.  The net increase in mortgage  servicing rights during
2001 also  reflected  the  adoption  of SFAS No. 133 on  January 1, 2001,  which
included the reclassification of derivative financial  instruments used to hedge
the change in fair value in mortgage  servicing  rights from Mortgage  servicing
rights to Other assets.

Investment  in  operating  leases,  net,  acquired  principally  under  the GMAC
SmartLease  program,  totaled  $25.2 billion at December 31, 2001, a decrease of
$4.1 billion from December 31, 2000. The decrease was primarily  attributable to
a decrease in volume caused by a shift from lease incentive  programs to special
rate retail finance programs sponsored by GM.

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
         FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

CONSOLIDATED ASSETS (concluded)

Notes  receivable  from GM amounted to $4.2 billion and $5.4 billion at December
31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.  The decline was attributable to a $0.7 billion
decrease in a $2.0 billion  revolving  line of credit that GM has available with
GMAC.  Additionally,  there was a decline in the outstanding  loans from GMAC of
Canada,  Limited,  a  wholly-owned  subsidiary,  to GM  of  Canada  ("GMCL"),  a
wholly-owned subsidiary of GM. The loans are used to fund GMCL's vehicle leasing
program.

Factored  receivables totaled $1.4 billion and $2.3 billion at December 31, 2001
and 2000,  respectively.  This decrease  relates to both a decline in sales from
existing clients and in the factoring client base during the course of 2001.

Net  unrealized  losses on  derivatives  at December  31, 2001,  totaled  $170.7
million (including a $52.6 million transition adjustment) due to the adoption of
SFAS No. 133 by the  Company on January 1,  2001.  This  amount  represents  the
effective portion of changes in the fair value of the Company's derivatives that
are  designated as cash flow hedges as well as  unrealized  losses on terminated
cash flow hedges.

LIQUIDITY

The  Company's  liquidity,  as  well  as its  ability  to  profit  from  ongoing
acquisition  activity,  is in large part  dependent  upon its  timely  access to
capital and the costs associated with raising funds in different segments of the
capital  markets.  In this  regard,  GMAC  regularly  accesses  the  short-term,
medium-term  and  long-term  debt  and  asset  backed  securitization   markets,
principally through commercial paper, notes and underwritten transactions.

Debt and Credit Facilities

As of December 31, 2001,  GMAC's total  borrowings were $152.0 billion  compared
with  $133.4  billion  at  December  31,  2000.  Approximately  84% of this debt
represented  funding for operations in the United States,  and the remaining 16%
represented  borrowings  for  operations  in Canada (7%),  United  Kingdom (3%),
Germany (2%) and other  countries  (4%). The 2001 year-end ratio of consolidated
debt to total  stockholder's  equity was 9.4:1  compared  to 9.5:1 for  year-end
2000.  The higher  year-to-year  debt  balances  were  principally  used to fund
increased asset levels.  Total short-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2001,
amounted to $36.2 billion compared with $56.9 billion at year-end 2000.

Intermediate  and  long-term   funding  is  provided  through  the  issuance  of
underwritten  debt and  medium-term  notes,  which are  offered  by  prospectus,
offering  circular or private  placement  worldwide on a continuous  basis. GMAC
sells  medium-term  notes worldwide through dealer agents in book-entry form for
any maturity  ranging from nine months to thirty years.  Issuance of medium-term
notes for U.S.  operations  totaled  $25.6  billion  in 2001  compared  to $10.2
billion in 2000. Outstanding medium-term notes for U.S. operations totaled $48.3
billion at December 31, 2001, an increase of $16.7  billion from the  prior-year
period.  During  2001,  underwritten  debt issues  totaling  $25.8  billion were
completed for use in the U.S., compared with $7.3 billion in 2000.  Underwritten
debt issues outstanding in the U.S. at December 31, 2001, totaled $49.8 billion,
an increase of $19.2  billion from year-end  2000. As of December 31, 2001,  the
Company  had  unissued  debt   securities   available   under   effective  shelf
registrations with the U.S.  Securities and Exchange  Commission  totaling $50.1
billion.

LIQUIDITY (continued)

Debt and Credit Facilities (concluded)

The  Company and its  subsidiaries  maintain  substantial  bank lines of credit,
which totaled  $48.8 billion at December 31, 2001,  compared to $48.1 billion at
year-end  2000.  The unused  portion of these  credit  lines  increased  by $0.5
billion from December 31, 2000 to $38.9  billion at December 31, 2001.  Included
in the unused credit lines at December 31, 2001,  is a $14.7 billion  syndicated
multi-currency  global credit facility available for use in the U.S. by GMAC and
in Europe by GMAC International Finance B.V. and GMAC (UK) plc. The entire $14.7
billion is available to GMAC in the U.S., $1.0 billion is available to GMAC (UK)
plc and $0.9  billion  is  available  to GMAC  International  Finance  B.V.  The
syndicated  credit  facility  serves  primarily  as  back-up  for the  Company's
unsecured commercial paper programs. Also included in the unused credit lines is
a $12.3 billion U.S.  asset-backed  commercial  paper  liquidity and receivables
facility for New Center Asset Trust ("NCAT"), a non-consolidated limited purpose
business trust established to issue  asset-backed  commercial  paper.  (Refer to
Off-balance Sheet Activities section of the Management's Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.)

In June 2001, GMAC renewed the syndicated  multi-currency global facility, which
includes  terms of five years on one-half of the facility (due to expire in June
2006) and a 364-day  term with a one year  term-out  option.  It was modified to
permit the  Company,  at its  discretion,  to  transfer up to  approximately  $6
billion of the banks' commitments to the liquidity and receivables  facility for
NCAT. Such transfer provisions have not been utilized.  Additionally, there is a
leverage   covenant   restricting  the  ratio  of  consolidated  debt  to  total
stockholder's  equity to no greater than 11.0:1 under certain  conditions.  This
covenant is only  applicable on the last day of any fiscal  quarter  (other than
the fiscal  quarter during which a change in rating occurs) during such times as
the Company has senior unsecured long-term debt outstanding, without third-party
enhancement,  which is rated BBB+ or less by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services,
a division of  McGraw-Hill  Companies,  Inc.  ("S&P") or Baa1 or less by Moody's
Investors  Service,  Inc.  ("Moody's").  As a  result  of the  Company's  rating
downgrade by S&P in October  2001,  those  conditions  became  effective and the
Company is in compliance with the covenant.  Those conditions were not in effect
on December 31, 2000.

Outside of the United  States,  funding needs are met primarily by a combination
of short-term and medium-term loans from banks and other financial institutions.
Where it is cost-effective,  the Company also issues commercial paper as well as
medium-term  and  long-term  debt in both  the euro and  local  markets  to fund
certain non-U.S. operations.

Credit  facilities   supporting   operations  of  the  Company's   international
subsidiaries  totaled  $16.5 billion at December 31, 2001, of which $9.6 billion
were unused.  As of December 31, 2001, the committed and uncommitted  portion of
such credit facilities totaled $3.8 billion and $12.7 billion, respectively.

Inclusive of the $1.9 billion of the  syndicated  multi-currency  global  credit
facility, credit facilities supporting operations of the Company's international
subsidiaries  totaled $18.4 billion at December 31, 2001, of which $11.5 billion
were unused.  As of December 31, 2001, the committed and uncommitted  portion of
such credit facilities totaled $5.7 billion and $12.7 billion, respectively.

Off-balance Sheet Activities

Automotive
The Company  securitizes and transfers  financial assets,  using financial asset
securitization  procedures,  as an  alternative  funding  source  to  borrowing.
Securitization  of assets allows the Company to diversify  funding sources in an
attempt to lower its overall cost of funds. Termination of the activities of the
entities described below would reduce the number of funding resources  currently
available to the Company for funding its automotive finance activities. Any such
reduction of funding  sources  would create a risk of  increasing  the Company's
cost of funds and reducing its profit margins.

LIQUIDITY (continued)

Off-balance Sheet Activities (continued)

Automotive (continued)
The  Company's  finance  receivables  asset  securitization  program  is further
described in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated  Financial  Statements.  In the
program, automotive retail and wholesale finance receivables are sold to limited
purpose   bankruptcy-remote   subsidiaries  of  the  Company.   In  turn,  these
subsidiaries establish separate trusts to which they transfer the receivables in
exchange for the proceeds from asset-backed  securities issued by the trust. The
trusts'   activities   are  limited  to  acquiring  the   receivables,   issuing
asset-backed securities and making payments on the securities.  The Company does
not  sell   non-performing   automotive   receivables   as  part  of  its  asset
securitization program.

Due to the nature of the assets  held by the  trusts and the  limited  nature of
each  trust's  activities,  they are each  classified  as a  qualifying  special
purpose  entity  ("QSPE")  under SFAS No.  140,  Accounting  for  Transfers  and
Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities.  In accordance
with SFAS No. 140, assets and  liabilities of the QSPEs are not  consolidated in
the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company agrees to service the receivables transferred to the QSPEs for a fee
and earns other  related  ongoing  income  customary  with the  programs  and in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The Company
also may retain all or a portion of senior  and  subordinated  interests  in the
QSPEs;  these  interests  are reported as assets in the  Company's  Consolidated
Financial  Statements.  The amount of the fees earned and the levels of retained
interests  that the Company  maintains are quantified and described in Note 3 of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  The Company may also enter into
derivative  transactions in order to facilitate its  securitization  activities.
Those  transactions  are  described  in Note  17 of the  Notes  to  Consolidated
Financial Statements.

No  recourse  provisions  exist  that allow  holders of the QSPEs'  asset-backed
securities to put those  securities back to the Company.  Moreover,  the Company
does not guarantee any securities  issued by the QSPEs.  The Company's  exposure
related to these QSPEs is limited to cash  deposits  held for the benefit of the
QSPEs' investors and retained  interests in the QSPEs, all of which are reported
in the Company's  Consolidated  Financial  Statements.  The QSPEs have a limited
life  and  generally  terminate  upon  final  distribution  of  amounts  owed to
investors or upon exercise by GMAC, as servicer,  when the servicing of the sold
contracts becomes burdensome. In addition, the QSPEs do not own stock of GMAC or
any of its affiliates.

The Company has also sponsored two special  purpose  entities  ("SPEs") that are
used as sources of additional liquidity.  Currently the activities of these SPEs
are not sufficiently limited to meet the QSPE criteria of SFAS No. 140. However,
because each SPE maintains  substantive  independent  third-party equity,  these
entities  are  not  consolidated  with  the  Company's   Consolidated  Financial
Statements.  As with the QSPEs described above, all interests in these SPEs that
are retained by the Company and its  consolidated  subsidiaries  are included in
its Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, the SPEs do not own stock of
GMAC or any of its affiliates.

NCAT is a  limited  purpose  trust  that  was  established  for the  purpose  of
purchasing  and holding  privately  issued  asset-backed  securities  created in
GMAC's asset securitization program as described above. NCAT funds that activity
through the issuance of asset-backed  commercial paper and equity  certificates.
NCAT acquires the  asset-backed  securities  from the QSPEs  established  by the
Company's  limited purpose  bankruptcy-remote  subsidiaries.  As of December 31,
2001, NCAT had $9.7 billion in asset-backed  securities  which were supported by
$9.3 billion in  commercial  paper and $0.4 billion in equity owned by investors
not affiliated with the Company.  The Company acts as  administrator  of NCAT to
provide  for the  administration  of the trust.  In this  capacity,  the Company
earned  pre-tax  income of $6.4  million,  $14.2  million  and $14.5  million in
administration fees for the years ended 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

Off-balance Sheet Activities (continued)

Automotive (concluded)
The Company  does not  guarantee  debt issued by NCAT nor are there any recourse
provisions that would permit holders to put NCAT's debt  obligations back to the
Company. NCAT maintains a separate revolving credit agreement characterized as a
liquidity  and  receivables   purchase  facility  to  support  its  issuance  of
commercial  paper.  However,  at the Company's  discretion,  approximately  $6.0
billion of the Company's $14.7 billion syndicated  multi-currency  global credit
facility is available  for transfer to the liquidity  and  receivables  purchase
facility for NCAT. In the event of termination of NCAT's liquidity facility, its
commercial paper would be paid with loans from participating  banks and proceeds
from its assets would be used to repay the banks.  Termination of NCAT, however,
would  preclude the Company  from  continuing  its indirect  access to NCAT as a
source of funding.

Central  Originating  Lease  Trust  ("COLT")  is a limited  purpose  trust  that
acquires  vehicles  and related  consumer  leases on consumer  vehicles  from GM
franchised  dealers.  COLT funds  these  acquisitions  through  the  issuance of
secured notes, which it sells to the Company, and through the issuance of equity
certificates to unaffiliated investors.  The equity certificates are subordinate
to and have  substantially  different  rights than the secured notes. The equity
certificates  are  perpetual,  subject to redemption  in  accordance  with their
terms,  and in the legal form of equity.  COLT had $8.1 billion in finance lease
assets outstanding as of December 31, 2001, and $282.9 million of equity.

Each secured note issued to the Company by COLT is  non-recourse  to COLT and is
secured by,  among other  items,  a security  interest in the related  lease and
leased vehicle. As of December 31, 2001 and 2000, the Company owned $7.1 billion
and $7.5  billion,  respectively,  of  secured  notes  issued  by COLT that were
recorded in its Consolidated Financial Statements as finance receivables.  These
secured  notes  may  be  retained  by  the  Company  or  sold  under  its  asset
securitization  program.  Pre-tax  income on these secured notes totaled  $449.7
million,  $382.7 million and $183.8  million for the years 2001,  2000 and 1999,
respectively.  The Company  also acts as an  originating  agent and servicer for
COLT leases.  In connection  with these  services,  the Company  earned  pre-tax
income of $200.9  million,  $204.9 million and $144.9 million during 2001,  2000
and 1999,  respectively.  The Company also enters into swap agreements with COLT
for which the  accounting  is described in Note 17 of the Notes to  Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Losses  with  respect  to the  lease-related  assets  of COLT are  covered  by a
termination  value  insurance  agreement.  The  insurance is  underwritten  by a
third-party insurer and provides 100 percent loss coverage (subject to a cap) if
there is a  deficiency  in the expected  proceeds  from the lease asset at lease
termination.  Separately,  the Company has entered  into an  agreement  with the
third-party  insurer  whereby the  Company  receives a fee for  reimbursing  the
insurer for a portion of losses paid to COLT,  subject to a cap. The Company has
established  a reserve  (recorded in its  Consolidated  Financial  Statements as
other liabilities)  related to its exposure under this reimbursement  agreement.
At December  31, 2001 and 2000,  the Company  had  reserved  $478.8  million and
$349.5 million,  respectively,  to cover potential claims from the insurer under
the reimbursement agreement.

If it should be  terminated,  COLT  would no  longer  be  available  as a source
through  which  GM  franchised  dealers  would be able to fund  sales of  retail
automotive  leases.  COLT would wind down its activities using proceeds of lease
assets and the termination value insurance  agreement to repay its secured notes
and to ultimately redeem its equity.

Mortgage
In the normal  course of business,  GMACMG  originates  and  purchases  mortgage
loans, including residential and commercial mortgage loans and related products,
with the intent to earn interest income,  origination fees and servicing income.
The majority of mortgage loans  originated and purchased are considered held for
sale,  and are  usually  sold to third  party  investors  directly  or through a
variety of SPEs (including QSPEs),  and other structured  facilities in order to
achieve more efficient execution and provide funds for the continued origination
and purchase of loans.  Conforming  residential  mortgages  are  generally  sold
through sponsored  mortgage backed securities  programs of investors such as the
Federal  National  Mortgage  Association  (Fannie  Mae),  the Federal  Home Loan
Mortgage   Corporation   (Freddie  Mac)  or  the  Government  National  Mortgage
Association (Ginnie Mae). Nonconforming  residential,  commercial mortgage, home
equity  loans and other asset  classes are  generally  sold  through  whole loan
transactions  to third parties or through  securitization  vehicles such as SPEs
where beneficial  interests in underlying pools of loans are sold to third party
investors.  These SPEs are also known as off-balance  sheet  facilities.  GMACMG
does not provide any loans or guarantees to the SPEs.

Rated Term Securitizations
--------------------------
GMACMG's mortgage loan securitization program is further described in Note 13 of
the  Notes  to   Consolidated   Financial   Statements.   Under   GMACMG's  term
securitization   program,   mortgage   loans   are  sold  to   limited   purpose
bankruptcy-remote  subsidiaries of GMACMG. In turn, these subsidiaries establish
separate  trusts to which they  transfer the mortgage  loans in exchange for the
proceeds from the sale of mortgage and/or asset-backed  securities issued by the
trust.  The trusts'  activities are generally  limited to acquiring the mortgage
loans,  issuing mortgage and/or  asset-backed  securities and making payments on
the  securities.  Due to the  nature of the  assets  held by the  trusts and the
limited  nature of each trust's  activities,  they are each  classified as QSPEs
under SFAS No. 140. In accordance  with SFAS No. 140,  assets and liabilities of
the  QSPEs  are  not  consolidated  in  the  Company's   Consolidated  Financial
Statements.  Mortgage  loans  totaling  $89.6 billion were  outstanding in these
facilities at December 31, 2001.

GMACMG agrees to service the mortgage  loans  transferred to the QSPEs for a fee
and may earn  other  related  ongoing  income.  GMACMG  also may retain all or a
portion of senior and  subordinated  interests in the QSPEs, and these interests
are reported as assets in the Company's Consolidated  Financial Statements.  The
amount of the fees earned and the levels of retained  interests that the Company
maintains are quantified  and described in Note 13 of the Notes to  Consolidated
Financial  Statements.  GMACMG may also enter into  derivative  transactions  in
order to facilitate its securitization  activities.  Those transactions are also
described in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

GMACMG's  securitization  program also includes the  securitization  of mortgage
securities, unsecured notes receivable, and mortgage loans using SPEs that issue
collateralized  debt obligations  ("CDOs").  In these  transactions,  GMACMG and
other  unaffiliated  parties each  contributed a portion of the total collateral
underlying the CDO investments.  GMACMG holds subordinated interests,  including
partial  first loss  positions in CDO  investments,  and also acts as collateral
manager for the SPEs.  These  interests  are reflected in Note 5 of the Notes to
Consolidated  Financial  Statements but the assets and liabilities of these SPEs
are not consolidated in the Company's  Consolidated  Financial  Statements.  The
face  amount  of  collateral  outstanding  in these  deals was $1.2  billion  at
December 31, 2001.

Off-balance Sheet Activities (continued)

Mortgage (continued)
Off-balance Sheet Warehouse Funding
-----------------------------------
GMACMG uses several  off-balance  sheet warehouse funding vehicles to accumulate
and  aggregate  both  residential  and  commercial   mortgage  loans  or  senior
beneficial interests in mortgage loans pending permanent sale or securitization.
Net assets in these  facilities  totaled  $9.2  billion at  December  31,  2001.
Funding for the assets is provided through the issuance of commercial paper by a
GMACMG (see below) or bank-sponsored SPE, by a QSPE or by third-party financing.
A number of the  facilities  ($6.1  billion  outstanding  at December  31, 2001)
provide  committed  funding for the term of the  facility  agreement.  Under the
remaining facilities ($3.1 billion outstanding at December 31, 2001), funding is
at the  discretion of the  sponsoring  bank or third party.  In connection  with
certain of these funding  facilities  ($4.7 billion  outstanding at December 31,
2001), GMACMG enters into derivative  contracts to retain or hedge interest rate
and/or  credit risk  associated  with certain  assets in the  facilities.  These
derivatives  are  marked  to  market  in the  Company's  Consolidated  Financial
Statements,   with   unrealized   holding  gains  and  losses  recorded  in  the
Consolidated Statement of Income. Failure of the committed facility providers to
renew their  commitments,  or of the uncommitted  facility providers to continue
accepting loans, would require GMACMG to find alternative  financing sources for
these assets.

One of the committed  warehouse  funding  facilities  is a GMACMG  sponsored SPE
whose activities are not sufficiently  limited to meet the QSPE criteria of SFAS
No.140.  The SPE funds the  purchase of mortgage  loans from GMACMG  through the
issuance of asset-backed  commercial paper and through  substantive  independent
third-party  equity and with no supporting loans or guarantees from GMACMG. As a
result,  the  SPE  is  not  included  in the  Company's  Consolidated  Financial
Statements.  As of December 31, 2001,  mortgage loans totaling $1.9 billion were
held by this entity.

Other Off-balance Sheet Funding
-------------------------------
GMACMG also uses off-balance  sheet QSPEs and third-party  facilities to finance
mortgage-related products,  primarily defaulted government insured or guaranteed
mortgage loans and warehouse and construction lending receivables. Net assets in
these  facilities  totaled $5.9  billion at December  31, 2001.  Funding for the
assets is provided by either a  bank-sponsored  commercial  paper  conduit or by
third party financing.  Nearly all of these facilities ($5.8 billion outstanding
at December  31, 2001) are  committed  for the term of the  agreement,  with the
balance at the discretion of the third party.  Failure of the committed facility
providers to renew their commitments,  or of the uncommitted  facility providers
to continue accepting loans, would require GMACMG to find alternative  financing
sources for these assets. The assets and liabilities of these facilities are not
consolidated in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.

Liquidity and Related Risks
---------------------------
Liquidity support for the bank-sponsored  asset-backed commercial paper conduits
is provided by the banks. GMACMG does not guarantee debt issued by the conduits,
nor guarantee the liquidity support,  nor are there any recourse provisions that
would permit holders to put the conduit's debt  obligations  back to GMACMG.  In
the event that  liquidity  banks fail to renew  their  commitment  and GMACMG is
unable to find  replacement  liquidity  support or  alternative  financing,  the
outstanding  commercial paper would be paid with loans from participating banks,
and proceeds from the underlying assets would be used to repay the banks.

Included in the derivative  contracts  previously discussed are put options held
by third party banks covering $1.1 billion in loans at December 31, 2001. In the
event of a concurrent  exercise of these puts by the holders,  GMACMG would need
to obtain  additional  financing  from its parent or  elsewhere  to satisfy  its
obligations.

Certain of the facilities  contain  provisions which permit or require GMACMG to
purchase  assets from the SPEs upon the occurrence of specific  events caused by
third parties.  When these events occur, GMACMG is required to record the assets
subject to these provisions in its Consolidated Financial Statements.

Mortgage (concluded)
Retained Interests
-------------------
GMACMG often retains residual or subordinated  interests  (including  investment
securities,  mortgage  servicing  rights,  cash deposit and spread  accounts and
subordinate  loan  participations)  in  connection  with the  off-balance  sheet
activities.  Subordinate  interests typically provide support to the more highly
rated senior certificates in a securitization transaction, and may be subject to
all or partial first loss position related to the collateral sold. All interests
in the QSPEs and the off-balance sheet SPEs described above that are retained by
GMACMG are included in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.

Debt Ratings

GMAC's  ability to access the capital  markets for  unsecured  debt is linked to
both its term debt and commercial paper ratings.  This is particularly true with
respect to the Company's commercial paper ratings. These ratings are intended to
provide  guidance to investors in determining  the credit risk  associated  with
particular  securities  based on  current  information  obtained  by the  rating
organizations from the Company or other sources that such organizations consider
to be reliable. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well
as reduced access to capital markets.  A security rating is not a recommendation
to buy, sell or hold  securities and is subject to revision or withdrawal at any
time by the  assigning  rating  organization.  Each rating  should be  evaluated
independently of any other rating.

Substantially  all of the Company's  short-term,  medium-term and long-term debt
has been rated by three nationally recognized  statistical rating organizations.
As of March 11, 2002,  all of the ratings  assigned  were within the  investment
grade category.

-------------                           ----------   -------------

Fitch, Inc.                                 A-             F-2
Moody's Investors Service, Inc.             A2          Prime-1
Standard & Poor's Ratings Services        BBB+             A-2

Fitch, Inc. ("Fitch") has assigned ratings of A- and F-2 to the Company's senior
debt and commercial paper,  respectively.  The A- rating is assigned by Fitch to
bonds  considered to be very good credit  quality with the obligor's  ability to
pay interest and repay  principal  considered to be very good. The F-2 rating is
assigned  to  short-term  issues  which  possess  a good  credit  quality  based
primarily on the existence of liquidity  necessary to meet the  obligations in a
timely manner.  In October 2001,  Fitch downgraded the senior debt rating from A
to A- and  downgraded  the  commercial  paper  rating to F-2.  The rating  watch
negative was removed and the rating outlook was revised to negative.

Moody's has assigned a rating of A2 to the  Company's  senior  debt,  indicating
favorable  investment  attributes  and strong  ability to repay  principal  plus
interest.  The Company's  commercial paper has received a rating of Prime-1 from
Moody's,  reflecting  superior  ability for repayment of senior  short-term debt
obligations  and assured  ability to access  alternative  sources of  liquidity.
Additional  repayment  characteristics of commercial paper issues receiving this
premium rating include leading market position in a  well-established  industry,
high rates of return on funds employed and broad margins in earnings coverage of
fixed financial charges. In October 2001,  Moody's,  while affirming its ratings
on GMAC, revised its outlook on the rating from stable to negative.

S&P has assigned a rating of BBB+ to the Company's  senior debt. The BBB+ rating
is assigned to bonds  considered to have  adequate  capacity to pay interest and
repay  principal.  The Company's  commercial paper has received a rating of A-2,
indicating  an  adequate  capacity  for timely  payment.  In October  2001,  S&P
downgraded  the  senior  debt  and  commercial  paper  ratings  from A and  A-1,
respectively.  All ratings were removed from credit watch and the rating outlook
is now stable.

As of March  11,  2002,  GMAC is not under  review  by any of the  above  rating
agencies.

Derivative Financial Instruments

In managing the interest rate and foreign exchange  exposures of a multinational
finance entity,  the Company and its subsidiaries  utilize a variety of interest
rate and  currency  derivative  financial  instruments.  As an  end-user of such
instruments,  GMAC is in a better  position to expand its  investor  base and to
minimize  its  funding  costs,   enhancing  its  ability  to  offer  attractive,
competitive  financing rates to its customers.  The portfolio consists primarily
of interest rate swaps,  futures and options;  currency swaps and forwards which
are  matched  to offset a  companion  asset or  funding  obligation;  and hedges
related to mortgage operations.

These instruments  involve,  to varying degrees,  elements of credit risk in the
event a counterparty  should  default,  and market risk, as the  instruments are
subject  to rate and price  fluctuations.  Credit  risk is managed  through  the
periodic  monitoring  and  approval  of  financially  sound  counterparties  and
limiting the potential  exposure to individual  counterparties  to predetermined
notional and exposure limits. Market risk is inherently limited by the fact that
the Company holds offsetting asset or liability  positions.  Market risk is also
managed on an ongoing basis by determining and monitoring the fair value of each
transaction in the portfolio. GMAC employs a variety of internal swap and option
models,  using  mid-market  rates,  to  calculate  mark-to-market  values of its
derivative  positions and also obtains  valuations from its  counterparties  for
reporting purposes.

CASH FLOWS

Cash  provided by  operating  activities  during 2001 totaled  $4.7  billion,  a
decrease from the $10.1 billion during the comparable 2000 period and a decrease
from the $10.2 billion provided during the comparable 1999 period.  The decrease
in  operating  cash flow from 2000 was  primarily  the result of an  increase in
originations/purchases of mortgage loans held for sale that was partially offset
by an increase in proceeds  on sale of mortgage  loans.  The slight  decrease in
2000 over 1999 was primarily the result of a decrease in net proceeds on sale of
mortgage  loans,   mainly  offset  by  an  increase  in  other  liabilities  and
depreciation and amortization.

Cash used for investing  activities during 2001 totaled $14.9 billion,  compared
with $24.5 billion and $21.4  billion  during the same periods in 2000 and 1999,
respectively.  The  decrease  in 2001 from 2000 was  primarily  the  result of a
decrease in net  acquisitions  of operating  lease assets which was offset by an
increase in proceeds from sales of wholesale and retail receivables.  These were
partially  offset by increases in net acquisitions of finance  receivables.  The
increase  in 2000  from  1999 was  primarily  the  result  of net  increases  in
acquisitions of finance  receivables,  along with an increase in other investing
activities,  which was  primarily  driven by an  increase  in  mortgage  lending
receivables. These increases were mainly offset by increased proceeds from sales
of wholesale receivables.

Cash  provided by  financing  activities  during  2001  totaled  $19.2  billion,
compared  with  $14.9   billion  and  $11.3   billion   during  2000  and  1999,
respectively.  The  increase  in 2001  from  2000 was  primarily  the  result of
increases in net proceeds  from debt  issuances.  The increase in 2000 from 1999
was  primarily  the  result  of an  increase  in  short-term  debt  and  capital
contributions  from GM,  mainly  offset by a net decrease in long-term  debt and
dividends paid to GM.

EURO CONVERSION

On January 1, 1999,  eleven of fifteen member countries of the European Monetary
Union established  fixed conversion rates between their existing  currencies and
adopted the euro as their new common  currency.  Additionally,  on December  31,
2000,  Greece also  established a fixed  conversion rate between the drachma and
the euro.  The euro  trades on  currency  exchanges  and the  legacy  currencies
remained  legal tender in the  participating  countries for a transition  period
that ended January 1, 2002. Beginning on January 1, 2002, euro denominated bills
and  coins  were  issued  and  legacy   currencies  are  being   withdrawn  from
circulation.

The  Company  established  and  implemented  plans to  assess  and  address  the
potential impact to GMAC that may result from the euro conversion. The Company's
euro  conversion  did  not  have a  material  adverse  impact  on its  financial
condition or results of operations.

Certain  aspects of the operations  impacted by the conversion have already been
converted to the euro.

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

In June 2001, the Financial  Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No.
141,  Business  Combinations,   which  requires  that  the  purchase  method  of
accounting be used for all business combinations  completed after June 30, 2001.
SFAS No. 141 specifies  that certain  acquired  intangible  assets in a business
combination be recognized as assets separately from goodwill.  Additionally,  it
requires the Company to evaluate its existing intangible assets and goodwill and
to make  any  necessary  reclassifications  in  order  to  conform  with the new
separation requirements at the date of adoption.  Goodwill and intangible assets
determined  to have  indefinite  useful  lives that were  acquired in a business
combination completed after June 30, 2001, were not amortized.

Goodwill  and  intangible  assets  acquired in business  combinations  completed
before July 1, 2001, were amortized until December 31, 2001. The Company adopted
the  provisions  of SFAS No. 141 on January 1, 2002,  with the  exception of the
requirement to use the purchase  method of accounting for business  combinations
completed  after June 30, 2001,  which was adopted on July 1, 2001. The adoption
of SFAS No.  141 did not  have a  material  impact  on the  Company's  financial
condition or results of operations.

In June 2001,  the FASB  issued  SFAS No.  142,  Goodwill  and Other  Intangible
Assets.  SFAS No. 142 requires  that goodwill no longer be amortized but instead
be tested for impairment at least  annually,  and that  intangible  assets other
than goodwill  should be amortized over their useful lives.  In connection  with
the  transitional  impairment  evaluation,  SFAS No. 142 requires the Company to
perform an  assessment  of  whether  there is an  indication  that  goodwill  is
impaired as of January 1, 2002.  SFAS No. 142  provides  for a six-month  period
from the date of adoption for the Company to complete its assessment of goodwill
impairment.  Management  estimates  that goodwill  amortization  required  under
previous accounting  standards of approximately $95.0 million after-tax will not
be charged to the income statement in 2002.

In August 2001,  the FASB issued SFAS No. 144,  Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal  of  Long-Lived  Assets.  This  statements  supercedes  SFAS  No.  121,
Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived  Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to
Be  Disposed  Of. The  statement  retains  the  previously  existing  accounting
requirements  related to the  recognition  and  measurement of the impairment of
long-lived   assets  to  be  held  and  used  while  expanding  the  measurement
requirements  of  long-lived  assets  to be  disposed  of  by  sale  to  include
discontinued  operations.  It also expands on the previously  existing reporting
requirements  for  discontinued  operations  to include a component of an entity
that either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale.  The Company
is required to implement  SFAS No. 144 on January 1, 2002.  Management  does not
expect  this  statement  to have a material  impact on the  Company's  financial
position or results of operations.

The FASB is currently deliberating the issuance of an interpretation of SFAS No.
94,  Consolidation of All  Majority-Owned  Subsidiaries,  to provide  additional
guidance to assist  companies in identifying  and accounting for special purpose
entities,  including  when SPEs  should be  consolidated  by the  investor.  The
interpretation would introduce a concept that consolidation would be required by
the primary beneficiary of the activities of a special purpose entity unless the
SPE can meet certain substantive  independent economic substance criteria. It is
not possible to determine at this time what  conclusions will be included in the
final interpretation;  however, the result could impact the accounting treatment
of these entities.

The FASB is currently  deliberating  the issuance of a proposed  statement  that
would amend SFAS No. 133, subject to decisions to be made at the March 13, 2002,
FASB meeting.  The proposed  statement will address and resolve  certain pending
Derivatives  Implementation Group ("DIG") issues. The outcome of the pending DIG
issues  and  other  provisions  of the  statement  could  impact  the  Company's
accounting for beneficial  interests,  loan  commitments and other  transactions
deemed to be derivatives under the new statement.  The Company's  accounting for
such transactions is currently based on management's best  interpretation of the
accounting literature as of March 11, 2002.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

The foregoing  Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial  Condition and
Results of Operations  contains various  forward-looking  statements  within the
meaning of applicable  federal securities laws and are based upon GMAC's current
expectations and assumptions  concerning  future events,  which are subject to a
number of risks and  uncertainties  that could  cause  actual  results to differ
materially from those anticipated.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

GMAC is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates,  foreign currency
exchange rates and certain equity security  prices.  In order to manage the risk
arising from these exposures, GMAC enters into a variety of foreign currency and
interest rate contracts and options.

A  discussion  of GMAC's  accounting  policies  for  derivative  instruments  is
included in Note 1 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and further
disclosure  is provided  in Notes 8, 13, 14 and 17 in the Notes to  Consolidated
Financial Statements.

GMAC maintains risk management control systems to monitor interest rate, foreign
currency  exchange  rate and equity  price  risks and related  hedge  positions.
Positions  are  monitored  using a variety of  analytical  techniques  including
market  value,  sensitivity  analysis and  value-at-risk  models.  The following
analyses  are based on  sensitivity  analysis  tests that assume  instantaneous,
parallel shifts in exchange rates, interest rate yield curves and equity prices.
For options and instruments with non-linear  returns,  models appropriate to the
instrument are utilized to determine the impact of sensitivity shifts.

Interest Rate Risk
------------------
GMAC is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest  rates based
on its financing,  investing and cash  management  activities.  GMAC enters into
various  financial  instrument  transactions  to maintain  the desired  level of
exposure  to the risk of interest  rate  fluctuations  and to minimize  interest
expense. More specifically,  GMAC and its affiliates have entered into contracts
to provide  automotive  financing,  to retain mortgage  servicing  rights and to
retain various assets related to mortgage  securitization.  Automotive financing
activities are primarily funded by debt obligations.  These debt obligations are
frequently  hedged to manage  exposure to  fluctuations  in interest  rate risk.
Certain  exchange traded future and option  contracts and interest rate caps and
floors,  along with various other investments,  have been entered into to manage
the  interest  rate risk  related to mortgage  activities  and manage  potential
prepayment activity associated with mortgage servicing rights.

GMACMG  manages  prepayment  risk  associated  with  its  capitalized   mortgage
servicing rights with interest rate caps and floors, futures, options on futures
contracts,  interest rate swaps,  swaptions and forwards.  Since the  derivative
instruments do not have  identical  characteristics  to the underlying  mortgage
servicing  rights,  GMAC is exposed to basis risk.  GMACMG  mitigates  this risk
through a historical  review of value changes in various interest rate scenarios
when establishing and maintaining its hedge program. GMACMG manages the interest
rate risk  associated  with its mortgage loans held for sale with U.S.  Treasury
derivatives,  commitments to sell mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities.
Additionally,  GMACMG uses U.S.  Treasury  derivatives  as well as interest rate
swap   agreements  to  manage  the  interest  rate  risk   associated  with  its
mortgage-related securities. To hedge the interest rate risk associated with its
mortgage  inventory   pipeline,   GMACMG  uses  U.S.  Treasury  and  LIBOR-based
derivatives.

The net fair value  liability  of all  financial  instruments  held for purposes
other than trading with  exposure to interest rate risk was  approximately  $8.3
billion and $14.7  billion at  December  31,  2001 and 2000,  respectively.  The
potential change in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10 percent increase
in interest  rates would have been a gain of  approximately  $228.1  million for
2001 and a loss of $655.1  million  for 2000.  The net fair  value  asset of all
financial  instruments  held for trading purposes with exposure to interest rate
risk was  approximately  $3.6  billion and $3.2 billion at December 31, 2001 and
2000,  respectively.   The  potential  loss  in  fair  value  resulting  from  a
hypothetical 10 percent decrease in interest rates would have been approximately
$181.8 million and $216.5 million for 2001 and 2000, respectively.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (continued)

Interest Rate Risk (concluded)
------------------------------
There are certain  shortcomings  inherent to the sensitivity analyses presented.
The model assumes  interest rate changes are  instantaneous,  parallel shifts in
the yield  curve.  In reality,  changes are rarely  instantaneous  or  parallel.
Although  certain assets and liabilities may have similar  maturities or periods
to repricing,  they may not react  correspondingly to changes in market interest
rates.  Also, the interest rates on certain types of assets and  liabilities may
fluctuate with changes in market interest  rates,  while interest rates on other
types of assets may lag behind changes in market rates.  Finance receivables are
less susceptible to prepayments when interest rates change, while prepayments on
many mortgage-related  instruments are directly affected by a change in interest
rates.  As such,  GMAC's model does not address  prepayment  risk for automotive
related   finance   receivables,   but  does   consider   prepayment   risk  for
mortgage-related instruments that are highly sensitive to prepayment risk.

However, in the event of a change in interest rates, actual loan prepayments may
deviate  significantly  from  assumptions  used in the model.  Further,  certain
assets,  such as  adjustable  rate  loans,  have  features,  such as annual  and
lifetime  caps,  that restrict  changing the interest rates both on a short-term
basis and over the life of the asset.  Finally, the ability of certain borrowers
to make scheduled  payments on their  adjustable  rate loans may decrease in the
event of an interest rate increase.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk
-----------------------------------
GMAC is exposed to foreign  currency  risk  arising  from the  possibility  that
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates will impact future earnings or assets and
liability  values  from  normal  operations  in foreign  countries  and  various
financial  instruments that are denominated in foreign  currencies.  GMAC's most
significant  foreign currency  exposures  relate to the Canadian  dollar,  euro,
United Kingdom pound sterling and Australian dollar. As of December 31, 2001 and
2000, the net fair value  liability of financial  instruments  held for purposes
other than trading with exposure to foreign currency risk was approximately $2.1
billion and $1.1 billion,  respectively.  The  potential  loss in fair value for
such financial  instruments  from a hypothetical  10 percent  increase in quoted
foreign currency exchange rates would have been approximately $210.3 million and
$114.5 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000,  respectively.  As of December 31,
2001 and 2000,  the net fair value asset of all financial  instruments  held for
trading purposes with exposure to currency risk was approximately  $98.7 million
and $79.9 million, respectively. The potential loss in fair value resulting from
a hypothetical  10 percent  increase in quoted foreign  currency  exchange rates
would have been  approximately  $9.9 million and $8.0 million for 2001 and 2000,
respectively.

The model  assumes an  instantaneous,  parallel  shift in the  foreign  currency
exchange rates. Exchange rates rarely move in the same direction. The assumption
that exchange rates change in an instantaneous or parallel fashion may overstate
the impact of changing exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in a
foreign currency.

Equity Price Risk
-----------------
GMAC holds  investments in various available for sale equity securities that are
subject to price risk. The fair value of such investments was approximately $1.3
billion  and $1.0  billion at  December  31,  2001 and 2000,  respectively.  The
potential  loss in the fair  value of these  investments,  assuming a 10 percent
decrease in  underlying  equity  prices,  would have been  approximately  $129.9
million and $103.5 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Overall Limitations and Forward-Looking Statements
--------------------------------------------------
Operating leases are not required to be included in the sensitivity analysis and
as a result,  have not been presented as part of this analysis.  This limitation
is significant to the analysis  presented.  While the sensitivity  analysis will
show a fair market value change for the debt which funds GMAC's  operating lease
portfolio,  a corresponding  change for GMAC's operating lease portfolio,  which
has a book value of $25.2  billion and $29.3  billion at  December  31, 2001 and
2000,  respectively,  was not considered by the model. As a result,  the overall
impact to the fair  market  value of  financial  instruments  from  hypothetical
changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates may be overstated.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (concluded)

Overall Limitations and Forward-Looking Statements (concluded)
--------------------------------------------------------------
The Company has developed the fair value  estimates by  utilization of available
market  information  or  other  appropriate  valuation  methodologies.  However,
considerable  judgment  is  required  in  interpreting  market  data to  develop
estimates of fair value, so the estimates are not necessarily  indicative of the
amounts  that could be realized or would be paid in a current  market  exchange.
The effect of using different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies
may be material to the estimated  fair market value  amounts.  In addition,  the
above  discussion  and the  estimated  amounts  generated  from the  sensitivity
analyses  referred to above  include  forward-looking  statements of market risk
which assume for analytical purposes that certain adverse market  considerations
may occur.  Actual  future market  conditions  may differ  materially  from such
assumptions because the amounts noted previously are the result of analyses used
for  the  purpose  of  assessing  possible  risks  and the  mitigation  thereof.
Accordingly, the forward-looking statements should not be considered projections
by GMAC of future events or losses.

ITEM 8.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

MANAGEMENT'S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The following  consolidated  financial  statements of General Motors  Acceptance
Corporation and subsidiaries  were prepared by management,  which is responsible
for their  integrity  and  objectivity.  The  statements  have been  prepared in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America and, as such, include amounts based on judgments of management.

Management is further  responsible for maintaining  internal control designed to
provide reasonable assurance that the books and records reflect the transactions
of the  companies and that  established  policies and  procedures  are carefully
followed.  Perhaps the most important  feature of internal control is that it is
continually  reviewed for effectiveness and is augmented by written policies and
guidelines,  the careful  selection  and training of qualified  personnel  and a
strong program of internal audit.

Deloitte & Touche LLP, an  independent  auditing  firm,  is engaged to audit the
consolidated  financial statements of General Motors Acceptance  Corporation and
subsidiaries and issue reports  thereon.  The audits are conducted in accordance
with auditing standards  generally accepted in the United States of America that
comprehend the  consideration  of internal  control and tests of transactions to
the extent necessary to form an independent opinion on the financial  statements
prepared by management.  The  Independent  Auditors'  Report appears on the next
page.

The Board of  Directors,  through  the Audit  Committee  (the  "Committee"),  is
responsible for ensuring that management  fulfills its  responsibilities  in the
preparation of the consolidated financial statements.  The Committee selects the
independent auditors annually.  In addition,  the Committee reviews the scope of
the audits and the accounting  principles being applied in financial  reporting.
The  independent  auditors,  representatives  of  management  and  the  internal
auditors meet  regularly  (separately  and jointly) with the Committee to review
the  activities  of each,  to  ensure  that  each is  properly  discharging  its
responsibilities,  and to assess the  effectiveness of internal  control.  It is
management's  conclusion  that internal  control at December 31, 2001,  provides
reasonable  assurance that the books and records reflect the transactions of the
companies and that  established  policies and  procedures  are complied with. To
reinforce complete independence,  Deloitte & Touche LLP has full and free access
to meet with the  Committee,  without  management  representatives  present,  to
discuss  the  results of the audits,  the  adequacy of internal  control and the
quality of the financial reporting.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

General Motors Acceptance Corporation:

We have audited the  accompanying  Consolidated  Balance Sheet of General Motors
Acceptance  Corporation  and  subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and
the related Consolidated  Statements of Income,  Changes in Stockholder's Equity
and Cash Flows for each of the three  years in the  period  ended  December  31,
2001.  These  financial  statements  are  the  responsibility  of the  Company's
management.  Our  responsibility  is to express  an  opinion on these  financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the  United  States of  America.  Those  standards  require  that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a
test basis,  evidence  supporting  the amounts and  disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant  estimates  made by  management,  as well as evaluating  the overall
financial  statement  presentation.   We  believe  that  our  audits  provide  a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,  such consolidated  financial  statements present fairly, in all
material  respects,  the  consolidated  financial  position  of  General  Motors
Acceptance  Corporation and  subsidiaries at December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the
consolidated  results of their  operations  and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2001, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

incorporated in 1997 under Delaware General Corporation Law. On January 1, 1998,
the Company merged with its  predecessor,  which was originally  incorporated in
New York in 1919.

The Company is a  financial  services  organization  that  principally  provides
consumer and dealer vehicle financing.  GMAC also provides commercial  financing
to the apparel, textile,  automotive supplier and numerous other industries. The
principal markets for the Company's  automotive  financial products and services
are North America, Europe, Latin America and Asia-Pacific. The principal markets
for the commercial  financing products are North America and Europe. The Company
conducts insurance operations primarily in the United States, Canada and Europe.
In addition,  the Company's mortgage banking subsidiaries operate principally in
North America, Latin America, Japan and Europe.

Principles of Consolidation
---------------------------
The consolidated  financial  statements  include the accounts of the Company and
its domestic and foreign subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and
transactions are eliminated in consolidation.

Segment Reporting
-----------------
GMAC's  reportable  operating  segments  include GMAC North  American  Financing
Operations  ("GMAC-NAO"),  GMAC International  Financing Operations ("GMAC-IO"),
Insurance  Operations  ("GMACI") and Mortgage  Operations  ("GMACMG").  GMAC-NAO
consists of automotive  financing in the United States and Canada as well as the
commercial  financing operations and GMAC-IO consists of automotive financing in
all other  countries and Puerto Rico.  GMAC-NAO and GMAC-IO offer a wide variety
of  automotive  financial  services to and  through  franchised  General  Motors
dealers in many  countries  throughout  the world.  Additionally,  GMAC-NAO  and
GMAC-IO offer  financial  services to other  automobile  dealerships  and to the
customers of those  dealerships.  GMAC-NAO also offers commercial  financing and
factoring services to companies in various industries.  The Company operates its
international  automotive financing services in a similar manner as in the U.S.,
subject  to local  laws or other  circumstances  that may cause it to modify its
procedures accordingly.

The  accounting  policies  of the  operating  segments  are the  same  as  those
described in this summary of significant  accounting policies,  and also include
those listed in Note 12 (Insurance  Operations) and Note 13 (Mortgage  Banking).
Revenues are attributed to geographic  areas based on the location of the assets
producing the revenues.

Cash Equivalents
----------------
Cash  equivalents  are defined as  short-term,  highly liquid  investments  with
original maturities of 90 days or less.

Investments in Securities
-------------------------
The  Company's  portfolio  of  securities  includes  bonds,  equity  securities,
mortgage-backed  securities,  notes,  interests in trusts and other investments.
Investments  in  securities  are  classified  as held to  maturity,  trading  or
available for sale.  Held to maturity  investments  are debt securities that the
Company  has  the  positive  intent  and  ability  to hold  to  maturity.  These
investments  are carried at  amortized  cost unless a decline in value is deemed
other than temporary,  in which case the carrying value is reduced.  The Company
determines cost on the specific identification basis.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

Investments in Securities (concluded)
-------------------------------------
Securities that are bought and held  principally for the purpose of selling them
in  the  near  term  are  classified  as  trading  securities.   Mortgage-backed
securities  held for sale in conjunction  with mortgage  banking  activities are
classified  as  trading   securities   and  are  carried  at  fair  value.   For
mortgage-related trading securities, unrealized gains and losses are included in
income. The fair value of the  mortgage-related  trading securities are based on
estimated market value.

Investments  in securities  not  categorized  as trading or held to maturity are
classified as available for sale  securities and are carried at fair value.  For
available for sale investments,  the aggregate excess of market value over cost,
net of  related  income  taxes,  is  included  within a  separate  component  of
stockholder's equity. The Company determines cost on the specific identification
basis.  The fair value of the  investments,  except for the interests in trusts,
are based on quoted market prices. The fair value of the interests in trusts are
based on estimated market value.

Revenue Recognition
-------------------
Financing  revenue  is  recorded  over the  terms of the  receivables  using the
interest method.  Certain loan  origination  costs are deferred and amortized to
financing  revenue over the life of the related loans using the interest method.
Recognition  of non-retail  finance  revenue is generally  suspended when a loan
becomes  contractually  delinquent  for 90 days.  Recognition  of retail finance
revenue is generally suspended when a loan becomes contractually  delinquent for
120  days.  Finance  revenue  recognition  is  resumed  when  the  loan  becomes
contractually current, at which time all past due finance revenue is recognized.

Income from operating lease assets is recognized on a  straight-line  basis over
the scheduled lease term. Certain operating lease origination costs are deferred
and amortized to financing revenue over the life of the related operating leases
using the straight-line method.

Investments in Operating Leases, Net
------------------------------------
The Company has  significant  investments in the residual  values of its leasing
portfolios.  The  residual  values  represent  an  estimate of the values of the
assets at the end of the lease  contracts  and are initially  recorded  based on
appraisals and estimates. Realization of the residual values is dependent on the
Company's  future  ability to market the vehicles under then  prevailing  market
conditions.  Management  reviews residual values  periodically to determine that
recorded  amounts are  appropriate  and the operating lease assets have not been
impaired.

Allowance for Credit Losses
---------------------------
An allowance  for credit  losses is generally  established  during the period in
which  receivables are acquired and is maintained at a level deemed  appropriate
by management based on historical and other factors that affect  collectibility.
Such  factors  include  the  historical  trends  of  repossession,  charge-offs,
recoveries  and credit  losses;  the  careful  monitoring  of  portfolio  credit
quality,  including  the  impact of  acquisitions;  and  current  and  projected
economic  and  market  conditions.  The  evaluation  of these  factors  involves
complex,  subjective  judgments.  Losses  arising  from the sale of  repossessed
collateral  are charged to the allowance for credit losses.  Where  repossession
has not taken  place,  receivables  are charged off as soon as it is  determined
that the  collateral  cannot be  repossessed,  generally  not more than 150 days
after default.

NOTE 1.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

Repossessed Property and Impaired Loans
---------------------------------------
Losses arising from the repossession of collateral  supporting impaired accounts
and  property   supporting   defaulted  operating  leases  are  recognized  upon
repossession. Repossessed assets are recorded at the lower of historical cost or
fair value and are reclassified from finance  receivables or operating leases to
other assets with the related adjustments to the valuation allowance included in
other operating expenses.

Non-retail  finance  receivables  are reduced to the lower of historical cost or
the estimated fair value of collateral when determined to be impaired. A loan is
considered  impaired  when it is  determined  that the Company will be unable to
collect all amounts due according to the original  terms of the loan  agreement.
The Company's  policy is to recognize  interest income related to impaired loans
on a cash basis.

Sales of Auto and Mortgage Receivables
--------------------------------------
The Company sells retail and wholesale  receivables through consolidated special
purpose  subsidiaries which absorb all losses related to sold receivables to the
extent of their subordinated  investments and certain segregated restricted cash
reserves.  Appropriate  limited  recourse loss  allowances  associated with sold
receivables  are  transferred  from the  allowance  for  credit  losses  and are
included  in  other   liabilities.   The  Company  continues  to  service  these
receivables  for a fee,  which is  considered to be adequate  compensation,  and
earns other related  ongoing  income which is recorded in other  income.  Normal
servicing fees on sold  receivables are recognized over the estimated  remaining
life of the sold receivables.

On April 1, 2001, the Company adopted the accounting  provisions of Statement of
Financial  Accounting  Standards ("SFAS") No. 140,  Accounting for Transfers and
Servicing of Financial  Assets and  Extinguishments  of Liabilities,  related to
transfers and servicing of financial assets and  extinguishments  of liabilities
occurring after March 31, 2001. The effect of adopting the accounting provisions
of this new statement was not material to the  Company's  financial  statements.
Consistent with the provisions of the statement, prior year financial statements
have not been restated.

Pre-tax gains on sold  receivables are recorded in other income.  In determining
the gain or loss for each qualifying sale of retail receivables,  the investment
in the sold  receivable  pool is  allocated  between  the  portion  sold and the
portion  retained  based on their  relative fair values on the date of sale. The
receivables  sold are removed  from  finance  receivables  and the  subordinated
securities retained by the Company are included in investments in securities and
are classified as available for sale.

Interest-only strip receivables resulting from receivables sales are recorded at
estimated  fair  value.  The  difference  between  market  value  and  cost  for
interest-only strip receivables is recorded within comprehensive  income, net of
related income taxes.

GMACMG  generally  sells  mortgage  loans  through  sponsored   mortgage  backed
securities   programs  of  investors  such  as  the  Federal  National  Mortgage
Association  (Fannie Mae), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage  Corporation  (Freddie
Mac) or the Government  National Mortgage  Association  (Ginnie Mae), or through
whole loan transactions to third parties or through securitization vehicles such
as special purpose entities,  with servicing  retained.  Gains or losses on such
sales are  generally  recognized  at the time of sale based upon the  difference
between the sales proceeds and the allocated  basis of loans sold,  adjusted for
net deferred  origination fees and costs,  mortgage  servicing rights,  retained
interests, hedge activities and the cost of issuing securities. Refer to Note 13
(Mortgage Banking) for additional mortgage securitization accounting policies.

Depreciation
------------
The Company and its subsidiaries  provide for depreciation of vehicles and other
equipment on  operating  leases or in company use  generally on a  straight-line
basis over a period of time consistent with the term of the underlying operating
lease  agreement or the  estimated  useful life for property in company use. The
provision for  depreciation is adjusted for the difference  between the net book
value and the proceeds of sale or salvage on disposal of the assets. The Company
evaluates its depreciation policy for leased vehicles on a regular basis.

NOTE 1.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

Mortgages Held for Sale
-----------------------
Mortgage  loans held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair
value as determined on an aggregate basis.  Fair value is based on contractually
established   commitments   from   investors  or  by  current   investor   yield
requirements.  GMACMG accrues  interest on residential  and commercial  mortgage
loans held for sale not more than 90 and 60 days delinquent,  respectively.  The
Company  separately  evaluates the estimated  fair value of its  commitments  to
lend,  including  consideration  of  all  designated  open  delivery  commitment
positions.  Commitments to lend are included in Other Assets and carried at fair
value with unrealized gains or losses recorded in the Consolidated  Statement of
Income.

Mortgages Held for Investment
-----------------------------
Mortgage  loans held for  investment  include  certain  loans  that the  Company
originates  and  purchases  with the intent to hold for  investment,  as well as
loans  held as  collateral  for  securitization  transactions  accounted  for as
collateralized borrowing arrangements.

Periodically,  the Company  acquires or originates  certain  mortgage  loans for
investment  purposes including  commercial and multi-family  construction loans.
The Company  carries  these loans at  amortized  cost net of deferred  costs and
fees. In addition,  the Company  originates or repurchases loans that are unable
to be sold through normal investor channels.  These loans are classified as held
for investment and carried at amortized cost, which represents  either the lower
of cost or  market at the time the loans  are  transferred,  or the  repurchases
price.  The  Company  has the  intent and  ability  to hold these  loans for the
foreseeable  future.  The Company  accrues  interest on mortgage  loans held for
investment not more than 60 days delinquent.

Mortgages Lending Receivables
-----------------------------
Mortgage  lending  receivables  are  primarily  comprised  of  receivables  from
warehouse,   construction,   commercial  real  estate  lending   activities  and
distressed unsecured consumer  receivables.  All lending receivables are carried
at amortized  cost,  less an allowance for credit  losses.  Amortized cost basis
includes deferred origination fees and costs.

Warehouse  lending involves the extension of  collateralized  lines of credit to
mortgage  originators to finance loans until a permanent  investor purchases the
loans.  Advances under the lines of credit are generally fully collateralized by
the  underlying  mortgages  and bear  interest  at  variable  rates  based  upon
short-term indices.  Warehouse lending also involves certain longer term lending
to mortgage companies primarily  collateralized by pledged servicing  portfolios
and interest-only and residual securities.  Term loans are generally for periods
of less than five years and bear  interest at variable  rates tied to short-term
indices.  Construction lending involves the extension of collateralized lines of
credit to  construction  lending  project  managers  and  national  and regional
residential home builders.

Warehouse and construction  lending receivables are placed on non-accrual status
when scheduled principal or interest payments are greater than 60 days past due.
When a loan is placed on  non-accrual  status,  the accrued and unpaid  interest
receivable is reversed and  accounted  for on the cash or cost recovery  method.
Generally, a loan is returned to accrual status when all delinquent interest and
principal becomes current in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement.

The Company  services and manages  mortgage loans and warehouse and construction
lending receivables for third parties under commercial paper programs.  Revenues
from these activities are recognized on an accrual basis.

Mortgage Servicing Rights
-------------------------
The Company  capitalizes  mortgage  servicing rights  associated with loans sold
with  servicing  retained and servicing  rights  acquired  through bulk and flow
purchase  transactions.  The Company capitalizes the cost of originated mortgage
servicing  rights  based upon the relative  fair market value of the  underlying
mortgage  loans  and  mortgage  servicing  rights  at the  time  of  sale of the
underlying mortgage loan. The Company  capitalizes  purchased mortgage servicing
rights at cost, an amount not exceeding the estimated fair market value of those
purchased mortgage servicing rights. See Note 13 (Mortgage Banking).

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

Intangible Assets
-----------------
Intangible  assets,  principally  the  excess  of cost  over the  fair  value of
identifiable  net  assets of  purchased  businesses,  were  amortized  using the
straight-line  method over periods  ranging from 5 to 40 years through  December
31, 2001.  However,  amounts  related to  acquisitions  completed after June 30,
2001, were not amortized in accordance with SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations.
Goodwill in excess of associated  expected operating cash flows is considered to
be impaired and is written down to fair value.  The  existence of  impairment is
evaluated based on undiscounted future cash flows.

Software Costs
--------------
Other assets include certain software costs capitalized in accordance with AICPA
Statement  of  Position  ("SOP")  98-1,  Accounting  for the  Costs of  Computer
Software  Developed or Obtained for Internal  Use. The  capitalized  software is
generally  amortized on a straight-line  basis over its useful life for a period
not to exceed three years.  Capitalized software that is not expected to provide
substantive  service potential or for which the costs of developing the software
significantly  exceed the amount originally  expected is considered impaired and
is written down to fair value.

Foreign Currency Translation
----------------------------
All assets and  liabilities of foreign  subsidiaries  are  translated  into U.S.
dollars at year-end  exchange rates.  Income and expense items are translated at
average  exchange rates  prevailing  during the year. The resulting  translation
adjustments are recorded as a component of stockholder's equity.

Income Taxes
------------
The Company and its domestic  subsidiaries  join with General Motors in filing a
consolidated  United  States  federal  income  tax  return.  The  portion of the
consolidated  tax recorded by the Company and its  subsidiaries  included in the
consolidated tax return generally is equivalent to the liability that would have
been  incurred on a separate  return  basis and are settled as GM's tax payments
are due.

Derivative Financial Instruments
--------------------------------
The Company is a party to derivative  financial  instruments that it uses in the
normal course of business to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in interest and
foreign currency rates.  Effective  January 1, 2001, GMAC adopted the provisions
of SFAS No. 133,  Accounting for Derivative  Instruments and Hedging Activities,
as amended by SFAS No. 138. Under these standards,  GMAC records  derivatives on
the balance  sheet as assets or  liabilities,  measured at fair value.  Gains or
losses  resulting from changes in the values of those  derivatives are accounted
for  depending on the use of the  derivative  and whether it qualifies for hedge
accounting.  The after-tax  cumulative  effect of this  accounting  change as of
January  1,  2001,  was $34.3  million  favorable  to income  and $52.6  million
unfavorable to equity.  Consistent  with the provisions of the statement,  prior
year financial  statements have not been restated.  The amount of the transition
adjustment  reclassified  into earnings from other  comprehensive  income during
2001 was immaterial.

Prior  to  the  change  referred  to in the  preceding  paragraph,  the  Company
accounted for derivatives as follows:

Interest Rate Instruments
-------------------------
The company utilizes  various  contracts to manage interest rate risk including:
interest  rate swaps that are  contractual  agreements  between  the Company and
another  party to  exchange  the net  difference  between a fixed  and  floating
interest rate, or different floating interest rates,  periodically over the life
of the contract  without the exchange of the underlying  principal  amount.  The
Company also uses written and purchased  options  (including  interest rate caps
and  cancellation  features).  Interest rate cap  agreements  provide the holder
protection  against  interest rate movements  above the rate  established in the
contract.  In exchange for assuming this risk, the writer  receives a premium at
the outset of the agreement.

                      GENERAL MOTORS ACCEPTANCE CORPORATION
                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

Interest Rate Instruments (concluded)
The Company uses swaps to alter its fixed and floating  interest rate exposures.
As such, the majority of swaps are executed as an integral element of a specific
financing transaction.  In a limited number of cases, swaps, matched to specific
portfolios  of  wholesale  assets or debt,  are  executed  to  achieve  specific
interest rate  management  objectives.  Any amounts due or payable,  and amounts
paid or received, are offset against the related interest income or expense. The
Company accounts for interest rate swap agreements  using settlement  accounting
as they alter the  characteristics  of assets or  liabilities  to which they are
matched.  The  cash  flows  from  interest  rate  swaps  are  accounted  for  as
adjustments to interest income or expense depending on the underlying  exposure.
Gains and losses from  terminated  swaps are  deferred  and  amortized  over the
remaining  period of the original swap or the remaining  term of the  underlying
exposure,  whichever  is shorter,  as either a reduction or increase of interest
expense.  Open swap positions are reviewed  regularly to ensure that they remain
effective in managing interest rate risk.

Written options  (including  related premiums) and interest rate basis swaps are
marked-to-market on a current basis with the related gains or losses included in
other income.

Foreign Currency Instruments
Currency  swaps and  forwards  are used to hedge  foreign  exchange  exposure on
foreign  currency  denominated  debt by converting  the funding  currency to the
currency of the assets being financed.  Foreign  currency swaps and forwards are
legal agreements between two parties to purchase and sell a foreign currency for
a price specified at the contract date, with delivery and settlement at both the
effective  date  and  maturity  date  of the  contract.  Foreign  currency  swap
agreements  are  accounted  for using  settlement  accounting  as it  relates to
periodic  interest  payments.  The foreign currency gains and losses  associated
with both the  currency  swaps  and  forwards  offset  the  correlating  foreign
currency gains and losses related to the designated liabilities.

Use of Estimates
----------------
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally  accepted in the United States of America requires  management to make
estimates and  assumptions  that affect  amounts  reported  therein.  Due to the
inherent  uncertainty  involved in making estimates,  actual results reported in
future periods may be based upon amounts which differ from those estimates.

Reclassifications
-----------------
Certain  amounts for 1999 and 2000 have been  reclassified  to conform with 2001
classifications.

Accounting Standards
--------------------
In June 2001, the Financial  Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No.
141,  Business  Combinations,   which  requires  that  the  purchase  method  of
accounting be used for all business combinations  completed after June 30, 2001.
SFAS No. 141 specifies  that certain  acquired  intangible  assets in a business
combination be recognized as assets separately from goodwill.  Additionally,  it
requires the Company to evaluate its existing intangible assets and goodwill and
to make  any  necessary  reclassifications  in  order  to  conform  with the new
separation requirements at the date of adoption.  Goodwill and intangible assets
determined  to have  indefinite  useful  lives that were  acquired in a business
combination completed after June 30, 2001, were not amortized.

Goodwill  and  intangible  assets  acquired in business  combinations  completed
before July 1, 2001 were amortized  until December 31, 2001. The Company adopted
the  provisions  of SFAS No. 141 on January 1, 2002,  with the  exception of the
requirement to use the purchase  method of accounting for business  combinations
completed  after June 30, 2001,  which was adopted on July 1, 2001. The adoption
of SFAS No.  141 did not  have a  material  impact  on the  Company's  financial
condition or results of operations.

NOTE 1.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (concluded)

Accounting Standards (concluded)
--------------------------------
In June 2001,  the FASB  issued  SFAS No.  142,  Goodwill  and Other  Intangible
Assets.  SFAS No. 142 requires  that goodwill no longer be amortized but instead
be tested for impairment at least  annually,  and that  intangible  assets other
than goodwill  should be amortized over their useful lives.  In connection  with
the  transitional  impairment  evaluation,  SFAS No. 142 requires the Company to
perform an  assessment  of  whether  there is an  indication  that  goodwill  is
impaired as of January 1, 2002. SFAS No.142 provides for a six-month period from
the date of  adoption  for the Company to complete  its  assessment  of goodwill
impairment.  Management  estimates  that goodwill  amortization  required  under
previous accounting  standards of approximately $95.0 million after-tax will not
be charged to the income statement in 2002.

In August 2001,  the FASB issued SFAS No. 144,  Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal  of  Long-Lived  Assets.  This  statements  supercedes  SFAS  No.  121,
Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived  Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to
Be  Disposed  Of. The  statement  retains  the  previously  existing  accounting
requirements  related to the  recognition  and  measurement of the impairment of
long-lived   assets  to  be  held  and  used  while  expanding  the  measurement
requirements  of  long-lived  assets  to be  disposed  of  by  sale  to  include
discontinued  operations.  It also expands on the previously  existing reporting
requirements  for  discontinued  operations  to include a component of an entity
that either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale.  The Company
is required to implement  SFAS No. 144 on January 1, 2002.  Management  does not
expect  this  statement  to have a material  impact on the  Company's  financial
position or results of operations.

The FASB is currently deliberating the issuance of an interpretation of SFAS No.
94,  Consolidation of All  Majority-Owned  Subsidiaries,  to provide  additional
guidance to assist  companies in identifying  and accounting for special purpose
entities,  including  when SPEs  should be  consolidated  by the  investor.  The
interpretation would introduce a concept that consolidation would be required by
the primary beneficiary of the activities of a special purpose entity unless the
SPE can meet certain substantive  independent economic substance criteria. It is
not possible to determine at this time what  conclusions will be included in the
final interpretation;  however, the result could impact the accounting treatment
of these entities.

The FASB is currently  deliberating  the issuance of a proposed  statement  that
would amend SFAS No. 133, subject to decisions to be made at the March 13, 2002,
FASB meeting.  The proposed  statement will address and resolve  certain pending
Derivatives  Implementation Group ("DIG") issues. The outcome of the pending DIG
issues  and  other  provisions  of the  statement  could  impact  the  Company's
accounting for beneficial  interests,  loan  commitments and other  transactions
deemed to be derivatives under the new statement.  The Company's  accounting for
such transactions is currently based on management's best  interpretation of the
accounting literature as of March 11, 2002.

The total  investments  in these  impaired  loans were $354.8 million and $202.2
million at  December  31,  2001 and 2000,  respectively.  The  average  recorded
investments  during  2001 and 2000  were  $291.8  million  and  $179.9  million,
respectively.

NOTE 3.  SALE OF FINANCE RECEIVABLES

The Company  participates in various sales of receivables  programs and has sold
retail finance receivables  through special purpose  subsidiaries with principal
aggregating $8.4 billion in 2001, $5.2 billion in 2000 and $5.1 billion in 1999.
These subsidiaries generally retain a subordinated investment of no greater than
5.25 percent of the total receivables pool and sell the remaining  portion.  Net
pre-tax gains relating to such sales  amounted to $210.4 million in 2001,  $13.7
million in 2000 and $64.2  million in 1999.  The Company's  sold retail  finance
receivables  servicing  portfolio  amounted to $12.0 billion and $7.0 billion at
December 31, 2001 and 2000,  respectively.  The Company's  total serviced retail
finance receivables, including sold receivables, totaled $83.8 billion and $58.3
billion at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

At December 31, 2001 and 2000, the principal  amount of sold retail  receivables
60 days or more past due was $40.4 million and $31.2 million, respectively.

During  the years 2001 and 2000,  the total  losses on sold  retail  receivables
amounted to $39.3 million and $34.2 million, respectively.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 3.  SALE OF FINANCE RECEIVABLES (continued)

The Company has sold  wholesale  receivables on a revolving  basis  resulting in
decreases  in  wholesale  outstandings  of $16.2  billion  and $10.0  billion at
December  31,  2001 and 2000,  respectively.  The Company is  committed  to sell
eligible wholesale  receivables  arising in certain dealer accounts.  During the
years  2001,  2000 and  1999,  there  were no  gains  recorded  on the  sales of
wholesale  receivables.  In  addition,  the fair value of retained  interests in
wholesale  securitizations  is assumed to approximate cost due to the short term
nature  of  wholesale   receivables.   The  Company's  total  wholesale  finance
receivables serviced, including sold receivables,  amounted to $32.2 billion and
$37.5 billion at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

When the Company sells  receivables in  securitizations  of retail and wholesale
receivables,  it retains  interest-only  strips,  all or a portion of senior and
subordinated tranches,  servicing rights and cash reserve accounts, all of which
are retained interests in the securitized  receivables.  Gain or loss on sale of
the receivables depends in part on the previous carrying amount of the financial
assets involved in the transfer.  The carrying  amount is allocated  between the
assets sold and the retained  interests,  based on their relative fair values on
the date of sale.

The Company generally  estimates fair value based on the present value of future
expected cash flows. The key assumptions used in present value  calculations are
prepayment  speeds and current market  interest  rates.  These  assumptions  use
management's best estimates  commensurate with the risks involved. Any excess of
the carrying  amount of the retained  interest over its fair value results in an
adjustment to the asset with a corresponding offset to shareholders'  equity. If
management  determines  that the difference  between the carrying value and fair
value of the  retained  interest  is  unrecoverable,  the asset is written  down
through earnings.

In  the   aforementioned   securitizations,   the  Company   retains   servicing
responsibilities  and  subordinated  interests.   The  Company  receives  annual
servicing  fees  approximating  2.0  percent  (for retail  receivables)  and 1.0
percent (for wholesale  receivables) of the outstanding  balance.  Additionally,
the Company receives the rights to future cash flows arising after the investors
in the securitization trust have received their contracted return. The investors
and the securitization trusts have no recourse to the Company's other assets for
failure  of  debtors  to pay when due.  The  Company's  retained  interests  are
subordinate  to  investor's  interests.  Their  value is  subject  to credit and
prepayment risks on the transferred assets.

The Company's  interest-only strip receivables,  cash deposits and other related
amounts  are  generally  restricted  assets  and  subject  to  limited  recourse
provisions.  The following is a summary of amounts  included in due and deferred
from receivable sales, net.

(1) An adverse  change in the fair value of retained  interests  may result from
either  an  increase  or  decrease  in  prepayment  speeds,  depending  upon the
characteristics of each  securitization and the related residual cash flows. Due
to the  composition  of GMAC's  sold  retail  finance  receivables,  this amount
represents the net adverse impact of a decrease in prepayment speeds.

NOTE 3.  SALE OF FINANCE RECEIVABLES (concluded)

Considerable  judgment  is  required  in  interpreting  market  data to  develop
estimates of fair value, so the above  estimates are not necessarily  indicative
of the  amounts  that  could be  realized  or would be paid in a current  market
exchange.   In  addition,   the  above  estimated  amounts  generated  from  the
sensitivity  analyses include  forward-looking  statements of market risk, which
assume for analytical  purposes that certain adverse market  considerations  may
occur.  Actual future market  conditions may differ  materially and accordingly,
the forward-looking  statements should not be considered  projections by GMAC of
future events or losses.

The Company has sponsored two special purpose entities ("SPEs") that are used as
sources of  additional  liquidity,  New Center Asset Trust  ("NCAT") and Central
Originating  Lease Trust ("COLT").  The Company acts as administrator of NCAT to
provide  for the  administration  of the trust and earned  $6.4  million,  $14.2
million and $14.5 million in  administration  fees for the years 2001,  2000 and
1999,  respectively.  The Company also acts as an originating agent and servicer
for COLT leases and earned $200.9  million,  $204.9  million and $144.9  million
during  2001,  2000 and 1999,  respectively.  The  Company  may enter  into swap
agreements  with NCAT and COLT for which the accounting is described in Note 17.
The Company has entered into an agreement with a third-party insurer whereby the
Company  receives a fee for reimbursing the insurer for a portion of losses paid
to COLT,  subject to a cap. The Company's reserve for such exposure was recorded
as a liability  on the balance  sheet at  December  31, 2001 and 2000,  totaling
$478.8 million and $349.5 million, respectively.

(1)  Effective  January 1, 2001,  the  Company  was  required to record the fair
market value of its  derivatives on the balance sheet due to the  implementation
of SFAS No. 133.  Such  instruments  were either  included as a component of the
underlying  hedged asset or liability or were not reflected on the balance sheet
at December 31, 2000. Refer to Note 17 for additional information.

NOTE 7.  LINES OF CREDIT WITH BANKS

The Company and its subsidiaries maintain substantial bank lines of credit which
totaled  $48.8  billion at  December  31,  2001,  compared  to $48.1  billion at
year-end  2000.  The unused  portion of these credit  lines  increased by $500.0
million from December 31, 2000, to $38.9 billion at December 31, 2001.  Included
in the unused credit lines at December 31, 2001,  is a $14.7 billion  syndicated
multi-currency  global credit facility available for use in the U.S. by GMAC and
in Europe by GMAC International Finance B.V. and GMAC (UK) plc. The entire $14.7
billion is available to GMAC in the U.S., $1.0 billion is available to GMAC (UK)
plc and $0.9  billion  is  available  to GMAC  International  Finance  B.V.  The
syndicated  credit  facility  serves  primarily  as  back-up  for the  Company's
unsecured commercial paper programs. Also included in the unused credit lines is
a $12.3 billion U.S.  asset-backed  commercial  paper  liquidity and receivables
facility for NCAT, a non-consolidated limited purpose business trust established
to issue asset-backed commercial paper.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 7.  LINES OF CREDIT WITH BANKS (concluded)

In June 2001, GMAC renewed the syndicated  multi-currency global facility, which
includes  terms of five years on one-half of the facility (due to expire in June
2006) and a 364-day  term with a one year  term-out  option.  It was modified to
permit the  Company,  at its  discretion,  to  transfer up to  approximately  $6
billion of the banks' commitments to the liquidity and receivables  facility for
NCAT. Such transfer provisions have not been utilized.  Additionally, there is a
leverage   covenant   restricting  the  ratio  of  consolidated  debt  to  total
stockholder's  equity to no greater than 11.0:1 under certain  conditions.  This
covenant is only  applicable on the last day of any fiscal  quarter  (other than
the fiscal  quarter during which a change in rating occurs) during such times as
the Company has senior unsecured long-term debt outstanding, without third-party
enhancement,  which is rated BBB+ or less by Standard & Poor's Ratings  Services
("S&P") or Baa1 or less by Moody's  Investors  Service,  Inc. As a result of the
Company's  rating  downgrade by S&P in October  2001,  those  conditions  became
effective and the Company is in compliance with the covenant.  Those  conditions
were not in effect on December 31, 2000.

GMAC  Mortgage  Group had $5.4  billion of bank lines of credit at December  31,
2001, compared with $4.6 billion at December 31, 2000, which are utilized in the
normal  course of business.  Of these lines,  $2.3 billion and $1.3 billion were
unused at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Inclusive of the $1.9 billion of the  syndicated  multi-currency  global  credit
facility,  operations in Canada,  Europe,  Latin America and  Asia-Pacific  were
supported by credit  facilities  totaling $18.4 billion at December 31, 2001 and
$18.1  billion at December 31, 2000,  of which $11.5  billion and $11.7  billion
were unused at  December  31, 2001 and 2000,  respectively.  As of December  31,
2001, the committed and uncommitted  portion of such credit  facilities  totaled
$5.7 billion and $12.7  billion,  respectively.  As of December  31,  2000,  the
committed and uncommitted portion of such credit facilities totaled $5.6 billion
and $12.5 billion, respectively.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 8.  DEBT (concluded)

(1)  The 2001 weighted  average  interest  rates include the effects of interest
     rate swap agreements.

(2)  The  weighted  average  maturities  of  commercial  paper  were  40 days at
     December 31, 2001, and 35 days at December 31, 2000.

(3)  Bank loans and overdrafts  include $4,273.9 million and $2,778.2 million in
     the United  States  and  $3,788.8  million  and  $3,835.1  million in other
     countries at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

(4)  The 2000 weighted average interest rate for short-term debt was 6.1%.

(5)  Effective  January 1, 2001,  the Company was required to record hedged debt
     at fair value on the balance  sheet due to the  implementation  of SFAS No.
     133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. Refer to
     Note 17 for additional information.

After consideration of foreign currency swaps, the above maturities  denominated
in  currencies  other than the U.S.  dollar  primarily  consist of the  Canadian
dollar  ($9,997.3  million),  euro  ($5,653.3  million),  United  Kingdom  pound
sterling  ($4,602.3  million) and  Australian  dollar  ($1,226.8  million).  The
Company and its subsidiaries  have entered into foreign currency swap agreements
to hedge  exposures  related to debt payable in currencies  other than the local
currency of the issuing entity.

Debt issues totaling $9,389.5 million are redeemable,  at par or slightly above,
at the Company's option.  The debt issues are redeemable  anytime prior to their
maturity dates with the latest maturity date in November 2049.

The Company has issued  warrants to subscribe  for up to $300 million  aggregate
principal  amount of 6.5% notes due October 15, 2009.  The warrants  entitle the
holder to  purchase  from GMAC the  aggregate  principal  amount at par plus any
accrued  interest.  The warrants are exercisable up to and including October 15,
2007.

The  Company's  debt  includes  $525  million in notes with fixed  rates and $75
million in notes with variable rates which provide  investors with the option to
cause  GMAC to  repurchase  them at  specific  dates  prior to  their  maturity.
Generally, the probability of exercising such option would increase in the event
that one or more of the Company's  security ratings is reduced or an increase in
market  interest rates occurs and the notes are subject to fixed interest rates.
For  purposes of the above  maturities,  it is assumed that no  repurchase  will
occur.

In addition,  the Company's debt includes  $12,975.6 million in notes with fixed
rates that contain a survivor's  option,  which  provides the survivor  with the
option to cause GMAC to  repurchase  them at par prior to  maturity.  The latest
maturity date of these notes is September 2021.

As of  December  31,  2001,  GMACMG  had  $2,096.8  million of  short-term  debt
outstanding  secured by real estate  mortgages  held for  investment of $1,249.8
million  and  real  estate  mortgages  held for sale of  $979.8  million.  These
mortgage  assets are  restricted  in that they are used to pay back the  secured
debt.

To achieve its desired balance between fixed and variable rate debt, the Company
has entered  into  interest  rate swap and  interest  rate cap  agreements.  The
breakdown  between  the fixed and  variable  interest  rate  amounts  (excluding
discount) based on contractual  terms  (predominately  based on London Interbank
Offering Rate ("LIBOR")) and after the effect of interest rate derivatives is as
follows:

NOTE 10.  PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries participate in various pension plans
of  General  Motors and its  domestic  and  foreign  subsidiaries,  which  cover
substantially  all of their  employees.  Benefits  under the plans are generally
related  to an  employee's  length of  service,  salary  and  where  applicable,
contributions. GMAC Mortgage Group, Inc., GMAC Commercial Credit LLC and certain
subsidiaries of GMAC Insurance  Holdings,  Inc. have separate  retirement  plans
which provide for pension payments to their eligible employees upon retirement.

The   Company   and  certain  of  its   subsidiaries   participate   in  various
postretirement  medical,  dental,  vision  and life  insurance  plans of General
Motors.  These  benefits are funded as incurred  from the general  assets of the
Company.  The  Company  accrues  postretirement  benefit  costs  over the active
service period of employees to the date of full  eligibility  for such benefits.
The Company has provided for certain amounts  associated  with estimated  future
postretirement  benefits other than pensions and  characterized  such amounts as
other postretirement benefits. Notwithstanding the recording of such amounts and
the use of these terms, the Company does not admit or otherwise acknowledge that
such amounts or existing postretirement benefit plans of the Company (other than
pensions) represent legally enforceable liabilities of the Company.

The total  pension  and other  postretirement  benefits  expense of the  Company
amounted to $96.1  million,  $80.4 million and $96.5  million in 2001,  2000 and
1999, respectively.

NOTE 12.  INSURANCE OPERATIONS

GMAC  Insurance  Holdings,  Inc.  and its  subsidiaries  (collectively  "GMACI")
perform a wide array of insurance  underwriting  including personal,  mechanical
and commercial  coverages.  GMACI conducts insurance and reinsurance  operations
primarily  in the United  States,  Canada and  Europe.  GMACI  insures  selected
personal,  commercial and extended service  contract  coverages for individuals,
auto  dealerships,  GMAC and GM. In the U.S.,  property and  casualty  risks are
assumed from other insurers. Outside the U.S., property, casualty and mechanical
risks are assumed from local insurance  companies.  GMACI cedes a portion of its
insurance  business  and  retrocedes  a portion of its  reinsurance  business to
outside  reinsurers  to  protect  the  Company  against  certain  types  of loss
activity.  GMACI  remains  liable with respect to any  reinsurance  ceded if the
assuming companies were unable to meet their obligations under these reinsurance
agreements. Premiums are earned on a basis related to coverage provided over the
terms of the policies or reinsurance  assumed  contracts.  Commissions,  premium
taxes and other costs that vary with, and are directly  related to acquiring new
business,  are deferred and amortized over the terms of the related  policies on
the same  basis as  premiums  are  earned or over the  average  life of  related
policies,  including  renewals.  The  liability  for  losses  and loss  expenses
includes  amounts   relating  to  reinsurance   agreements  and  represents  the
accumulation  of  estimates  for  reported  losses  and a  provision  for losses
incurred but not reported. Estimates for salvage and subrogation recoverable are
recognized  at  the  time  losses  are  incurred.   Insurance   liabilities  are
necessarily  based on estimates  and the ultimate  liability  may vary from such
estimates.  The estimates are regularly reviewed and adjustments are included in
income.

Unpaid Insurance Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses
Activity in the  reserves  for losses and loss  adjustment  expenses  ("LAE") is

The decreases in incurred losses and loss adjustment  expenses  related to prior
years is  primarily  attributable  to changes in estimates  for loss  adjustment
expenses for personal lines business, partially offset by development in assumed
reinsurance in 2001 and certain discontinued operations in 2000 and 1999.

GMACI is subject to certain minimum aggregated capital requirements,  restricted
net  assets  and  restricted  dividend   distributions  under  applicable  state
insurance  law,  the  National  Association  of  Securities  Dealers,   Barbados
Insurance law, the Financial Services Authority in England and the Office of the
Superintendent  of Financial  Institution of Canada.  To date,  compliance  with
these  various  regulations  has  not had a  materially  adverse  effect  on the
Company's financial position or results of operations.

Under the various state insurance  regulations,  dividend  distributions  may be
made  only  from  statutory   unassigned  surplus,   and  the  state  regulatory
authorities  must approve such  distributions  if they exceed certain  statutory
limitations.  Based on the December 31, 2001, statutory  policyholders' surplus,
the maximum dividend which could be paid by the insurance  subsidiaries over the
next twelve  months  without prior  statutory  approval  would be  approximately
$120.1 million.

Sales of Loans
--------------
GMACMG sells its originated,  brokered and purchased  residential mortgage loans
into  various  governmental  agency  (FHLMC,  FNMA  and  GNMA)   mortgage-backed
securities and private mortgage-backed securities for sale to investment bankers
and private  mortgage  investors  while  maintaining  the right to service  such
mortgage  loans.  GMACMG  securitizes  a majority of its  originated  commercial
mortgage  loans into  commercial  mortgage  backed  securities  while  generally
retaining  a  subordinate  tranche  and the  right  to  service  the  commercial
mortgages sold.

As part of its conduit mortgage banking activities,  GMACMG retains subordinated
and  stripped  mortgage-backed  securities  which are  generally  classified  as
trading securities or available for sale and held at estimated fair value.

Allowance for Losses
--------------------
On certain transactions,  GMACMG will retain full or limited recourse for credit
or other losses  incurred by the purchaser of the loans sold,  under  provisions
which comply with SFAS No. 140.  GMACMG  establishes  allowances  for  estimated
losses  related  to  the  outstanding  recourse  obligations,  which  management
considers adequate. In addition,  GMACMG provides appropriate loss allowances on
mortgage lending receivables and other mortgage loans held as investments, based
upon management's  evaluation of the pertinent factors underlying the quality of
the loan portfolio,  including actual credit loss  experience,  current economic
conditions,  detailed  evaluation of specifically  identified mortgage loans for
which full collectibility may not be assured and the existence and realizability
of the collateral and guarantees securing such loans.

GMACMG  uses U.S.  Treasury  related  derivatives  to hedge  interest  rate risk
associated with its mortgage inventory pipeline.  At December 31, 2001 and 2000,
the  notional  amount of such  instruments  totaled  $3,018.5  million and $37.7
million,  respectively.  These  instruments are carried at estimated fair value.
Realized and unrealized gains and losses on these  instruments are recognized in
the current period on a mark-to-market basis.

GMACMG utilizes U.S. Treasury related derivatives and mortgage-backed securities
to hedge  interest rate and price risk  associated  with its mortgage loans held
for sale. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, the notional amount of such instruments
totaled $2,083.7 million and $1,095.7 million,  respectively.  These instruments
are carried at estimated fair value. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on
these  instruments  are  recognized  in the current  period on a  mark-to-market
basis.

GMACMG uses U.S. Treasury related  derivatives and interest rate swap agreements
to hedge  price and  interest  rate risk  associated  with its  mortgage-related
securities.  At  December  31,  2001  and  2000,  the  notional  amount  of such
instruments totaled $11,830.7 million and $9,353.9 million, respectively.  These
instruments are carried at estimated fair value.  Realized and unrealized  gains
and  losses on these  instruments  are  recognized  in the  current  period on a
mark-to-market basis.

GMACMG  enters  into  interest  rate swap  contracts  in an effort to  stabilize
short-term  borrowing  costs. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, the notional amount
of these instruments totaled $985.0 million and $1,230.9 million,  respectively.
The contracts involve the delivery of fixed payments to a counterparty in return
for  variable  payments  based  upon  a  published  index.  The  contracts  have
maturities  ranging from one to five years.  Amounts paid or received under such
contracts are recorded as an adjustment to interest  expense.  These instruments
are  carried  at  estimated  fair  value.  Realized  gains  and  losses on these
instruments are recognized in the current period. Unrealized gains and losses on
these  instruments  are recognized in the current period as a component of Other

contracts,  swaps,  swaptions,  forwards and  mortgage-backed  security  related
derivatives  to manage the risk of  impairment  loss due to a change in the fair
value of capitalized  mortgage  servicing rights. At December 31, 2001 and 2000,
the notional amount of such instruments  totaled $56,752.5 million and $31,074.3

originate  residential  mortgage  loans held for sale are  derivative  financial
instruments. Gains and losses on IRLC's and commitments to purchase or originate
residential  mortgage loans held for sale are initially  deferred as a component
of Other Assets or Other  Liabilities on the Consolidated  Balance Sheet;  gains
and  losses  subsequent  to  the  initial  recording  of  such  instruments  are
recognized  in the  current  period as  incurred.  Deferred  gains or losses are
recognized as a component of Mortgage  Revenues when the related  mortgage loans
are sold.

In  connection  with  certain  special  purpose  entities,  GMACMG  enters  into
derivative  contracts  to retain  or hedge  interest  rate  and/or  credit  risk
associated with certain assets in the entities.  These derivatives are marked to
market in the  Company's  Consolidated  Financial  Statements,  with  unrealized
holding  gains and losses  recorded  in the  Consolidated  Statement  of Income.

Commitments to sell mortgage  loans totaled $426.0 million and $1,644.5  million
at  December  31,  2001 and 2000,  respectively.  Of these  commitments,  $400.0
million  qualified  as  derivatives  under  SFAS  No.  133 and were  carried  at

December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Of these commitments, $7,106.2 million
qualified as  derivatives  under SFAS No. 133 and were carried at estimated fair
value. The remaining balance of $1,693.7 million did not meet the criteria for a
derivative and were  considered in conjunction  with the lower of cost or market

market on the balance sheet with the  corresponding  unrealized gains and losses
recorded in the income statement. There were no such commitments at December 31,
2000.

Warehouse  lending involves the extension of short-term  secured lines of credit
to mortgage originators to finance mortgage loans until such loans are purchased
by a permanent investor. Advances under the lines of credit are fully secured by
the  underlying  mortgages  and  bear  interest  at a rate  that  is  tied  to a
short-term  index.  At December  31,  2001 and 2000,  unused  warehouse  lending
commitments totaled $5,029.4 million and $3,383.6 million, respectively.  GMACMG
enters  into  foreign  currency   contracts  to  hedge  foreign  exchange  risks
associated  with overseas  lending.  At December 31, 2001 and 2000, the notional
amounts  of  such  instruments   totaled  $117.8  million  and  $134.6  million,
respectively.  Construction  lending involves the extension of long-term secured

million,  respectively.  Healthcare  lending involves the extension of long-term
secured  lines of credit to  healthcare  related  institutions.  At December 31,
2001, unused healthcare  commitments totaled $46.9 million. There were no unused
healthcare  commitments  at December  31,  2000.  In  addition,  GMACMG also has
outstanding commitments to lend on available credit lines, primarily home equity
lines of credit.  At December 31, 2001 and 2000,  unused lending  commitments on
these lines totaled $1,025.7 million and $722.7 million, respectively.

Mortgage Securitization
-----------------------
GMACMG sells mortgage loans through public and private  securitizations  as well
as through  whole loan sales.  Gains or losses on such sales are  recognized  at
transfer  of title and when  control  over the loans has been  surrendered.  The
resulting gain or loss on sale is determined by allocating  the carrying  amount
of the loans between the mortgage  securities  sold and the  interests  retained
based on their relative fair value at the date of sale. Fair values are based on
quoted  market prices if  available.  Otherwise,  the fair value of the retained
interests is estimated based on the present value of expected future cash flows.
Expected  future  cash flows are  derived  from  management's  best  estimate of
assumptions   regarding  prepayment  speeds,   credit  losses,   discount  rates
commensurate  with the risks  involved  and, if  applicable,  interest  rates on
variable and adjustable contracts.

Prepayment  speed  estimates are determined  utilizing data obtained from market
participants,  where  available,  or based  on  historical  prepayment  rates on
similar assets. Credit loss assumptions are based upon historical experience and
the characteristics of individual loans underlying the securities. Discount rate
assumptions are determined using data obtained from market  participants,  where
available,  or based on current  relevant  treasury  rates plus a risk  adjusted
spread based on analysis of historical  spreads on similar types of  securities.
Estimates of interest  rates on variable and  adjustable  contracts are based on
spreads over the applicable benchmark interest rate.

Mortgage Securitization (continued)
-----------------------------------
During 2001,  GMACMG sold  residential  mortgage  loans,  including  home equity
loans, high loan-to-value loans, residential first and second mortgage loans and
other loans, and commercial  mortgage loans in securitization  transactions.  In
the   majority   of   those    securitizations,    GMACMG   retained   servicing
responsibilities and, in some cases,  subordinated interests. As of December 31,
2001,  the  weighted  average  servicing  fee for GMACMG for  primary  servicing
activities was between 32.2 and 40.0 basis points on  residential  mortgages and
8.4 basis points on commercial  mortgages of the outstanding  principal  balance
serviced.  Master  servicing  fees were  between 1.5 and 8.0 basis points of the
unpaid  principal  balance  serviced at December 31, 2001. The investors and the
securitization  trusts have no recourse to GMACMG's  other assets for failure of
debtors to pay when due.  GMACMG's  retained  interests are  subordinate  to the
investors'  interest.  Their fair value is  subject  to credit,  prepayment  and
interest rate risks on the transferred financial assets.

In 2001,  2000 and 1999,  GMACMG  recognized  pre-tax  gains of $965.8  million,
$682.4  million  and $526.7  million,  respectively,  on the  securitization  of
residential  mortgages  and $28.8  million,  $40.4  million  and $76.1  million,
respectively, on the securitization of commercial mortgages.

Key economic assumptions used in measuring the retained interests at the date of
securitization  resulting from  securitizations  completed  during 2001 and 2000
were as follows:

NOTE 13.  MORTGAGE BANKING (continued)

Mortgage Servicing Rights
-------------------------
The right to service  loans is  contracted  under  primary  or master  servicing
agreements.   Under  primary  servicing  agreements,   GMACMG  collects  monthly
principal,  interest and escrow payments from individual mortgagors and performs
certain accounting and reporting  functions on behalf of the mortgage investors.
As master servicer,  GMACMG collects monthly payments from various sub-servicers
and  performs  certain  accounting  and  reporting  functions  on  behalf of the
mortgage  investors.  With the exception of serviced mortgages owned GMACMG, the
servicing portfolio principal amount is not reflected in the Company's financial
statements.  Capitalized mortgage servicing rights, net of valuation allowances,
totaled  $4,839.8  million and  $3,984.5  million at December 31, 2001 and 2000,
respectively.  The fair value of the mortgage  servicing  rights at December 31,
2001 and 2000, was $5,384.9 million and $4,082.8 million, respectively.

The Company estimates the fair value of its mortgage servicing rights based upon
assumptions that market participants would use. Typically, those assumptions are
derived from similar  transactions,  which occur in the  marketplace.  Continued
industry  consolidation  and other factors have led to a substantial  decline in
relevant  market  transactions  for  certain   residential   mortgage  products,
particularly  since April 2001.  In order to improve  the  Company's  estimation
process  for  assessing  the fair  value of certain  of its  mortgage  servicing
rights, during the second quarter, the Company increased its reliance on its own
mortgage  servicing  rights  cash  flow  history  for  certain  assumptions  and
continues to use market driven earning rates, discounting factors and prepayment
models.

GMACMG  has  stratified  its  mortgage  servicing  rights  by  predominant  risk
characteristics, primarily loan type and interest rate interval, for purposes of
measuring  impairment.  Amortization  expense is  recorded  for each  stratum in
proportion  to and  over the  period  of the  projected  net  servicing  income.
Impairment  is evaluated  for each stratum by comparing  fair value as estimated
using projected discounted cash flows with current market assumptions to the net
book value of the related  stratum.  Impairment is recorded  through a valuation
allowance and charged to amortization expense in the period it is determined. At
December 31, 2001 and 2000, the valuation  allowance  totaled $491.1 million and

NOTE 13.  MORTGAGE BANKING (concluded)

The sensitivities in this note are hypothetical and should be used with caution.
As the figures  indicate,  changes in fair value based on a 10 percent variation
in assumptions  generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the
change in  assumption  to the change in fair value may not be linear.  Also,  in
this table,  the effect of a variation  in a particular  assumption  on the fair
value  of the  retained  interest  is  calculated  without  changing  any  other
assumption.  In reality,  changes in one factor may result in changes in another
(for example, increases in market interest rates may result in lower prepayments
and  increased   credit   losses),   which  might  magnify  or  counteract   the
sensitivities.  Further,  these  sensitivities show only the change in the asset
balances and do not show any expected changes in the fair value instruments used
to manage the interest rate and prepayment  risks  associated with these assets,
as discussed under Mortgage Derivative Financial Instruments above.

In addition, the above estimated amounts generated from the sensitivity analyses
include  forward-looking  statements of market risk, which assume for analytical
purposes that certain  adverse market  considerations  may occur.  Actual future
market  conditions may differ  materially and accordingly,  the  forward-looking
statements  should not be  considered  projections  by GMAC of future  events or
losses.

NOTE 14.  FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The Company has developed the following  fair value  estimates by utilization of
available  market  information  or other  appropriate  valuation  methodologies.
However,  considerable  judgment  is  required  in  interpreting  market data to
develop estimates of fair value, so the estimates are not necessarily indicative
of the  amounts  that  could be  realized  or would be paid in a current  market
exchange.  The effect of using different market  assumptions  and/or  estimation
methodologies may be material to the estimated fair value amounts.

Fair value  information  presented  herein is based on information  available at
December 31, 2001 and 2000. Although management is not aware of any factors that
would significantly  affect the estimated fair value amounts,  such amounts have
not been updated since those dates and, therefore, the current estimates of fair
value at dates subsequent to December 31, 2001 and 2000 may differ significantly
from these amounts.

The estimated fair value of financial instruments held by the Company, for which
it is practicable to estimate that value, were as follows:

(1) Effective January 1, 2001 the Company was required to record the fair market
value of its derivatives on the balance sheet due to the  implementation of SFAS
No. 133. Refer to Note 17 for additional information.

(2) The 2001 notional balance includes $5,054.6 million in financial instruments
that  are  recorded  at fair  value on the  balance  sheet.  The net fair  value
recorded on the balance  sheet for these  financial  instruments  totaled  $28.1
million at December 31, 2001.

(3) The 2001 notional balance includes $7,506.2 million in financial instruments
that  are  recorded  at fair  value on the  balance  sheet.  The net fair  value
recorded on the balance  sheet for these  financial  instruments  totaled  $63.7
million at December 31, 2001.

(4)  The  2000  notional  balance  includes   $51,617.9   million  in  financial
instruments  that are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet.  The net fair
value  recorded on the balance  sheet for these  financial  instruments  totaled
$310.5 million at December 31, 2000. The loss position  includes deferred losses
of $5.1 million for December 31, 2000. The gain/loss positions presented exclude
accrued interest.

(5) Includes  $4,719.5 million in combined interest rate and currency swaps with
unrealized losses of $612.9 million at December 31, 2000. The unrealized gain or
loss in the fair value of the foreign currency instruments in 2000 was offset by
the  unrealized  loss or gain in the fair value of the related  underlying  debt
instruments. The gain/loss positions presented exclude accrued interest.

(6) Contract/notional  amounts of off-balance sheet financial instruments do not
represent  credit risk exposures.  Credit risk is limited to the current cost of
replacing instruments in a gain position.

Cash and cash equivalents
-------------------------
The book value  approximates  fair value because of the short  maturity of these
instruments.

Investments in securities
-------------------------
Bonds,  equity  securities,  notes and other  available for sale  investments in
securities  are carried at fair value,  which is based on quoted market  prices.
The fair value of mortgage-related trading securities is based on market quotes,
discounted using market  prepayment  assumptions and discount rates. The held to
maturity  investments  in securities  are carried at historical  cost.  The fair
value of the held to  maturity  investments  in  securities  is based on  quoted
market prices.  The retained  interests in  securitizations  are carried at fair
value based on discounted expected cash flows using current market rates.
<page>

Finance receivables, net
------------------------
The  fair  value is  estimated  by  discounting  the  future  cash  flows  using
applicable  spreads to approximate  current rates applicable to each category of
finance  receivables.  The  carrying  value of wholesale  receivables  and other
receivables  whose interest rates adjust on a short-term  basis with  applicable
market indices  (generally the prime rate) are assumed to approximate fair value
either due to their short  maturities  or due to the  interest  rate  adjustment
feature.

Factored receivables
--------------------
The book value approximates the fair value because of the short duration of such
receivables.

Notes receivable from GM
------------------------
The  fair  value is  estimated  by  discounting  the  future  cash  flows  using
applicable spreads to approximate current rates applicable to certain categories
of other financing assets.

Real estate mortgages
---------------------
The fair  value of  mortgage  loans held for sale is based  upon  actual  prices
received on recent  sales of mortgage  loans and  securities  to  investors  and
projected  prices obtained  through investor  indications  considering  interest
rates,  mortgage loan type and credit quality. The fair values of loans held for
investment  is  determined  through a review  of  published  market  information
associated  with similar  instruments.  Due to the short-term  floating rates on
lending receivables, book values are assumed to approximate fair values.

Due and deferred from receivable sales, net
-------------------------------------------
The fair value of  interest-only  strip  receivables  is derived by  discounting
expected cash flows using current market rates.

Derivatives asset position / Derivatives liability position
-----------------------------------------------------------
Effective  January 1, 2001,  the Company was required by SFAS No. 133 to reflect
the fair market value of its derivatives on the balance sheet.

Interest rate instruments
-------------------------
The fair value of the existing  interest rate swaps is estimated by  discounting
expected  cash flows  using  quoted  market  interest  rates.  The fair value of
written and purchased  options is estimated  using  broker/dealer  quoted market
prices. The fair value of mortgage-related interest rate swaps, caps and written
and purchased options is based upon broker/dealer quoted market prices.

Foreign currency instruments
----------------------------
The estimated fair value of the foreign currency swaps is derived by discounting
expected cash flows using market  exchange  rates over the remaining term of the
agreement.

Debt
----
The fair value of debt is  determined by using quoted market prices for the same
or similar  issues,  if available,  or based on the current rates offered to the
Company for debt with similar remaining  maturities.  Commercial  paper,  master
notes  and  demand  notes  have an  original  term of less  than 270  days  and,
therefore, the carrying amount of these liabilities is considered to approximate
fair value.

Commitments to originate/purchase mortgages/securities
------------------------------------------------------
The fair value of commitments is estimated  using published  market  information
associated with commitments to sell similar instruments.

Commitments to sell mortgages/securities
----------------------------------------
The fair value of commitments is estimated  using published  market  information
associated with similar instruments.

Unused mortgage lending commitments
-----------------------------------
The fair value of these  commitments  is considered in the overall  valuation of
the underlying assets with which they are associated.
<page>
Commitments to provide capital to equity method investees
---------------------------------------------------------
GMAC  Mortgage  Group is  committed  to lend  equity  capital to its real estate
partnerships.  The fair value of these  commitments is considered in the overall
valuation of the underlying assets with which they are associated.

NOTE 14.  FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (concluded)

Unused revolving credit lines
-----------------------------
The unused portion of revolving  lines of credit will  approximate  market value
since they reprice at prevailing market rates.

Credit Risk
-----------
These  aforementioned  instruments  contain  an element of risk in the event the
counterparties  are  unable to meet the terms of the  agreements.  However,  the
Company  minimizes  the risk  exposure by limiting the  counterparties  to those
major banks and financial  institutions who meet established  credit guidelines.
Management also reduces its credit risk for unused lines of credit it extends by
applying the same credit policies in making commitments as it does for extending
loans. Management does not expect any counterparty to default on its obligations
and, therefore,  does not expect to incur any loss due to counterparty  default.
The  Company  does  not  require  or  place   collateral  for  these   financial
instruments, except for the lines of credit it extends.

Concentrations of Credit Risk
-----------------------------
The Company's  primary business is to provide vehicle  financing for GM products
to GM dealers and their customers.  Wholesale and dealer loan financing  relates
primarily to GM dealers,  with collateral  primarily GM vehicles (for wholesale)
and GM dealership  property (for loans). For wholesale  financing,  GMAC is also
provided further protection by GM factory repurchase programs.  Retail contracts
and  operating  lease  assets  relate  primarily  to the secured sale and lease,
respectively, of vehicles (primarily GM).

In terms of geographic  concentrations  as of December 31, 2001, 81.3% of GMAC's
consolidated  automotive  servicing assets were U.S. based;  8.2% were in Europe
(of which 30.6% reside in Germany and 27.0% reside in the United Kingdom);  8.0%
were in Canada; 1.0% were in Asia-Pacific (of which Australia represents 80.0%);
and  1.5%  were  in  Latin  America.  The  majority  of  the  Company's  finance
receivables are geographically diversified throughout the United States.

NOTE 16.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

Minimum future  commitments under operating leases having  noncancellable  lease
terms in excess of one year,  primarily for real  property,  aggregating  $523.7
million,  are payable  $135.8  million in 2002;  $106.9  million in 2003;  $79.7
million in 2004;  $56.2  million  in 2005;  $33.1  million  in 2006;  and $112.0
million in 2007 and thereafter. Certain of the leases contain escalation clauses
and renewal or purchase  options.  Rental expenses under  operating  leases were
$241.9  million,  $237.5  million  and $232.5  million  in 2001,  2000 and 1999,
respectively.

The Company  and certain  subsidiaries  of GMACI and GMACMG  have  entered  into
multiple  agreements under which Electronic Data Systems  Corporation,  a former
subsidiary  of GM, will  continue to be the  principal  provider of  information
technology services through 2003.

Various international  subsidiaries of the Company are subject to regulatory and
other requirements of the jurisdictions in which they operate.  These regulatory
restrictions  primarily  dictate that these  subsidiaries  meet certain  minimum
capital  requirements,  restrict  dividend  distributions  and require that some
assets be restricted. To date, compliance with these various regulations has not
had a materially  adverse effect on the Company's  financial position or results
of operations.

GMAC Bank is a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  depository institution and
is subject to certain minimum  aggregate capital  requirements  under applicable
federal  banking  laws.  As of the date of this  filing,  GMAC  Bank has met all
regulatory requirements.

GMAC is subject to potential liability under government  regulations and various
claims and legal actions which are pending or may be asserted against them. Some
of the pending  actions  purport to be class  actions.  The  aggregate  ultimate
liability of GMAC under these government  regulations and under these claims and
actions,  was not  determinable  at December 31,  2001.  After  discussion  with
counsel,  it is the opinion of management that such liability is not expected to
have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  the  Company's   consolidated  financial
condition, results of operations or cash flows.

NOTE 17.  DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

GMAC's  primary  objective for utilizing  derivative  instruments is to minimize
market risk volatility  associated with interest rate and foreign currency risks
related to the assets and liabilities of the automotive and mortgage operations.
Minimizing this volatility enables the Company to price its finance and mortgage
offerings  at  competitive  rates and to  minimize  the impact of market risk on
earnings of the  Company.  The Company  utilizes  comprehensive  asset/liability
management  strategies  administered  by the  respective  automotive or mortgage
operations  management  to achieve this  objective.  One of the key goals of the
Company's strategy is to match the interest rate characteristics of the interest
bearing  liabilities  with those of the interest  earning assets,  including the
assets and liabilities  associated with securitization  transactions that may be
recorded in off-balance sheet special purpose entities. In addition, the Company
utilizes  derivatives to neutralize the foreign currency exposure due to foreign
currency denominated debt.

GMAC Automotive Operations

Interest Rate Instruments
GMAC is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest  rates based
on its financing,  investing and cash  management  activities.  GMAC enters into
various  financial  instrument  transactions  to maintain  the desired  level of
exposure  to the risk of interest  rate  fluctuations  and to minimize  interest
expense.  The Company  utilizes  various  contracts to manage interest rate risk
including:  interest  rate swaps that are  contractual  agreements  between  the
Company and another  party to exchange  the net  difference  between a fixed and
floating interest rate, or different floating interest rates,  periodically over
the life of the  contract  without  the  exchange  of the  underlying  principal
amount.  The Company  uses swaps to alter its fixed and floating  interest  rate
exposures. As such, the majority of swaps are executed as an integral element of
a specific financing  transaction.  In a limited number of cases, swaps, matched
to specific  portfolios  of assets or debt,  are  executed  to achieve  specific
interest rate management objectives.

GMAC has elected to designate  particular  interest  rate swap  arrangements  as
hedging  the  exposure  to  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  fixed  rate  debt
instruments.  Any measured hedge ineffectiveness related to fair value hedges is
recognized  as a net gain or loss in other  operating  expenses.  For the period
ended December 31, 2001, a net gain of $26.1  million,  including the transition
adjustment,  was  recognized  representing  the  ineffectiveness  of fair  value
hedges.

The Company has also elected to designate  other interest rate  arrangements  as
hedging the exposure to variability in expected  future cash flows  attributable
to  variable  rate debt.  Any  ineffectiveness  related  to cash flow  hedges is
recognized  as a net gain or loss in other  operating  expenses.  For the period
ended December 31, 2001, there was no measured  ineffectiveness in the Company's
cash flow  hedges.  The  amounts  related to GMAC's  cash flow  hedges  that are
reported in other  comprehensive  income will be  reclassified  into earnings as
payments  become  due and the swaps  approach  maturity.  During  2001,  $(31.6)
million  loss  was  reclassified  out of  other  comprehensive  income  and into
earnings.  Over the next twelve  months  $(29.5)  million loss is expected to be
reclassified out of other comprehensive income and into earnings.

GMAC has certain  interest  rate swap  arrangements  that are not  designated as
hedges under SFAS No. 133. These instruments  relate primarily to swaps that are
used to  facilitate  securitization  transactions.  During  2001,  a net gain of
$161.2 million,  including the transition adjustment, was recognized into income
related to these instruments.

NOTE 17.  DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (continued)

GMAC Automotive Operations (continued)

Foreign Currency Instruments
GMAC is exposed to foreign  currency  risk  arising  from the  possibility  that
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates will impact future earnings or assets and
liability  values  from  normal  operations  in foreign  countries  and  various
financial instruments that are denominated in foreign currencies. Currency swaps
and forwards are used to hedge  foreign  exchange  exposure on foreign  currency
denominated  debt by  converting  the funding  currency  to the  currency of the
assets being financed.  Foreign currency swaps and forwards are legal agreements
between  two  parties  to  purchase  and sell a  foreign  currency,  for a price
specified  at the  contract  date,  with  delivery  and  settlement  at both the
effective date and maturity date of the contract.

The Company has elected to designate  certain foreign  currency  arrangements as
hedging the exposure to variability in expected  future cash flows  attributable
to debt denominated in a foreign currency. Any ineffectiveness  related to these
cash  flow  hedges  is  recognized  as a net  gain or loss  in  other  operating
expenses.  For the  period  ended  December  31,  2001,  there  was no  measured
ineffectiveness  in the Company's foreign currency cash flow hedges. The amounts
related to GMAC's  foreign  currency cash flow hedges that are reported in other
comprehensive  income will be reclassified  into earnings as payments become due
and the swaps approach maturity.  The Company expects that any amounts that will
be  reclassified  into  earnings from other  comprehensive  income over the next
twelve months will be immaterial.

GMAC has elected not to designate  foreign  currency  derivatives  as fair value
hedges of foreign  dominated debt under SFAS No. 133 because the changes in fair
value,  recorded in other operating  expenses,  is  substantially  offset by the
foreign currency revaluation gains and losses of the related liabilities.

Mortgage Derivatives

GMACMG maintains an overall risk management  strategy that  incorporates the use
of various derivative financial  instruments in the normal course of business to
manage inherent risks.

Fair-Value Hedges

Mortgage loans held for sale
GMACMG originates and purchases  residential  conforming and  non-conforming and
commercial  mortgage loans for sale into the secondary  market.  From the loan's
closing  until its sale  (warehoused  loans),  GMACMG is  exposed to risk due to
changes in the fair value of the loans in its warehouse.

In order to accomplish the intended risk  management  objectives,  GMACMG enters
into a combination  of derivative  instruments  that are designated as hedges of
specific  pools of  similar  mortgage  loans  held  for  sale.  GMACMG  uses the
following  derivatives in managing the hedged risk  associated with its mortgage
loans held for sale: (1) forward  commitments;  (2) over the counter  options on
MBS;  (3)  options  on  treasury   securities/futures;   (4)  constant  maturity
treasuries/swaps   ("CMT/CMS")  caps  and  floors;  and  (5)  other  instruments
considered derivatives under SFAS No. 133.

NOTE 17.  DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (concluded)

Mortgage Derivatives (concluded)

Mortgage Servicing Rights
In connection with  capitalized  mortgage  servicing  rights ("MSRs") related to
residential conforming loans, GMACMG generally hedges the risk of changes in the
MSRs fair value  attributable  to changes in the designated  benchmark  interest
rate risk. In connection with capitalized  mortgage  servicing rights related to
certain residential non-conforming loans, GMACMG hedges the total change in fair
value of the MSR asset.

In order to accomplish the intended risk  management  objectives,  GMACMG enters
into a combination  of derivative  instruments  that are designated as hedges of
specific  assets or specific  pools of similar  MSRs.  GMACMG uses the following
derivatives  in managing the hedged risk  associated  with its  residential  MSR
assets:  (1) call and put options on Treasuries and Swaps; (2) MBS, treasury and
LIBOR future  contracts;  (3) CMT/CMS caps and floors;  (4)  swaptions;  and (5)
swaps.

For the  period  ended  December  31,  2001,  GMACMG  recognized  a net  loss of
approximately  $(243.9)  million  reported as a component of Mortgage Revenue in
the Consolidated  Statement of Income, pre-tax which represented the ineffective
portion of all fair-value  hedges.  All components of each  derivative's gain or
loss were generally included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness.

Cash Flow Hedges

GMACMG issues  floating rate  commercial  paper and  short-term  debt to finance
long-term  assets.  Thus, GMACMG is exposed to interest rate risk due to changes
in  short-term  interest  rates.  To mitigate  this risk,  GMACMG  enters into a
portfolio  of  interest  rate swaps to convert a portion  of its  floating  rate
commercial  paper  and  short-term  debt  to  fixed  rate  instruments   thereby
minimizing its exposure to volatility in short-term interest rates.

Included in Mortgage  revenue,  GMACMG  recognized an immaterial amount of hedge
ineffectiveness  on all cash flow hedges for the year ended  December  31, 2001.
Additionally,  GMACMG  expects that any amounts  which will be  reclassified  to
earnings from other comprehensive income will be immaterial.

Trading and Non-Hedge Derivatives

GMACMG  also  enters  into  various   derivative   contracts   for  trading  and
economically hedging certain trading assets and financial instruments carried at
fair value.  Trading activities (which include derivative  transactions that are
entered into for risk-management purposes and do not otherwise qualify for hedge
accounting)  primarily  involve the use of options and futures contracts on U.S.
Treasury instruments and Euros, and interest rate swap, cap and floor agreements
to hedge  price and  interest  rate risk  associated  with its  mortgage-related
securities.  GMACMG also enters into other derivative  financial  instruments to
hedge its  exposure  to foreign  exchange  fluctuations  on certain  obligations
denominated in foreign currencies.  Finally,  the interest rate lock commitments
and loan purchase commitments for 1-4 family residential mortgage loans held for
sale are  classified as  derivatives  and are carried at their fair value on the
balance sheet.
