containers, primarily for beverages and foods. This segment decreased from 84&nbsp;percent
of Ball&#146;s consolidated net sales in 2002 to 67&nbsp;percent in 2003 due to the

Packaging
products are sold in highly competitive markets, primarily based on quality, service and
price. The packaging business is capital intensive, requiring significant investments in
machinery and equipment. Profitability is sensitive to selling prices, production volumes,
labor, freight and warehousing costs, as well as the availability and price of certain raw
materials, such as aluminum, steel and plastic resin. These raw materials are generally
available from several sources and we have secured what we consider to be adequate
supplies and are not experiencing any shortages. We believe we have minimal
exposure related to changes in the costs of aluminum, steel and plastic resin as a result
of (1)&nbsp;the inclusion of provisions in aluminum can sales contracts to pass through
aluminum cost changes, as well as the use of derivative instruments, (2)&nbsp;steel can
sales contracts that incorporate annually negotiated metal costs and (3) the inclusion of
provisions in plastic container sales contracts to pass through resin cost changes. </FONT></TD>

Metal beverage containers and ends represent Ball&#146;s largest product line, accounting for
69&nbsp;percent of segment net sales and 46&nbsp;percent of consolidated net sales in
2003. Decorated two-piece aluminum beverage cans are produced at 16 manufacturing
facilities in the U.S., one facility in Canada and one in Puerto Rico; can ends are
produced within four of the U.S. facilities, as well as in a fifth facility that
manufactures ends only. The annual production capacity of these plants is
approximately 33&nbsp;billion cans. Metal beverage containers are sold under long-term or annual
supply contracts primarily to fillers of carbonated soft drinks, beer and other beverages.
Sales volumes of metal beverage cans and ends in North America tend to
be highest during the period from April through September. </FONT></TD>

Beverage container industry production capacity in the U.S. and Canada exceeds demand. In order to
balance more closely capacity and demand within our business, from time to time we consolidate our can and
end manufacturing capacity into fewer, more efficient facilities. From January1, 1999, through December 31, 2001, we closed
five plants. In the second quarter of 2003, we closed a beverage can end plant
which we acquired from Metal Packaging International, Inc., in March 2003. </FONT></TD>

The aluminum beverage can continues to compete aggressively with other packaging materials in
the beer and soft drink industries. The glass bottle has shown resilience in the packaged
beer industry, while soft drink industry use of the PET bottle has grown. In Canada, metal
beverage containers have captured significantly lower percentages of the packaged beverage
industry than in the U.S., particularly in the packaged beer industry. The market share of
metal containers has been hindered by non-tariff trade barriers and restrictive taxes
within Canada. </FONT></TD>

In addition to metal beverage cans, Ball produces two-piece and three-piece steel food cans
for packaging vegetables, fruit, soups, meat, seafood, nutritional products, pet food and other products. These
steel food containers are manufactured in 11&nbsp;plants in the U.S. and Canada and sold
primarily to food processors in North America. In 2003 metal food container sales
comprised approximately 20&nbsp;percent of segment net sales and 13&nbsp;percent of
consolidated net sales. Sales volumes of metal food containers in North America tend to be
highest from June through October as a result of seasonal vegetable and salmon packs.
Approximately 34&nbsp;billion steel food cans were shipped in the U.S. and Canada in 2003,
of which we estimate approximately 17&nbsp;percent were shipped by Ball. </FONT></TD>

containers made of PET has increased in the beverage packaging industry and is expected to
increase in the food packaging industry with improved technology and adequate supplies of
resin. While PET beverage containers compete against metal, glass and paper, the
historical increase in the sales of PET containers has come primarily at the expense of
glass containers and through new market introductions. We estimate our 2003 shipments of
5.5&nbsp;billion plastic containers to be approximately 8&nbsp;percent of total U.S. and
Canadian plastic container shipments. </FONT></TD>

Packaging Europe&#146;s operations, which accounted for 20&nbsp;percent of Ball&#146;s
consolidated net sales in 2003, consist of nine&nbsp;beverage can plants and two aluminum
beverage can end plants, a technical center in Bonn, Germany, and the European
headquarters in Ratingen, Germany. Of the 11&nbsp;plants, four are located in Germany,
three in the United Kingdom, two in France and one each in the Netherlands and Poland. In
total the plants produced approximately 11&nbsp;billion cans in 2003, with
approximately half of those being produced from steel and half from aluminum. Four of the

with an estimated one-third industry share in 2003, and produces two-piece beverage cans
and can ends for beer, carbonated soft drinks, mineral water, fruit juices, isotonics,
milk-based beverages, coffee drinks and alcoholic mixed drinks. In Western Europe, Ball
Packaging Europe is the top beverage container manufacturer in Germany, France and the
Benelux countries and the second largest beverage container manufacturer in the United
Kingdom. In addition, it has contributed to the development of the eastern European
beverage business and has an estimated 50&nbsp;percent share in Poland. Ball plans to

Our
operations in Germany are subject to packaging legislation that exempts one-way containers
from a mandatory deposit fee as long as returnable containers maintain at least a
72&nbsp;percent market share. After the market share dropped below this mandated level,
regulators imposed a mandatory deposit fee on cans and other non-refillable containers
effective January&nbsp;1, 2003. Due to political and legal uncertainties in Germany, no
nationwide system for returning the containers was in place at the time the mandatory
deposit was imposed and many retailers stopped carrying beverages in non-refillable
containers. The situation is not expected to improve until the deposit is eliminated by
once again meeting the mandatory refill quotas or until it is resolved by various courts,
intervention by the European Union or by the implementation of a nationwide return system.
We have responded by reducing beverage can production at our German plants, implementing
aggressive cost reduction measures, entering into price increase negotiations and
increasing exports from Germany to other European nations. We also closed a plant in the
Untied Kingdom, delayed capital investment projects in France and Poland and are
converting one of our steel can production lines in Germany to aluminum in order to
facilitate additional can exports from Germany. </FONT></TD>

The
European beverage can business is capital intensive, requiring significant investments in
machinery and equipment. Profitability is sensitive to selling prices, foreign exchange
rates, production volumes, labor and the costs and availability of certain raw materials,
such as aluminum and steel. The European steel and aluminum industry is highly
consolidated with three steel suppliers and three aluminum suppliers providing
95&nbsp;percent of European requirements. Material supply contracts are generally for a period
of one year, although Ball Packaging Europe has negotiated some longer term agreements.
Aluminum is purchased primarily in U.S. dollars while the functional currencies of Ball
Packaging Europe and its subsidiaries are non-U.S. dollars. This inherently results in a
foreign exchange rate risk, which the company minimizes through the use of derivative
contracts. </FONT></TD>

Legislation which would prohibit, tax or restrict the sale or use of certain types of containers, and
would require diversion of solid wastes such as packaging materials from disposal in

container legislation has been adopted in a few jurisdictions, similar legislation has
been defeated in public referenda and legislative bodies in numerous others. The company anticipates that
continuing efforts will be made to consider and adopt such legislation in many
jurisdictions in the future. If such legislation was widely adopted, it potentially could have a

As
previously reported, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) considers the
company a Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) with respect to the Lowry Landfill site
located east of Denver, Colorado. On June&nbsp;12, 1992, the company was served with a
lawsuit filed by the City and County of Denver (Denver) and Waste Management of Colorado,
Inc., seeking contributions from the company and approximately 38 other companies. The
company filed its answer denying the allegations of the Complaint. On July&nbsp;8, 1992,
the company was served with a third-party complaint filed by S.W. Shattuck Chemical
Company, Inc., seeking contribution from the company and other companies for the costs
associated with cleaning up the Lowry Landfill. The company denied the allegations of the
complaints. </FONT></TD>

In
July 1992 the company entered into a settlement and indemnification agreement with Denver,
Chemical Waste Management, Inc., and Waste Management of Colorado, Inc. (collectively
Waste) pursuant to which Denver and Waste dismissed their lawsuit against the company and
Waste agreed to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the company from claims and lawsuits
brought by governmental agencies and other parties relating to actions seeking
contributions or remedial costs from the company for the cleanup of the site. Several
other companies, which are defendants in the above-referenced lawsuits, had already
entered into the settlement and indemnification agreement with Denver and Waste. Waste
Management, Inc., has agreed to guarantee the obligations for Chemical Waste Management,
Inc., and Waste Management of Colorado, Inc. Denver and Waste may seek additional payments
from the company if the response costs related to the site exceed $319&nbsp;million. In
2003 Waste Management indicated that the cost of the site might exceed $319&nbsp;million
in 2030, approximately three years before the projected completion of the project. The
company might also be responsible for payments (calculated in 1992 dollars) for any
additional wastes which may have been disposed of by the company at the site but which are
identified after the execution of the settlement agreement. </FONT></TD>

The
company previously reported that on August&nbsp;1, 1997, the USEPA sent notice of
potential liability to 19 PRPs concerning past activities at one or more of the four Rocky
Flats parcels (including land owned by Precision Chemicals now owned by Great Western
Inorganics) at the Rocky Flats Industrial Park site (RFIP) located in Jefferson County,
Colorado. The RFIP site also includes the American Ecological Recycling and Research
Company (AERRCO) site and a site owned by Thoro Products Company. Based upon sampling at
the site in 1996, the USEPA determined that additional site work would be required to
determine the extent of contamination and the possible cleanup of the site. The USEPA
requested the PRPs to perform certain site work in 1996. These discussions have been
ongoing. On December&nbsp;19, 1997, the USEPA issued an Administrative Order on Consent
(AOC) to conduct the engineering estimates and cost analyses. The AOC has been finalized.
The company has funded approximately $70,000 toward these costs. The PRPs have negotiated
an agreement and the company contributed $5,000 as an initial group contribution. The
company has agreed to pay 12&nbsp;percent of the costs of cleanup at the AERRCO site and a
percentage of the cleanup costs on the Thoro site. On January&nbsp;8, 2003, and
October&nbsp;9, 2003, the company made additional payments of $97,200 (total $194,400)
toward the cost of cleanup. Based on the information available to the company at the
present time, the company does not believe that this matter will have a material adverse
effect upon the liquidity, results of operations or financial condition of the company. </FONT></TD>

As
previously reported, in October 2001 representatives of Vauxmont Intermountain Communities
(Vauxmont) notified six of the PRPs at the AERRCO site, including the company, (AERRCO
PRPs) that hazardous materials might have contaminated property owned by Vauxmont. The
AERRCO site is contained within the Rocky Flats Industrial Park site. Vauxmont also
alleges that it lost $7&nbsp;million on a contract with a home developer for the purchase
of a portion of the land. Vauxmont representatives requested that the AERRCO PRPs study
any contamination to the Vauxmont real estate. The AERRCO PRPs agreed to undertake such a
study and sought the USEPA&#146;s final approval. The sampling results were made available
to all parties. No further claims have been made against the company by Vauxmont to date.

As
previously reported, the company was notified on June&nbsp;19, 1989, that the USEPA has
designated the company and numerous other companies as PRPs responsible for the cleanup of
certain hazardous wastes that were released at the Spectron, Inc., site located in Elkton,
Maryland. In December&nbsp;1989, the company, along with other companies whose alleged
hazardous waste contributions to the Spectron, Inc., site were considered to be <I>de
minimis</I>, entered into a settlement agreement with the USEPA for cleanup costs incurred
in connection with the removal action of aboveground site areas. By a letter dated
September&nbsp;29, 1995, the company, along with other above-described PRPs, were notified
by the USEPA that it was negotiating with the large-volume PRPs another consent order for
performance of a site environmental study as a prerequisite to long-term remediation. The
USEPA and the large-volume PRPs offered a second <I>de minimis </I>program buyout for
settlement of liability for remediation of the site, and the offer was made to certain
PRPs, including the company. On August&nbsp;10, 2001, the USEPA issued a General Notice
and Opportunity to Participate in <I>De Minimis</I> Settlement letter to the company and
over 1,000 other PRPs. The company signed the Global Consent Decree for <I>De Minimis </I>
Parties on September&nbsp;6, 2001, and returned it to the USEPA. Within 30 days of entry
of the Consent Decree, the company made payments of $66,737 to the USEPA and an additional
payment of $53,668 to the large volume PRPs. Jarden Corporation (formerly Alltrista
Corporation) agreed to reimburse the company for $116,311 of the $120,404 total payment.
The Consent Decree was finalized in U.S. District Court on November&nbsp;26, 2002. The
company made a payment of $66,737 to the USEPA and an additional payment of $53,668 to the
Spectron Site Group on April&nbsp;22, 2003. Jarden reimbursed the company for $116,311 of
the $120,404. This matter is now resolved with no material adverse effect upon the
liquidity, results of operations or financial condition of the company. </FONT></TD>

As
previously reported, during July 1992, the company received information that it had been
named a PRP with respect to the Solvents Recovery of New England Site (SRSNE) located in
Southington, Connecticut. According to the information received, it is alleged that the
company contributed approximately 0.08816 percent of the waste contributed to the site on
a volumetric basis. The PRP group has been involved in negotiations with the USEPA
regarding the remediation of the site. The company paid approximately $17,500 toward site
investigation and remediation efforts. The PRP group spent $15&nbsp;million through the
end of 2001. Approximately $1.5&nbsp;million more was spent to complete a Remedial
Investigation and Feasibility Study (RI/FS) and pay for remediation work through 2003. As
of December 2001, projected remediation cost estimates for a bioremediation and enhanced
oxidation system ranged from $20&nbsp;million to $30&nbsp;million. A <I>de minimis</I>
offer was expected to be prepared in 2001, but there will be no proposals made in the
foreseeable future. The PRP group offered a $5.5&nbsp;million settlement to resolve the
USEPA claim of $16&nbsp;million for past costs at the SRSNE site. PRP/USEPA negotiations
to resolve the past cost claims from the USEPA have not been resolved and are not being
actively pursued by the PRP group. A natural resources damage claim of approximately
$3&nbsp;million is anticipated. Based on the information, or lack thereof available to the
company at the present time, the company does not believe that this matter will have a
material adverse effect upon the liquidity, results of operations or financial condition
of the company. </FONT></TD>

The company previously reported that
on or about June&nbsp;14, 1990, the El Monte plant of Ball-InCon Glass Packaging Corp.
(renamed Ball Glass Container Corporation [Ball Glass] in 1994), a then wholly-owned
subsidiary of the company, the assets of which were contributed in September 1995 into a
joint venture with Compagnie de Saint-Gobain (Saint-Gobain), now known as Saint-Gobain
Industries, Inc., and currently wholly owned by Saint-Gobain, received a general
notification letter and information request from the USEPA, Region IX, notifying Ball
Glass that it may have a potential liability as defined in Section 107(a) of the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) with respect
to the San&nbsp;Gabriel Valley areas 1-4 Superfund Sites located in Los Angeles County,
California. The USEPA requested certain information from Ball Glass, and Ball Glass
responded. A PRP group organized and drafted a PRP group agreement, which Ball Glass
executed. The PRP group completed negotiations with the USEPA over the terms of the
administrative order on consent (RI/FS AOC), including the statement of work for the
remedial investigation phase of the cleanup. An interim allocation arrangement was
negotiated by the PRP group members to fund the remedial investigation. The interim
allocation approach requires that any payment will be based upon contribution to
pollution. The RI/FS AOC was executed by the PRP group and the USEPA. The USEPA thereby
accepted the statement of work for the remedial investigation phase of the cleanup. The
PRP group retained an environmental engineering consulting firm to perform the remedial
investigation. The USEPA then approved the work plan, project management plan, and the
data management plan portions of the PRP group&#146;s proposed RI/FS. The PRP group funded
the RI/FS. The PRP group&#146;s environmental consulting firm then submitted its
Feasibility Study Technical Memorandum 1 to the USEPA concerning the site. Five potential
remedial action plans were identified in the study. USEPA finalized the Record of Decision
(ROD) and selected the most extensive and expensive remedy. The selected remedy is
extraction and treatment of the solvent contaminated groundwater in both the east
El&nbsp;Monte and west El&nbsp;Monte plumes, both deep and shallow aquifers. The PRP group
then commenced the final allocation process. The Allocation Committee was assigned such
task and undertook the development of the method for final allocation of costs among PRP
group members. The company has been involved with other <I>de&nbsp;minimis</I> members of
the PRP group to settle this matter. In August 2001, the <I>de&nbsp;minimis</I> members,
including the company, finalized their <I>de&nbsp;minimis</I> offer to the PRP group in
the amount $3.75&nbsp;million. In October&nbsp;2003 the <I>de&nbsp;minimis</I> members,
the three site work parties in the U.S. and the USEPA reached a final settlement for the
remediation of the El&nbsp;Monte operable unit including USEPA&#146;s approval of the
<I>de&nbsp;minimis </I>settlement. As a result, a second administrative order on consent
(Remedy AOC) governing the implementation and performance of the site remedial activity
was negotiated and finalized on October&nbsp;28, 2003. The company is recognized as a
&#147;contributing settling defendant&#148; (i.e., a cash-out party) and a member of the
<I>De&nbsp;Minimis </I>Group (DMG). DMG is obligated to pay $3.75&nbsp;million into a
settlement fund established by Gould Electronics Inc. Each DMG members receives a covenant
not to sue from the USEPA and the State of California and contribution protection from
matters addressed in the remedy AOC, including past response actions, past and future
response costs for the El Monte Operable Unite, future basin-wide response costs, east
side plume, west side plume remediation and all other work required by the ROD. Settling
parties do not anticipate any additional work being required by a final record of decision
although any such work would not be covered in the remedy AOC. The company&#146;s
allocated share of the DMG&#146;s $3.75&nbsp;million is $391,055. The Remedy AOC has been
filed with the U.S. District Court and entry of the Remedy AOC as a final order is
expected during 2004 following the expiration of a public comment period. Based on the
information, or lack thereof available to the company at the present time, the company is
unable to express an opinion as to the actual exposure of the company, however, the
company does not believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect upon the
liquidity, results of operations or financial condition of the company.

The company previously reported that
in 1998 various consumers filed toxic tort litigation in the Superior Court for Los
Angeles County (Trial Court) against various water companies operating in the
San&nbsp;Gabriel Valley Basin. Plaintiffs have also joined numerous companies, which are
alleged to be PRPs in the various operable units in the San Gabriel Valley Superfund Site.
The Trial Court consolidated the six separate lawsuits in the Northeast district
(Pasadena) and designated the case of <I>Adler, et al. v. Southern California Water
Company, et al.</I>, as the lead case. The water companies petitioned the Trial Court to
remove this action to the California Public Utilities Commission. The Trial Court agreed.
The plaintiffs appealed this decision to the California Court of Appeals. The Court of
Appeals held that the claims against the defendants that are not public utilities should
be litigated in the Trial Court. One non-regulated utility appealed this decision to the
California Supreme Court. Although the plaintiffs were permitted to add additional
defendants, the litigation, including the filing of answers by such joined parties, was
otherwise stayed pending the decision of the California Supreme Court as to whether the
California Public Utilities Commission had sole jurisdiction over these cases since some
of the defendants are regulated utilities. In late March&nbsp;1999, Ball-Foster Glass
Container Co., L.L.C. (now named Saint Gobain Containers, Inc.), the present owner of the
El Monte glass plant and an entity in which the company has no current ownership interest,
received a summons and amended complaint based on its ownership of the El Monte glass
plant. Ball-Foster Glass tendered the lawsuit to the company for defense and indemnity.
The company in turn tendered this lawsuit to its general liability carrier for defense and
indemnity. On February&nbsp;4, 2002, the California Supreme Court issued its written
opinion upholding the decision of the Court of Appeals ruling that the plaintiffs may
proceed with their toxic tort claims in the Trial Court against all defendants, including
the company, who are non-regulated utilities. A complex case management order was then
entered. Under the order, the cases were divided into three groups with the company being
named in only the <I>Adler</I> case. The plaintiffs were ordered to re-file their
complaints. Plaintiffs served the consolidated <I>Adler</I> group complaint on the
company, and the company filed its answer to the group complaint. At a hearing on
October&nbsp;21, 2002, the judge dismissed the punitive damage claims in the complaint.
The case management order also allows limited discovery by written interrogatories and
separate requests for production of documents. Similarly situated <I>de minimis</I>
industry defendants have formed a joint defense group and the company has joined the
group. During January and February&nbsp;2003, the company responded to discovery requests
by the plaintiffs. In a pretrial ruling on August&nbsp;12, 2003, the presiding trial judge
ruled that liability can only be established by showing a violation of regulatory drinking
water standards; thus, isolated incidents of elevated contaminate level will not
constitute violations for liability purposes. The plaintiffs have pursued interlocutory
appeals of this ruling. As a result, the presiding trial judge has yet to rule whether the
water purveyors actually violated the applicable standards. Lastly, the presiding trial
judge has ruled that selected representatives, the so-called &#147;bellwether
plaintiffs,&#148; may proceed to trial if violations of the applicable standards are found
by the presiding trial judge. The company&#146;s general liability insurer is defending
this action and is paying the cost of defense, including attorneys&#146; fees under
a reservation of rights. Based on the information, or lack thereof, available to the
company at the present time, the company is unable to express an opinion as to the actual
exposure for this matter; however, based on the information available to the company at
the present time, the company does not believe that this matter will have a material
adverse effect upon the liquidity, results of operations or financial condition of the
company.</FONT></TD>

On
December&nbsp;30, 2002, the company received a 104(e) letter from the USEPA pursuant to
CERCLA requesting answers to certain questions regarding the waste disposal practices of
the Heekin Can Company and the relationship between the company and the Heekin Can
Company. Region&nbsp;5 of the USEPA is involved in the cleanup of the Jackson Brothers
Paint Company site which consists of four, and possibly five, sites in and around Laurel,
Indiana. The Jackson Brothers Paint Company apparently disposed of drums of waste in the
1960s and 1970s. The USEPA has alleged that some of the waste that has been uncovered was
sent to the sites from the Cincinnati plant operated by the Heekin Can Company. The
Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) referred this matter to the USEPA
for removal of the drums and cleanup. At the present time there are an undetermined number
of drums at one or more of the sites that have been initially identified by the USEPA as
originating from the Heekin Can Company. The USEPA has sent 104(e) letters to seven other
potentially responsible parties including the Heekin Can Company. On January&nbsp;30,
2003, the company responded to the request for information pursuant to Section&nbsp;104(e)
of CERCLA. The USEPA has initially estimated cleanup costs to be between $4&nbsp;million
and $5&nbsp;million. Based on the information, or lack thereof, available to the company
at the present time, the company does not believe that this matter will have a material
adverse effect upon the liquidity, results of the operations or financial condition of the

Ball
Packaging Europe, together with other plaintiffs, is contesting the enactment of a
mandatory deposit for non-returnable containers based on the German Packaging Regulation
(Verpackungsverordnung) in federal and state administrative courts. The proceedings in the
administrative court in Hessen (Verwaltungsgericht Wiesbaden) and Brandenburg
(Verwaltungsgericht Potsdam) were discontinued on September&nbsp;24 and October&nbsp;30,
2002, respectively. The Administrative Court in Northrhine Westfalia (Verwaltungsgericht
D&ucirc;sseldorf) has rendered a positive judgment and confirmed that a duty to implement
a mandatory deposit fee as of January&nbsp;1, 2003, does not exist. According to that
court, a mandatory deposit fee to protect returnable containers is without legal basis in
the current legislation. Other administrative courts have not yet scheduled hearings. The
German administration has filed an appeal against the suspensive effect of the judgment of
the administrative court in Northrhine Westfalia to the Oberverwaltungsgericht
M&uuml;nster (Higher Administrative Court) and has filed an appeal on the merits of the
case to the Bundesverwaltungsgericht in Leipzig (Federal Administrative Court). On
November&nbsp;27, 2002, the Higher Administrative Court in M&uuml;nster decided to lift
the temporary legal protection. On January&nbsp;16, 2003, the Federal Administrative Court
in Leipzig decided that the plaintiffs did not have procedural standing in the
administrative court in Dusseldorf; therefore, it did not reach the issue of whether the
imposition of the mandatory deposit is a proper implementation of the current legislation.
A proceeding in the Bundesverfassungsgericht in Karlsruhe (Federal Constitutional Court)
is still pending; the date of the hearing has not yet been set. Based on the information,
or lack thereof available to the company at the present time, the company is unable to
express an opinion as to the actual exposure of the company, however, the company does not
believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity, results
of operations or financial condition of the company. </FONT></TD>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The company has made or implied
certain forward-looking statements in this annual report which are made as of the end of
the time frame covered by this report. These forward-looking statements represent the
company&#146;s goals and results could vary materially from those expressed or implied. From
time-to-time we also provide oral or written forward-looking statements in other materials
we release to the public. As time passes, the relevance and accuracy of forward-looking
statements may change. Some factors that could cause the company&#146;s actual results or
outcomes to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements
include, but are not limited to: fluctuation in customer and consumer growth and demand,
particularly during the months when the demand for metal beverage cans is heaviest;
product introductions; insufficient production capacity; overcapacity in foreign and
domestic metal and plastic container industry production facilities and its impact on
pricing and financial results; lack of productivity improvement or production cost
reductions; the weather; fruit, vegetable and fishing yields; power and natural resource
costs; difficulty in obtaining supplies and energy, such as gas and electric power;
shortages in and pricing of raw materials, particularly resin, steel and aluminum and the
ability or inability to include or pass on to customers changes in raw material costs;
changes in the pricing of the company&#146;s products and services; competition in pricing
and the possible decrease in, or loss of, sales resulting therefrom; loss of profitability
and plant closures; insufficient or reduced cash flow; transportation costs; the number
and timing of the purchases of the company&#146;s common shares; the ability to obtain
adequate credit resources for foreseeable financing requirements of the company&#146;s
businesses and to satisfy the resulting credit obligations; regulatory action or federal
and state legislation including mandated corporate governance and financial reporting
laws; the German mandatory deposit or other restrictive packaging legislation such as
recycling laws; increases in interest rates, particularly on floating rate debt of the
company; labor strikes; increases and trends in various employee benefits and labor costs,
including pension, medical and health care costs incurred in the countries in which Ball
has operations; rates of return projected and earned on assets and discount rates used to
measure future obligations and expenses of the company&#146;s defined benefit retirement
plans; boycotts; litigation; antitrust, intellectual property, consumer and other issues;
maintenance and capital expenditures; goodwill impairment; the effect of LIFO accounting
on earnings; changes in generally accepted accounting principles or their interpretation;
local economic conditions; the authorization, funding and availability of contracts for
the aerospace and technologies segment and the nature and continuation of those contracts
and related services provided thereunder; technical uncertainty and schedule of
performance associated with such segment contracts; international business and market
risks such as the devaluation of international currencies; pricing and ability or
inability to sell scrap associated with the production of metal and plastic containers;
the ability to invoice and collect accounts receivable related to such segment contracts
in the ordinary course of business; international business risks (including foreign
exchange rates) in the United States, Europe and particularly in developing countries such
as China and Brazil; foreign exchange rates of the U.S. dollar, the European euro, British
pound, Polish zloty, Hong Kong dollar, Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi and Brazilian
real; terrorist activity or war that disrupts the company&#146;s production, supply, or
pricing of raw materials used in the production of the company&#146;s goods and services,
including increased energy costs, and/or disrupts the ability of the company to obtain
adequate credit resources for the foreseeable financing requirements of the company&#146;s
businesses; and successful or unsuccessful acquisitions, joint ventures or divestitures
and the integration activities associated therewith, including the integration and
operation of the business of Ball Packaging Europe. If the company is unable to achieve
its goals, then the company&#146;s actual performance could vary materially from those
goals expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. The company currently does
not intend to publicly update forward-looking statements except as it deems necessary at
quarterly or annual earnings reports. You are advised, however, to consult any further
disclosures we make on related subjects in our 10-Q, 8-K and 10-K reports to the
Securities and Exchange Commission. </FONT></P>
