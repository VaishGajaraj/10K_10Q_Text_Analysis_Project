Item 1.    Business</b>

   Ball Corporation was organized in 1880 and incorporated in Indiana in 1922. Its principal executive offices are located at
   10 Longs Peak Drive, Broomfield, Colorado 80021-2510. The terms "Ball," "the company," "we" or "our" as used herein refer
   to Ball Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.

   Ball is a manufacturer of metal and plastic packaging, primarily for beverages and foods, and a supplier of aerospace and other
   technologies and services to commercial and governmental customers.

   The following sections of the 2002 Annual Report to Shareholders contain financial and other information concerning company
   business developments and operations, and are incorporated herein by reference:  the notes to the consolidated financial
   statements including "Business Segment Information" (Note 2), "Acquisitions" (Note 3), "Business Consolidation Costs and Other"
   (Note 4) and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."

                                               <b>Business Developments in 2002 and Early 2003</b>

   <u>Acquisitions</u>

   On December 19, 2002, Ball acquired 100 percent of the outstanding shares of Schmalbach-Lubeca GmbH (a European beverage can
   manufacturer) for an initial cash purchase price of(euro)922.3 million (approximately $948 million), plus acquisition costs of
   $11.6 million, refinancing costs of $28.1 million and the assumption of approximately $20 million of debt and $11 million of
   unencumbered cash. In addition, the company assumed approximately $300 million of unfunded pension liabilities. The final
   acquisition price will be reduced by working capital and other adjustments estimated to be $23.9 million. With this acquisition,
   now known as Ball Packaging Europe, we became one of the world's largest manufacturers of metal beverage cans with the ability
   to produce over 45 billion cans annually, and we gained entry into the European market, of which Ball Packaging Europe's share
   was approximately 31 percent in 2002. In addition, we believe that in the first year of combined operations, the acquisition
   will be accretive to our earnings per share and provide us returns on our capital invested in excess of our weighted average
   cost of capital. On a pro forma basis, the acquisition significantly increases our 2002 sales from $3.8 billion to $4.9 billion.

   In connection with the acquisition, we refinanced the company and, as a result, recorded an after-tax extraordinary charge from
   the early extinguishment of debt of $3.2 million (6 cents per diluted share). The refinancing, including related costs, was
   completed with the placement of $300 million in 6.875% senior notes due 2012 and $1.1 billion from borrowings under new
   long-term multi-currency senior credit facilities.

   On March 11, 2003, we acquired Metal Packaging International, Inc. (MPI), a manufacturer of aluminum beverage can ends for
   $30.2 million in cash, subject to working capital and other adjustments. MPI produces just over 2 billion ends per year,
   primarily for soft drink companies, and had sales of approximately $42 million in 2002. MPI's plant, which is located in
   Northglenn, Colorado, will be closed and the volumes will be consolidated into other Ball facilities. The acquisition is not
   significant to the North American packaging segment's financial statements.

   <u>Other</u>

   On February 25, 2003, the company announced it will close its Blytheville, Arkansas, metal food container plant to address
   decreased demand for three-piece welded cans. The plant will be closed in the second quarter of 2003 and its operations will
   be consolidated into the Springdale, Arkansas, plant. The business consolidation will result in a charge of approximately
   $2.1 million ($1.3 million after tax) including $0.7 million of employee severance and benefit costs and $1.4 million related
   to decommissioning costs and an impairment charge on the fixed assets. These actions are not expected to have a significant
   impact on ongoing financial results.

   In December 2002 Ball announced it would relocate its plastics office and research and development facility from Atlanta,
   Georgia, to Colorado. In connection with the relocation, we recorded a pretax charge in 2002 of $1.6 million ($1 million after
   tax) for employee-related and decommissioning costs and impairment of the leasehold improvements related to a leased facility.
   The office relocation is expected to be completed in 2003 and the R&amp;D facility by the end of 2004.

                                          <b>Information Pertaining to the Business of the Company</b>

   The company's businesses are comprised of three segments:  (1) North American packaging, (2) international packaging and (3)
   aerospace and technologies.

   <b>North American Packaging</b>

   Our principal business in North America is the manufacture and sale of aluminum, steel and PET containers, primarily for
   beverages and foods. This segment comprised 84 percent of Ball's 2002 consolidated net sales. However, this percentage will
   decrease to approximately 65 percent in 2003 due to the addition of Ball Packaging Europe, which is included in our
   international packaging segment.

   A substantial part of our North American packaging sales are made directly to relatively few major companies in packaged
   beverage and food businesses, including Miller Brewing Company and bottlers of Pepsi-Cola and Coca-Cola branded beverages
   and their licensees that utilize consolidated purchasing groups. Sales of aluminum cans and PET containers to Miller Brewing
   Company, PepsiCo, Inc., and the Coca-Cola Company represented approximately 15 percent, 13 percent and 8 percent of Ball's
   consolidated net sales, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2002. Additional details about our sales to our major
   customers are included in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, which can be found in Exhibit 13.1 to this Form 10-K.

   Packaging products are sold in highly competitive markets, primarily based on quality, service and price. The packaging business
   is capital intensive, requiring significant investments in machinery and equipment. Profitability is sensitive to selling prices,
   production volumes, labor and the availability of certain raw materials, such as aluminum, steel and plastic resin. These raw
   materials are generally available from several sources and we have secured what we consider to be adequate supplies and are
   therefore not experiencing any shortages. We believe we have minimal, if any, exposure related to changes in the costs of
   aluminum, steel and plastic resin as a result of (1) the inclusion of provisions in aluminum container sales contracts to pass
   through aluminum cost changes, as well as the use of derivative instruments, (2) steel can sales contracts that incorporate
   annually negotiated metal costs and (3) the inclusion of provisions in plastic container sales contracts to pass through resin
   cost changes.

   Our manufacturing facilities are dependent, in varying degrees, upon the availability of process energy, such as natural gas and
   electricity. While certain of these energy sources may become increasingly in short supply or halted due to external factors, we
   cannot predict the effects, if any, of such occurrences on future operations.

   Research and development efforts in this segment generally seek to improve manufacturing efficiencies and lower unit costs,
   principally raw material costs, by reducing the material content of containers while improving or maintaining other physical
   properties such as material strength. In addition, research and development efforts are directed toward the development of new
   sizes and types of metal and plastic beverage and food containers, as well as new uses for the current containers.

   <u>North American Metal Beverage Containers</u>

   Metal beverage containers and ends represent Ball's largest product line, accounting for approximately 70 percent of segment net
   sales and 58 percent of consolidated net sales in 2002. Since 1998 we have been the largest beverage can producer in North
   America. Decorated two-piece aluminum beverage cans are produced at 17 manufacturing facilities in the U.S., one facility in
   Canada and one in Puerto Rico; ends are produced within five of these U.S. facilities. The annual production capacity of these
   plants is currently approximately 33 billion cans. Metal beverage containers are sold primarily to fillers of carbonated soft
   drinks, beer and other beverages under long-term or annual supply contracts. Sales volumes of metal beverage cans and ends in
   North America tend to be highest during the period from April through September.

   Through Rocky Mountain Metal Container, LLC, a 50/50 joint venture, which is accounted for as an equity investment, Ball and
   Coors Brewing Company (Coors) operate Coors' can and end facilities in Golden, Colorado. The joint venture supplies Coors with
   approximately 3.6 billion beverage cans and ends annually for its Golden, Colorado, and Memphis, Tennessee, breweries under
   agreements which commenced in January 2002. Ball receives management fees and technology licensing fees under this agreement.
   In addition to beverage cans supplied to Coors from the joint venture, substantially all of Coors' can requirements for its
   Shenandoah, Virginia, filling location are manufactured at Ball facilities and sold to Coors.

   In mid-December 2001 we ceased production at the Moultrie, Georgia, beverage can plant. Its production of one billion cans per
   year was consolidated into other Ball plants.

   Based on publicly available industry information, we estimate that our North American metal beverage container shipments were
   approximately 31 percent of total U.S. and Canadian shipments for metal beverage containers. We also estimate that four producers
   represent substantially all of the remaining metal beverage container shipments. Available industry information indicates the
   growth in industry-wide shipments was relatively flat over the past several years.

   Beverage container industry production capacity in the U.S. and Canada exceeds demand. In order to balance more closely
   capacity and demand within our business, we have consolidated our can and end manufacturing capacity into fewer, more
   efficient facilities with the closure of five plants during 1999, 2000 and 2001.

   The aluminum beverage can continues to compete aggressively with other packaging materials in the beer and soft drink industries.
   The glass bottle has shown resilience in the packaged beer industry, while soft drink industry use of the PET bottle has grown.
   The beer industry also has begun the usage of plastic beer bottles. In Canada, metal beverage containers have captured
   significantly lower percentages of the packaged beverage industry than in the U.S., particularly in the packaged beer industry,
   in which the market share of metal containers has been hindered by non-tariff trade barriers and restrictive taxes within Canada.

   Ball also participates in joint ventures in Thailand and Taiwan, in addition to providing manufacturing technology and
   assistance to several can manufacturers around the world.  In addition to Ball's joint ventures, current licensees of
   technology include Fabricas Monterrey, SA de CV, and Amcor Ltd., among others.

   <u>North American Metal Food Containers</u>

   In addition to metal beverage cans, Ball produces two-piece and three-piece steel food cans for packaging vegetables, fruit,
   soups, meat and other foods. These steel food containers are manufactured in the U.S. and Canada and sold primarily to food
   processors in North America. In 2002 metal food container sales comprised approximately 19 percent of North American packaging
   segment net sales. Sales volumes of metal food containers in North America tend to be highest from June through October as a
   result of seasonal vegetable and salmon packs. Approximately 33 billion steel food cans were shipped in the U.S. and Canada in
   2002, of which we estimate approximately 16 percent were shipped by Ball.

   Since the second quarter of 2000, Ball and ConAgra Grocery Products Company (ConAgra) have participated in a joint venture food
   can manufacturing company, Ball Western Can Company (Ball Western). Ball receives management fees and accounts for the results
   of its 50 percent-owned investment under the equity method. On December 30, 2002, ConAgra notified Ball of its desire to
   terminate and dissolve the Ball Western joint venture effective January 1, 2004. Ball and ConAgra are engaged in ongoing
   discussions to evaluate various options.

   We recently signed a multi-year contract with Abbott Laboratories' Ross Products Division (Ross), the makers of a broad range
   of infant formulas and food supplements. Ross will exit a portion of its self-manufacturing operations in early 2003. To
   accommodate this new business and convert some of our existing three-piece food can customers to two-piece cans, we are adding
   a new two-piece steel food can line in our Milwaukee beverage can plant capable of producing approximately 1.2 billion cans per
   year, as well as a new 225,000-square-foot warehouse addition.

   Ball has two main competitors in the metal food containers business. The steel food can also competes with other packaging
   materials in the food industry including glass, aluminum, plastic, paper and the stand-up pouch. As a result, this product line
   must increasingly focus on product innovation. Service, quality and price are deciding competitive factors.

   <u>North American Plastic Containers</u>

   To capitalize on existing customer relationships, Ball entered the polyethylene terephthalate (PET) container business in 1995.
   PET packaging represented approximately 11 percent of packaging segment net sales in 2002. Demand for containers made of PET has
   increased in the beverage packaging industry and is expected to increase in the food packaging industry with improved technology
   and adequate supplies of resin. While PET beverage containers compete against metal, glass and cardboard, the historical
   increase in the sales of PET containers has come primarily at the expense of glass containers and through new market
   introductions. The latest publicly available projections indicate that the growth in overall PET demand in North America over
   the next two years is expected to be between 7 and 8 percent. Based on research estimates from various sources, we believe
   Ball's share of the total U.S. and Canadian shipments is between 8 and 12 percent.

   On December 28, 2001, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Wis-Pak Plastics, Inc. and entered into a long-term
   agreement to supply 100 percent of Wis-Pak's PET container requirements, which are currently 550 million containers annually.
   We closed one of the acquired plants in Iowa during 2002; the after-tax cash costs associated with this closure were
   approximately $1 million and were substantially paid by the end of 2002.

   In addition to a Wisconsin facility that Ball acquired from Wis-Pak, the company operates four PET facilities that it built in
   California, Iowa, New Jersey and New York. Four new plastic bottle blow-molding productions lines were added to three of our
   facilities throughout 2002.

   Competition in the PET container industry includes several national and regional suppliers and self-manufacturers. Service,
   quality and price are deciding competitive factors. Increasingly, the ability to produce customized, differentiated plastic
   containers is an important competitive factor.

   Most of Ball's PET containers are sold under long-term contracts to suppliers of bottled water and carbonated soft drinks,
   including Pepsi-Cola and Coca-Cola. Plastic beer containers are being tested by several of our customers and we are developing
   plastic containers for the single serve juice market.

   <b>International Packaging</b>

   <u>Europe</u>

   Ball Packaging Europe and its operations consist of 10 beverage can plants and two beverage can end plants, a technical center
   in Bonn, Germany, and the European headquarters in Ratingen, Germany. Of the 12 plants, four are located in Germany, four in
   the United Kingdom, two in France and one each in the Netherlands and Poland. In total the newly acquired plants produce
   approximately 12 billion cans annually, with 60 percent being produced from steel and 40 percent from aluminum. Five of the
   can plants use steel only, three use aluminum and two plants use both metals.

   Ball Packaging Europe's metal beverage container business is the second largest in Europe, with an estimated 2002 market share
   of 31 percent, and produces two-piece beverage cans and can ends for beer, carbonated soft drinks, mineral water, fruit juices,
   isotonics, milk-based beverages, coffee drinks and alcoholic mixed drinks. In Western Europe, Ball Packaging Europe is the top
   beverage container manufacturer in Germany, France and the Benelux countries and the second largest beverage container
   manufacturer in the United Kingdom. In addition, it has contributed to the development of the Eastern European beverage market
   and has an estimated 50 percent market share in Poland.

   As in North America, the metal beverage can continues to compete aggressively with other packaging materials in the European
   beer and soft drink industries. The glass bottle is utilized in the packaged beer industry, while soft drink industry use of
   the PET bottle has grown.

   The European beverage can business has a relatively balanced and stable customer base with 10 customers accounting for
   approximately 55 percent of its gross trade sales and 20 customers accounting for approximately 70 percent of such sales.
   Ball Packaging Europe's major customers include Coca-Cola, Britvic (Pepsi-Cola), Coors, Heineken, Interbrew and South
   African Breweries.

   Our operations in Germany are subject to packaging legislation that exempts one-way containers from a mandatory deposit fee as
   long as returnable containers maintain at least a 72 percent market share. After the market share dropped below this mandated
   level, regulators imposed a mandatory deposit fee on cans and other non-refillable containers effective January 1, 2003,
   although an effective container return system is not expected to be in place until October 2003, at the earliest. It is too
   soon to determine the long-term impact the deposit fee will have on sales in Germany, but in the interim, we have temporarily
   reduced production at our German plants in response to lower demand.

   The European packaging business is capital intensive, requiring significant investments in machinery and equipment.
   Profitability is sensitive to selling prices, foreign exchange rates, production volumes, labor and the costs and availability
   of certain raw materials, such as aluminum and steel. The European market for steel and aluminum supply is highly consolidated
   with three steel suppliers and four aluminum suppliers providing 95 percent of European demand. Material supply contracts are
   generally for a period of one year, although Ball Packaging Europe has negotiated some longer agreements. Aluminum is purchased
   primarily in U.S. dollars while the functional currencies of Ball Packaging Europe and its subsidiaries are non-U.S. dollars.
   This inherently results in a foreign exchange rate risk, which the company minimizes through the use of hedging contracts.

   <u>Other International</u>

   Through Ball Asia Pacific Holdings Limited, we are the largest beverage can manufacturer in the People's Republic of China (PRC)
   and believe that our facilities are the most modern in that country. Capacity has grown rapidly in the PRC, resulting in a
   supply/demand imbalance. We undertook a review of our options there and, as a result, have closed several facilities during the
   past several years. The Beijing manufacturing facility is one of the most technologically advanced plants in the PRC and the
   company's 34 percent-owned affiliate, Sanshui Jianlibao FTB Packaging Limited, is the largest can manufacturing facility in the
   PRC in terms of production capacity.

   We are also a 50 percent equity owner of a joint venture in Brazil that produces approximately 2 billion two-piece aluminum cans
   and ends and holds an estimated 15 percent market share.

   For more information on Ball's international operations, see Item 2, Properties, and Exhibit 21.1, Subsidiary List.

   <b>Aerospace and Technologies</b>

   The aerospace and technologies segment includes defense systems, civil space systems and commercial space operations.  The
   defense operations business unit includes defense systems, systems engineering services, advanced antenna and video systems and
   electro-optics and cryogenic systems and components. Sales in the aerospace and technologies segment accounted for approximately
   13 percent of consolidated net sales in 2002.

   The majority of the aerospace and technologies segment business involves work under contracts, generally from one to five years
   in duration, for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and other U.S.
   government agencies and for foreign governments. Contracts funded by the various agencies of the federal government represented
   approximately 96 percent of segment sales in 2002. Geopolitical events and executive and legislative branch priorities have
   created considerable growth opportunities in our core competencies. However, consolidation in the aerospace and defense
   industries continues, and there is strong competition for business.

   Civil space systems, defense systems and commercial space operations include hardware, software and services to both U.S. and
   international customers, with emphases on space science, environmental and Earth sciences, defense and intelligence, manned
   missions and space exploration.  Major contractual activities frequently involve the design, manufacture and testing of
   satellites, ground systems and payloads (including launch vehicle integration), as well as satellite ground station control
   hardware and software. The company also produces navigation and cryogenic equipment that is standard equipment on every space
   shuttle mission. At this time, the company anticipates minimal effect on its results from the loss of the space shuttle Columbia
   on February 1, 2003.

   Other hardware activities include:  target identification, warning and attitude control systems and components; cryogenic
   systems for reactant storage, and sensor cooling devices using either closed-cycle mechanical refrigerators or open-cycle
   solid and liquid cryogens; star trackers, which are general-purpose stellar attitude sensors; and fast-steering mirrors.

   Additionally, the aerospace and technologies segment provides diversified technical services and products to federal and local
   government agencies, prime contractors and commercial organizations for a broad range of information warfare, electronic warfare,
   avionics, intelligence, training and space systems needs.

   Backlog of the aerospace and technologies segment was approximately $497 million and $431 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001,
   respectively, and consists of the aggregate contract value of firm orders, excluding amounts previously recognized as revenue.
   The 2002 backlog includes approximately $329 million expected to be billed during 2003, with the remainder expected to be billed
   thereafter. Unfunded amounts included in backlog for certain firm government orders which are subject to annual funding were
   approximately $334 million at December 31, 2002. Year-to-year comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of the trend
   of future operations.

   The company's aerospace and technologies segment has contracts with the U.S. government or its contractors which have standard

                                                                 <b>Patents</b>

   In the opinion of the company, none of its active patents is essential to the successful operation of its business as a whole.

                                                          <b>Research and Development</b>

   Note 17, "Research and Development," in the 2002 Annual Report to Shareholders contains information on company research and
   development activity and is incorporated herein by reference.

                                                               <b>Environment</b>

   Aluminum, steel and PET containers are recyclable, and significant amounts of used containers are being recycled and diverted
   from the solid waste stream. Using the most recent data available, in 2001 approximately 55 percent of aluminum containers,
   58 percent of steel cans and 22 percent of the PET containers sold in the U.S. were recycled.

   Recycling rates vary throughout Europe, but generally are comparable with rates for similar packaging materials in North America.
   Some of the highest rates are in Germany where both aluminum and steel cans were recycled at rates estimated to be at least
   80 percent prior to the imposition of mandatory deposits on one-way packaging effective January 1, 2003.

   Compliance with federal, state and local laws relating to protection of the environment has not had a material, adverse effect
   upon capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position of the company. As more fully described under Item 3, Legal
   Proceedings, the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency and various state environmental agencies have designated the company
   as a potentially responsible party, along with numerous other companies, for the cleanup of several hazardous waste sites.
   However, the company's information at this time does not indicate that these matters will have a material, adverse effect
   upon the liquidity, results of operations or financial condition of the company.

   Legislation which would prohibit, tax or restrict the sale or use of certain types of containers, and would require diversion
   of solid wastes such as packaging materials from disposal in landfills, has been or may be introduced in the U.S., Canada Europe
   and Asia. While container legislation has been adopted in a few jurisdictions, similar legislation has been defeated in public
   referenda in several others. The company anticipates that continuing efforts will be made to consider and adopt such legislation
   in many jurisdictions in the future. If such legislation was widely adopted, it could have a material adverse effect on the
   business of the company, as well as on the container manufacturing industry generally, in view of the company's substantial
   global sales and investment in metal and PET container manufacture.

                                                                <b>Employees</b>

   At the end of February 2003 the company employed approximately 12,500 people worldwide, including approximately 8,300 employees
   in the United States and 4,200 in other countries. Approximately 20 percent of the North American employees were unionized and
   approximately 90 percent of the European employees were unionized.

<b>Item 3.    Legal Proceedings</b>

<u>North America</u>

As previously reported, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) considers the company a Potentially Responsible Party (PRP)
with respect to the Lowry Landfill site located east of Denver, Colorado. On June 12, 1992, the company was served with a lawsuit
filed by the City and County of Denver (Denver) and Waste Management of Colorado, Inc., seeking contribution from the company and
approximately 38 other companies. The company filed its answer denying the allegations of the Complaint. On July 8, 1992, the
company was served with a third-party complaint filed by S.W. Shattuck Chemical Company, Inc., seeking contribution from the
company and other companies for the costs associated with cleaning up the Lowry Landfill. The company denied the allegations
of the complaint.

In July 1992 the company entered into a settlement and indemnification agreement with Denver, Chemical Waste Management, Inc.,
and Waste Management of Colorado, Inc. (collectively Waste) pursuant to which Denver and Waste dismissed their lawsuit against
the company and Waste agreed to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the company from claims and lawsuits brought by governmental
agencies and other parties relating to actions seeking contributions or remedial costs from the company for the cleanup of the
site. Several other companies, which are defendants in the above-referenced lawsuits, had already entered into the settlement
and indemnification agreement with Denver and Waste. Waste Management, Inc., has agreed to guarantee the obligations for Chemical
Waste Management, Inc., and Waste Management of Colorado, Inc. Denver and Waste may seek additional payments from the company if
the response costs related to the site exceed $319 million. The company might also be responsible for payments (calculated in 1992
dollars) for any additional wastes which may have been disposed of by the company at the site but which are identified after the
execution of the settlement agreement.

At this time, there are no Lowry Landfill actions in which the company is actively involved. Based on the information available to
the company at this time, the company does not believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity,
results of operations or financial condition of the company.

The company previously reported that on August 1, 1997, the EPA sent notice of potential liability to 19 PRPs concerning past
activities at one or more of the four Rocky Flats parcels (including land owned by Precision Chemicals now owned by Great Western
Inorganics) at the Rocky Flats Industrial Park site (RFIP) located in Jefferson County, Colorado. The RFIP site also includes the
AERRCO site and a site owned by Thoro Products Company. Based upon sampling at the site in 1996, the EPA determined that additional
site work would be required to determine the extent of contamination and the possible cleanup of the site. The EPA requested the
PRPs to perform certain site work in 1996. These discussions have been ongoing. On December 19, 1997, the EPA issued an
Administrative Order on Consent (AOC) to conduct the engineering estimates and cost analyses. The AOC has been finalized. The
company has funded approximately $70,000 toward these costs. The PRPs have negotiated an agreement and the company contributed
$5,000 as an initial group contribution. The company has agreed to pay 12 percent of the costs of cleanup at the AERRCO site and
a percentage of the cleanup costs on the Thoro site. On January 8, 2003, the company made an additional payment of $97,200 toward
the cost of cleanup. Based on the information available to the company at the present time, the company does not believe that this
matter will have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity, results of operations or financial condition of the company.

As previously reported, in October 2001 representatives of Vauxmont Intermountain Communities notified six of the PRPs at the
AERRCO site, including the company, (AERRCO PRPs) that hazardous materials might have contaminated property owned by Vauxmont.
The AERRCO site is contained within the Rocky Flats Industrial Park site. Vauxmont also alleges that it lost $7 million on a
contract with a home developer for the purchase of a portion of the land. Vauxmont representatives requested that the AERRCO
PRPs study any contamination to the Vauxmont real estate. The AERRCO PRPs agreed to undertake such a study and sought the EPA's
final approval. Based on the information, or lack thereof available to the company at the present time, the company does not
believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity, results of operations or financial condition
of the company.

As previously reported, the company was notified on June 19, 1989, that the EPA has designated the company and numerous other
companies as PRPs responsible for the cleanup of certain hazardous wastes that were released at the Spectron, Inc., site located
in Elkton, Maryland. In December 1989, the company, along with other companies whose alleged hazardous waste contributions to the
Spectron, Inc., site were considered to be de minimis, entered into a settlement agreement with the EPA for cleanup costs incurred
in connection with the removal action of aboveground site areas. By a letter dated September 29, 1995, the company, along with
other above-described PRPs, were notified by the EPA that it was negotiating with the large-volume PRPs another consent order for
performance of a site environmental study as a prerequisite to long-term remediation. The EPA and the large-volume PRPs offered a
second de minimis program buyout for settlement of liability for remediation of the site, and the offer was made to certain PRPs,
including the company. On August 10, 2001, the EPA issued a General Notice and Opportunity to Participate in De Minimis Settlement
letter to the company and over 1,000 other PRP's. The company signed the Global Consent Decree for De Minimis Parties on
September 6, 2001, and returned it to the EPA. Within 30 days of entry of the Consent Decree, the company will make one payment
of $66,737 to the EPA and an additional payment of $53,668 to the large volume PRPs. Alltrista Corporation has agreed to reimburse
the company for $116,311 of the $120,404 total payment. Once the Consent Decree is final, the company's and Alltrista Corporation's
liability at the site will be resolved. The Consent Decree is finalized and expected to be entered in 2003. Based upon the
information available to the company at the present time, the company does not believe that this matter will have a material
adverse effect upon the liquidity, results of operations or financial condition of the company.

As previously reported, during July 1992, the company received information that it had been named a PRP with respect to the
Solvents Recovery of New England Site (SRSNE) located in Southington, Connecticut. According to the information received, it is
alleged that the company contributed approximately 0.08816 percent of the waste contributed to the site on a volumetric basis.
The PRP group has been involved in negotiations with the EPA regarding the remediation of the site. The company has paid
approximately $17,500 toward site investigation and remediation efforts. The PRP group has spent $15 million through the end
of 2001. Approximately $1.5 million more will be spent to complete a remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS) and pay for
remediation work through 2003. As of December 2001, projected remediation cost estimates for a bioremediation and enhanced
oxidation system ranged from $20 million to $30 million. A de minimis offer was expected to be prepared in 2001, but there will
be no proposals made in the foreseeable future. The PRP group offered a $5.5 million settlement to resolve the EPA claim of
$16 million for past costs at the SRSNE site. PRP/EPA negotiations to resolve the past cost claims from the EPA have not been
resolved and are not being actively pursued by the PRP group. A natural resources damage claim of approximately $3 million is
anticipated. The company paid $1,230 in 2002 toward site assessments. Based on the information, or lack thereof available to the
company at the present time, the company does not believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity,
results of operations or financial condition of the company.

The EPA has also sought recovery for the Angelillo site which is related to the SRSNE site. Contaminated soil and empty drums were
transferred from the SRSNE Site to the Angelillo site and removed by the EPA's contractor in 1996 and 1997. The EPA informed the
PRP group in March 2000 of their intention to seek recovery of approximately $1,155,000 for work the EPA conducted at the Angelillo
site. The company signed a Tolling Agreement with the EPA on April 20, 2000, regarding the Angelillo site. The PRP group and the
EPA reached agreement on past EPA site costs for Angelillo. The company signed the Agreement for Recovery of Past Response Costs
on March 20, 2001. The PRP and the EPA finalized a settlement of the past site costs. The PRP group paid $626,000 to the EPA on
behalf of the PRP group. The company paid $885 on May 15, 2001, and $1,139 on December 5, 2001, for group assessments. This matter
is now resolved with no material adverse effect upon the liquidity, results of operations or financial condition of the company.

The company previously reported that on or about June 14, 1990, the El Monte plant of Ball-InCon Glass Packaging Corp., a then
wholly-owned subsidiary of the company (renamed Ball Glass Container Corporation [Ball Glass]), the assets of which were
contributed in September 1995 into a joint venture with Compagnie de Saint-Gobain (Saint-Gobain), now known as Saint-Gobain
Industries, Inc., and currently wholly owned by Saint-Gobain, received a general notification letter and information request
from the EPA, Region IX, notifying Ball Glass that it may have a potential liability as defined in Section 107(a) of the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) with respect to the San Gabriel Valley areas 1-4
Superfund Sites located in Los Angeles County, California. The EPA requested certain information from Ball Glass, and Ball Glass
responded. A PRP group organized and drafted a PRP group agreement, which Ball Glass executed. The PRP group completed negotiations
with the EPA over the terms of the administrative consent order, statement of work for the remedial investigation phase of the
cleanup, and the interim allocation arrangement between PRP group members to fund the remedial investigation. The interim
allocation approach requires that any payment will be based upon contribution to pollution. An AOC was executed by the PRP group
and the EPA. The EPA also accepted the statement of work for the remedial investigation phase of the cleanup. The PRP group
retained an environmental engineering consulting firm to perform the remedial investigation. As required under the AOC, the group
submitted to the EPA copies of all environmental studies conducted at the plant, the majority of which had already been furnished
to the State of California. The EPA then approved the work plan, project management plan, and the data management plan portions
of the PRP group's proposed RI/FS. The PRP group funded the RI/FS. The PRP group's environmental consulting firm then submitted
its Feasibility Study Technical Memorandum 1 to the USEPA concerning the site. Five potential remedial action plans were identified
in the study. USEPA finalized the Record of Decision ("ROD") and selected the most extensive and expensive remedy. The selected
remedy is extraction and treatment of the solvent contaminated groundwater in both the east El Monte and west El Monte plumes, both
deep and shallow aquifers. The PRP group then commenced the final allocation process.  The Allocation Committee was assigned such
task and undertook the development of the method for final allocation of costs among PRP group members. Although final allocation
has not been made, the Allocation Committee will, if necessary, allocate costs so that PRP group members responsible for the
majority of the contamination will pay a higher percentage of the cleanup costs required by the ROD. As a result of such allocation
method for final remediation costs Ball Glass performed additional soil vapor analysis testing to compliment its soil and
groundwater sampling analyses previously conducted.  In a significant positive development, the results of all 44-vapor probe
locations were non-detect for constituents of concern sampled (i.e., those pollutants present in the area groundwater). On
November 11, 1999, Ball Glass informed the PRP group of these results, which should reduce Ball Glass' final cost allocation under
such allocation method. Related to remediation costs, the San Gabriel Basin Water Quality Authority ("WQA") committed to fund
$500,000 as an early response action program ("ERAP"); and as a result, the PRP group implemented a shallow aquifer groundwater
treatment program under ERAP (in order to obtain such matching public grant funds), using group funds to install three west plume
shallow aquifer groundwater remediation wells.  Regarding the anticipated implementation of the final remedy, negotiations continue
with area water providers who may pump and treat deep aquifer groundwater from the east and west plumes. If negotiations are
successful the PRP group members may only be responsible for remediation of shallow aquifers on the east and west sides of the
operable unit. The company has also been involved with other de minimis members of the PRP group to settle this matter. In
August 2001, the de minimis members, including the company, finalized their de minimis offer to the PRP group. The amount of the
offer is $3.75 million with the company's share being $391,000 (10%). Also, the company and the other de minimis' PRPs reached a
tentative buy-out settlement with Gould Industries and the other large PRPs who will be site work parties. The work parties have
submitted to USEPA and subsequently withdrawn a good-faith offer to conduct the final site remedial work. Site investigation work
continues. In addition, the company's general liability insurer is defending this governmental action and is paying the cost of
defense, including attorneys' fees under a reservation of rights. Based on the information, or lack thereof available to the
company at the present time, the company is unable to express an opinion as to the actual exposure of the company, however the
company does not believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity, results of operations or
financial condition of the company.

The company previously reported that in 1998 various consumers filed toxic tort litigation in the Superior Court for Los Angeles
County (Trial Court) against various water companies operating in the San Gabriel Valley Basin. The water companies petitioned the
Trial Court to remove this action to the California Public Utilities Commission. The Trial Court agreed. The plaintiffs appealed
this decision to the California Court of Appeals, which reversed the Trial Court. One non-regulated utility appealed this decision
to the California Supreme Court. Pending completion of the appellate process, the Trial Court stayed further action in this
litigation except that the plaintiffs were permitted to add additional defendants. Plaintiffs have joined numerous companies,
which are alleged to be PRPs in the various operable units in the San Gabriel Valley Superfund Site. The Trial Court consolidated
the six separate lawsuits in the Northeast District (Pasadena) and designated the case of Adler, et al. v. Southern California
Water Company, et al., as the lead case. In late March 1999, Ball-Foster Glass Container Co., L.L.C. (now named Saint Gobain
Containers, Inc.), the present owner of the El Monte glass plant and an entity in which the company has no current ownership
interest, received a summons and amended complaint based on its ownership of the El Monte glass plant. Ball-Foster Glass tendered
the lawsuit to the company for defense and indemnity. The company in turn tendered this lawsuit to its general liability carrier
for defense and indemnity. The litigation, including the filing of answers by such joined parties, was stayed pending the decision
of the California Supreme Court as to whether the California Public Utilities Commission had sole jurisdiction over these cases
since some of the defendants are regulated utilities. On February 4, 2002, the California Supreme Court issued its written opinion
upholding the decision of the Court of Appeals ruling that the plaintiffs may proceed with their toxic tort claims in the Trial
Court against all defendants, including the company, who are non-regulated utilities. A complex case management order has been
entered. Under the order, the cases were divided into three groups with the company being named in only the Adler case. The
plaintiffs were ordered to re-file their complaints. Plaintiffs served the consolidated Adler group complaint on the company,
and the company filed its answer to the group complaint. At a hearing on October 21, 2002, the judge dismissed the punitive damage
claims in the complaint. The case management order also allows limited discovery by written interrogatories and separate requests
for production of documents. Similarly situated de minimis industry defendants have formed a joint defense group and the company
has joined the group. During January and February 2003, the company responded to discovery requests by the plaintiffs. The
company's general liability insurer is defending this action and is paying the cost of defense, including attorneys' fees under
a reservation of rights. Based on the information, or lack thereof, available to the company at the present time, the company is
unable to express an opinion as to the actual exposure for this matter; however, based on the information available to the company
at the present time, the company does not believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity, results
of operations or financial condition of the company.

On December 30, 2002, the company received a 104(e) letter from the USEPA pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental, Response,
Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) requesting answers to certain questions regarding the waste disposal practices of the
Heekin Can Company and the relationship between the company and the Heekin Can Company. Region 5 of the EPA is involved in the
cleanup of the Jackson Brothers Paint Company site which consists of four, and possibly five, sites in and around Laurel, Indiana.
The Jackson Brothers Paint Company apparently disposed of drums of waste in the 1960s and 1970s. The USEPA has alleged that some
of the waste that has been uncovered was sent to the sites from the Cincinnati plant operated by the Heekin Can Company. The
Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) referred this matter to the USEPA for removal of the drums and cleanup. At
the present time there are an undetermined number of drums at one or more of the sites that have been initially identified by the
USEPA as originating from the Heekin Can Company. The USEPA has sent 104(e) letters to seven other potentially responsible parties
including the Heekin Can Company. On January 30, 2003, the company responded to the request for information pursuant to Section
104(e) of CERCLA. The USEPA has initially estimated cleanup costs to be between $4 million and $5 million. Based on the information,
or lack thereof, available to the company at the present time, the company does not believe that this matter will have a material
adverse effect upon the liquidity, results of the operations or financial condition of the company.

The company previously reported that in March of 1992, William Hallahan, an employee of the company's metal container plant in
Saratoga Springs, New York, filed a workers' compensation claim alleging that he suffers from a form of leukemia that was caused by
his exposure to certain chemicals used in the plant. The company denied the claim, and hearings on the matter were held before the
Workers' Compensation Board of the State of New York. Testimony was concluded in April 1996. On January 14, 1997, the Administrative
Law Judge (ALJ) filed his Memorandum of Decision finding in favor of the claimant. The decision was appealed, and the Workers'
Compensation Board remanded the case back to the ALJ for further findings. The ALJ made those findings and the company again
appealed the case. In June 1999, a three-judge panel of the Workers' Compensation Board reversed the decision of the ALJ and found
that the claimant failed to show a causal relationship between the claimant's workplace and his disease in order to establish that
he developed an occupational disease from an exposure at the plant. The Board then closed the case. The claimant appealed the case
to the Full Workers' Compensation Board and alternatively to the Appellate Division of the New York State judicial system. On
May 30, 2000, the Full Workers' Compensation Board denied Mr. Hallahan's appeal. On April 6, 2001, the General Counsel of the
New York State Workers' Compensation Board deemed Mr. Hallahan's appeal to have been abandoned. On November 21, 2001, Mr. Hallahan
filed a Petition to reopen the workers' compensation case on the basis that ethylene glycol monobutyl ethers (2-Buto-xylthanol)
(EGBE) may have been the possible cause of Mr. Hallahan's leukemia. Mr. Hallahan's attorney requested the Board to reopen the case
under its continuing jurisdiction. Claimant also claims that this information supports their expert witness' previous testimony at
the hearing regarding the cause of Mr. Hallahan's leukemia. Mr. Hallahan's counsel also argued that the EPA supports the position
that EGBE is a possible human carcinogen. The company filed a statement in opposition to Mr. Hallahan's petition to reopen the case.
On February 4, 2002, the Board denied the request to reopen the case. This decision was not appealed. This matter is now resolved
with no material adverse effect upon the liquidity, results of operations or financial condition of the company.

As previously reported, on or about December 31, 1992, William Hallahan and his wife filed suit in the Supreme Court of the State
of New York, County of Saratoga, against certain manufacturers of solvents, coatings and equipment, including Somerset Technologies
Inc. and Belvac Production Machinery, seeking damages in the amount of $15 million for allegedly causing leukemia by exposing him
to harmful toxins. Somerset and Belvac filed third-party complaints seeking contribution from the company for damages that they
might be required to pay William Hallahan. The defendants, including the company, have filed a motion for summary judgment against
the plaintiff requesting a judgment that the Workers' Compensation Board has determined this case against William Hallahan. On
July 3, 2002, the Court entered a decision in favor of the defendants and us. On August 13, 2002, the Court entered judgment on the
decision. On August 29, 2002, Mr. Hallahan and his wife filed an appeal in the Appellate Division. On February 24, 2003, the
Appellate Division held a mandatory mediation conference regarding this case. Certain defendants settled this case with the
plaintiffs as to all parties. The company did not contribute to the settlement. The settlement agreement is being prepared by the
parties. The appeal has been withdrawn by Mr. and Mrs. Hallahan. This matter has now been resolved with no material adverse effect
upon the liquidity, results of operations or financial condition of the company.

<u>Europe</u>

Ball Packaging Europe, together with other plaintiffs, is contesting the enactment of a mandatory deposit for non-returnable
containers based on the German Packaging Regulation (Verpackungsverordnung) in federal and state administrative courts. The
proceedings in the administrative court in Hessen (Verwaltungsgericht Wiesbaden) and Brandenburg (Verwaltungsgericht Potsdam) were
discontinued on September 24 and October 30, 2002, respectively. The Administrative Court in Northrhine Westfalia
(Verwaltungsgericht D&uuml;sseldorf) has rendered a positive judgment and confirmed that a duty to implement a mandatory deposit fee
as of January 1, 2003, does not exist. According to that court, a mandatory deposit fee to protect returnable containers is without
legal basis in the current legislation. Other administrative courts have not yet scheduled hearings. The German administration has
filed an appeal against the suspensive effect of the judgment of the administrative court in Northrhine Westfalia to the
Oberverwaltungsgericht M&uuml;nster (Higher Administrative Court) and has filed an appeal on the merits of the case to the
Bundesverwaltungsgericht in Leipzig (Federal Administrative Court). On November 27, 2002, the Higher Administrative Court in
M&uuml;nster decided to lift the temporary legal protection. On January 16, 2003, the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig
decided that the plaintiffs did not have procedural standing in the administrative court in D&uuml;sseldorf; therefore, it did not
reach the issue of whether the imposition of the mandatory deposit is a proper implementation of the current legislation. A
proceeding in the Bundesverfassungsgericht in Karlsruhe (Federal Constitutional Court) is still pending; the date of the hearing
has not yet been set. Based on the information, or lack thereof available to the company at the present time, the company is unable
to express an opinion as to the actual exposure of the company, however, the company does not believe that this matter will have a
material adverse effect upon the liquidity, results of operations or financial condition of the company.
