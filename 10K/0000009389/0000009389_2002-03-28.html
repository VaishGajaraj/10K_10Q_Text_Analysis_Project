Item 1.  Business</b>

   Ball Corporation was organized in 1880 and incorporated in Indiana in 1922. Its principal executive offices are located at
   10 Longs Peak Drive, Broomfield, Colorado 80021-2510. The terms "Ball," "the company," "we" or "our" as used herein refer to Ball
   Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.

   Ball is a manufacturer of metal and plastic packaging, primarily for beverages and foods, and a supplier of aerospace and other
   technologies and services to commercial and governmental customers.

   The following sections of the 2001 Annual Report to Shareholders contain financial and other information concerning company
   business developments and operations, and are incorporated herein by reference:  the notes to the consolidated financial
   statements including "Business Segment Information" (Note 2), "Business Consolidation Costs and Other" (Note 3), "Acquisition"
   (Note 4) and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."

                                               <b>Business Developments in 2001 and Early 2002</b>

   Ball took a number of actions in 2001 to address overcapacity in the industries in which we operate and to improve production
   efficiencies. In June 2001, after an extensive review, we announced a plan to exit the general line metal can business in the
   People's Republic of China (PRC) and to further reduce our PRC beverage can manufacturing capacity by closing two plants. We have
   since sold the general line business, closed one beverage can plant and are in the process of closing the second. Also in June
   2001, we ceased operations in two commercial product lines in our aerospace and technologies business. In mid-December 2001 we
   closed our Moultrie, Georgia, beverage can plant. Charges recorded in connection with these actions totaled $271.2 million.

   On December 28, 2001, Ball acquired substantially all of the assets of Wis-Pak Plastics, Inc. (Wis-Pak) for approximately
   $27.5 million. Additional payments of up to $10 million in total, including interest, are contingent upon the future performance
   of the acquired business through 2006. Under the acquisition agreement, we entered into a ten-year agreement to supply
   100 percent of Wis-Pak's annual PET container requirements, which are currently 550 million containers.

   Additional details about the business consolidations charges and the acquisition are provided in Notes 3 and 4 to the
   consolidated financial statements, which can be found in Exhibit 13.1

   On January 1, 2002, we commenced a 50/50 joint venture agreement with Coors Brewing Company (Coors) for the manufacture and
   supply of the majority of the 4.5 billion beverage cans and ends used by Coors annually. Ball will receive management fees under
   this agreement and will account for the joint venture using the equity method of accounting. In addition to beverage cans
   supplied to Coors from the joint venture, Ball will supply Coors with beverage cans manufactured in other wholly-owned Ball
   facilities.

   On January 23, 2002, the company's board of directors declared a two-for-one split of Ball stock, increased the next quarterly
   dividend and authorized the additional repurchase of common shares. The stock split was effective February 22, 2002, for all
   shareholders of record on February 1, 2002. As a result of the stock split, all amounts related to earnings per share, share
   prices and share amounts have been retroactively restated for all periods presented.

                                          <b>Information Pertaining to the Business of the Company</b>

   The company's businesses are comprised of two segments:  (1) packaging and (2) aerospace and technologies.

   <b>Packaging Segment</b>

   Ball's principal business is the manufacture and sale of rigid packaging products, primarily for beverages and foods. Packaging
   products are sold in highly competitive markets, primarily based on quality, service and price. A substantial part of our
   packaging sales are made directly to relatively few major companies in packaged beverage and food businesses, including Miller
   Brewing Company and bottlers of Pepsi-Cola and Coca-Cola branded beverages and their licensees utilizing consolidated purchasing
   groups. Additional details about our sales to these customers are included in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements,
   which can be found in Exhibit 13.1.

   The rigid packaging business is capital intensive, requiring significant investments in machinery and equipment. Profitability is
   sensitive to production volumes, labor and the costs and availability of certain raw materials, such as aluminum, steel and
   plastic resin.

   Raw materials used in our packaging business are generally available from several sources. We have secured what we consider to be
   adequate supplies of raw materials and are not experiencing any shortages. Our manufacturing facilities are dependent, in varying
   degrees, upon the availability of process energy, such as natural gas and electricity. While certain of these energy sources may
   become increasingly in short supply or halted due to external factors, we cannot predict the effects, if any, of such occurrences
   on future operations.

   Research and development efforts in this business generally seek to improve manufacturing efficiencies and lower unit costs,
   principally raw material costs, by reducing the material content of containers while improving or maintaining other physical
   properties such as material strength. In addition, research and development efforts are directed toward the development of new
   sizes and types of metal and plastic beverage and food containers, as well as new uses for the current containers.

   Decorated two-piece aluminum beverage cans are produced at 17 manufacturing facilities in the U.S., one facility in Canada and
   one in Puerto Rico; ends are produced within five U.S. facilities. Metal beverage containers are sold primarily to fillers of
   carbonated soft drinks, beer and other beverages under long-term or annual supply contracts. Sales volumes of metal beverage cans
   and ends in North America tend to be highest during the period from April through September.

   Metal beverage containers and ends represent Ball's largest product line, accounting for approximately 67 percent of 2001
   packaging segment net sales. Since 1998 we have been the largest beverage can producer in North America.

   Based on publicly available industry information, we estimate that our North American metal beverage container shipments were
   approximately 31 percent of total U.S. and Canadian shipments for metal beverage containers. We also estimate that five producers
   represent substantially all of the remaining metal beverage container shipments. Available industry information indicates the
   growth in industry-wide shipments was relatively flat from 1998 to 2001.

   In Canada, metal beverage containers have captured significantly lower percentages of the packaged beverage industry than in the
   U.S., particularly in the packaged beer industry, in which the market share of metal containers has been hindered by non-tariff
   trade barriers and restrictive taxes within Canada.
<PAGE>
   Beverage container industry production capacity in the U.S. and Canada exceeds demand. In order to balance more closely capacity
   and demand within our business, we have consolidated our can and end manufacturing capacity into fewer, more efficient facilities
   with the closure of five plants during 1999, 2000 and 2001, as reported in Note 3 in our Annual Report to Shareholders, which can
   be found in Exhibit 13.1.

   The aluminum beverage can continues to compete aggressively with other packaging materials in the beer and soft drink industries.
   The glass bottle has shown resilience in the packaged beer industry, while the soft drink industry use of the PET bottle has
   grown. The beer industry has also begun the usage of plastic beer bottles.

   Two-piece and three-piece steel food containers are manufactured in the U.S. and Canada and sold primarily to food processors in
   the U.S. and Canada. In 2001 metal food container sales comprised approximately 19 percent of packaging segment net sales. Sales
   volumes of metal food containers in North America tend to be highest from June through October as a result of seasonal vegetable
   and salmon packs.

   In the metal food container industry, manufacturing capacity in North America exceeds demand. Approximately 33 billion
   steel food cans were shipped in the U.S. and Canada in 2001, of which approximately 17 percent were shipped by Ball.

   Since the second quarter of 2000, Ball and ConAgra Grocery Products Company have participated in a joint venture food can
   manufacturing company, Ball Western Can Company. Under this arrangement, Ball receives management fees and accounts for the
   results of its 50 percent-owned investment under the equity method.

   The steel food can competes with other packaging materials in the food industry including glass, aluminum, plastic and paper.
   As a result, this product line must increasingly focus on product innovation. Service, quality and price are deciding competitive
   factors.

   Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) packaging is Ball's newest product line, representing slightly less than 9 percent of packaging
   segment net sales in 2001. Demand for containers made of PET has increased in the beverage packaging industry and is expected to
   increase in the food packaging industry with improved technology and adequate supplies of PET resin. While PET beverage
   containers compete against metal, glass and cardboard, the historical increase in the sales of PET containers has come primarily
   at the expense of glass containers and through new market introductions. The latest publicly available projections indicate that
   the growth in overall PET demand over the next two years is expected to be between 7 and 8 percent. Based on research estimates
   from various sources, we believe Ball's share of the total U.S. and Canadian shipments is between 8 and 12 percent.

   Competition in the PET container industry includes four national suppliers and several regional suppliers and self-manufacturers.
   Service, quality and price are deciding competitive factors. Increasingly, the ability to produce customized, differentiated
   plastic containers is an important competitive factor.

   Ball has secured long-term customer supply agreements, principally for carbonated beverage and water containers. Plastic beer
   containers are being tested by several of our customers and we are developing plastic containers for the single serve juice
   market.

   Capacity has grown rapidly in the PRC, resulting in a supply/demand imbalance. As discussed above, we undertook a review of our
   options there and, as a result, have either closed or are closing several facilities. The Beijing manufacturing facility is one
   of the most technologically advanced plants in the PRC and the company's 32 percent-owned affiliate, Sanshui Jianlibao FTB
   Packaging Limited, is the largest can manufacturing facility in the PRC in terms of production capacity. For more information on
   operations in the PRC, see Item 2, Properties, and Exhibit 21.1, Subsidiary List.

   We are a 50 percent equity owner of a joint venture with BBM Participacoes S.A. producing two-piece aluminum cans and ends in
   Brazil. Ball also participates in joint ventures in Thailand, Taiwan and the Philippines, in addition to providing manufacturing
   technology and assistance to several can manufacturers around the world.

   <b>Aerospace and Technologies Segment</b>

   The aerospace and technologies segment includes civil space systems, defense operations, and commercial space operations. The
   defense operations business unit includes defense systems, systems engineering services, advanced antenna and video systems and
   electro-optics and cryogenic systems and components. Sales in the aerospace and technologies segment accounted for approximately
   11 percent of consolidated net sales in 2001. The commercial products and technologies business unit was closed in mid-2001.
   Additional details regarding this closure can be found in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements, which can be found in
   Exhibit 13.1.

   The majority of the aerospace and technologies segment business involves work under contracts, generally of from one to five
   years in duration for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), other U.S.
   government agencies and for foreign governments. Contracts funded by the various agencies of the federal government represented
   approximately 92 percent of segment sales in 2001. Major industry trends have not changed significantly, with DoD and NASA
   budgets remaining relatively stable. Consolidation in the aerospace and defense industries continues, and there is strong
   competition for business.

   Civil space systems, defense operations and commercial space operations include hardware, software and services to both U.S. and
   international customers, with emphases on space science, environmental and Earth sciences, defense and intelligence, manned
   missions and space exploration. Major contractual activities frequently involve the design, manufacture and testing of
   satellites, ground systems and payloads (including launch vehicle integration), as well as satellite ground station control
   hardware and software.

   Other hardware activities include:  electro-optics products for spacecraft guidance, control of instruments and sensors, and
   surveillance subsystems; target identification, warning and attitude control systems and components; cryogenic systems for
   reactant storage, and sensor cooling devices using either closed-cycle mechanical refrigerators or open-cycle solid and liquid
   cryogens; star trackers, which are general-purpose stellar attitude sensors; and fast-steering mirrors.

   Additionally, the aerospace and technologies segment provides diversified technical services and products to federal and local
   government agencies, prime contractors and commercial organizations for a broad range of information warfare, electronic warfare,
   avionics, intelligence, training and space systems needs.

   <i>Backlog</i>

   Backlog of the aerospace and technologies segment was approximately $431 million and $351 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000,
   respectively, and consists of the aggregate contract value of firm orders, excluding amounts previously recognized as revenue.
   The 2001 backlog includes approximately $250 million expected to be billed during 2002, with the remainder expected to be billed
   thereafter. Unfunded amounts included in backlog for certain firm government orders which are subject to annual funding were
   approximately $291 million at December 31, 2001. Year-to-year comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of the trend
   of future operations.

   The company's aerospace and technologies segment has contracts with the U.S. government or its contractors which have standard
   termination provisions. The government retains the right to terminate contracts at its convenience. However, if contracts are
   terminated in this manner, Ball is entitled to reimbursement for allowable costs and profits to the date of termination relating
   to authorized work performed to such date. U.S. government contracts are also subject to reduction or modification in the event
   of changes in government requirements or budgetary constraints.

                                                                 <b>Patents</b>

   In the opinion of the company, none of its active patents is essential to the successful operation of its business as a whole.
<PAGE>
                                                         <b>Research and Development</b>

   Note 18, "Research and Development," in the 2001 Annual Report to Shareholders contains information on company research and
   development activity and is incorporated herein by reference.

                                                               <b>Environment</b>

   Aluminum, steel and PET containers are recyclable, and significant amounts of used containers are being recycled and diverted
   from the solid waste stream. Using the most recent data available, in 2000 approximately 62 percent of aluminum containers,
   58 percent of steel cans and 22 percent of the PET containers sold in the U.S. were recycled.

   Compliance with federal, state and local laws relating to protection of the environment has not had a material, adverse effect
   upon capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position of the company. As more fully described under Item 3, Legal
   Proceedings, the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency and various state environmental agencies have designated the company as a
   potentially responsible party, along with numerous other companies, for the cleanup of several hazardous waste sites. However,
   the company's information at this time does not indicate that these matters will have a material, adverse effect upon the
   liquidity, results of operations or financial condition of the company.

   Legislation which would prohibit, tax or restrict the sale or use of certain types of containers, and would require diversion of
   solid wastes such as packaging materials from disposal in landfills, has been or may be introduced in the U.S. Congress and the
   Canadian Parliament, in state and Canadian provincial legislatures and other legislative bodies. While container legislation has
   been adopted in a few jurisdictions, similar legislation has been defeated in public referenda in several other states, in local
   elections and in many state and local legislative sessions. The company anticipates that continuing efforts will be made to
   consider and adopt such legislation in many jurisdictions in the future. If such legislation was widely adopted, it could have a
   material adverse effect on the business of the company, as well as on the container manufacturing industry generally, in view of
   the company's substantial North American sales and investment in metal and PET container manufacture.

                                                                <b>Employees</b>

   At the end of February 2002 the company employed approximately 9,950 people worldwide.

<b>Item 2.    Properties</b>

   The company's properties described below are well maintained, are considered adequate and are being utilized for their intended
   purposes.

   The Corporate headquarters is located in Broomfield, Colorado. The offices for metal packaging operations are in Westminster,

<b>Item 3.    Legal Proceedings</b>

   As previously reported, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) considers the company to be a Potentially Responsible
   Party (PRP) with respect to the Lowry Landfill site located east of Denver, Colorado. On June 12, 1992, the company was served
   with a lawsuit filed by the City and County of Denver (Denver) and Waste Management of Colorado, Inc., seeking contribution from
   the company and approximately 38 other companies. The company filed its answer denying the allegations of the Complaint. On
   July 8, 1992, the company was served with a third-party complaint filed by S.W. Shattuck Chemical Company, Inc., seeking
   contribution from the company and other companies for the costs associated with cleaning up the Lowry Landfill. The company
   denied the allegations of the complaint.

   In July 1992 the company entered into a settlement and indemnification agreement with Denver, Chemical Waste Management, Inc.,
   and Waste Management of Colorado, Inc. (collectively Waste) pursuant to which Denver and Waste dismissed their lawsuit against
   the company and Waste agreed to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the company from claims and lawsuits brought by governmental
   agencies and other parties relating to actions seeking contributions or remedial costs from the company for the cleanup of the
   site. Several other companies, which are defendants in the above-referenced lawsuits, had already entered into the settlement and
   indemnification agreement with Denver and Waste. Waste Management, Inc., has agreed to guarantee the obligations for Chemical
   Waste Management, Inc., and Waste Management of Colorado, Inc. Denver and Waste may seek additional payments from the company if
   the response costs related to the site exceed $319 million. The company might also be responsible for payments (calculated in
   1992 dollars) for any additional wastes which may have been disposed of by the company at the site but which are identified
   after the execution of the settlement agreement.

   At this time, there are no Lowry Landfill actions in which the company is actively involved. Based on the information available
   to the company at this time, the company believes that this matter will not have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity,
   results of operations or financial condition of the company.

   The company previously reported that it was notified on April 24, 1992, by the Muncie Race Track Steering Committee that the
   company may have been a PRP with respect to the disposal of waste at the Muncie Race Track Site located in Delaware County,
   Indiana. On February 15, 2001, General Motors Company, one of the PRPs at the site, filed a lawsuit against Ball and several
   other companies seeking contribution from them for past, present and future remedial costs at the site. On June 5, 2001, Ball
   and General Motors Company settled their dispute, and General Motors Company dismissed its lawsuit with prejudice. Based upon
   the information available to the company at the present time, the company believes that this matter is now concluded without any
   material adverse effect upon the liquidity, results of operations or financial condition of the company.

   The company previously reported that on August 1, 1997, the EPA sent notice of potential liability to 19 PRPs concerning past
   activities at one or more of the four Rocky Flats parcels (including land owned by Precision Chemicals now owned by Great Western
   Inorganics) at the Rocky Flats Industrial Park site (RFIP) located in Jefferson County, Colorado. The RFIP site also includes the
   AERRCO site and a site owned by Thoro Products Company. Based upon sampling at the site in 1996, the EPA determined that
   additional site work would be required to determine the extent of contamination and the possible cleanup of the site. The EPA
   requested the PRPs to perform certain site work in 1996. These discussions have been ongoing. On December 19, 1997, the EPA
   issued an Administrative Order on Consent (AOC) to conduct the engineering estimates and cost analyses. The AOC has been
   finalized. The company has funded approximately $70,000 toward these costs. The PRPs have negotiated an agreement and the company
   contributed $5,000 as an initial group contribution. The company has agreed to pay 12 percent of the costs of cleanup at the
   AERRCO site and a percentage of the cleanup costs on the Thoro site. Based on the information available to the company at the
   present time, the company does not believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity, results of
   operations or financial condition of the company.

   In October 2001 representatives of Vauxmont Intermountain Communities notified six of the PRPs at the AERRCO site, including the
   company, (AERRCO PRPs) that hazardous materials might have contaminated property owned by Vauxmont. The AERRCO site is contained
   within the Rocky Flats Industrial Park site. Vauxmont also alleges that it lost $7 million on a contract with a home developer
   for the purchase of a portion of the land. Vauxmont representatives requested that the AERRCO PRPs study any contamination to the
   Vauxmont real estate. The AERRCO PRPs agreed to undertake such a study and sought the EPA's final approval. Based on the
   information, or lack thereof available to the company at the present time, the company does not believe that this matter will
   have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity, results of operations or financial condition of the company.

   As previously reported, the company was notified on June 19, 1989, that the EPA has designated the company and numerous other
   companies as PRPs responsible for the cleanup of certain hazardous wastes that were released at the Spectron, Inc., site located
   in Elkton, Maryland. In December 1989, the company, along with other companies whose alleged hazardous waste contributions to the
   Spectron, Inc., site were considered to be <i>de minimis</i>, entered into a settlement agreement with the EPA for cleanup costs
   incurred in connection with the removal action of aboveground site areas. By a letter dated September 29, 1995, the company,
   along with other above-described PRPs, were notified by the EPA that it was negotiating with the large-volume PRPs another
   consent order for performance of a site environmental study as a prerequisite to long-term remediation. The EPA and the large-
   volume PRPs offered a second <i>de minimis</i> program buyout for settlement of liability for remediation of the site, and the offer was
   made to certain PRPs, including the company. On August 10, 2001, the EPA issued a General Notice and Opportunity to Participate
   in <i>De Minimis</i> Settlement letter to the company and over 1,000 other PRPs. The company signed the Global Consent Decree for
   <i>De Minimis</i> Parties on September 6, 2001, and returned it to the EPA. Within 30 days of entry of the Consent Decree, the company
   will make one payment of $66,737 to the EPA and an additional payment of $53,668 to the large volume PRPs. Alltrista Corporation
   has agreed to reimburse the company for $116,311 of the $120,404 total payment. Once the Consent Decree is final, the company's
   and Alltrista Corporation's liability at the site will be resolved. The Consent Decree is expected to be finalized and entered
   in 2002. Based upon the information available to the company at the present time, the company does not believe that this matter
   will have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity, results of operations or financial condition of the company.

   As previously reported, during July 1992, the company received information that it had been named a PRP with respect to the
   Solvents Recovery of New England Site (SRSNE) located in Southington, Connecticut. According to the information received, it is
   alleged that the company contributed approximately 0.08816 percent of the waste contributed to the site on a volumetric basis.
   The PRP group has been involved in negotiations with the EPA regarding the remediation of the site. The company has paid
   approximately $17,500 toward site investigation and remediation efforts.
<PAGE>
   The PRP group has spent $15 million through the end of 2001. Approximately $1.5 million more will be spent to complete a remedial
   investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS) and pay for remediation work through 2003. As of December 2001, projected remediation
   cost estimates for a bioremediation and enhanced oxidation system ranged from $20 million to $30 million. A <i>de minimis</i> offer was
   expected to be prepared in 2001, but there will be no proposals made in the foreseeable future. The PRP group offered a $5.5
   million settlement to resolve the EPA claim of $16 million for past costs at the SRSNE site. PRP/EPA negotiations to resolve the
   past cost claims from the EPA have not been resolved and are not being actively pursued by the PRP group. A natural resources
   damage claim of approximately $3 million is anticipated. At the present time, there are no PRP group assessments for 2002.

   The EPA has also sought recovery for the Angelillo site which is related to the SRSNE site. Contaminated soil and empty drums
   were transferred from the SRSNE Site to the Angelillo site and removed by the EPA's contractor in 1996 and 1997. The EPA informed
   the PRP group in March 2000 of their intention to seek recovery of approximately $1,155,000 for work the EPA conducted at the
   Angelillo site. The company signed a Tolling Agreement with the EPA on April 20, 2000, regarding the Angelillo site. The PRP
   group and the EPA reached agreement on past EPA site costs for Angelillo. The company signed the Agreement for Recovery of Past
   Response Costs on March 20, 2001 and submitted it for the PRP group to hold until a sufficient number of PRPs (80-90 percent)
   responded in like manner. The company has not yet received notice that a sufficient number of PRPs have so responded. The company
   paid $885 on May 15, 2001, and $1,139 on December 5, 2001, for group assessments.

   Based on the information, or lack thereof available to the company at the present time, the company does not believe that these
   matters will have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity, results of operations or financial condition of the company.

   The company previously reported that on or about June 14, 1990, the El Monte plant of Ball-InCon Glass Packaging Corp., a then
   wholly-owned subsidiary of the company (renamed Ball Glass Container Corporation [Ball Glass]), the assets of which were
   contributed in September 1995 into a joint venture with Compagnie de Saint-Gobain (Saint-Gobain), now known as Saint-Gobain
   Industries, Inc., and currently wholly owned by Saint-Gobain, received a general notification letter and information request from
   the EPA, Region IX, notifying Ball Glass that it may have a potential liability as defined in Section 107(a) of the Comprehensive
   Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) with respect to the San Gabriel Valley areas 1-4 Superfund Sites
   located in Los Angeles County, California. The EPA requested certain information from Ball Glass, and Ball Glass responded. A PRP
   group organized and drafted a PRP group agreement, which Ball Glass executed. The PRP group completed negotiations with the EPA
   over the terms of the administrative consent order, statement of work for the remedial investigation phase of the cleanup, and
   the interim allocation arrangement between PRP group members to fund the remedial investigation. The interim allocation approach
   requires that any payment will be based upon contribution to pollution. An AOC was executed by the PRP group and the EPA. The EPA
   also accepted the statement of work for the remedial investigation phase of the cleanup. The PRP group retained an environmental
   engineering consulting firm to perform the remedial investigation. As required under the AOC, the group submitted to the EPA
   copies of all environmental studies conducted at the plant, the majority of which had already been furnished to the State of
   California. The EPA then approved the work plan, project management plan, and the data management plan portions of the PRP
   group's proposed RI/FS. The PRP group funded the RI/FS. The EPA and the PRP group have continued to negotiate a resolution of
   this matter. The EPA is requiring the PRP group to pay $331,000 of the EPA's past site operation costs plus interest. Such
   payment must be made within the next 3 years; however, the EPA has agreed to accept installment payments. The first such
   installment of $100,000 was anticipated to be made by the PRP group during the first quarter of 2001, but such payment was not
   made and is now expected to be made during the first or second quarter of 2002. However, the company paid its allocated
   percentage of $5,020 of the $100,000 on January 2001. The PRP group, <i>de minimis</i> members, including the company, have finalized
   their <i>de minimis</i> offer to the PRP group. The amount of the offer was $3.75 million with the company's share being $391,000
   (10 percent). In November 2001, PRP group members circulated a good-faith settlement offer to the EPA. If accepted, the company
   will be released from any further cleanup obligation or liability upon payment of its share of the <i>de minimis</i> settlement. In
   addition, Commercial Union, the company's general liability insurer, is defending this governmental action and is paying the cost
   of defense including attorneys' fees. Based on the information, or lack thereof available to the company at the present time, the
   company does not believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity, results of operations or
   financial condition of the company.

   The company previously reported that in 1998 various consumers filed toxic tort litigation in the Superior Court for Los Angeles
   County (Trial Court) against various water companies operating in the San Gabriel Valley Basin. The water companies petitioned
   the Trial Court to remove this action to the California Public Utilities Commission. The Trial Court agreed. The plaintiffs
   appealed this decision to the California Court of Appeals, which reversed the Trial Court. One non-regulated utility has appealed
   this decision to the California Supreme Court. Pending completion of the appellate process, the Trial Court stayed further action
   in this litigation except that the plaintiffs were permitted to add additional defendants. The Trial Court consolidated the six
   separate lawsuits in the Northeast District (Pasadena) and designated the case of <i>Adler, et al. v. Southern California Water
   Company, et al</i>., as the lead case. In late March 1999, Ball-Foster Glass Container Co., L.L.C., which the company no longer owns,
   received a summons and amended complaint based on its ownership of the El Monte glass plant. Ball-Foster Glass tendered the
   lawsuit to the company for defense and indemnity. The company has in turn tendered this lawsuit to its liability carrier,
   Commercial Union, for defense and indemnity. Plaintiffs appear to be proceeding to join all companies, which are alleged to be
   PRPs in the various operable units in the San Gabriel Valley Superfund Site. The litigation, including the filing of answers by
   such joined parties, has been stayed pending the decision of the California Supreme Court as to whether the California Public
   Utilities Commission has sole jurisdiction over these cases since some of the defendants are regulated utilities. On February 4,
   2002, the California Supreme Court issued its written opinion upholding the decision of the Court of Appeals ruling that the
   plaintiffs may proceed with their toxic tort claims in the Trial Court against all defendants, including the company, who are
   non-regulated utilities. The stay remains in effect until a complex case management order is entered, and no responsive pleadings
   or motions are required while the stay is in effect. Similarly situated <i>de minimis</i> industry defendants are forming a joint
   defense group and the company will be invited to join. Based on the information, or lack thereof, available to the company at the
   present time, the company is unable to express an opinion as to the actual exposure of the company for this matter; however,
   based on the information available to the company at the present time, the company does not believe that this matter will have a
   material adverse effect upon the liquidity, results of operations or financial condition of the company.

   The company previously reported that in March of 1992, William Hallahan, an employee of the company's metal container plant in
   Saratoga Springs, New York, filed a workers' compensation claim alleging that he suffers from a form of leukemia that was caused
   by his exposure to certain chemicals used in the plant. The company denied the claim, and hearings on the matter were held before
   the Workers' Compensation Board of the State of New York. Testimony was concluded in April 1996. On January 14, 1997, the
   Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) filed his Memorandum of Decision finding in favor of the claimant. The decision was appealed, and
   the Workers' Compensation Board remanded the case back to the ALJ for further findings. The ALJ made those findings and the
   company again appealed the case. In June 1999, a three-judge panel of the Workers' Compensation Board reversed the decision of
   the ALJ and found that the claimant failed to show a causal relationship between the claimant's workplace and his disease in
   order to establish that he developed an occupational disease from an exposure at the plant. The Board then closed the case. The
   claimant appealed the case to the Full Workers' Compensation Board and alternatively to the Appellate Division of the New York
   State judicial system. On May 30, 2000, the Full Workers' Compensation Board denied Mr. Hallahan's appeal. On April 6, 2001, the
   General Counsel of the New York State Workers' Compensation Board deemed Mr. Hallahan's appeal to have been abandoned. On
   November 21, 2001, Mr. Hallahan filed a Petition to reopen the workers' compensation case on the basis that ethylene glycol
   monobutyl ethers (2-Buto-xylthanol) (EGBE) may have been the possible cause of Mr. Hallahan's leukemia. Mr. Hallahan's attorney
   requested the Board to reopen the case under its continuing jurisdiction. Claimant also claims that this information supports
   their expert witness' previous testimony at the hearing regarding the cause of Mr. Hallahan's leukemia. Mr. Hallahan's counsel
   also argued that the EPA supports the position that EGBE is a possible human carcinogen. The company filed a statement in
   opposition to Mr. Hallahan's petition to reopen the case. On February 4, 2002, the Board denied the request to reopen the case.
   Based on the information, or lack thereof, available to the company at the present time, the company does not believe that this
   matter will have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity, results of operations or financial condition of the company.

   As previously reported, on or about December 31, 1992, William Hallahan and his wife filed suit in the Supreme Court of the State
   of New York, County of Saratoga, against certain manufacturers of solvents, coatings and equipment, including Somerset
   Technologies Inc. and Belvac Production Machinery, seeking damages in the amount of $15 million for allegedly causing leukemia by
   exposing him to harmful toxins. Somerset and Belvac filed third-party complaints seeking contribution from the company for
   damages that they might be required to pay William Hallahan. The defendants, including the company, have filed a motion for
   summary judgment against the plaintiff requesting a judgment that the Workers' Compensation Board has determined this case
   against William Hallahan. Based upon the information available to the company at the present time, the company believes that this
   matter will not have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity, results of operations or financial condition of the company.

   The company previously reported that on September 21, 1998, The Daiei Inc. (Daiei), a Japanese corporation, with its principal
   place of business in Tokyo, Japan, sued the company in United States District Court, Southern District of Indiana, Evansville
   Division (Court). Daiei alleged it is engaged in the retail sale of consumer goods and food products at stores throughout Japan.
   Daiei alleged that it purchased defective beer cans filled with beer from Evansville Brewing Company, Inc. (EBC) between April 6,
   1995 and July 20, 1995. Daiei alleged that the metal containers were defectively assembled and sealed by EBC at its production
   facility in Evansville, Indiana, on a machine that was inspected by representatives of Ball. Daiei further alleged Ball breached
   its warranty to provide metal containers that performed in a commercially reasonable manner and that the company's
   representatives were negligent in the repair of the sealing equipment owned by EBC. Daiei sought damages for the lost containers
   and product in the amount of $6 million. The company retained counsel and defended this case. The parties engaged in the
   discovery process and a Motion to Dismiss was filed by the company on several legal grounds. On March 31, 2000, the Court
   dismissed plaintiff's claim alleging negligence on the part of the company and its representatives, but denied the company's
   Motion to Dismiss Daiei's claim for breach of express and implied warranties. The case proceeded on Daiei's claim that the
   company allegedly breached express and implied warranties and warranties of fitness for a particular purpose with respect to the
   sale of beverage cans to Daiei by EBC. In a Court ordered settlement conference in December 2001, the parties settled this
   matter. The company believes that this matter is now concluded with no material adverse effect upon the liquidity, results of
   operations or financial condition of the company.

   As previously reported on March 3, 2000, Pechiney Plastic Packaging, Inc., and Pechiney Emballage Flexible Europe (Pechiney)
   filed a lawsuit against Kortec, Inc.; Crown Cork and Seal Company, Inc.; Crown Cork and Seal Technologies Company and Ball
   Plastic Container Corp. in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. Pechiney alleged that the defendants had
   infringed two of its patents with respect to methods and apparatus for injection molding and injection blow molding multi-layer
   plastic containers. Pechiney sought an injunction and damages. Kortec is a supplier to Ball Plastic Container Corp, of equipment
   for use in manufacturing multi-layered plastic bottles. Kortec agreed to defend Ball Plastic Container Corp. against the claims
   for infringement of patents arising out of the purchase and use of such equipment purchased from Kortec and assumed the defense
   of the action. The parties negotiated a settlement of this matter effective November 2, 2000. Pursuant to the terms of the
   settlement agreement, the company agreed to become a licensee of Pechiney in exchange for certain royalty payments. The company
   believes that this matter has been concluded without any adverse material effect upon the liquidity, results of operations or
   financial condition of the company.
<PAGE>
   The company previously reported that on January 27, 1999, Plastic Solutions of Texas, Inc. (PST) and Kurt H. Ruppmann, Sr.
   (Ruppmann) filed a statement of claim with the American Arbitration Association alleging the company breached a contract between
   the company, PST and Ruppmann relating to the grant of a license under certain patents and technology owned by PST and Ruppmann
   relating to the use of cryogenics in the manufacture of hot-fill PET bottles. The arbitrator issued an order favorable to Ball
   including monetary damages and specific performance. This award was confirmed by the District Court of Dallas County, Texas, and
   a judgment was entered on the company's behalf. The parties have negotiated a satisfactory payment schedule of this judgment. The
   company believes that this matter is now concluded without any adverse material effect upon the liquidity, results of operations
   or financial condition of the company.
