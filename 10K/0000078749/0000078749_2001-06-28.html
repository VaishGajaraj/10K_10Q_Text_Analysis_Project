<P align="left"><B>General and Signficant Events</B>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pioneer-Standard Electronics, Inc. was organized as an Ohio corporation in
1963 and maintains its principal office at 6065 Parkland Boulevard, Mayfield
Heights, Ohio 44124 (telephone number (440)&nbsp;720-8500). Except as otherwise
stated, the term &#147;Company&#148; as used herein shall mean Pioneer-Standard
Electronics, Inc. and its subsidiaries.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is a broad-line distributor of electronic components and
mid-range computer products for leading manufacturers and strives to be the
preferred strategic link between suppliers and customers. The Company operates
warehouse, distribution and value added centers throughout North America. In
addition, the Company continues to increase its global presence through
strategic investments. These investments further the Company&#146;s growth strategy
by offering access to an extensive distribution network in the Asia Pacific
region and Europe, and to markets within the United States.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During fiscal 2001, the Company acquired an equity interest in Magirus AG,
a European computer systems distributor headquartered in Stuttgart, Germany.
The Company also increased its investments in existing affiliates, World Peace
Industrial Co. Ltd., an Asian distributor of electronics headquartered in
Taipei, Taiwan, and Eurodis Electron PLC, a European distributor of electronic
components headquartered in London, England.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has made strategic investments in small start-up software
companies that offer tool sets with the potential to dramatically improve
supply chain management in the electronic components industry. The Company
acquired an 85% interest in Supplystream, Inc., a company specializing in
supply chain decision support tools. The Company also made a financial
investment in Aprisa, Inc., a company that provides Web-based engineering
services to speed product to market by enabling a fast and thorough design
discovery process.

<P align="left"><B>Description of Segments</B>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Historically, the Company&#146;s operations have been classified into two
reportable business segments, the distribution of electronic components and the
distribution of computer products, which are managed separately based on
product and market differences. During the fourth quarter of 2001, in
combination with the completion of a financial system implementation and
enhancements to internal reporting available for senior management decisions,
the Company redefined its reportable segments and established a third segment,
Corporate and Other. The revised segment presentation reflects how management
allocates resources, measures performance and views the overall business.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Industrial Electronics. </I>The Company&#146;s Industrial Electronics Division is a
broad-line distributor of semiconductors, interconnect, passive and
electromechanical (&#147;IPE&#148;) components, power supplies and embedded computer
products. Semiconductors are the building blocks of computer chips and include
microprocessors, memory and programmable logic devices, and analog and digital
integrated circuits. IPE products are devices that move or use an electrical
signal and include capacitors, connectors, resistors, switches and power
conditioning equipment. This segment also provides value added services
associated with industrial electronic products, such as point of use inventory
management, just-in-time kitting operations, turnkey assembly, memory and logic
device programming, connector and cable assemblies to customer specifications
and power products integration. Sales of industrial electronics products
constituted 51% of the Company&#146;s total sales in fiscal 2001, compared with 52%
in 2000 and 50% in 1999.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The semiconductor market historically has experienced fluctuations in
product supply and demand associated with technology changes and supply
capability occurring from time to time. At times when product supply has been
high relative to demand, prices for those products have declined. The Company
has attempted to minimize the effect of these price fluctuations in its
distribution arrangements. The Company&#146;s gross margins may nevertheless be
negatively affected if an excess supply of semiconductors causes a general
decline in prices for those products. If there is a shortage of semiconductor supply, the Company&#146;s results of operations will depend on how much
product it is able to obtain from suppliers and how quickly the Company receives shipments
of those products.
<P align="center">&nbsp;
<!-- PAGEBREAK -->
<P><HR noshade><P>
<H5 align="left"><A HREF="#toc">Table of Contents</A></H5><P>


<P>There can be no assurance that supply and demand
fluctuations in the semiconductor market will not have a material adverse
effect on the Company&#146;s results of operations and business.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Computer Systems. </I>The Company&#146;s Computer Systems Division is a distributor
and reseller of mid-range computer systems and high-end platforms, storage
subsystems, software, servers and networking products. As a complement to its
systems distributor operations, the Company provides value added
services, including systems integration, enterprise resource planning systems design and
network consulting. The Company&#146;s systems products and value added services
accounted for 49% of the Company&#146;s sales in fiscal 2001 compared with 48% in
2000 and 50% in 1999.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Computer Systems Division distributes many products that are used in
the manufacturing or configuration of mid-range computer systems and high-end
platforms. The technology used in these products has changed rapidly over the
last several years, resulting in short product life cycles. Because the
Company&#146;s customers have been forced to replace systems that have become
technologically obsolete in a relatively short period of time, the Company has
experienced substantial demand for these products that has contributed
significantly to its revenue growth. A slowdown in this market could have a
substantial negative effect on the Company&#146;s revenues and results of
operations.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Corporate &#38; Other. </I>Corporate &#38; Other primarily includes investments in
affiliates and selected other assets, fixed assets, related depreciation and
goodwill amortization, certain corporate management costs and special charges.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For financial information regarding the Company&#146;s business segments, see
Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company.

<P align="left"><B>Products Distributed And Sources of Supply</B>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company distributes products supplied by more than 200 manufacturers.
A majority of the Company&#146;s revenues comes from products sourced by relatively
few suppliers. During the 2001 fiscal year, products purchased from the
Company&#146;s three largest suppliers accounted for 53% of the Company&#146;s sales
volume. The largest three suppliers, Compaq, IBM and Intel Corporation,
supplied 18%, 24% and 11%, respectively, of the Company&#146;s sales volume. The
loss of any one of the top three suppliers and/or a combination of certain
other suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s business,
results of operations and financial condition unless alternative products
manufactured by others are available to the Company.

<P align="left"><B>Inventory</B>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company must maintain certain levels of inventory in order to ensure
that the lead times to its customers remain competitive. However, to minimize
its inventory exposure, the Company has arrangements with certain of its
suppliers for just-in-time product delivery. The majority of the products sold
by the Company are purchased pursuant to distributor agreements, which
generally provide for inventory return privileges by the Company upon
cancellation of a distributor agreement. The distributor agreements also
typically provide protection to the Company for product obsolescence and price
erosion. Although the Company believes that its relationships with suppliers
are good, there can be no assurance that the Company&#146;s suppliers will continue
to supply products to the Company on terms acceptable to the Company.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s results of operations depend in part on successful
management of the challenges of rapidly changing technology and evolving
industry standards characteristic of the markets for industrial electronics and
computer systems products. These challenges include predicting the nature and
timing of technological changes and the direction of evolving industry
standards; identifying, obtaining and successfully marketing new products as
they emerge; and minimizing the risk of loss due to inventory obsolescence.
Some of the Company&#146;s competitors may be able to market products that have
perceived advantages over the products distributed by the Company or that
render the products distributed by the Company obsolete or more difficult to
market. Although the Company attempts to minimize the effects of inventory
obsolescence in its distribution arrangements, the Company may have high
inventories of unsold product if a new technology renders a product distributed
by the Company less desirable or obsolete. In addition, customers may be less
willing, for financial or other reasons, to purchase the new products necessary
to use new technologies.

<H5 align="left"><A HREF="#toc">Table of Contents</A></H5><P>

<P align="left"><B>Customers</B>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company serves customers in many major markets of North America. Both
of the Company&#146;s operating segments have a varied customer base which includes
original equipment manufacturers (which constitute the core customer base of
the Industrial Electronics segment), value added resellers, research
laboratories, government agencies and commercial end-users, including
manufacturing companies and service and other non-manufacturing organizations.
No single customer accounted for more than ten percent of the Company&#146;s total
sales or the sales of either operating segment during the fiscal year 2001.

<P align="left"><B>Backlog</B>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company historically has not had a significant backlog of orders,
although some shipments may be scheduled for delivery over an extended period
of time. There was not a significant backlog at March&nbsp;31, 2001.

<P align="left"><B>Competition</B>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sale and distribution of electronic components and computer systems
products are highly competitive, primarily with respect to price and product
availability, but also with respect to service, variety and availability of
products carried, number of locations and promptness of service. The Company
also faces intense competition with respect to obtaining sources of supply for
products distributed, and in developing and maintaining relationships with
customers. In the case of semiconductor and computer systems products, the
Company competes for customers with other distributors as well as with some of
its suppliers. Many of the distributors with which the Company competes are
regional or local distributors. However, several of the Company&#146;s strongest
competitors have national and international distribution businesses and have
greater financial and other resources, which may enable them to compete more
effectively. Also, it is possible that an increasing number of suppliers may
decide to distribute products directly to the customer, which would further
heighten competitive pressures. Due to continuing competitive pressures, the
Company&#146;s margins have declined in recent years, and the Company expects
continued pressure on margins in the foreseeable future.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Industry Consolidation. </I>The electronic components distribution industry
and the computer systems distribution industry have become increasingly
concentrated in recent years as companies have combined or formed strategic
alliances. If this trend continues, new business combinations or strategic
alliances may have a competitive advantage if their potentially greater
financial, technical, marketing or other resources allow them to negotiate
relationships with suppliers that are more favorable than the Company&#146;s
relationships with its suppliers. If such relationships develop, these new
business combinations or strategic alliances may be able to offer lower prices
that could precipitate an industrywide decline in prices. This decline would
have a negative impact on the Company&#146;s margins, and could cause a decline in
the Company&#146;s revenues and loss of market share.

<P align="left"><B>Growth through Acquisitions</B>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company continually reviews acquisition prospects and strategic
alliances that could complement its existing lines of business and its balanced
business model, augment its volume and/or geographic coverage or provide
opportunities to expand into new markets. The Company&#146;s continued growth
depends in part on its ability to find suitable acquisition candidates and to
consummate strategic acquisitions. To fund acquisition costs, the Company may
issue equity securities, which could dilute the holdings of existing
shareholders, or incur debt, which could result in additional leveraging. These
actions could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s financial
condition and results of operations or the price of the Company&#146;s Common
Shares. Furthermore, acquiring businesses always entails risk and
uncertainties. The Company may not be able to integrate the operations of the
acquired businesses successfully, and the failure to do so could have a
material adverse impact on the Company&#146;s business and results of operations.

<P align="left"><B>Employees</B>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of March&nbsp;31, 2001, the Company had 2,581 employees. The Company is not
a party to any collective bargaining agreements, has had no strikes or work
stoppages and considers its employee relations to be excellent.

<P align="left"><B>Distribution</B>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company distributes its products principally in the United States and
Canada. Export sales are not a significant portion of the Company&#146;s sales.

<!-- link2 "Item&nbsp;2. Properties" -->
<DIV align="left"><A NAME="002"></A></DIV>
<P align="left"><B>Item&nbsp;2. </B><I>Properties</I>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company owns an 87,000 square foot facility and a 32,000 square foot
facility, each located in Cleveland, Ohio. The larger facility houses certain
corporate, accounting and information system functions, while the smaller
building serves as a corporate storage facility. In addition, the Company owns
a 106,000 square foot facility, located in Twinsburg, Ohio. The Twinsburg
facility houses the Company&#146;s Industrial Electronics Distribution Center.
Certain of the Company&#146;s corporate offices are located in a 60,450 square foot
facility in Mayfield Heights, Ohio, to which the Company entered into an
11-year lease in April&nbsp;1999. The Company&#146;s operations occupy a total of
approximately 1,427,000 square feet, with the majority, approximately 1,284,000
square feet, devoted to product distribution facilities and sales offices. Of
the approximately 1,427,000 square feet occupied, 225,000 square feet are owned
and 1,202,000 square feet are occupied under operating leases. The Company&#146;s
facilities of 100,000 square feet or larger, as of March&nbsp;31, 2001, are set
forth in the table below.
