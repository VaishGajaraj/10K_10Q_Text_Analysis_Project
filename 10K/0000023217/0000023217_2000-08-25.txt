ITEM 1. BUSINESS (Continued)

       The following comments pertain to each of the Company's reporting
       segments.

       ConAgra is a food company that operates in many different areas of the
       food business, from basic agricultural inputs to production and sale of
       branded consumer products. As a result, ConAgra uses many different raw
       materials, the bulk of which are commodities. Raw materials are generally
       available from several different sources and ConAgra presently believes
       that it can obtain these as needed.

       The Company experiences intense competition for sales of its principal
       products in its major markets. The Company's products compete with widely
       advertised, well-known, branded products, as well as private label
       products. The Company has major competitors in all of its reporting
       segments.

       Quality control processes at principal manufacturing locations emphasize
       applied research and technical services directed at product improvement
       and quality control. In addition, the Refrigerated Foods and the Packaged
       Foods segments conduct research activities related to the development of
       new products.

       Many of ConAgra's facilities and products are subject to various laws and
       regulations administered by the United States Department of Agriculture,
       the Federal Food and Drug Administration, and other federal, state, local
       and foreign governmental agencies relating to the quality of products,
       sanitation, safety and environmental control. The Company believes that
       it complies with such laws and regulations in all material respects, and
       that continued compliance with such regulations will not have a material
       effect upon capital expenditures, earnings or the competitive position of
       the Company.

       ConAgra and its subsidiaries have more than 85,000 employees, primarily
       in the United States.

d)     Foreign Operations

       The information, with respect to foreign operations, set forth in Note 19
       "Business Segments and Related Information" on pages 53 through 55 of the
       Company's 2000 Annual Report to Stockholders is incorporated herein by
       reference.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

The Company's corporate headquarters are located in Omaha, Nebraska. The
headquarters and principal operating locations of each business are set forth on
the following list of "ConAgra Locations."

The Company maintains a number of distribution facilities, in addition to
distribution facilities and warehouse space available at substantially all of
its manufacturing facilities.

Utilization of manufacturing capacity varies by type of product manufactured,
plant and week. In general, ConAgra operates most of its manufacturing
facilities in excess of 80% of standard industry capacity. Standards vary by
industry from 40 hours per week to 144 hours per week.

Most principal manufacturing facilities are held in fee. However, certain
parcels of land, machinery and buildings, and substantially all of ConAgra's
transportation equipment used in its processing and merchandising operations,
are leased.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

In fiscal 1991, ConAgra acquired Beatrice Company ("Beatrice"). As a result of
the acquisition and the significant pre-acquisition contingencies of the
Beatrice businesses and its former subsidiaries, the consolidated
post-acquisition financial statements of ConAgra reflect significant liabilities
associated with the estimated resolution of these contingencies. These include
various litigation and environmental proceedings related to businesses divested
by Beatrice prior to its acquisition by ConAgra. The environmental proceedings
include litigation and administrative proceedings involving Beatrice's status as
a potentially responsible party at 40 Superfund, proposed Superfund or
state-equivalent sites. Beatrice has paid or is in the process of paying its
liability share at 34 of these sites. Substantial reserves for these matters
have been established based on the Company's best estimate of its undiscounted
remediation liabilities, which estimates include evaluation of investigatory
studies, extent of required cleanup, the known volumetric contribution of
Beatrice and other potentially responsible parties and its experience in
remediating sites.

ConAgra is party to a number of other lawsuits and claims arising out of the
operation of its businesses. After taking into account liabilities recorded for
all of the foregoing matters, management believes the ultimate resolution of
such matters should not have a material adverse effect on ConAgra's financial
condition, results of operations or liquidity.

ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

Not applicable.
