<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgent Networks, Inc. (&#147;Forgent&#148; or &#147;Company&#148;) is a licensor of
intellectual property as well as a provider of low-cost, easy-to-use scheduling
and asset management software solutions that enable organizations to schedule
and manage their office environment effectively and efficiently. Forgent
currently generates a significant portion of its revenues and cash flow from
the licensing of its patent portfolio on a worldwide basis.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgent is a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1985 with principal
executive offices located at 108 Wild Basin Road, Austin, Texas 78746. The
Company telephone number is (512)&nbsp;437-2700 and the Company website is
www.forgent.com. The Company does not intend for information contained on its
website to be part of this Form 10-K. Forgent makes available free of charge,
on or through its website, its annual report on Form 10-K, its quarterly
reports on Form 10-Q, its current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those
reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange
Act as soon as reasonably practicable after the Company electronically files
such material or furnishes it to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company has two
main businesses &#151; intellectual property licensing and scheduling and asset
management software and professional services.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgent&#146;s intellectual property licensing business is derived from the
Company&#146;s Patent Licensing Program. The Company&#146;s Patent Licensing Program is
currently focused on generating licensing revenues related to the Company&#146;s
data compression technology embodied in U.S. Patent No.&nbsp;4,698,672 (the &#147;672
patent&#148;) and its foreign counterparts and is currently conducted through the
Company&#146;s wholly-owned subsidiary, Compression Labs, Inc. The Company&#146;s
aggregate intellectual property licensing revenues, which were generated by the
licensing of these patents, totaled over $94.5&nbsp;million through July&nbsp;31, 2004.
Other patents are currently being investigated for additional licensing
opportunities.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October&nbsp;2003, Forgent acquired software products from Network
Simplicity Software Inc. and molded these products into the Company&#146;s
NetSimplicity software product line which is currently sold through the Company&#146;s
web and telesales business model. NetSimplicity&#146;s flagship product, Meeting
Room&nbsp;Manager (&#147;MRM&#148;), automates the entire facility scheduling process:
reserving rooms, requesting equipment, ordering food, sending invitations,
creating reports and more. The product is easy to install and easy to deploy,
which allows customers to be up and running within minutes of starting their
deployment. Other products include Visual Asset Manager, an easy-to-use
information technology asset tracking and management tool, Resource Scheduler,
a scheduling application built on the same base as MRM but designed for
scheduling resources such as equipment, computers, etc., and Classroom Manager,
also a derivative product of MRM, that allows educational institutions and
training facilities to schedule their classrooms. Additionally, the Company
manufactures and sells Family Scheduler, an easy-to-install, simple-to-use
scheduling solution for busy families.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With 20&nbsp;years of experience and expertise in video network management,
Forgent developed and launched, in December&nbsp;2001, Video Network Platform (&#147;VNP&#148;),
a multi-vendor, multi-protocol video network management platform that monitors
and manages video and network devices from multiple vendors in order to ensure
interoperability. The Company expanded the functionality of VNP and created
ALLIANCE MEDIA MANAGER (&#147;MEDIA MANAGER&#148;), which configures all of the
components of an audio, video or web conference via a single meeting request by
interpreting user requests for rich-media resources, selecting and scheduling
the appropriate devices and services, automatically launching the conferences
as requested and providing ongoing monitoring to detect and recover if problems
occur. Forgent is currently exploring opportunities to leverage its expertise
with rich media networking through potential acquisitions of businesses that
are considered to be a good fit with Forgent&#146;s experience.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Founded in 1985 and using its expertise in the videoconferencing equipment
industry, the Company previously manufactured and installed videoconferencing
endpoints. In January&nbsp;2002, the Company sold its manufacturing products
business and shifted its focus from hardware manufacturing to software and
services. To further expedite this shift, during fiscal year 2002, Forgent also
sold its integration business, which designed and installed custom integrated
visual communication systems primarily in meetings spaces of large
corporations. During fiscal year 2003, the Company completed the divestiture
of its videoconferencing hardware services business, devoting itself entirely
to its intellectual property licensing business, as well as its software and
professional services business.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fiscal year 2004, Forgent continued its focus on licensing of
intellectual property and streamlined its software business with a low-cost,
high transaction marketing and distribution model. During fiscal year 2004,
Forgent achieved

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">several goals including: (1)&nbsp;initiated litigation to protect its intellectual
property rights related to the &#145;672 patent, (2)&nbsp;continued licensing efforts
from its Patent Licensing Program, (3)&nbsp;completed the integration of the
acquisition of Network Simplicity Software, Inc. and (4)&nbsp;made progress in
growing revenues related to its NetSimplicity software. Despite these
achievements, uncertainties and challenges remain, and there can be no
assurance that the Company can successfully grow its revenues or achieve
profitability.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>CORPORATE STRATEGY</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Company&#146;s inception, Forgent has designed, developed and
acquired strategies to help find new and better ways to solve problems in its
area of expertise. As these solutions were found, the Company patented and
then sought to commercialize these innovative technologies. This effort has
created a diverse portfolio of intellectual property such as data compression,
video mail, videoconferencing, video call scheduling and many others. The
Company&#146;s patent portfolio includes the combined invention of Compression Labs,
Inc., VTEL Corporation and Forgent Networks, Inc.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company licenses its intellectual property to technology companies,
which manufacture and sell hardware or software devices that incorporate
Forgent&#146;s technology. Through the licensing program, the Company seeks to
monetize its investment in its intellectual property portfolio and leverage the
resulting cash flow from licensing revenues in order to achieve a profitable
and growing business as well as returning value to its stockholders. The
Company has taken a portion of the intellectual property cash flows and
invested them in NetSimplicity, the Company&#146;s software business. As the
Company further evolves, Forgent&#146;s strategy will continue to adhere to the
following key elements:

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Intellectual Property Licensing Business</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgent intends to continue its efforts to derive revenue from its
intellectual property licensing business in order to provide stability
and serve as an internal source of funding for the Company&#146;s future
growth. The vast majority of the Company&#146;s Patent Licensing Program is
currently focused on generating licensing revenues related to the
Company&#146;s data compression technology embodied in U.S. Patent No.
4,698,672 and its foreign counterparts and is currently conducted
through the Company&#146;s wholly-owned subsidiary, Compression Labs, Inc.
The licensing revenues generated by the &#145;672 patent thus far relate to
one-time intellectual property license agreements and the Company does
not anticipate any additional intellectual property revenue from these
companies. However, Forgent continues to actively seek new licenses and
put more companies on notice by extending the &#145;672 patent&#146;s global reach
and broadening its field of use. Additionally, Forgent is currently
investigating other patents for additional licensing opportunities.
Currently, the Company&#146;s success is largely dependent on its ability to
license and commercialize its intellectual property from its patent
portfolio, which currently includes several dozen issued patents and
several pending patent applications.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During fiscal year 2004, Forgent initiated litigation against 31
technology companies for infringement of its &#145;672 patent (the &#147;&#145;672
Litigation&#148;). In August&nbsp;2004, the Company added 11 more technology
companies. Although the Company previously offered to provide a license
of the &#145;672 patent to these companies, none of the defendants chose to
do so. In addition to the current litigation, Forgent continues to
pursue license agreements with targeted companies, whether or not named
in the litigation. The timing of signing the license agreements and the
timing of the litigation results continue to pose forecasting
challenges, which inevitably causes peaks and valleys in the Patent
Licensing Program. Management anticipates its licensing program will
generate additional intellectual property licensing revenues. However,
uncertainties and challenges remain and there can be no assurances that
Forgent&#146;s strategy will be successful. See Item&nbsp;3 &#147;Legal Proceedings&#148;
for more detail.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Software &#038; Professional Services Business</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgent&#146;s software products solve common office administration
problems simply and affordably to save organizations time and money.
Businesses, educational institutions and healthcare organizations of all
sizes buy Forgent&#146;s software products because they solve real office
administration problems in an easy and affordable

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">
<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">manner. In October&nbsp;2003, Forgent acquired software products from
Network Simplicity Software Inc. and has molded these products into the
Company&#146;s NetSimplicity software product line. NetSimplicity&#146;s flagship
product, Meeting Room&nbsp;Manager&#153; (MRM), provides a complete meeting and
meeting room scheduling solution in an easy-to-buy and easy-to-deploy
application. Further, management is of the opinion that its current
scheduling and asset management software and professional services helps
to minimize or eliminate the inefficiencies plaguing meeting
environments. As Forgent expands the market awareness of its products
and services, management feels it will successfully generate additional
revenue. However, uncertainties and challenges remain and there can be
no assurances that Forgent&#146;s strategy will be successful.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Mergers &#038; Acquisition Efforts</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgent has considered and evaluated several businesses. However during
the due diligence phase, the Company was not satisfied with the discovered
quality of the prospects and thus terminated any further pursuit of these
specific businesses. Forgent will continue to investigate other potential
candidates for acquisition. Candidates to be considered include public and
private technology businesses or product lines that have proven growth, audited
profitability and are a good fit with Forgent&#146;s business. There can be no
assurances, however, that Forgent will acquire any new businesses, or that if
acquired, such acquisitions will be successful.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Focus on Expenses</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has continued to work to reduce operating expenses and has
employed a variety of strategies including headcount reductions, office space
rationalization, equipment lease terminations and asset divestitures among
others. The majority of the Company&#146;s software development efforts are in its
NetSimplicity office in Vancouver, Canada where it can realize lower operating
costs due to salary and overhead costs savings. The Company will continue to
plan additional overall spending reductions while increasing spending in the
intellectual property business and also maintaining its investment in the
software business.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LICENSING BUSINESS</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Background</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In May&nbsp;1997, the Company&#146;s stockholders approved a merger with Compression
Labs, Incorporated (&#147;CLI&#148;), a Delaware corporation that developed, manufactured
and marketed visual communication systems. As a result, CLI became a direct
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Through this merger, the Company
acquired certain patents, including the &#145;672 patent. Forgent also has foreign
counterparts of this patent in force in Great Britain, France, Germany and
Italy.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s Strategic Patent Program was created during fiscal year 2001
to stimulate the creation of the Company&#146;s intellectual property. An internal
patent committee representing all functions in the Company empowered all
employees to develop intellectual property and rewarded those employees who
generated ideas. In addition to the Strategic Patent Program, Forgent also
initiated an active program for licensing its intellectual property, which
developed into the Company&#146;s Patent Licensing Program. During fiscal year
2002, the Company signed its first two patent license agreements, including one
with Sony Corporation. These patent license agreements relate to the Company&#146;s
data compression technology embodied in the &#145;672 patent that will expire in
October&nbsp;2006 and its foreign counterparts that will expire in September&nbsp;2007.
The &#145;672 patent covers a type of encoding that plays a principle role in JPEG.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joint Photographic Experts Group (&#147;JPEG&#148;) is a standardized image
compression mechanism, designed for compressing full-color or gray images.
Since JPEG is designed for still images, it works well on photographs and other
similar material. The JPEG standard compresses the still images into smaller
files, which take less time to transmit across networks and saves significant
disk space for archiving purposes. Additionally, JPEG can store full color
information, thus allowing images to be exchanged among people with widely
varying display hardware.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wide variety of products create and manipulate digital images by using
JPEG. Manufacturers, software product providers and media services providers
in various industries worldwide use JPEG in their products, including many
digital cameras, personal computers, camera cell phones, scanners, printing
devices, video cameras, rendering devices, etc. The Company&#146;s &#145;672 patent
covers all of these types of products and accordingly, Forgent seeks to
commercialize the patent through license agreements with companies making,
using or selling these products. See Item&nbsp;7

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations of the Company &#150; Results of Operations&#148; for more detail.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Patent Licensing Program</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To date, the Company has signed several license agreements with
international consumer and commercial electronics firms. As a result of
pursuing license agreements related to the &#145;672 patent, Forgent&#146;s Patent
Licensing Program has aggregated over $94.5&nbsp;million in intellectual property
licensing revenues since inception of the program as of July&nbsp;31,
2004. The Company expends significant efforts and
expenses identifying potential licensees and negotiating license agreements.
During the negotiations, the Company typically seeks consideration for sales
made prior to the effective date of the license agreement, as well as a license
fee or royalties for future sales. Additionally, most of Forgent&#146;s license
agreements to date are fully paid upon signing and do not require
further payments. Management expects that most new license
agreements will follow this model.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgent recognizes intellectual property licensing revenues and the
related cost of sales in the period the license agreements are signed. The
cost of sales on the intellectual property licensing business relates to the
legal fees incurred on successfully achieving licensing revenues. Historically, Forgent&#146;s fee arrangement with its counsel engaged in
connection with Forgent&#146;s Patent Licensing Program was based on a
percentage of the licensing revenues received on signed agreements. The
payment was based on a sliding scale that began during the quarter ended
April&nbsp;30, 2002 at 35% and increased to 50% based on the aggregate
recoveries achieved. On October&nbsp;27, 2004, Forgent formally terminated
its counsel and is currently in discussions with the law firm regarding
the termination. Forgent has engaged new counsel to advise it in
connection with its Patent Licensing Program and is working with both
counsels to ensure a timely and efficient transition in legal services.
Presently, the Company has not yet finalized a new fee agreement with
its new counsel.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the current litigation as discussed in the following
&#147;Litigation&#148; section, Forgent will continue to pursue license agreements with
targeted companies, whether or not named in the litigation. Since the end of
fiscal 2004, Forgent has obtained additional licensing revenues and the Company
is continuing to actively seek to license other users of its technology.
Although management anticipates signing more patent license agreements with
other companies from various industries, there can be no assurance that
additional licenses can be obtained or, if obtained, that any new license
agreements will be on similar or favorable terms. Additionally, the timing of
signing the license agreements and the timing of the litigation results
continue to pose forecasting challenges, which inevitably causes peaks and
valleys in the Patent Licensing Program.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgent&#146;s Patent Licensing Program involves risks inherent in licensing
intellectual property, including risks of protracted delays, legal challenges
that would lead to disruption or curtailment of the licensing program,
increasing expenditures associated with pursuit of the program and other risks
that could adversely affect the Company&#146;s licensing program. Additionally, the
&#145;672 patent expires in October&nbsp;2006 in the United States and its foreign
counterparts expire in September&nbsp;2007. Thus, there can be no assurance that the
Company will be able to continue to effectively license its technology to other
companies. Additionally, there are no guarantees that the Company can protect
its intellectual property rights in its current litigation or prevent the
unauthorized use of its technology in the future. However, Forgent will
continue to enforce and pursue its rights through the legal system when
necessary.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Litigation</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During fiscal year 2004, Forgent initiated litigation against 31
technology companies for infringement of its &#145;672 patent (the &#147;&#145;672
Litigation&#148;). In August&nbsp;2004, the Company added 11 more technology companies.
Although the Company previously offered to provide a license of the &#145;672 patent
to these companies, including Canon USA, Dell Incorporated, Google Inc.,
International Business Machines Corp., Toshiba Corporation and Xerox
Corporation, none of the defendants chose to do so. Several defendants have
sued Forgent, claiming, among other assertions, that their products do not
infringe Forgent&#146;s patent and that the patent is invalid. Thus, the litigation
process of discovery and exchanging information and documents on infringement,
invalidity and damage contentions, is ongoing. Management believes the
litigation process is on track and has not discovered any new information that
would lead the Company to change its current plans. Due to uncertainties
inherent with litigation, management is unable to accurately predict the
ultimate outcome. Forgent anticipates that it will continue to incur
significant litigation costs and there can be no assurances that the Company
will be able to recover these costs.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June&nbsp;2004 and August&nbsp;2004, Forgent settled with two of the defendants;
one was a plaintiff in a suit filed against CLI and the Company related to the
&#145;672 patent. Forgent is also currently in discussions with other companies who
are defendants in the lawsuit. Therefore, management is encouraged that other
defendants, as well as companies not currently named in the lawsuit, will
choose to license the &#145;672 patent. See Item&nbsp;3 &#147;Legal Proceedings&#148; for more
detail.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to improve communication and information flow with its
stockholders regarding the complicated litigation process with the remaining 40
defendants, the Company has enhanced the intellectual property section of its
corporate website to include viewing of selected court filings and links to
related governmental websites.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Other Patents and Trademarks</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Company&#146;s inception, Forgent has designed, developed and
acquired strategies to find new and better ways to solve problems in its areas
of expertise. As these solutions were found, the Company patented and then
sought to commercialize these innovative technologies. The U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office and foreign patent offices have issued the Company several
dozen patents related to data compression, scheduling, videoconferencing,
systems management and other technologies developed or acquired by Forgent.
These patents comprise Forgent&#146;s diverse intellectual property portfolio.
Additionally, Forgent has several patent applications pending with the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office and anticipates continuing to pursue these pending
applications in order to protect its intellectual property. However, there can
be no assurance that Forgent&#146;s pending patents will be issued or that the
issued patents can be defended successfully. Management also plans to expand
the Company&#146;s intellectual property program beyond its current focus on its
patent related to data compression by attempting to enforce and license or sell
the Company&#146;s intellectual property rights with respect to its other patents.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has issued the Company the &#147;Forgent&#148;
trademark under its current business practices in the United States. The
Company was issued trademarks and service marks by the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office and by certain foreign countries and entities covering the
&#147;VTEL&#148; mark and the &#147;VTEL&#148; logo. These trademarks and service marks were sold
to VTEL Products Corporation as part of the sale of the products business
segment in fiscal year 2002. Forgent retained all patents related to its
discontinued products, integration and videoconferencing hardware services
businesses sold during fiscal years 2002 and 2003.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>SOFTWARE &#038; PROFESSIONAL SERVICES BUSINESS</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Background</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to competitive pressures compelling companies to improve their
critical business processes, the marketplace has witnessed a movement in which
companies are re-examining opportunities for fundamental business improvement.
Organizations of all sizes have realized that they can no longer schedule their
facilities and related logistics, such as equipment, catering and other
services, using a manual approach, which is fraught with inefficiencies such as
double-booked rooms, catering errors and other time-consuming, costly issues.
These inefficiencies have a significant negative business impact, including
decreased productivity, diffused communications and delayed decisions, thus
ultimately undermining the organization&#146;s competitiveness. As a result of
these inefficiencies, businesses have recognized a need for scheduling software
in order for them to streamline and optimize their approach to meeting
planning.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leveraging off of this desire to streamline operations and improve
efficiencies, Forgent&#146;s scheduling software enables customers to quickly
reserve rooms and other meeting logistics in a simplified manner. Because of
its built-in capabilities to notify all service providers on the back end,
needs such as special equipment and catering are communicated in advance and
services are provided on time and without error. Additionally, Forgent&#146;s asset
management software meets businesses&#146; need to efficiently and effectively
discover and track company assets such as computers, software, printers and
other network equipment. By streamlining and automating scheduling and office
administration tasks, Forgent helps reduce costs associated with day-to-day
office operations and increases productivity of those involved with meetings.
See Item&nbsp;7 &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations of the Company &#150; Results of Operations&#148; for more detail.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Products &#038; Services</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October&nbsp;2003, Forgent acquired software products from Network
Simplicity Software Inc. and has molded these products into the Company&#146;s
NetSimplicity software product line. NetSimplicity&#146;s flagship product, Meeting
Room&nbsp;Manager (&#147;MRM&#148;), provides a complete meeting and meeting room scheduling
solution in an easy-to-buy and easy-to-

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">
<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">deploy application. MRM enables users to instantly find and book
available meeting rooms, schedule meeting services, such as catering or audio
and visual devices, and invite attendees to the meeting. It provides a
powerful but easy-to-use web-based user interface, enabling everyone in an
organization to access the system without requiring software to be deployed at
each desktop. MRM also includes a SQL database and rich and extensible
reports, which provide management oversight into resource utilization and costs
associated with the meeting environment.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MRM is offered in two editions, Classroom Manager and Resource Scheduler.
Classroom Manager allows schools and other educational organizations to
customize scheduling of classrooms for their specific needs and allows
instructors and students to view class schedules via the Internet from anywhere
at anytime. Resource Scheduler allows businesses to schedule resources other
than meeting rooms, such as shared equipment or other resources, through an
intuitive and customizable interface.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to MRM, Forgent&#146;s current NetSimplicity software product line
also includes Visual Asset Manager (&#147;VAM&#148;) and Family Scheduler. VAM solves an
organization&#146;s needs to administer its information technology (&#147;IT&#148;) and fixed
assets by automatically locating IT assets, such as computers and software, and
tracks these assets as well as other office equipment, furniture and other
fixed assets. VAM provides a powerful but easy-to-use web-based interface that
makes it easy to deploy in any environment, enabling organizations to map and
display the locations of each asset on their floor plans as well as track
maintenance coverage, equipment leases, warranties, repairs and depreciation
for each asset in the inventory in a simple and cost-effective manner. Family
Scheduler is a robust scheduling system that allows busy families to
efficiently manage both single events and recurring events from one central
location as well as organize all of their contact information for emergencies,
schools, babysitters and other parents.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an extension of its software product offerings, Forgent offers its
customers maintenance and support contracts that provide ready access to
qualified support staff, software patches as necessary and upgrades to the
Company&#146;s next software version without any additional costs. Additionally,
Forgent also provides professional services for installation and training on
its software at the customer&#146;s request.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During fiscal year 2004, as well as in previous fiscal years, Forgent
provided other software products including ALLIANCE, which was launched in July
2003, Global Scheduling System (&#147;GSS&#148;) and Video Network Platform (&#147;VNP&#148;). The
ALLIANCE suite consisted of two main products: ALLIANCE SCHEDULER (&#147;SCHEDULER&#148;)
and ALLIANCE MEDIA MANAGER (&#147;MEDIA MANAGER&#148;), each with optional add-on
modules.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SCHEDULER, the enhanced product based on GSS which was originally acquired
in June&nbsp;2002, streamlines conference scheduling and empowers users to schedule
meetings quickly, easily and without significant investment in additional
training. This robust scheduling capability augments existing calendaring
applications such as Microsoft Outlook&#174; and Lotus Notes&#174; and is also accessible
via the Internet to support remote users and meeting environments that do not
have access to Microsoft Outlook&#174; or Lotus Notes&#174;. MEDIA MANAGER, the enhanced
product based on VNP, which was developed internally and originally released in
November&nbsp;2001, monitors and manages rich media communications and network
devices from multiple vendors in order to ensure interoperability. MEDIA
MANAGER&#146;s intuitive graphical user interface enables call administrators to
easily configure calls and manage companies&#146; audio and video devices, while
further enhancing the quality of service via real-time notifications and
diagnostics of faults. By combining SCHEDULER with MEDIA MANAGER, the entire
ALLIANCE solution allows a user to schedule highly complex multi-participant,
multi-time zone meetings and conferences, which are automatically launched on
time and with quality, thus eliminating the need for administrative oversight
of the conference.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to installation and training, the Company&#146;s professional
services, as related to its ALLIANCE product line, also included network
consulting, which provided evaluation of current and evolving network
requirements, preparation of capacity plans and development of migration and
implementation plans, and customized integration of ALLIANCE with existing
third-party applications or with customers&#146; proprietary in-house applications.
Due to Forgent&#146;s shift in its go-forward strategy related to its software
business, the ALLIANCE software products and related professional services are
no longer actively marketed.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Product Development</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The future success of Forgent&#146;s software products depends largely on the
Company&#146;s ability to develop innovative software solutions and to enhance its
current software products in order to satisfy an evolving range of customer
requirements and needs. The Company&#146;s development team, based in Richmond,
British Columbia, Canada, consists of skilled software developers, testers and
technical writers who work closely with sales and marketing teams to

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">build products based on market requirements, customer feedback and technical
support needs. See Item&nbsp;7 &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations of the Company &#150; Results of Operations &#150;
Research and Development&#148; for more detail.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fiscal year 2004 was a period of substantial accomplishment for the
Forgent development team, as it (1)&nbsp;introduced two major product releases,
Meeting Room&nbsp;Manager 2004 and Visual Asset Manager 2004, (2)&nbsp;launched two new
product editions designed to broaden the market application of MRM, Classroom

Manager and Resource Scheduler, and (3)&nbsp;responded to technical support needs of
a rapidly growing customer base of over 1,000 organizations. Additionally,
Forgent released a new product, Family Scheduler. Available both as an
installed software product, and as a hosted online offering, Family Scheduler
is Forgent&#146;s first consumer product offering.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgent&#146;s research and development strategy is to continue to enhance Meeting
Room&nbsp;Manager&#146;s functionality through new releases and new feature development
to satisfy the requirements of current and prospective customers. Forgent will
continue to evaluate opportunities and develop new software that enables
organizations to streamline the tasks associated with administering a business,
simultaneously allowing organizations to improve their productivity while
reducing costs associated with those tasks.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the Company&#146;s best efforts, there can be no assurance that Forgent
will complete its existing and future development efforts within the
anticipated schedule or that new and enhanced software products will adequately
meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance.
Additionally, Forgent may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent
the successful development or introduction of new or enhanced software
products. In the case of acquiring new or complementary software products or
technologies, the Company may not be able to integrate the acquisitions into
its current product line. Furthermore, despite extensive testing, errors may
be found in the Company&#146;s new software products or releases after shipment,
resulting in a diversion of development resources, increased service costs,
loss of revenue and/or delay in market acceptance.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Sales and Distribution</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgent sells its scheduling and asset management software principally
through a direct telesales model. The Company&#146; web and telesales business model
enables it to sell its software solutions in an efficient, cost-effective
manner. The prospect comes to Forgent&#146;s website, gathers the product
information needed, downloads the product for a 30-day free trial if desired
and then can either purchase the software via credit card on the website or
engage with a sales representative to purchase the software via purchase order.
Additionally, the Company supplements the efforts of its direct sales force
with its Partner Program. By working with these partners, Forgent expands the
reach of its direct sales force and gains access to key opportunities in major
market segments worldwide.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has two distinct levels of partners in its Partner Program:
the Reseller Partner and the Referral Partner. Reseller Partners are companies
that represent Forgent in geographies outside the United States or in the
Federal government as well as companies with video room integration projects or
information technology integration projects. The Reseller Partner commits to a
minimum level of business per year with the Company, and for that commitment
they receive a channel discount. Forgent has three Reseller Partners that
represent the Company&#146;s software outside the United States: BusinessSolve, Ltd.
in the United Kingdom, Meeting Manager, Gmbh in Germany and VPA in the
Asia/Pacific region. Additionally, Forgent has two Reseller Partners that
represent the Company&#146;s software in the Federal government space: CRV and AGT.
A Referral Partner provides the Company with the name and particular
information about a customer and their needs as a sales lead. If the Company
accepts the sales lead, registers it for a particular Referral Partner and
subsequently makes a sale as a direct result of such a lead, the Company will
pay the Referral Partner a sales lead referral fee. Currently Forgent&#146;s
Referral Partners include PolyVision Corp./Steelcase, Vmeals, e-Innovative
Solutions and Marenzana Group.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s software sales organization supporting the ALLIANCE product
line included telemarketing, inside sales, pre-sales engineers and field sales
territory managers. Due to Forgent&#146;s shift in its go-forward strategy related
to its software business, the ALLIANCE sales organization was terminated during
fiscal year 2004.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Competition</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the MRM product, a primary source of competition is point schedulers
that include vendor-specific and homegrown tools that corporations have
purchased or created to solve each individual scheduling problem in isolation
of other problems. These disparate solutions each have a unique interface and
users must be trained how to work with each separate tool. Additionally, many
organizations have adopted personal calendaring tools such as Microsoft
Outlook<SUP>&#174;</SUP> in an


<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt">8

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">
<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">attempt to meet their needs. These tools provide little in the way of
end-to-end scheduling and management of meetings and meeting rooms. MRM has
effectively delivered a unified meeting and meeting room management solution
that truly solves the organization&#146;s problems in an easy, affordable and
universally accessible manner. Management believes that no other product
combines these attributes and offers the value that MRM does to its customers.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The VAM product competes in a different marketplace: asset management in
general and IT asset management in particular, both of which are well-defined
and well-served software categories. VAM is differentiated by the strength of
its visual, floor-plan-oriented, user interface and its low price. Management
believes there is an opportunity to continue to enrich the VAM feature set
while maintaining price advantage to disrupt the more well-established products
in the marketplace.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Competition for the ALLIANCE products included a range of individual
products that provide some portion of the enterprise meeting automation
solution, including personal calendaring applications such as Microsoft
Outlook&#174; and Lotus Notes&#174;. Similar to MRM, ALLIANCE also competed against
point schedulers. Although Forgent effectively delivered a unified scheduling
and rich media platform that ties all the available tools and technologies into
a single enterprise meeting automation solution, price sensitivity and
integration with enterprise infrastructures prevented ALLIANCE from achieving
the market acceptance that management originally anticipated.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Marketing</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgent&#146;s software business has a large roster of more than 1,000 domestic
and international customers, including many Fortune 500 companies. The
consistent growth of the customer base relies on the development and
implementation of a comprehensive integrated marketing plan, which is primarily
aimed at reaching small to medium-sized businesses (&#147;SMBs&#148;) and departments of
enterprise organizations throughout the United States, Europe and Asia Pacific.
The integrated elements of Forgent&#146;s marketing plan include a mix of demand
generation, public relations and other corporate communications activities to
ensure a consistent and accurate flow of information to and from prospects,
customers and other key stakeholders.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&nbsp;2003, Forgent established NetSimplicity as a brand in order to
appeal more directly to its target audiences. Internal and external research
provided the foundation for a NetSimplicity brand plan, which took the form of
a new website, logos, product definitions and marketing support materials.
Demand generation activities were launched, utilizing direct mail, e-mail,
search engine optimization and online advertising. The primary marketing
mandate was to continually seek out new ways and make use of proven methods to
increase the demand for Meeting Room&nbsp;Manager, Classroom Manager, Resource
Scheduler, Visual Asset Manager and Family Scheduler.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the first half of fiscal year 2004, particular diligence was paid
to the marketing efforts surrounding the Company&#146;s ALLIANCE software suite.
Marketing efforts were targeted at Fortune 2000 and Global 1000 enterprises for
which meetings are a critical part of the business process either due to a
large meeting workforce, a geographically diverse workforce (i.e. many
corporate offices), and/or organizations that drive revenue as a result of
meetings. Due to Forgent&#146;s shift in its go-forward strategy related to its
software business, marketing efforts related to ALLIANCE were terminated during
the second half of fiscal year 2004.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>EMPLOYEES</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of July&nbsp;31, 2004, Forgent had 34 employees in the following

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Company continues to evolve its business strategy, Forgent&#146;s
workforce is continually evaluated and adjusted accordingly &#151; both in number
and composition. The Company occasionally hires contractors to support its
sales and marketing, engineering, information technology and administrative
functions. Forgent believes it retains the appropriate management team and
employees to fully implement its business strategy. None of the Company&#146;s
employees

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">
<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">are represented by a collective bargaining agreement. Forgent has not
experienced any work stoppages and considers its relations with its employees
to be good.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October&nbsp;6, 2003, Forgent acquired certain assets and the operations of
Network Simplicity Software Inc., a privately held provider of web-based
scheduling solutions. As a result of this acquisition, Forgent&#146;s workforce
grew by 10 employees: five employees in sales and marketing, three employees in
research and development; and two employees in administration. The acquired
workforce has remained based in Richmond, British Columbia, Canada.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The future performance of the Company depends largely on its continuing
ability to attract, train and retain highly qualified technical, sales,
service, marketing and managerial personnel. Forgent&#146;s development and
management of its growth and other activities depend on the efforts of key
management and technical employees. Competition for such personnel is intense.
The Company uses incentives, including competitive compensation and stock
option plans to attract and retain well-qualified employees and generally does
not have employment agreements with key management personnel or technical
employees. Forgent&#146;s future success is dependent upon its ability to
effectively attract, retain, train, motivate and manage its employees. However,
there can be no assurance that the Company will continue to attract and retain
personnel with the requisite capabilities and experience. The loss of one or
more of Forgent&#146;s key management or technical personnel could have a material
and adverse effect on its business and operating results.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>EXECUTIVE OFFICERS</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgent&#146;s executive officers are as follows:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard N. Snyder, age 60, joined the Company&#146;s Board of Directors in
December of 1997 and became Chairman of the Board in March&nbsp;2000. In June&nbsp;2001
Mr.&nbsp;Snyder was named Forgent&#146;s President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr.
Snyder has over 28&nbsp;years of senior management experience, including Founder and
Chief Executive Officer at Corum Cove Consulting, LLC, Senior Vice President of
Worldwide Sales, Marketing, Service and Support at Compaq Computer Corporation,
and Group General Manager at Hewlett-Packard. Mr.&nbsp;Snyder received a Masters in
Business Administration from Saint Mary&#146;s College and a Bachelor of Science
from Southern Illinois University.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jay C. Peterson, age 47, joined the Company in September&nbsp;1995 as Manager
of Corporate Planning and has served as Chief Financial Officer and Vice
President of Finance since May&nbsp;2000. Prior to joining the Company, Mr.&nbsp;Peterson
performed as Assistant Controller with the Dell Direct Channel that generated
$1&nbsp;billion in annual sales at Dell Computer Corporation and held various
financial positions during 11&nbsp;years with IBM Corporation. Mr.&nbsp;Peterson holds a
Masters in Business Administration and a Bachelor of Arts in Economics from the
University of Wisconsin.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kenneth A. Kalinoski, age 44, joined the Company in February&nbsp;2001 as
Vice-President &#151; Development, currently serves as Chief Technology Officer, and
is responsible for all aspects of technology for the Company. Mr.&nbsp;Kalinoski&#146;s
previous 20-year career focused on client/server and communications technology.
He was the founder, company officer, and Vice-President of Development at
Netpliance from February&nbsp;1999 to January&nbsp;2001 and was responsible for
delivering the first information appliance to the consumer marketplace. Prior
to that, Mr.&nbsp;Kalinoski spent 17&nbsp;years at IBM and held multiple management
positions, including director of IBM PC Systems and Licensing (1998), program
director of IBM Multimedia Systems (1995-1997), and program director of AIX
Development ( 1993 to 1995). Mr.&nbsp;Kalinoski received a Masters in Computer
Engineering from State University of New York and a Bachelor of Science from
Wilkes University and currently holds five patents.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nancy L. Harris, age 41, joined the company in October&nbsp;2001 as
Vice-President of Marketing, currently serves as Vice-President of Software and
is responsible for the daily operations of the Company&#146;s software business.
Ms.&nbsp;Harris has 18&nbsp;years experience in the software industry, serving in both
marketing and development capacities. Prior to joining the Company, Ms.&nbsp;Harris
was the Director of Marketing and Product Management at Clear Commerce, an
Internet transaction-processing software company (2000 to 2001). Prior to that,
Ms.&nbsp;Harris spent eight years with BMC Software in various positions including
Director of Field Marketing, Director of Product Marketing and Development
Manager. Ms.&nbsp;Harris also spent several years with Andersen Consulting in
various capacities. Ms.&nbsp;Harris holds a Masters of Science in Marketing and a
Bachelor of Science in Journalism from Northwestern University.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgent&#146;s headquarters, product development and sales and marketing
facility leases approximately 137,000 square feet at Wild Basin in Austin,
Texas under a lease that expires in March&nbsp;2013. As a result of the sale of the
products business segment during fiscal year 2002, 52,000 square feet of this
space was vacated by the VTEL group. Additionally, Forgent had existing
unoccupied leased space inventory due to the downsizing of the Company on
account of past restructurings. Therefore, during the 2002 fiscal year, Forgent
actively engaged in subleasing its available area and incurred a charge of $2.0
million related to these lease impairments. During fiscal year 2003, Forgent
was able to sublease the vacated space quicker than originally anticipated;
however, the rates on the subleases were considerably less than originally
anticipated due to then current depressed market rates. Therefore, management
calculated the economic value of the lost sublease rental income and recorded
an additional charge of $0.5&nbsp;million. During fiscal year 2004, the current
depressed market rates continued to drive rates on the subleases to levels less
than anticipated. As a result, management calculated the economic value of the
lost sublease rental income and recorded an additional charge of $1.5&nbsp;million.
As of July&nbsp;31, 2004, Forgent had $1.9&nbsp;million recorded as a liability on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet related to its Wild Basin property. Currently, the
Company occupies approximately 29,000 square feet, subleases approximately
82,000 square feet and anticipates continuing to sublease the remaining
under-utilized space.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgent&#146;s discontinued videoconferencing hardware services business
partially occupies a facility of approximately 41,000 square feet in King
of Prussia, Pennsylvania, which the Company leases through June&nbsp;2006. As a
result of the sale of Forgent&#146;s videoconferencing hardware services business to
an affiliate of Gores Technology Group (&#147;Gores&#148;) in fiscal year 2003, a portion
of the total lease space was subleased to Gores. Gores and another subtenant
currently sublease 100% of the total lease space. Since management was unable
to sublease the space at the Company&#146;s lease rate, management calculated the
economic value of the lost sublease rental income and recorded in discontinued
operations a one-time charge of $0.5&nbsp;million for the lease impairment related
to its Pennsylvania facility in fiscal year 2003. As of July&nbsp;31, 2004, Forgent
had $0.2&nbsp;million recorded as a liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet
related to its King of Prussia property.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the acquisition of Network Simplicity Software Inc. in October&nbsp;2003,
Forgent also holds approximately 3,000 square feet of office space in Richmond,
British Columbia, Canada. Management believes that the facility in Austin,
Texas is adequate to meet Forgent&#146;s current requirements and can accommodate
further physical expansion of corporate and development operations, as well as
additional sales and marketing offices as needed.

<!-- link2 "ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS" -->

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is the defendant or plaintiff in various actions that arose in
the normal course of business. In the opinion of management, the ultimate
disposition of these matters, including those discussed below, may have a
material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s financial condition or results of
operations. With the exception of the proceedings described below, none of the
pending legal proceedings to which the Company is a party involves claims for
damages in excess of 10% of the Company&#146;s current assets for the period covered
by this report.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April&nbsp;2004, Forgent&#146;s wholly-owned subsidiary, Compression Labs, Inc.
(&#147;CLI&#148;), initiated litigation against 31 companies for infringement of United
States Patent No.&nbsp;4,698,672 in the United States District Court for the Eastern
District of Texas, Marshall Division, seeking injunctive relief against sales
of infringing products and monetary damages, among other relief sought. The
defendants consist of Adobe Systems Incorporated; Agfa Corporation; Apple
Computer, Incorporated; Axis Communications, Incorporated; Cannon USA; Concord
Camera Corporation; Creative Labs, Incorporated; Dell Incorporated; Eastman
Kodak Company; Fuji Photo Film Co U.S.A.; Fujitsu Computer Products of America;
Gateway, Inc.; Hewlett-Packard Company; International Business Machines Corp.;
JASC Software; JVC Americas Corporation; Kyocera Wireless Corporation;
Macromedia, Inc.; Matsushita Electric Corporation of America; Oce&#146; North
America, Incorporated; Onkyo Corporation; PalmOne, Inc.; Panasonic
Communications Corporation of America; Panasonic Mobile Communications
Development Corporation of USA; Ricoh Corporation; Riverdeep, Incorporated
(d.b.a. Broderbund); Savin Corporation; Thomson S.A.; Toshiba Corporation; and
Xerox Corporation. Additionally, in August&nbsp;2004, CLI initiated litigation
against another 11 companies for infringement of United States Patent No.
4,698,672. The defendants consist of Acer America Corporation; AudioVox
Corporation; BancTec, Inc.; BenQ America Corporation; Color Dreams, Inc. (d/b/a
StarDot Technologies); Google Inc.; ScanSoft, Inc.; Sun Microsystems Inc.; TiVo
Inc.; Veo Inc.; and Yahoo! Inc. Forgent has since settled with two of the
defendants.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty-four of the defendants have filed against CLI and Forgent in the
U.S. Federal Court for Delaware, seeking declaratory relief that the &#145;672
patent is not infringed, is unenforceable, and is invalid, among other
assertions.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">
<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Additionally, three other defendants have filed suit against CLI and
Forgent in the U.S. District Court for Northern California, San Jose Division,
the U.S. District Court for Delaware and the U.S. District Court for Northern
California, Oakland Division, seeking similar declaratory relief. Forgent and
CLI have moved to stay, dismiss or transfer the Delaware actions, asserting
that all such issues should be heard in the U.S. District for the Eastern
District, Marshall Division, rather than in Delaware. Although Forgent is
currently unaware of any other suits against CLI and itself, it is possible
that other defendants, and/or other accused infringers, could join in the
pending Delaware actions or file similar suits for declaratory relief in
Delaware or elsewhere.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&nbsp;2003, the Company received notification from the Federal Trade
Commission (the &#147;FTC&#148;) that it is conducting a non-public investigation to
determine whether the Company may have engaged in violation of the Federal
Trade Commission Act by reason of the alleged involvement of CLI in the JPEG
standard-setting process during the 1980&#146;s and very early 1990&#146;s and its
subsequent licensing of the &#145;672 patent, which the Company believes is
infringed by the implementation of that standard. If the FTC proceeds with an
investigation and thereafter determines that the Company acted improperly,
further proceedings before the FTC could ensue, which could result in a
challenge to the Company&#146;s &#145;672 patent licensing program. The Company believes
that CLI has not acted improperly and advised the FTC as such. In April&nbsp;2004,
Forgent received a Subpoena Duces Tecum (&#147;Subpoena&#148;) and a Civil Investigative
Demand (&#147;CID&#148;) in this FTC proceeding. The Company responded in May&nbsp;2004 by
filing a petition to quash and/or limit the Subpoena and CID. Forgent has not
since received any further communication from the FTC on this matter.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February&nbsp;2003, the Company received a letter from legal counsel for the
independent executrix of the Estate of Gordon Matthews, asserting that the
Company was obligated to pay the independent executrix of the Estate of Gordon
Matthews for the asserted value of services claimed to have been rendered by
Mr.&nbsp;Matthews in connection with his alleged involvement in the Company&#146;s Patent
Licensing Program. In February&nbsp;2003, the Company initiated an action in the
261st District Court in Travis County Texas, styled Forgent Networks, Inc. v.
Monika Matthews, et al., for the purposes of declaring that the Company has no
obligation to the defendant. In that action, the defendant has filed a counter
claim asserting that the independent executrix of the Estate of Gordon Matthews
is entitled to recover in quantum meruit for the reasonable value of the work
and services claimed to have been provided by Gordon Matthews, a former member
of the board of directors and consultant to the Company, which the defendant
asserts is at least $5.0&nbsp;million. The Company does not believe the counter
claim has merit and intends to continue to vigorously pursue declaratory relief
from the court that no liability is due to the independent executrix of the
Estate of Gordon Matthews.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intellectual property licensing revenues were $31.2&nbsp;million in fiscal year
2002, $48.9&nbsp;million in fiscal year 2003 and $14.5&nbsp;million in fiscal year 2004.
The increase was $17.7&nbsp;million, or 57.1% from 2002 to 2003. The decrease was
$34.4&nbsp;million, or 70.5%, from 2003 to 2004. Intellectual property licensing
revenues represent 93.3%, 90.8% and 82.7% of total revenues for the years ended
July&nbsp;31, 2002, 2003 and 2004 respectively. The Company began realizing revenue
from its Patent Licensing Program during fiscal year 2002 and during the past
ten consecutive quarters has achieved over $94.5&nbsp;million in aggregate revenues
generated from international consumer and commercial electronics firms in
multiple countries, including the United States. These licensing revenues
relate to one-time intellectual property license agreements with companies for
Forgent&#146;s data compression technology embodied in U.S. Patent No.&nbsp;4,698,672 and
its foreign counterparts, which cover several types of products including many
digital cameras, personal computers, camera cell phones, scanners, printing
devices, video cameras, rendering devices and other technologies. Licensing of
the &#145;672 patent is currently conducted through the Company&#146;s wholly-owned
subsidiary, Compression Labs, Inc. (&#147;CLI&#148;). Historically, Forgent&#146;s licensing
revenues have been primarily generated from foreign-based corporations. During
fiscal year 2004, the trend changed and Forgent&#146;s licensing revenues were
primarily generated from U.S. based corporations. However, uncertainties
remain and there are no assurances that the Company will continue this trend
and derive future licensing revenues primarily from domestic companies. In
addition, the Company does not anticipate any additional

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">licensing revenue from the companies that it currently holds license agreements
with, but Forgent will continue to actively seek new licenses from its &#145;672
patent as well as licensing opportunities from other patents in its
intellectual property portfolio.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During fiscal year 2004, Forgent initiated litigation against 31
technology companies for infringement of its &#145;672 patent. In August&nbsp;2004, the Company added 11 more technology companies.
Although the Company previously offered to provide a license of the &#145;672 patent
to these companies, including Canon USA, Dell Incorporated, Google Inc.,
International Business Machines Corp., Toshiba Corporation and Xerox
Corporation, none of the defendants chose to do so. Several defendants have
sued Forgent, claiming, among other assertions, that their products do not
infringe Forgent&#146;s patent and that the patent is invalid. In June&nbsp;2004 and
August&nbsp;2004, Forgent settled with two of the defendants; one was a plaintiff in
a suit filed against CLI and the Company related to the &#145;672 patent. Forgent
is also currently in discussions with other companies who are defendants in the
lawsuit. Therefore, management is optimistic that other defendants, as well as
companies not currently named in the lawsuit, will choose to license the &#145;672
patent. In addition to the current litigation, Forgent will continue to pursue
license agreements with targeted companies, whether or not named in the
litigation. The timing of signing the license agreements and the timing of the
litigation results continue to pose forecasting challenges, which inevitably
causes peaks and valleys in the Patent Licensing Program. See Item&nbsp;3 &#147;Legal
Proceedings&#148; for more detail.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there continues to be uncertainties and risks related to the
Company&#146;s Patent Licensing Program, management anticipates generating revenues
from its intellectual property licensing segment during fiscal year 2005.
Forgent&#146;s Patent Licensing Program involves risks inherent in licensing
intellectual property, including risks of protracted delays, legal challenges
that would lead to disruption or curtailment of the licensing program,
increasing expenditures associated with pursuit of the licensing program, and
other risks that could adversely affect the Company&#146;s licensing program.
Additionally, the U.S. patent, which has generated the intellectual property
licensing revenues, expires in October&nbsp;2006 and its foreign counterparts expire
in September&nbsp;2007. Thus, there can be no assurance that the Company will be
able to continue to effectively license its technology to other companies.
Additionally, there are no guarantees that the Company can protect its
intellectual property rights in its current litigation or prevent the
unauthorized use of its technology in the future. However, Forgent will
continue to enforce and pursue its rights through the legal system when
necessary.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Software and professional services revenues were $2.2&nbsp;million in fiscal
year 2002, $4.4&nbsp;million in fiscal year 2003 and $3.0&nbsp;million in fiscal year
2004. The increase was $2.2&nbsp;million, or 95.1%, from 2002 to 2003. The
decrease was $1.4&nbsp;million, or 31.3%, from 2003 to 2004. Software and
professional services revenues represent 6.7%, 8.1% and 17.2% of total revenues
for the years ended July&nbsp;31, 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively. Revenues from
this line of business include sales of Forgent&#146;s NetSimplicity scheduling and
asset management software as well as the Company&#146;s ALLIANCE enterprise meeting
automation software. The NetSimplicity software includes Meeting Room&nbsp;Manager,
Visual Asset Manager, Resource Scheduler, Classroom Manager and Family
Scheduler. Also included in this line of business&#146; revenues are software
maintenance, royalties and professional services, such as add-on software
customization, installation and training, and network consulting services.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The $1.4&nbsp;million decrease in software and professional services revenues
for the year ended July&nbsp;31, 2004, as compared to the year ended July&nbsp;31, 2003,
was due primarily to a $2.5&nbsp;million decrease in revenues from the ALLIANCE
software products and related hardware and services sales. Despite the initial
success of ALLIANCE, during the second fiscal quarter of 2004 management
learned that while indicators of demand existed for ALLIANCE, issues regarding
price sensitivity, lengthy sales cycle and integration with enterprise
infrastructures were preventing ALLIANCE from achieving the revenues that
management originally anticipated. As a result, the Company decided to shift
its go-forward strategy for this segment and focus its efforts and resources on
its NetSimplicity software product line.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October&nbsp;2003, Forgent acquired the assets and operations of Network
Simplicity Software Inc., including its flagship product, Meeting Room&nbsp;Manager,
a scheduling application. As a result of the acquisition, the acquired
software products were molded into the Company&#146;s &#147;NetSimplicity&#148; software
product line and the NetSimplicity&#146;s results of operations since October&nbsp;6,
2003 have been included in the Company&#146;s Consolidated Statement of Operations.
The $2.5&nbsp;million decrease in revenues from the ALLIANCE product line was offset
by a $1.0&nbsp;million increase in revenues from the NetSimplicity product line.
The demand and growing revenues from the NetSimplicity product line is
attributable to the software&#146;s robust capability, ease of use and low pricing
that easily fits into businesses&#146; current budgets. During fiscal year 2004,
sales of the NetSimplicity software were targeted primarily to the Education,
Healthcare and Legal industries. Forgent currently has distribution partners
in the United Kingdom, Germany and Australia and continues to search for
additional distribution partners in key geographies around the world in order
to grow revenues in the global market. Management believes the NetSimplicity
software business will continue to be a growth business during fiscal year
2005.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During fiscal year 2003, existing customers upgraded their VNP and GSS
software, prospects used the software on a trial basis and several new
customers installed ALLIANCE, Forgent&#146;s then newly developed software product,
which was introduced in July&nbsp;2003 and was an expansion of the functionalities
in its VNP and GSS software. The $2.2&nbsp;million increase in software and
professional services revenues for the year ended July&nbsp;31, 2003, as compared to
the year ended July&nbsp;31, 2002, was due to the Company gaining momentum with its
VNP, GSS and ALLIANCE software products in the marketplace. This momentum was
short-lived as described above.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other revenues were $0.0&nbsp;million in fiscal year 2002, $0.6&nbsp;million in
fiscal year 2003 and $22 thousand in fiscal year 2004. The increase was $0.6
million from 2002 to 2003 and the decrease was $0.5&nbsp;million, or 96.1%, from
2003 to 2004. Other revenues represent 0.0%, 1.1% and 0.1% of total revenues
for the years ended July&nbsp;31, 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively. During the
year ended July&nbsp;31, 2003, the Company subcontracted several integration
projects to SPL Integrated Solutions (&#147;SPL&#148;), which had purchased Forgent&#146;s
integration business during fiscal year 2002. As a result of these
subcontracts, Forgent recorded $0.6&nbsp;million in other revenue during the 2003
fiscal year. During the first fiscal quarter of 2004, Forgent completed its
final integration project and recorded $22 thousand in other revenues. As of
October&nbsp;31, 2003, Forgent no longer subcontracted any integration projects to
SPL and referred all of its integration customers directly to SPL.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Gross Margin</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consolidated gross margins were $14.6&nbsp;million in fiscal year 2002, $25.5
million in fiscal year 2003 and $3.3&nbsp;million in fiscal year 2004. The increase
was $10.9&nbsp;million, or 74.4%, from 2002 to 2003. The decrease was $22.2
million, or 87.1%, from 2003 to 2004. Consolidated gross margin percentages
were 43.9% for fiscal year 2002, 47.4% for fiscal year 2003 and 18.9% for
fiscal year 2004.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The $22.2&nbsp;million decrease in gross margin, as well as the related
decrease in gross margin as a percentage of total revenues, for the year ended
July&nbsp;31, 2004, is due primarily to the $17.2&nbsp;million decrease in gross margin
resulting from the patent license agreements obtained during fiscal year 2004.
Similarly, the $10.9&nbsp;million increase in gross margin, as well as the related
increase in gross margin as a percentage of total revenues, for the year ended
July&nbsp;31, 2003, is due primarily to the $8.0&nbsp;million increase in gross margin
resulting from the patent license agreements obtained during fiscal year 2003.
The cost of sales on the intellectual property licensing business relates to

the legal fees incurred on successfully achieving licensing revenues. The contingent legal fees were based on 50% of the licensing
revenues received on signed agreements and were paid to Forgent&#146;s
previous counsel pursuant to a fee agreement with such counsel.
Forgent has terminated such counsel and is currently in discussions
with the law firm regarding the termination. See Item&nbsp;1 &#147;Business
 &#151; Intellectual Property Licensing Business &#151; Patent Licensing
Program&#148; for more detail. Because of the inherent
risks in licensing intellectual property, including the October&nbsp;2006 expiration
of the U.S. patent and the September&nbsp;2007 expiration of the patent&#146;s foreign
counterparts, total gross margins could be adversely affected in the future if
licensing revenues decline.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to declining ALLIANCE revenues, management started in January&nbsp;2004 to
review its software segment and the related cash flows from its ALLIANCE and
NetSimplicity product lines in order to re-evaluate its strategy regarding
growing revenues from this segment. Based on the projected negative cash flows
related to ALLIANCE, Forgent fully impaired the $4.7&nbsp;million in net capitalized
software development costs and $90 thousand of certain prepaid assets that
specifically supported ALLIANCE, resulting in $4.8&nbsp;million being charged to
cost of sales for the software segment. This impairment represented 69.9% of
the software and professional services&#146; cost of sales during fiscal year 2004
and caused the gross margin for the segment to be (130.9%). Without the effect
of the impairment, the gross margin for the software segment would have been
30.4% for the year ended July&nbsp;31, 2004. Of the remaining $2.1&nbsp;million cost of
sales in fiscal year 2004, 89.5% of the costs associated with the software and
professional services business resulted from the amortization of the Company&#146;s
capitalized software development costs, depreciation and labor. Since the cost
of sales from this line of business is relatively fixed, decreases in software
and professional services revenues could adversely affect total gross margins.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s OnScreen24&#153; operations, which were folded back into
Forgent&#146;s core operations in January&nbsp;2001, developed a video streaming
technology, which is a server application with the abilities to create video
e-mail programs and to store streamed video for playback. Initially,
management intended to leverage these efforts and further develop this
technology as an added feature to its previous VNP software. Based upon
customer feedback regarding the VNP software during fiscal year 2002, customers
did not need advanced features but desired fundamental network management
applications with more robust device level support and valued added network
level instrumentation for ISDN and IP networks. Therefore, management
determined the video streaming technology would not be used in the development
of VNP. As a result, the $2.4&nbsp;million capitalized software development costs
associated with the video streaming technology was impaired during the year
ended July&nbsp;31, 2002. This impairment represented 58.7% of the

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">software and professional services&#146; cost of sales during fiscal year 2002 and
caused the gross margin for the segment to be (81.4%). Of the remaining $1.7
million cost of sales in fiscal year 2002, 64.3% of the costs associated with
the software and professional services business resulted from the amortization
of the Company&#146;s capitalized software development costs and labor. Similarly,
approximately 61.7% of the software and professional services cost of sales
during the year ended July&nbsp;31, 2003 resulted from the amortization of the
Company&#146;s capitalized software development costs and labor.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of sales associated with other revenues during the years ended
July&nbsp;31, 2003 and July&nbsp;31, 2004 relate to the costs incurred to complete the
Company&#146;s remaining integration projects. The gross margin for the integration
projects during fiscal years 2003 and 2004 were 12.2% and (9.1%), respectively.
Since Forgent no longer has any remaining integration projects as of July&nbsp;31,
2004, the low and negative gross margins from this line of business will not
affect the Company&#146;s financial results in future periods.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Selling, General and Administrative</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selling, general and administrative (&#147;SG&#038;A&#148;) expenses were $8.5&nbsp;million in
fiscal year 2002, $11.0&nbsp;million in fiscal year 2003 and $12.2&nbsp;million in fiscal
year 2004. The increases were $2.5&nbsp;million, or 29.3%, from 2002 to 2003 and
$1.2&nbsp;million, or 11.2%, from 2003 to 2004. SG&#038;A expenses were 25.5%, 20.4% and
70.1% of total revenues for the years ended July&nbsp;31, 2002, 2003 and 2004,
respectively.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the year ended July&nbsp;31, 2004, SG&#038;A expenses increased $1.2&nbsp;million.
Approximately $2.4&nbsp;million of the increase in SG&#038;A expenses is attributable to
increases in corporate expenses, professional fees and marketing expenses,
which are offset by approximately a $1.2&nbsp;million decrease in compensation
expenses. Forgent allocates certain corporate operating expenses to its
segments. Since the Company sold its videoconferencing hardware services
business during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2003, the operations of which are
shown as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements, the
Company had one less segment to allocate corporate operating expenses to and
thus, SG&#038;A expenses from continuing operations increased by an additional $1.4
million during the year ended July&nbsp;31, 2004. In attempts to generate increased
revenues for the Company, Forgent incurred $0.6&nbsp;million more in professional
fees during the year ended July&nbsp;31, 2004, the majority of which is attributable
to consulting and legal expenses related to the Company&#146;s mergers and
acquisitions efforts. Additionally, during fiscal year 2004, Forgent&#146;s
marketing expenses increased by $0.4&nbsp;million over fiscal year 2003 due
primarily to expenses related to generating demand for the ALLIANCE software
products, which were launched in July&nbsp;2003, and the NetSimplicity software
products, which were acquired in October&nbsp;2003. As a result of the
restructuring executed during the third fiscal quarter of 2004, certain
lay-offs during the year and attrition, the increases in corporate expenses,
professional fees and marketing expenses are offset by approximately $1.2
million in decreased compensation expenses.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the &#145;672 litigation, management anticipates that the
Company may incur significant litigation costs during fiscal year 2005. Due to
uncertainties inherent with litigation, management is unable to accurately
predict the ultimate outcome and thus, there can be no assurances that the
Company will be able to recover these costs. Additionally, management expects
SG&#038;A expenses may increase due to increased costs to comply with the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Until the software business becomes profitable, management
does not anticipate significant increases or decreases in SG&#038;A expenses for its
software segment during fiscal year 2005. Forgent will continue, however, its
attempts to further decrease any unnecessary SG&#038;A expenses, including corporate
expenses, that do not directly support the generation of revenues for the
Company without impacting the Company&#146;s ability to do business.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgent reviews potential customers&#146; credit ratings to evaluate customers&#146;
ability to pay an obligation within the payment term before extending any new
or additional credit. The Company follows its credit policy consistently and
constantly monitors all of its accounts for indications of uncollectability.
During the year ended July&nbsp;31, 2004, Forgent recorded $0.3&nbsp;million in bad debt
expense related to its accounts receivable, approximately 88.7% of which is due
to three customers&#146; accounts. The uncollectability of one account resulted
from the customer&#146;s current inability to pay timely and the uncollectability of
the other two accounts resulted from the Company&#146;s shift away from its ALLIANCE
software products. During fiscal year 2004, management turned these accounts
over to a third party for increased collection efforts with minimal success.
Therefore, these three accounts were written-off, accounting for 95.5% of the
Company&#146;s total write-offs in fiscal year 2004. Forgent intends to continue
aggressively pursuing collection from all of its other customers. As of July
31, 2004, approximately 6.7% of Forgent&#146;s remaining trade accounts receivable
were aged past 90&nbsp;days, all of which were related to ALLIANCE and reserved for
in accordance with the Company&#146;s policy (see Note 2, in the accompanying
financial statements).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the year ended July&nbsp;31, 2003, SG&#038;A expenses increased $2.5&nbsp;million.
Approximately 69.1% of this increase is due to Forgent&#146;s Patent Licensing
Program incurring additional consulting expenses, national and international
travel expenses and other associated expenses as compared to the year ending
July&nbsp;31, 2002. Additionally, Forgent

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">increased spending related to the ramp-up efforts in the sales
organization and the launch of its ALLIANCE software products in July&nbsp;2003.
These additional expenditures largely account for the remaining 30.9% of the
increase during the 2003 fiscal year.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Research and Development</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research and development (&#147;R&#038;D&#148;) expenses were $3.2&nbsp;million in fiscal year
2002, $3.8&nbsp;million in fiscal year 2003 and $4.0&nbsp;million in fiscal year 2004.
The increases were $0.6&nbsp;million, or 20.5%, from 2002 to 2003 and $0.2&nbsp;million,
or 4.9%, from 2003 to 2004. R&#038;D expenses were 9.6%, 7.2% and 23.2% of total
revenues for the years ended July&nbsp;31, 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout fiscal year 2004, Forgent continued its efforts on developing
its Meeting Room&nbsp;Manager and Visual Asset Manager software products as well as
developing and supporting its ALLIANCE software products. In November&nbsp;2003,
Forgent released Meeting Room&nbsp;Manager 2004, which significantly improved the
web client by providing many of the administrative functions, such as location
management, filter management, options, etc. that were previously only
available in the network client. The Company&#146;s latest version of its
NetSimplicity product line provides virtual meetings from users&#146; desktops
across one or multiple offices and allows web client users to create advanced
recurring meetings. Additionally, the new &#147;MRM Assistant&#148; performs automated
functions such as sending meeting reminders to attendees, generating web-based
reports, periodically archiving reservations and alerting administrators of
certain actions. Administrators can track the status of the equipment in
inventory, customize any detail or search form in the web client, as well as
define rules based on reservation information, such as limiting the number of
people in certain meeting rooms and identifying selected users with the ability
to reserve equipment for a meeting room. The Company is currently developing
its next versions of Meeting Room&nbsp;Manager and Visual Asset Manager.
Additionally, in May&nbsp;2004 Forgent released a new product, Family Scheduler,
which is designed to help parents effortlessly keep track, by family member, of
daily events for school, extra-curricular activities, doctor&#146;s appointments,
vacations, etc. Available both as an installed software product, and as a
hosted online offering, Family Scheduler is Forgent&#146;s first consumer product
offering.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During fiscal year 2004, the Company also released ALLIANCE 4.1, which
added several enhancements including abilities to support new audio and video
devices, create more sophisticated reports and delegate scheduling
responsibilities, enhanced international dialing rules, and improved Microsoft
Exchange synchronization. Forgent also released ALLIANCE 4.2, which integrated
web conferencing services into the ALLIANCE meeting automation platform and
allowed for a single conference to be connected by multiple &#147;cascaded&#148; bridges
in order to connect multiple participants who would otherwise not all fit on
one bridge or would be too costly to be serviced by one bridge.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The R&#038;D expenses were net of $3.5&nbsp;million, $2.8&nbsp;million and $0.9&nbsp;million
capitalized during the years ended July&nbsp;31, 2002, 2003 and 2004 respectively.
Software development costs are capitalized after a product is determined to be
technologically feasible and is in the process of being developed for market.
At the time the product is released for sale, the capitalized software is
amortized over the estimated economic life of the related projects, generally
three years, using the straight-line method. The software development costs
capitalized during the 2002, 2003 and 2004 fiscal years were related to the
continued efforts on enhancing Forgent&#146;s GSS, renamed as ALLIANCE SCHEDULER,
and Forgent&#146;s VNP, renamed as ALLIANCE MEDIA MANAGER. Due to the decrease in
software and professional services revenues and Forgent&#146;s shift in its
go-forward strategy for its software segment during fiscal year 2004, Forgent
evaluated the recoverability of its long-lived assets, including the
capitalized software development costs, related to the ALLIANCE efforts in
accordance with SFAS No.&nbsp;86, &#147;Accounting for the Costs of Software to Be Sold,
Leased, or Otherwise Marketed,&#148; and SFAS No.&nbsp;144, &#147;Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.&#148; Based on the projected negative
cash flows related to ALLIANCE, Forgent fully impaired $4.7&nbsp;million in net
capitalized software development costs as of January&nbsp;31, 2004. All of the
impaired capitalized software development costs was related to ALLIANCE and as
of July&nbsp;31, 2004, Forgent no longer had any capitalized software development
costs recorded on its Consolidated Balance Sheet.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total research and development expenditures from continuing operations,
including software development costs that were capitalized, were $6.7&nbsp;million
in fiscal year 2002, $6.7&nbsp;million in fiscal year 2003 and $5.0&nbsp;million in
fiscal year 2004. The decreases were $54.7 thousand, or 0.0%, from 2002 to 2003
and $1.7&nbsp;million, or 25.9%, from 2003 to 2004. During the year ended July&nbsp;31,
2004, total R&#038;D expenses decreased $1.7&nbsp;million. Approximately $1.4&nbsp;million,
or 80.5%, of this decrease is attributable to decreases in compensation
expenses. Due to the restructuring of its software operations during fiscal
year 2004, Forgent terminated 22 employees in research and development.
Additionally, nine employees terminated their employment voluntarily. These
employment terminations caused the decrease in compensation expenses during the
year ended July&nbsp;31, 2004. Although the total R&#038;D expenditures did not change
significantly from 2002 to 2003, R&#038;D expenses for the year ended July&nbsp;31, 2003
increased $0.7&nbsp;million due primarily to solving complications with the then
newly acquired GSS software during the first part of that fiscal year and to
more expenses incurred in supporting

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the second fiscal quarter of 2004, Forgent faced declining revenues
related to its ALLIANCE software products and services. On the other hand,
Forgent experienced increasing revenues related to its NetSimplicity software
products and services. Additionally, management learned that while indicators
of demand existed for ALLIANCE, issues regarding price sensitivity, lengthy
sales cycle and integration with enterprise infrastructures were preventing
ALLIANCE from achieving the revenues that management originally anticipated.
Starting in January&nbsp;2004, management reviewed its software segment, the related
cash flows from its ALLIANCE and NetSimplicity product lines and re-evaluated
its strategy regarding growing revenues from this segment. As a result, the
ALLIANCE assets were impaired.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to SFAS No.&nbsp;86, &#147;Accounting for the Costs of Software to Be Sold,
Leased, or Otherwise Marketed,&#148; and SFAS No.&nbsp;144, &#147;Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,&#148; Forgent evaluated the
recoverability of its long-lived assets, including the equipment and
capitalized software development costs, related to the ALLIANCE efforts. Based
on the projected negative cash flows related to ALLIANCE, Forgent fully
impaired the $4.7&nbsp;million in net capitalized software development costs and
$0.2&nbsp;million in equipment related to ALLIANCE. Additionally, Forgent impaired
$0.1&nbsp;million of certain prepaid assets that specifically supported ALLIANCE.
Due to the decrease in software and professional services revenues and
Forgent&#146;s shift in its go-forward strategy for its software segment, the
Company was also required to perform an impairment analysis in accordance with
SFAS No.&nbsp;142, &#147;Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.&#148; As part of the impairment
analysis, Forgent determined the implied fair value of goodwill based on a
discounted cash flow model. As a result of this valuation, Forgent recorded a
$5.0&nbsp;million impairment of its goodwill related to its acquisitions of Vosaic,
LLC and Global Scheduling Solutions, Inc. The technology obtained from these
acquisitions supported the development efforts on ALLIANCE and its predecessor,
Forgent&#146;s Video Network Platform. The $10.1&nbsp;million impairment charge related
to ALLIANCE was recorded as part of continuing operations on the Consolidated
Statement of Operations, with $4.8&nbsp;million in cost of sales and $5.3&nbsp;million in
operating expenses.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the change in focus of its software segment, Forgent also evaluated
the recoverability of its intangible assets and long-lived assets related to
its NetSimplicity product line in accordance with SFAS No.&nbsp;142 and SFAS No.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">
<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">These assets included fixed assets and intangible assets. Based on the
projected positive cash flow related to NetSimplicity, Forgent did not record
any impairment charge related to its NetSimplicity assets for the year ended
July&nbsp;31, 2004.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January&nbsp;2004, the Company closed its sales office in Melville, New
York. Management was unable to sublease the vacated space and upon review of
the future discounted cash flows related to this lease, management recorded an
impairment charge of $78 thousand. Additionally, management analyzed the
discounted cash flows related to its Wild Basin property lease and subleases
over the remainder of the lease term. Although Forgent was able to sublease
the vacated space more quickly than originally anticipated, the rates on the
subleases were less than originally anticipated due to depressed current market
rates. Therefore, management calculated the economic value of the lost
sublease rental income and recorded an additional charge of $1.5&nbsp;million. Also
during the second fiscal quarter of 2004, Forgent analyzed its recorded
leasehold improvements at its Wild Basin property. This analysis indicated
that certain leasehold improvements were no longer of value. Therefore,
management recorded an impairment charge of $0.2&nbsp;million related to these
leasehold improvements. The $1.7&nbsp;million impairment related to the Wild Basin
and New York leases and the leasehold improvements were recorded as part of
operating expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year
ended July&nbsp;31, 2004. As of July&nbsp;31, 2004, Forgent had settled its lease
obligations on its office in Melville, New York, remained obligated to make
lease payments in accordance with the original terms of its Wild Basin property
lease and had $1.9&nbsp;million recorded as a liability on the Consolidated Balance
Sheet related the Wild Basin property.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the fiscal year ended July&nbsp;31, 2003, Forgent recorded impairment
losses on the Consolidated Statement of Operations as follows:

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November&nbsp;2002, the GSS development operations in Atlanta, Georgia, were
relocated to Forgent&#146;s headquarters in Austin, Texas. Management was unable to
sublease the vacated space and upon review of the future undiscounted cash
flows related to this lease, management recorded an impairment charge of $21
thousand. Additionally, management analyzed the discounted cash flows related
to its Wild Basin property lease and subleases over the remainder of the lease
term. Although Forgent was able to sublease the vacated space more quickly
than originally anticipated, the rates on the subleases were considerably less
than originally anticipated due to depressed then current market rates.
Therefore, management calculated the economic value of the lost sublease rental
income and recorded an additional charge of $0.5&nbsp;million. Forgent remained
obligated to make lease payments in accordance with the original terms of both
leases. Both the Atlanta and Wild Basin lease impairments were recorded as
part of continuing operations on the Company&#146;s Consolidated Statement of
Operations for the year ended July&nbsp;31, 2003.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgent&#146;s discontinued integration and videoconferencing hardware services
businesses were located at its facilities in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania,
which leases approximately 41 thousand square feet. As a result of the sale of
Forgent&#146;s integration business, approximately 19% of the total lease space was
subleased to SPL, based on then current market values. As a result of the sale
of Forgent&#146;s videoconferencing hardware services business to Gores in July
2003, approximately 37% of the total lease space was subleased to Gores, based
on then current market values. SPL and another subtenant subleased the
remaining 63% of the total lease space during fiscal year 2003. However, in
October&nbsp;2003, SPL&#146;s sublease terminated and the subtenant vacated its leased
space. Therefore, management reviewed the undiscounted cash flows of this
lease and the related subleases, determined the economic value of the lost
sublease rental income and recorded a charge of $0.5&nbsp;million. Forgent remained
obligated to make lease payments in accordance with the original terms of the
lease. Since Forgent fully discontinued its operations in King of Prussia, the
lease impairment for this facility was recorded as part of discontinued
operations on the Company&#146;s Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year
ended July&nbsp;31, 2003.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the 2003 fiscal year, Forgent recorded $0.3&nbsp;million in accrued
interest on both outstanding notes receivable from VTEL Products Corporation
(&#147;VTEL&#148;) and fully reserved the accrued interest. Management agreed with VTEL&#146;s
management during the first fiscal quarter of 2003 to offset Forgent&#146;s accounts
payable to VTEL with its accounts receivable, notes receivable and interest
receivable from VTEL. The Forgent liability was fully offset with the accounts
receivable and accrued interest and partially offset with the note in default,
thus relieving $0.7&nbsp;million of the related reserves. Since the initial $6.0
million charge to reserve the VTEL notes receivable was reported as part of the
asset impairment from continuing operations, the related reduction of the
reserves is also reported as part of the asset impairment from continuing
operations for the year ended July&nbsp;31, 2003. No cash was exchanged with these
transactions.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, the ongoing difficult economic environment and its
associated negative impact on the Company&#146;s software business during fiscal
year 2003 represented an indicator of a possible impairment on the Company&#146;s
software business. Therefore, the Company was required to perform an
impairment analysis in accordance with SFAS No.&nbsp;142, &#147;Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets&#148; to determine the fair value of the assets and liabilities of
its software business. As a result of this analysis, Forgent recorded a $1.3
million impairment of its goodwill related to its acquisition of GSS. This
impairment was recorded as part of continuing operations on the Company&#146;s
Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended July&nbsp;31, 2003.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s OnScreen24&#153; operations, which were folded back into
Forgent&#146;s core operations in January&nbsp;2001, developed a video streaming
technology, which is a server application with the abilities to create video
e-mail programs and to store streamed video for later non-real time playback.
Initially, management intended to leverage these efforts and further develop
this technology as an added feature to its VNP software. Based upon customer
feedback regarding the VNP software during fiscal year 2002, customers did not
need advanced features but desired fundamental network management applications
with more robust device level support and valued added network level
instrumentation for ISDN and IP networks to enable them to understand and
monitor how well their networks were performing. Therefore, management
determined the video streaming technology would not be used in the development
of VNP. As a result, the $2.4&nbsp;million capitalized software development costs
associated with this technology was impaired during the year ended July&nbsp;31,
2002 and was reported as part of cost of sales from continuing operations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the disposition of the products business segment in fiscal year
2002, the VTEL personnel relocated from Forgent&#146;s headquarters at 108 Wild
Basin Road in Austin, Texas to VTEL&#146;s headquarters at 9208 Waterford Centre
Blvd. in Austin, Texas. This relocation left a vacancy of approximately 52
thousand rentable square feet, or 38% of the total lease space. Additionally,
Forgent had existing unoccupied space inventory due to the downsizing of the
Company relating to its restructurings. In fiscal year 2002, Forgent was able
to sublease some of the vacated space, but was unable to fully sublease the
space due to the economic downturn during the year. Therefore, management
analyzed the future undiscounted cash flows related to the lease on the Wild
Basin property and determined the economic value of the lost sublease rental
income. As a result, Forgent recorded a $2.1&nbsp;million impairment charge for the
unleased space as of July&nbsp;31, 2002. However, Forgent remained obligated to
make lease payments in accordance with the original terms of the lease.
Additionally, Forgent received two subordinated promissory notes from VTEL as a
result of the sale of the products business segment. VTEL did not remit
payment on its first subordinated promissory note due in April&nbsp;2002, as
stipulated in the sales agreement. As a result of this default and due to the
uncertainty in collecting both of the outstanding notes from VTEL, the Company
recorded a $6.0&nbsp;million charge for the reserve of both notes from VTEL for the
year ended July&nbsp;31, 2002. These impairments were reported as part of continuing
operations on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Restructuring Charge</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The restructuring expenses were $0.6&nbsp;million in fiscal year 2004, which
represents 3.6% of total revenues for the year ended July&nbsp;31, 2004. During
fiscal year 2004, Forgent streamlined its software operations to be more
commensurate with its software revenue base and implemented a leaner cost
structure, which included reducing headcount and closing certain sales offices
to conform to the Company&#146;s new operating structure. As a result of this
restructuring, Forgent terminated 62 employees, or 58% of the workforce, which
affected 33 employees in sales and marketing, 22 employees in research and
development and seven employees in general and administrative functions. The
designated employees were terminated upon the announcement of the reduction and
were assisted with outplacement support services and severance. Additionally,
Forgent closed its sales offices in McLean, Virginia and Houston, Texas. In
accordance with SFAS No.&nbsp;146, &#147;Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or
Disposal Activities,&#148; the Company recorded a one-time charge of $0.6&nbsp;million
for termination benefits and expenses related to the office closings during the
year ended July&nbsp;31, 2004. As of July

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">
<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">31, 2004, the Company had a liability of $4 thousand related to the
restructuring activities. This liability will be paid during the first fiscal
quarter of 2005.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During fiscal year 2002, the Company restructured its organization, which
involved the termination of 65 employees, or 17% of the workforce, who were
assisted with outplacement support and severance. The reduction affected 16
employees in Austin, Texas, 30 employees in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, and
19 employees in remote and international locations. The restructuring was the
result of eliminating certain business elements that did not contribute to
Forgent&#146;s core competencies at that time as well as efforts to increase
efficiencies and to significantly reduce administrative costs. All of the
employees were terminated and the Company recorded a one-time charge of $818 in
the first quarter of fiscal 2002 for the restructuring. This charge is included
in the loss from discontinued operations on the Consolidated Statement of
Operations. As of July&nbsp;31, 2002, all of the involuntary termination benefits
had been paid.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Amortization of Intangible Assets</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ongoing difficult economic environment and its associated negative
impact on the Company&#146;s software business during fiscal year 2003 represented
an indicator of a possible impairment on the Company&#146;s software business.
Therefore, the Company was required to perform an impairment analysis in
accordance with SFAS No.&nbsp;142, &#147;Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.&#148; As a
result of this analysis, Forgent recorded a $1.3&nbsp;million impairment of its
goodwill related to its acquisition of GSS during the year ended July&nbsp;31, 2003.
Due to decreasing revenues and Forgent&#146;s shift in its go-forward strategy for
its software segment during fiscal year 2004, the Company performed another
impairment analysis in accordance with SFAS No.&nbsp;142. As part of the impairment
analysis, Forgent determined the implied fair value of goodwill based on a
discounted cash flow model. As a result of this valuation, Forgent recorded a
$5.0&nbsp;million impairment of its goodwill related to its acquisitions of Vosaic,
LLC and Global Scheduling Solutions, Inc. These impairments were recorded and
reported as part of the impairment of assets from continuing operations on the
Company&#146;s Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended July&nbsp;31,
2004.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Other Income (Expenses)</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other income (expenses)&nbsp;were $1.7&nbsp;million in fiscal year 2002, ($35.0)
thousand in fiscal year 2003 and ($0.5) million in fiscal year 2004. The
decreases were $1.7&nbsp;million, or 102.1%, from 2002 to 2003 and $0.5&nbsp;million, or
1,391.4%, from 2003 to 2004. Other income (expenses)&nbsp;were 5.0%, (0.1%) and
(3.0%) of total revenues for the years ended July&nbsp;31, 2002, 2003 and 2004,
respectively.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the year ended July&nbsp;31, 2004, the Company recorded $0.6&nbsp;million in
foreign currency losses associated with ceasing the operations of certain
international entities. These losses are the primary cause for the increase in
other expenses during fiscal year 2004, as compared to fiscal year 2003.
During the year ended July&nbsp;31, 2002, the Company sold its remaining 76,625
shares of Polycom common stock under a cash flow hedge, resulting in a $1.7
million realized gain. This gain is the primary cause for the decrease in
other income during fiscal year 2003, as compared to fiscal year 2002.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Income Taxes</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At July&nbsp;31, 2004, the Company had federal net operating loss carryforwards
of approximately $147.9&nbsp;million, research and development credit carryforwards
of approximately $5.4&nbsp;million and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards
of approximately $0.3&nbsp;million. The net operating loss and research and
development credit carryforwards will expire in varying amounts from 2005
through 2024, if not utilized. Minimum tax credit carryforwards do not expire
and carry forward indefinitely.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of various acquisitions performed by the Company in prior
years, utilization of the net operating losses and credit carryforwards may be
subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the &#147;change in ownership&#148;
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The annual limitation may
result in the expiration of net operating losses before utilization.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of realizing the benefits of
its favorable tax attributes in future tax returns, the Company has placed a
valuation allowance against its net deferred tax asset. Accordingly, no
deferred tax benefits have been recorded for the tax years ended July&nbsp;31, 2002,
2003 and 2004. The valuation allowance increased by approximately $7.0&nbsp;million
during the year ended July&nbsp;31, 2004 primarily due to operating losses not
benefited. Approximately $8.0&nbsp;million of the valuation allowance relates to
tax benefits for stock option deductions included in the net operating loss
carryforward which, when realized, will be allocated directly to contributed
capital to the extent the benefits exceed amounts attributable to book deferred
compensation expense.

considered permanently reinvested and, accordingly, no provision for U.S.
federal or state income taxes has been provided thereon.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>(Loss) Income from Discontinued Operations, Net of Income Taxes</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the year ended July&nbsp;31, 2003, the Company sold the operations and
assets of its videoconferencing hardware services business to Gores. During
the year ended July&nbsp;31, 2002, the Company sold the operations and substantially
all of the assets of its VTEL products business, including the VTEL name, to
VTEL and the operations and assets of its integration business to SPL (see Note
7, in the accompanying financial statements). Accordingly, the products,
integration and videoconferencing hardware service businesses have been
accounted for and presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated
financial statements. Loss from discontinued operations was $2.6&nbsp;million in
fiscal year 2002. Income from discontinued operations was $0.6&nbsp;million in
fiscal year 2003. No loss or income from discontinued operations was recorded
in fiscal year 2004. The increase was $3.2&nbsp;million, or 123.0%, from 2002 to
2003. The decrease was $0.6&nbsp;million, or 100.0%, from 2003 to 2004. (Loss)
income from discontinued operations were (7.8%), 1.1% and 0.0% of total
revenues for the years ended July&nbsp;31, 2002, 2003 and 2004.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The $0.6&nbsp;million decrease during the year ended July&nbsp;31, 2004 resulted
from the fact that the Company did not record any operations from its
discontinued videoconferencing hardware services business in fiscal year 2004.
The $3.2&nbsp;million increase during the year ended July&nbsp;31, 2003 is due to a $8.6
million decrease in losses from the products and integration businesses. This
loss reduction was offset by a $5.4&nbsp;million decrease in income from the
videoconferencing hardware services business. The Company did not conduct any
business from any of these business lines during the year ended July&nbsp;31, 2004.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>(Loss) Income on Disposal, Net of Income Taxes</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July&nbsp;2003, Forgent sold substantially all of the assets of its
videoconferencing hardware services business (&#147;Services Business&#148;) based in
King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, to Gores, a privately held international
acquisition and management firm. As consideration for the sale of the
videoconferencing hardware services business, the Company
received $7.3&nbsp;million in cash and incurred $1.9&nbsp;million in loss on the
disposal. The following table shows the amounts of the assets sold and
liabilities assumed, as well as the fees incurred, related to this sale:

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Net loss was $6.1&nbsp;million in fiscal year 2002; net income was $8.0&nbsp;million
in fiscal year 2003; and net loss was $20.6&nbsp;million in fiscal year 2004. The
increase was $14.1&nbsp;million, or 231.4%, from 2002 to 2003. The decrease was
$28.6&nbsp;million, or 357.4%, from 2003 to 2004. Net income (loss)&nbsp;were (18.3%),
14.9% and (118.1%) of total revenues for the years ended July&nbsp;31, 2002, 2003
and 2004, respectively.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Year-end Review</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fiscal year 2004, Forgent continued its focus on licensing of
intellectual property and streamlined its software business with a low-cost,
high transaction marketing and distribution model. During fiscal year 2004,
Forgent achieved several goals including: (1)&nbsp;initiated litigation to protect
its intellectual property rights related to the &#145;672 patent, (2)&nbsp;continued
licensing efforts from its Patent Licensing Program, (3)&nbsp;completed the
integration of the acquisition of Network Simplicity Software, Inc. and (4)
made progress in growing revenues related to its NetSimplicity software.
Despite these achievements, uncertainties and challenges remain, and there can
be no assurance that the Company can successfully grow its revenues or achieve
profitability.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Other Factors Affecting Results of Operations</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgent&#146;s future results of operations and financial condition could be
impacted by many factors, including results of the current litigation related
to its &#145;672 patent, other competitors entering the same software market,
technical problems in delivering its software and the current economic
environment. Due to these factors and others noted elsewhere in Management&#146;s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and
Risk Factors contained elsewhere in this Report, Forgent&#146;s past earnings and
stock prices have been, and future earnings and stock prices potentially may
be, subject to significant volatility, particularly on a quarterly basis. Past
financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future
performance and investors are cautioned in using historical trends to
anticipate results or trends in future periods. Any shortfall in revenue or
earnings from the levels anticipated by securities analysts could have an
immediate and significant effect on the trading price of Forgent&#146;s common stock
in any given period. Also, the Company participates in a highly dynamic
industry that often contributes to the volatility of Forgent&#146;s common stock
price.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash provided by operating activities was $9.6&nbsp;million in fiscal year
2002; cash provided by operating activities was $2.3&nbsp;million in fiscal year
2003; and cash used in operating activities was $0.1&nbsp;million in fiscal year
2004. At July&nbsp;31, 2004, Forgent had working capital of $18.6&nbsp;million, including
$21.5&nbsp;million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The $0.1&nbsp;million of cash used in operating activities in fiscal year 2004
was due primarily to $21.2&nbsp;million in net loss, which was offset by $11.8
million of non-cash impairment expenses and a $9.0&nbsp;million decrease in accounts
receivable. During fiscal year 2004, Forgent collected $15.6&nbsp;million in
accounts receivable from its intellectual property licensing business.
Additionally, the Company sold $1.7&nbsp;million of its outstanding accounts
receivable, without any recourse, to Silicon Valley Bank in order to maintain
cash balances at levels considered appropriate by management. The Company
received proceeds from Silicon Valley Bank of $1.7&nbsp;million.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The $2.3&nbsp;million of cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year
2003 was due primarily to $9.4&nbsp;million in net income and $2.2&nbsp;million of
non-cash depreciation, amortization and impairment expenses, which were offset
by a $8.4&nbsp;million increase in accounts receivable and a $1.2&nbsp;million decrease
in accrued expenses. During the year ended July&nbsp;31, 2003, the Company
collected $16.2&nbsp;million in accounts receivable from its intellectual property
licensing business.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The $9.6&nbsp;million of cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year
2002 was due primarily to $3.2&nbsp;million in net loss, $12.5&nbsp;million of non-cash
depreciation, amortization and impairment expenses and a $7.8&nbsp;million decrease
in accounts receivable, which were offset by a $7.8&nbsp;million decrease in
accounts payable and accrued expenses. Forgent collected $16.5&nbsp;million in
accounts receivable from its intellectual property licensing business during
the year ended July&nbsp;31, 2002. Additionally, the Company sold $9.3&nbsp;million of

cash provided by investing activities was $3.4&nbsp;million in fiscal year 2003; and
cash used in investing activities was $2.6&nbsp;million in fiscal year 2004. The
$2.6&nbsp;million of cash used in investing activities during fiscal year 2004 was
due primarily to $2.3&nbsp;million in cash used to purchase certain assets and the
operations of Network Simplicity Software Inc. and $0.9&nbsp;million in the
capitalization of software development costs, which were offset by $1.4&nbsp;million
in cash received from net sales of short-term investments. The $3.4&nbsp;million of
cash provided by investing activities during fiscal year 2003 was due primarily
to $7.4&nbsp;million in cash received from the sale of the videoconferencing
hardware business, which was offset by $1.1&nbsp;million in net purchases of
short-term investments and $2.8&nbsp;million in the capitalization of software
development costs. The $7.3&nbsp;million of cash used in investing activities
during fiscal year 2002 was largely the result of the goodwill acquired among
other assets from Global Scheduling Solutions, Inc. and $3.5&nbsp;million in the
capitalization of software development costs. In addition to managing its
software business towards profitability, management anticipates utilizing the
cash receipts from its intellectual property business to strategically acquire
a significant, growing and profitable public or privately held technology
business or product line.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of July&nbsp;31, 2004, the Company leased computers, furniture, equipment
and office space under non-cancelable operating leases that expire at various
dates through 2013. Certain leases obligate Forgent to pay property taxes,
maintenance and insurance. Forgent also has several capital leases for computer
and office equipment. Additionally, the Company used the proceeds from its
notes payable to purchase computers and various equipment. Amounts payable
under these leases and notes payable are as follows:

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgent may periodically make other commitments and thus become subject to
other contractual obligations. However, management believes these commitments
and contractual obligations are routine in nature and incidental to the
Company&#146;s operations. Since Forgent&#146;s current businesses are not capital
intensive, Forgent&#146;s capital budget for fiscal year 2005 is approximately $0.3
million and will be used primarily for subtenant improvements as the Company
continues to sublease its vacated office space.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash used in financing activities was $0.9&nbsp;million in fiscal year 2002;
cash used in financing activities was $1.4&nbsp;million in fiscal year 2003; and
cash provided by financing activities was $18 thousand in fiscal year 2004. The
$18 thousand of cash provided by financing activities during fiscal year 2004
was due to $0.7&nbsp;million in proceeds received from the issuance of the Company&#146;s
common stock, which was offset by $0.5&nbsp;million purchase of treasury stock and
$0.2&nbsp;million in net payments related to the Company&#146;s notes payable. The $1.4
million of cash used in financing activities during fiscal year 2003 was due
primarily to the $1.4&nbsp;million purchase of treasury stock. The $0.9&nbsp;million of
cash used in financing activities during fiscal year 2002 is due primarily to
the $2.7&nbsp;million purchase of treasury stock, which was offset by the $1.3
million proceeds received from the issuance of its notes payable.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April&nbsp;2001 Forgent announced a stock repurchase program to repurchase
up to two million shares of the Company&#146;s stock. In September&nbsp;2002, Forgent&#146;s
board of directors approved the repurchase of an additional million shares

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Since April&nbsp;2001, the Company has repurchased 1,754,201 shares for
approximately $4.7&nbsp;million as of July&nbsp;31, 2004. Management will periodically
assess repurchasing additional shares during fiscal year 2005, depending on the
Company&#146;s cash position, market conditions and other factors.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgent&#146;s principal sources of liquidity at July&nbsp;31, 2004 consist of $21.5
million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and the ability to
generate cash from its intellectual property licensing business. Management
currently plans to strategically utilize its cash balances to acquire a
significant, growing and profitable public or privately held technology
business or product line in addition to investigating opportunities to reward
stockholders, such as additional stock buybacks or dividends. However,
Forgent&#146;s ability to generate cash from its intellectual property licensing
business is subject to certain risks as discussed under the &#147;Risk Factors &#150;
Licensing Program&#148; section of the &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the Company.&#148; As previously
stated above, however, there remain risks and uncertainties as to the timing of
the receipts of license fees due, in part, to the inherent nature of a patent
licensing program. Therefore, there is no assurance that the Company will be
able to continue to limit its cash consumption and preserve its cash balances,
and it is possible that the Company&#146;s business demands may lead to cash
utilization at levels greater than recently experienced due to the litigation
related to its &#145;672 patent, increased expense levels and other factors.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and include
the accounts of Forgent&#146;s wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in the
consolidation. Preparation of the consolidated financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of the assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The more significant
estimates made by management include the valuation allowance for the gross
deferred tax asset, capitalization of software development costs, contingency
reserves, useful lives of fixed assets, the determination of the fair value of
its long-lived assets, including its intangible assets, the loss from
discontinued operations and the loss from its impairments. These estimates
could be materially different under different conditions and assumptions.
Additionally, the actual amounts could differ from the estimates made.
Management periodically evaluates estimates used in the preparation of the
financial statements for continued reasonableness. Appropriate adjustments, if
any, to the estimates used are made prospectively based upon such periodic
evaluation.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Management believes the following represent Forgent&#146;s critical accounting
policies:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Revenue Recognition</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement
exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and
collectibility is probable. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with
Statement of Position (&#147;SOP&#148;) 97-2, &#147;Software Revenue Recognition,&#148; as amended
by SOP 98-4 and SOP 98-9, and Securities and Exchange Commission Staff
Accounting Bulletin 104, &#147;Revenue Recognition.&#148;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intellectual property licensing revenue is derived from the Company&#146;s
Patent Licensing Program, which is currently focused on generating license
revenues relating to the Company&#146;s data compression technology embodied in U.S.
Patent No.&nbsp;4,698,672, and its foreign counterparts and is currently conducted
through the Company&#146;s wholly-owned subsidiary, Compression Labs, Inc. Gross
intellectual property licensing revenue is recognized at the time a license
agreement has been executed and related costs are recorded as cost of sales.
The cost of sales on the intellectual property licensing business relates to
the legal fees incurred on successfully achieving signed agreements. The contingent legal fees were based on 50% of the licensing
revenues received on signed agreements and were paid to Forgent&#146;s
previous counsel pursuant to a fee agreement with such counsel.
Forgent has terminated such counsel and is currently in discussions
with the law firm regarding the termination. See Item&nbsp;1 &#147;Business &#150;
Intellectual Property Licensing Business &#150; Patent Licensing
Program&#148; for more detail.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Software and professional service revenue consists of license and service
fees. License fee revenue is earned through the licensing or right to use the
Company&#146;s software and from the sale of specific software products. Service
fee income is earned through the sale of maintenance and technical support,
training, installation, and other professional services related to the sale of
Forgent&#146;s scheduling software. The Company allocates the total fee to the
various elements based on the relative fair values of the elements specific to
the Company. The Company determines the fair value of each element in the
arrangement based on vendor-specific objective evidence (&#147;VSOE&#148;) of fair value.
When VSOE of fair value for the license element is not available, license
revenue is recognized using the residual method. Under the residual method,
the contract value is first allocated to the undelivered elements (maintenance
and service elements) based upon their VSOE of fair value; the remaining
contract value, including any discount, is allocated to the delivered element.
For maintenance, VSOE of fair value is based upon the renewal rate specified in
each contract. For training and installation services, VSOE of fair value is
based upon the rates charged for these services when sold separately. Revenue
allocated to maintenance and technical support is recognized ratably over the
maintenance term (typically one year). Revenue allocated to installation and
training is recognized upon completion of these services due to their
short-term nature. The Company&#146;s training and installation services are not
essential to the functionality of its products as such services can be provided
by a third party or the customers themselves. For instances in which VSOE
cannot be determined for undelivered elements, and these undelivered elements
do not provide significant customization or modification of its software
product, Forgent recognizes the entire contract amount ratably over the period
during which the services are expected to be performed.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company does not recognize revenue for agreements with rights of
return, refundable fees, cancellation rights, or acceptance clauses until such
rights of return, refund, or cancellation have expired or acceptance has
occurred. The Company&#146;s arrangements with resellers do not allow for any
rights of return.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deferred revenue includes amounts received from customers in excess of
revenue recognized, and is comprised of deferred maintenance, service and other
revenue. Deferred revenues are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of
Operations over the terms of the arrangements, primarily ranging from one to
three years.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Software Development Costs</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Costs incurred in connection with the development of software products are
accounted for in accordance with SFAS No.&nbsp;86, &#147;Accounting for the Costs of
Computer Software to Be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed.&#148; Costs incurred
prior to the establishment of technological feasibility are charged to research
and development expense. Software development costs are capitalized after a
product is determined to be technologically feasible and is in the process of
being developed for market. Amortization of capitalized software development
costs begins upon initial product shipment. Capitalized software development
costs are amortized over the estimated life of the related product (generally
thirty-six months), using the straight-line method.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Impairment of Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are no
longer required to be amortized under SFAS No.&nbsp;142, <I>&#147;Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets,&#148; </I>the Company reviews its goodwill and these intangible
assets for possible impairment on an annual basis, or whenever specific events
warrant. Events that may create an impairment review include, but are not
limited to: significant and sustained decline in the Company&#146;s stock price or
market capitalization, significant underperformance of operating units and
significant changes in market conditions and trends. Forgent uses a two-step
process and a discounted cash flow model to evaluate its assets for impairment.
If the carrying amount of the goodwill or asset exceeds its implied fair value,
an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess during that
fiscal period. Intangible assets that are not deemed to have indefinite lives
will continue to be amortized over their useful lives and are tested for
impairment in accordance with SFAS No.&nbsp;144, <I>&#147;Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.&#148;</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with SFAS No.&nbsp;144, Forgent reviews and evaluates its
long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that their net book value may not be recoverable. When such factors
and circumstances exist, including those noted above, the Company compares the
assets&#146; carrying amounts against the estimated undiscounted cash flows to be
generated by those assets over their estimated useful lives. If the carrying
amounts are greater than the fair value of those assets, the excess is recorded
as an impairment in that fiscal period.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Allowance for Doubtful Accounts</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts to estimate
losses from uncollectable customer accounts receivables. This estimate is based
in the aggregate, on historical collection experience, age of receivables, and
general economic conditions. It also considers an individual customer&#146;s payment
experience, credit-worthiness and age of receivable balances.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March&nbsp;2004, the Financial Accounting Standard Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) issued an
exposure draft entitled &#147;<I>Share-Based Payment, an Amendment of FASB Statements
Nos. 123 and 95,&#148; </I>which eliminates the ability to account for share-based
compensation transactions using APB No.&nbsp;25, <I>&#147;Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees.&#148; </I>The exposure draft would require stock-based compensation to
employees to be recognized as a cost in the financial statements and that such
cost should be measured according to the fair value of the stock options. The
proposed requirements in the exposure draft would be effective for fiscal years
beginning after June&nbsp;15, 2005, or fiscal year 2006 for the Company. The FASB
intends to issue a final Statement in late 2004. In order to determine the
impact on its consolidated financial statements, Forgent will continue to
monitor the progress on this exposure draft.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March&nbsp;2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force issued consensus No.&nbsp;03-1
(&#147;EITF 03-1&#148;), &#147;The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and its
Application to Certain Investments.&#148; The consensus applies to certain
investments in debt and security securities accounted for under Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (&#147;SFAS&#148;) No.&nbsp;115, &#147;Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,&#148; and SFAS No.&nbsp;124, &#147;Accounting for
Certain Investments Held by Not-for-Profit Organizations.&#148; EITF 03-1 provides
a three-step model to evaluate whether an investment is considered impaired,
whether that impairment is other than temporary and the measurement of an
impairment loss. The impairment accounting guidance is effective for reporting
periods beginning after June&nbsp;15, 2004, or the Company&#146;s first fiscal quarter of
2005, and disclosure requirements are effective for annual periods ending after
June&nbsp;15, 2004, or the Company&#146;s 2005 fiscal year. The adoption of this
interpretation is not expected to have a material effect on the Company&#146;s
consolidated results of operations, consolidated financial position or
consolidated cash flows.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>RISK FACTORS</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many factors that affect the Company&#146;s business, prospects,
liquidity and the results of its operations, some of which are beyond the
control of the Company. The following is a discussion of some, but not all, of
these and other important risk factors that may cause the actual results of the
Company&#146;s operations in future periods to differ materially from those
currently expected or desired. Additional risks not presently known to
management or risks that are currently believed to be immaterial, but which may
become more material, may also affect the Company&#146;s business prospects and
results of operations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Licensing Program</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s Patent Licensing Program involves risks inherent in
licensing intellectual property, including risks of protracted delays, legal
challenges that would lead to disruption or curtailment of the program,
increasing expenditures associated with the pursuit of the program and other
risks that could adversely affect the Company&#146;s licensing program. Thus, there
can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to license its
technology to others. In this regard, see Item&nbsp;3 &#147;Legal Proceedings&#148; of this
Report for information regarding the commencement by the Federal Trade
Commission of a non-public investigation associated with the Company&#146;s Patent
Licensing Program. If the Company fails to meet the expectations of securities
analysts or investors, the market price of Forgent&#146;s common stock may decrease
significantly. Quarterly operating results may fail to meet these expectations
for a number of reasons, including the unwillingness or inability of licensees
to pay for the license and other fees, a decline in the demand for the
Company&#146;s patented technology, higher than expected operating expenses and
license delays due to legal and other factors. Additionally, there are no
guarantees that the Company can protect its intellectual property rights in its
current litigation or prevent the unauthorized use of its technology in the
future. However, Forgent will continue to enforce and pursue its rights
through the legal system when necessary.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Litigation</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has initiated the &#145;672 Litigation against 42 companies for
infringement of its &#145;672 patent. As with any litigation, the outcome is
uncertain and although the Company intends to vigorously pursue its claims,
there can be no assurance or certainty that the Company will prevail.
Additionally, unintended consequences of the Company&#146;s initiating the &#145;672
Litigation may adversely affect the Company&#146;s business, including, without
limitation, that the Company may

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">
<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">have to devote significant time and financial resources to pursuing the &#145;672
Litigation, that the Company may become subject to counterclaims or lawsuits
and that the expenses of pursuing the &#145;672 Litigation could increase based upon
new developments occurring. These, and other factors not currently known to or
deemed material by management, could have a material and adverse impact on the
Company&#146;s business, prospects, liquidity and results of operations.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Licensing Cycle</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgent&#146;s licensing cycle for its Patent Licensing Program is lengthy and
costly, including expenditures related to various consultant fees, travel costs
and certain legal costs. Due to multiple negotiations and legal due diligence
required, the licensing process cannot necessarily be expedited. As a result,
the Company&#146;s intellectual property licensing revenues may fluctuate from
quarter to quarter, making it difficult for Forgent to predict its revenues,
which could cause the Company to miss analysts&#146; expectations. Additionally,
these fluctuations and missed expectations may lead to reduced prices for the
Company&#146;s common stock.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Counsel for Patent Licensing Program</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October&nbsp;27, 2004, Forgent formally terminated its previous
counsel engaged in connection with the Company&#146;s Patent Licensing
Program and is currently in discussions with the law firm regarding
the termination. Forgent has engaged new counsel to advise it in
connection with its Patent Licensing Program and is working with
both counsels to ensure a timely and efficient transition in legal
services. Presently, the Company has not yet finalized a new fee
agreement with its new counsel. The Patent Licensing Program is
dependent on intensive legal due diligence and negotiations. The
transition in the provision of legal services to Forgent caused by
this termination may cause delays in Forgent&#146;s ability to proceed
with its Patent Licensing Program, which could have a material and
adverse impact on the Company&#146;s business, liquidity and results of
operations.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Patents and Trademarks</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s success and ability to compete are substantially dependent
on its proprietary technology and trademarks. The Company seeks to protect
these assets through a combination of patent and trademark laws, as well as
confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions. These legal protections
afford only limited protection and enforcement of these rights may be time
consuming and expensive. Furthermore, despite best efforts, the Company may be
unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating its
intellectual property. Also, competitors may independently develop similar, but
not infringing, technology, duplicate products or design around the Company&#146;s
patents or other intellectual property.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, the Company&#146;s patent applications or trademark registrations
may not be approved. Moreover, even if approved, the resulting patents or
trademarks may not provide Forgent with any competitive advantage or may be
challenged by third parties. If challenged, patents might not be upheld or
claims could be narrowed. Any litigation surrounding the Company&#146;s rights would
force Forgent to divert important financial and other resources away from
business operations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>General Economic and Industry Conditions</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any adverse change in general economic, business or industry conditions
could have a material effect on the Company&#146;s business, prospects and financial
performance if those conditions cause customers or potential customers to
reduce or delay their purchases of scheduling software and related professional
services. Given competing priorities within limited budgets, businesses may
choose to curtail their capital spending. If so, a general reduction in
information technology spending could have an adverse effect on the demand for
the Company&#146;s products and services and could result in declining revenues and
earnings for the Company.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Acquisition Integration</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has made, and will continue to evaluate and may make,
strategic acquisitions in public and privately held technology companies. Some
of these acquisitions may be in markets or businesses that the Company had not
previously participated in and thus may require additional employees and/or
skill sets that the Company does not currently possess. In addition, some of
these acquisitions may be in regulated or other specialized industries. Some
of these companies may also be early-stage ventures with unproven business
models, have products that are not yet fully developed, or have products that
have not yet achieved market acceptance. Any acquisitions of this type are
inherently risky. Additionally, the Company may encounter a number of other
risks associated with acquisitions, including (1)&nbsp;diversion of management&#146;s
attention; (2)&nbsp;failure to retain and motivate key acquired personnel; (3)
failure to integrate acquired operations, products and technologies; (4)&nbsp;risks
associated with unanticipated events, circumstances or legal liabilities; (5)
client satisfaction or performance problems within the acquired business; and
(6)&nbsp;amortization of acquired intangible assets. These difficulties could
disrupt Forgent&#146;s ongoing business, distract existing management and employees,
require increased capital expenditures or increase the Company&#146;s expenses
and/or materially and adversely affect results of operations and liquidity.
Accordingly, there can be no assurances that any of the Company&#146;s investments
or acquisitions will be successful, that the Company will be able to recover
the amounts invested or that any acquisition would be profitable.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Software Marketing and Sales</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The future success of the Company&#146;s software segment will be dependent in
significant part on its ability to generate demand for its software products
and professional services. To this end, Forgent&#146;s sales operations must
increase market awareness of its products to generate increased revenue. All
sales new hires will require training and may take time to achieve full
productivity. Forgent cannot be certain that its new hires will become as
productive as necessary or that it will be able to hire enough qualified
individuals or retain existing employees in the future. The Company cannot be
certain that it will be successful in its efforts to market and sell its
products, and if it is not successful in building greater market awareness and
generating increased sales, future results of operations will be adversely
affected.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Increased Business from Current and New Customers</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgent&#146;s business model depends on the expanded use of its software
within its current and new customers&#146; organizations. Therefore, Forgent must
execute on its growth objectives, including growth from its acquired companies
or assets. If the Company fails to grow its customer base or generate repeat
and expanded business from its current customers, Forgent&#146;s business and
operating results could be adversely affected. Since the Company&#146;s maintenance
and other professional service fees depend largely on the size and number of
licenses that are sold, any downturn in Forgent&#146;s software license revenue
would negatively impact the Company&#146;s professional services revenue and future
maintenance revenue. Additionally, if customers elect not to renew their
maintenance agreements, Forgent&#146;s maintenance revenue could be adversely
affected.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Software Development</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgent expects that its future financial performance will depend, in
part, on revenue generated from its existing and future software products and
the related products that the Company plans to develop or acquire. There are
significant risks inherent in any new product introduction, such as with
Forgent&#146;s NetSimplicity software products. To be successful, Forgent must be
cost-effective and timely in enhancing its existing software applications,
developing new software technology and solutions that address the increasingly
sophisticated and varied needs of its existing and prospective clients, and
anticipating technological advances and evolving industry standards and
practices. Forgent may need to invest further in research and development in
order to keep its software applications and solutions viable in the rapidly
changing marketplace. This research and development effort may require
significant resources and could ultimately be unsuccessful. Such significant
investment could adversely affect the Company&#146;s operating results as well as
its liquidity.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, Forgent cannot be certain that its existing or future
products offerings will meet customer performance needs or expectations when
shipped or that they will be free of significant software defects or bugs. If
the Company&#146;s products do not meet customer needs or expectations, for whatever
reason, the Company&#146;s sales would be adversely affected and furthermore,
upgrading or enhancing the Company&#146;s products could be costly and time
consuming. Such upgrades or enhancements could have an adverse effect on the
Company&#146;s results of operations and liquidity.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Quarterly Revenues and Operating Results</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, Forgent&#146;s revenues and operating results have varied
significantly from quarter to quarter. Additionally, management expects that
revenues and operating results will continue to fluctuate significantly from
quarter to quarter. These fluctuations may lead to reduced prices for the
Company&#146;s common stock. Several factors may cause the quarterly results to
fluctuate, including:

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of these factors are within management&#146;s control while others are
not. Accordingly, management believes that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of
the Company&#146;s revenues and operating results are not necessarily meaningful.
Therefore, investors should not rely on the results of any particular quarter
as an indication of future performance.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Key Personnel and Senior Management</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgent&#146;s success depends upon its ability to attract, hire and retain
highly trained and experienced software developers and engineers to design and
develop software applications in order to keep pace with client demand for
rapidly evolving technologies and varying client needs. The Company&#146;s
operations are also dependent on the continued efforts of its executive
officers and senior management. Additionally, Forgent will likely depend on
the senior management of any business it may acquire in the future. If any of
the Company&#146;s key personnel or senior management are unable or unwilling to
continue in his or her present role, or if Forgent is unable to retain or hire,
train and integrate new personnel effectively, Forgent&#146;s business could be
adversely affected.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Technological Changes and Product Transitions</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The technology industry is characterized by continuing improvements in
technology, which results in the frequent introduction of new products, short
product life cycles and continual improvement in product performance
characteristics. If the Company fails to anticipate and respond effectively to
these improvements and new product introductions, these improvements could
render the Company&#146;s products noncompetitive. While Forgent believes that its
experience over the past few years as a provider of software and professional
services and its prior experience in the videoconferencing industry affords it
a competitive advantage over some of its competitors, rapid changes in
technology present challenges and risks for the Company.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Competition and New Entrants</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company may encounter new entrants or competition from competitors in
some or all aspects of its business, including any business that Forgent may
acquire. The Company currently competes on the basis of price, technology,
availability, performance, quality, reliability, service and support. The
Company believes that its experience and business model creates a competitive
advantage over its competitors. However, there can be no assurance that the
Company will be able to maintain this advantage. Many of the Company&#146;s current
and possibly future competitors have greater resources than the Company and,
therefore, may be able to compete more effectively on price and other terms.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Limited Operating History</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although founded in 1985, Forgent has a limited operating history in its
current lines of business due to the Company&#146;s recent transition to a licensor
of intellectual property and a provider of scheduling and asset management
software and professional services. As a result of this limited operating
history, Forgent cannot forecast revenue and operating expenses based on
historical results. Additionally, the Company&#146;s ability to forecast quarterly
revenue accurately is limited because of the relative unpredictability of its
intellectual property licensing revenues. The Company&#146;s business, operating
results and financial condition will be materially adversely affected if
revenues do not meet projections and if results in a given quarter do not meet
expectations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Divestiture Transactions</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of Forgent&#146;s transition to a licensor of intellectual property
and a provider of scheduling and asset management software and professional
services, the Company has divested certain non-core operations, including a
videoconferencing endpoint manufacturing business, an integration business and
a videoconferencing hardware services business. There can be no assurance that,
having divested such non-core operations, Forgent will be able to achieve
greater or any profitability, strengthen its core operations or compete more
effectively in existing or new markets. In addition, the Company continues to
evaluate the profitability realized or that is likely to be realized by its
existing businesses and operations. Forgent reviews from a strategic
standpoint, which, if any, of its businesses or operations should be divested.
Entering into, evaluating or consummating divestiture transactions may entail
risks and uncertainties in addition to those which may result from the
divestiture-related change in the Company&#146;s business operations, including but
not limited to extraordinary transaction costs, unknown indemnification
liabilities and unforeseen administrative complications, any of which could
result in reduced revenues, increased charges or post-transaction
administrative costs, or could otherwise have a material adverse effect on
Forgent&#146;s business, financial condition or results of operations.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Recently Proposed and Enacted Laws and Regulations</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of assessing, implementing and complying with recently
proposed and enacted changes in the laws and regulations affecting public
companies, including but not limited to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002,
management anticipates potential increased accounting, audit and legal fees, as
well as potential increased costs for certain types of insurance.
Additionally, the new and proposed rules could also make it more difficult for
Forgent to retain qualified individuals to serve on its Board of Directors.
Although management continually monitors and evaluates developments with
respect to these new and proposed laws and regulations, management cannot
estimate the amount of the additional costs the Company may incur or the timing
of such costs at this time. However, such increased costs could materially
affect Forgent&#146;s results of operations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the risk factors noted above and elsewhere in the Management&#146;s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,
Forgent&#146;s past earnings and stock price have been, and future earnings and
stock price potentially may be, subject to significant volatility, particularly
on a quarterly basis. Past financial performance should not be considered a
reliable indicator of future performance and investors are cautioned in using
historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Any
shortfall in revenue or earnings from the levels anticipated by securities
analysts could have an immediate and significant effect on the trading price of
the Company&#146;s common stock in any given period.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K represent
forward-looking statements under Section&nbsp;27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, and Section&nbsp;21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other
factors that may cause actual results of operations, levels of activity,
economic performance, financial condition or achievements to be materially
different from future results of operations, levels of activity, economic
performance, financial condition or achievements as expressed or implied by
such forward-looking statements.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever possible, Forgent attempted to identify these forward-looking
statements with the words &#147;believes,&#148; &#147;estimates,&#148; &#147;plans,&#148; &#147;expects,&#148;
&#147;anticipates,&#148; &#147;may,&#148; &#147;could&#148; and other similar expressions. Although these
forward-looking statements reflect management&#146;s current plans and expectations,
which are believed to be reasonable as of the filing date of this Report, they
inherently are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. Such risks and
uncertainties include, but are not limited to: (1)&nbsp;litigation involving
intellectual property and other matters, including the expense associated with
it; (2)&nbsp;inability to execute upon growth objectives, including growth in
entities acquired by Forgent; (3)&nbsp;failure of Forgent&#146;s sales pipeline to be
converted to realized sales and recorded as revenue; (4)&nbsp;rapid changes in
technology; (5)&nbsp;unexpected changes in customer order patterns; (6)&nbsp;inability to
recruit and retain professionals with the high level of skills and experience
needed to develop and enhance Forgent&#146;s software products; (7)&nbsp;general economic
conditions; (8)&nbsp;the intensity of competition; (9)&nbsp;pricing pressures; (10)
changes in the capital markets; (11)&nbsp;changes in tax and other laws and
governmental rules applicable to Forgent&#146;s business; and other risks indicated
in Forgent&#146;s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These risks
and uncertainties are beyond the Company&#146;s control, and in many cases,
management cannot predict all of the risks and uncertainties that could cause
actual results to differ materially from those contemplated, projected,
anticipated, planned or budgeted in any such forward-looking statements.
Additionally, Forgent does not assume responsibility for the accuracy and
completeness of such statements and is under no obligation to update any of the
forward-looking statements after the date of this Form 10-Q to conform such
statements to actual results.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>INTEREST RATE RISK</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s primary market risk exposure relates to interest rate risk.
Forgent&#146;s interest income is sensitive to changes in U.S. interest rates.
However, due to the short-term nature of the Company&#146;s investments, Forgent
does not consider these risks to be significant.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, Forgent managed its foreign currency exchange rate risk by
utilizing forward contracts to hedge its foreign currency exposure on firm
commitments. The principal currencies hedged were the Euro and Australian
dollars. Forgent ceased utilizing hedges in fiscal year 2001. During the last
two fiscal years, the Company has significantly reduced its international
operations. The operations from Forgent&#146;s Canadian subsidiary are not
significant as to cause a

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">To the Board of Directors and<BR>
Stockholders of Forgent Networks, Inc. (f.k.a. VTEL Corporation)

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Forgent
Networks, Inc. as of July&nbsp;31, 2003 and 2004, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders&#146; equity, and cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended July&nbsp;31, 2004. Our audits also included the
financial statement schedule listed in Item&nbsp;15. These financial statements and
schedules are the responsibility of the Company&#146;s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
schedule based on our audits.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Forgent Networks,
Inc. at July&nbsp;31, 2003 and 2004, and the consolidated results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
July&nbsp;31, 2004, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule,
when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole,
presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>1. THE COMPANY</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgent Networks, Inc. (&#147;Forgent&#148; or &#147;Company&#148;) is a licensor of
intellectual property and a provider of low-cost, easy-to-use scheduling and
asset management software solutions that enable organizations to schedule and
manage their office environment effectively and efficiently. Founded in 1985
and using its expertise in the videoconferencing equipment industry, the
Company manufactured and installed videoconferencing endpoints. In January
2002, the Company sold its manufacturing products business, shifting its focus
from hardware manufacturing to software and services. To further expedite this
shift, during fiscal year 2002, Forgent also sold its integration business,
which designed and installed custom integrated visual communication systems
primarily in meetings spaces of large corporations. During fiscal year 2003,
the Company completed the divestiture of its videoconferencing hardware
services business, devoting itself entirely to its intellectual property
licensing business as well as its software and professional services business.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgent&#146;s intellectual property licensing business is derived from the
Company&#146;s Patent Licensing Program. The Company&#146;s Patent Licensing Program is
currently focused on generating license revenues relating to the Company&#146;s data
compression technology embodied in U.S. Patent No.&nbsp;4,698,672 and its foreign
counterparts and is currently conducted through the Company&#146;s wholly-owned
subsidiary, Compression Labs, Inc. Other patents are currently being
investigated for additional licensing opportunities.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgent&#146;s flagship product, Meeting Room&nbsp;Manager (&#147;MRM&#148;), automates the
entire facility scheduling process: reserving rooms, requesting equipment,
ordering food, sending invitations, creating reports and more. The product is
easy to install and easy to deploy, which allows customers to be up and running
within minutes of starting their deployment. Other products include (1)&nbsp;Visual
Asset Manager, an easy-to-use IT asset tracking and management tool, (2)
Resource Scheduler, a scheduling application built on the same base as MRM but
designed for scheduling resources such as equipment, computers, etc., (3)
Classroom Manager, also a derivative product of MRM, that allows educational
institutions and training facilities to schedule their classrooms, and (4)
Family Scheduler, an easy-to-install, simple-to-use scheduling solution for
busy families.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Company has evolved, it has focused its efforts on generating
intellectual property licensing revenues and increasing revenues from its
software business. With its refocused efforts and streamlined business model,
Forgent believes it is poised to provide the greatest opportunity for long-term
success for the Company and its stockholders.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>BASIS OF PRESENTATION</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and include
the accounts of Forgent&#146;s wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in the
consolidation. Preparation of the consolidated financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of the assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The more significant
estimates made by management include the valuation allowance for the gross
deferred tax asset, capitalization of software development costs, contingency
reserves, useful lives of fixed assets, the determination of the fair value of
its long-lived assets, including its intangible assets, the loss from
discontinued operations and the loss from its impairments. These estimates
could be materially different under different conditions and assumptions.
Additionally, the actual amounts could differ from the estimates made.
Management periodically evaluates estimates used in the preparation of the
financial statements for continued reasonableness. Appropriate adjustments, if
any, to the estimates used are made prospectively based upon such periodic
evaluation.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>REVENUE RECOGNITION</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement
exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and
collectibility is probable. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with
Statement of Position (&#147;SOP&#148;) 97-2, &#147;Software Revenue Recognition,&#148; as amended
by SOP 98-4 and SOP 98-9, and Securities and Exchange Commission Staff
Accounting Bulletin 104, &#147;Revenue Recognition.&#148;

<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS<BR>
(AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA OR OTHERWISE NOTED)</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">U.S. Patent No.&nbsp;4,698,672, and its foreign counterparts and is currently
conducted through the Company&#146;s wholly-owned subsidiary, Compression Labs, Inc.
Gross intellectual property licensing revenue is recognized at the time a
license agreement has been executed and related costs are recorded as cost of
sales. The cost of sales on the intellectual property licensing business
relates to the legal fees incurred on successfully achieving signed agreements.
The contingent legal fees were based on 50% of the licensing
revenues received on signed agreements and were paid to Forgent&#146;s
previous counsel pursuant to a fee agreement with such counsel.
Forgent has terminated such counsel and is currently in discussions
with the law firm regarding the termination. See Item&nbsp;1 &#147;Business &#150;
Intellectual Property Licensing Business &#150; Patent Licensing
Program&#148; for more detail.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Software and professional service revenue consists of license and service
fees. License fee revenue is earned through the licensing or right to use the
Company&#146;s software and from the sale of specific software products. Service
fee income is earned through the sale of maintenance and technical support,
training, installation, and other professional services related to the sale of
Forgent&#146;s scheduling software. The Company allocates the total fee to the
various elements based on the relative fair values of the elements specific to
the Company. The Company determines the fair value of each element in the
arrangement based on vendor-specific objective evidence (&#147;VSOE&#148;) of fair value.
When VSOE of fair value for the license element is not available, license
revenue is recognized using the residual method. Under the residual method,
the contract value is first allocated to the elements based upon their VSOE of
fair value; the remaining contract value, including any discount, is allocated
to the remaining element that does not have VSOE. For maintenance, VSOE of
fair value is based upon the renewal rate specified in each contract. For
training and installation services, VSOE of fair value is based upon the rates
charged for these services when sold separately. Revenue allocated to
maintenance and technical support is recognized ratably over the maintenance
term (typically one year). Revenue allocated to installation and training is
recognized upon completion of these services due to their short-term nature.
The Company&#146;s training and installation services are not essential to the
functionality of its products as such services can be provided by a third party
or the customers themselves. For instances in which VSOE cannot be determined
and these elements do not provide significant customization or modification of
its software product, Forgent recognizes the entire contract amount ratably
over the period during which the services are expected to be performed.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company does not recognize revenue for agreements with rights of
return, refundable fees, cancellation rights, or acceptance clauses until such
rights of return, refund, or cancellation have expired or acceptance has
occurred. The Company&#146;s arrangements with resellers do not allow for any
rights of return.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deferred revenue includes amounts received from customers in excess of
revenue recognized, and is comprised of deferred maintenance, service, and
other revenue. Deferred revenues are recognized in the Consolidated Statement
of Operations over the terms of the arrangements, primarily ranging from one to
three years.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Costs incurred in connection with the development of software products are
accounted for in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(&#147;SFAS&#148;) No.&nbsp;86, &#147;Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to Be Sold,
Leased or Otherwise Marketed.&#148; Costs incurred prior to the establishment of
technological feasibility are charged to research and development expense.
Software development costs are capitalized after a product is determined to be
technologically feasible and is in the process of being developed for market.
Amortization of capitalized software development costs begins upon initial
product shipment. Capitalized software development costs are amortized over the
estimated life of the related product (generally thirty-six months), using the
straight-line method.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company capitalized internal software development costs of $3,471,
$2,814, and $889 for the years ended July&nbsp;31, 2002, 2003 and 2004,
respectively. Amortization of capitalized software development costs for the
years ended July&nbsp;31, 2002, 2003 and 2004 were $552, $1,524 and $969
respectively. All the amortization of capitalized software development costs
was charged to cost of sales for software and professional services.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the year ended July&nbsp;31, 2004, management decided to discontinue its
efforts on its ALLIANCE software products and services. As a result, the
capitalized software development costs related to ALLIANCE were fully impaired
and the Company recorded a $4,748 charge to cost of sales. During fiscal year
2002, management made the decision to discontinue further development efforts
of a software project and abandoned the project previously capitalized. The
resulting charge of $2,381 was included as a component of cost of sales during
the year ended July&nbsp;31, 2002. No capitalized software development costs were
impaired for the year ended July&nbsp;31, 2003.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL, INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND LONG-LIVED ASSETS</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are no
longer required to be amortized under SFAS No.&nbsp;142, <I>&#147;Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets,&#148; </I>the Company reviews its goodwill and these intangible
assets for possible impairment on an annual basis, or whenever specific events
warrant. Events that may create an impairment review include, but are not
limited to: significant and sustained decline in the Company&#146;s stock price or
market capitalization, significant underperformance of operating units and
significant changes in market conditions and trends. Forgent uses a two-step
process and a discounted cash flow model to evaluate its assets for impairment.
If the carrying amount of the goodwill or asset exceeds its implied fair value,
an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess during that
fiscal period. Intangible assets that are not deemed to have indefinite lives
will continue to be amortized over their useful lives and are tested for
impairment in accordance with SFAS No.&nbsp;144, <I>&#147;Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.&#148;</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with SFAS No.&nbsp;144, Forgent reviews and evaluates its
long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that their net book value may not be recoverable. When such factors
and circumstances exist, including those noted above, the Company compares the
assets&#146; carrying amounts against the estimated undiscounted cash flows to be
generated by those assets over their estimated useful lives. If the carrying
amounts are greater than the fair value of those assets, the excess is recorded
as an impairment in that fiscal period.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts to estimate
losses from uncollectable customer accounts receivables. This estimate is based
in the aggregate, on historical collection experience, age of receivables, and
general economic conditions. It also considers an individual customer&#146;s payment
experience, credit-worthiness and age of receivable balances.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>CASH AND EQUIVALENTS</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash and equivalents include cash and investments in highly liquid
investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased.
As of July&nbsp;31, 2004, the Company holds $650 in certificates of deposit to
secure its note payable to Silicon Valley Bank.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Short-term investments are carried at market value. Short-term investments
consist of funds primarily invested in mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by
the U.S. government, government securities and commercial paper, and all mature
within one year of July&nbsp;31, 2003 and 2004. The carrying amounts of the
Company&#146;s short-term investments at July&nbsp;31, 2003 and 2004 are as follows:

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company accounts for investment securities under SFAS No.&nbsp;115,
&#147;Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.&#148; SFAS No.
115 requires investment securities to be classified as held-to-maturity,
trading or available-for-sale based on the characteristics of the securities
and the activity in the investment portfolio. At July&nbsp;31, 2003 and July&nbsp;31,
2004, all investment securities were classified as available-for-sale. The
Company specifically identifies its short-term investments and uses the cost of
the investments as the basis for recording unrealized gains and losses as part
of other comprehensive income on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and for
recording realized gains and losses as part of other income and expenses on the
Consolidated Statement of Operations. As of July&nbsp;31, 2003 and July&nbsp;31, 2004,

<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS<BR>
(AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA OR OTHERWISE NOTED)</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Company did not have any unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale
securities. The Company realized $1,670, $0 and $0 in related gains during the
years ended July&nbsp;31, 2002, 2003 and 2004 respectively.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>CREDIT POLICY</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company reviews potential customers&#146; credit ratings to evaluate
customers&#146; ability to pay an obligation within the payment term, which is
usually net thirty days. When payment is reasonably assured and no known
barriers exist to legally enforcing the payment, the Company extends credit to
customers, not to exceed 10% of their net worth. An account is placed on
&#147;Credit Hold&#148; if a placed order exceeds the credit limit and may be placed on
&#147;Credit Hold&#148; sooner if circumstances warrant. The Company follows its credit
policy consistently and constantly monitors all of its delinquent accounts for
indications of uncollectibility.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Internal support equipment is
video teleconferencing equipment used internally for purposes such as sales and
marketing demonstrations, Company meetings, testing, troubleshooting customer
problems and engineering, and is recorded at manufactured cost, if the Company
manufactured the asset or is recorded at cost, if purchased. Depreciation and
amortization are recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated
economic useful lives of the assets, which range from two to eight years, over
the lease term or over the life of the improvement of the respective assets, as
applicable. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. The Company
periodically reviews the estimated economic useful lives of its property and
equipment and makes adjustments, if necessary, according to the latest
information available.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The financial statements of the Company&#146;s foreign subsidiaries are
measured using the local currency as the functional currency. Accordingly, the
assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries are translated at current rates of
exchange at the balance sheet date. The resulting gains or losses from
translation are included in a separate component of stockholders&#146; equity.
Income and expense from the subsidiaries are translated using monthly average
exchange rates.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>INCOME TAXES</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company accounts for income taxes under SFAS No.&nbsp;109, &#147;Accounting for
Income Taxes,&#148; which requires the liability method of accounting for income
taxes. Under the liability method, deferred taxes are determined based on the
difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and
liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the
differences are expected to reverse.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgent&#146;s Patent Licensing Program involves risks inherent in licensing
intellectual property, including risks of protracted delays, legal challenges
that would lead to disruption or curtailment of the licensing program,
increasing expenditures associated with pursuit of the program and other risks
that could adversely affect the Company&#146;s licensing program. Additionally, the
U.S. patent expires in October&nbsp;2006 and its foreign counterparts expire in
September&nbsp;2007. Thus, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able
to continue to effectively license its technology to other companies.
Additionally, there are no guarantees that the Company can protect its
intellectual property rights in its current litigation or prevent the
unauthorized use of its technology in the future. However, Forgent will
continue to enforce and pursue its rights through the legal system when
necessary.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company sells its software and services to various companies across
several industries, including third-party resellers. The Company performs
ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and maintains reserves for
potential credit losses. The Company requires advanced payments or secured
transactions when deemed necessary.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carrying amount of short-term investments and notes payable
approximates fair value because of the short maturity and nature of these
instruments. The Company places its cash investment in quality financial
instruments and limits the amount invested in any one institution or in any
type of instrument. The Company has not experienced any significant losses on
its investments.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>EMPLOYEE STOCK PLANS</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company determines the fair value of grants of stock, stock options
and other equity instruments issued to employees in accordance with SFAS No.
123, &#147;Accounting and Disclosure of Stock-Based Compensation,&#148; which was amended
by SFAS No.&nbsp;148, &#147;Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation&#151;Transition and
Disclosure.&#148; SFAS No.&nbsp;123 encourages, but does not require, companies to
recognize compensation expense for grants of stock, stock options, and other
equity instruments to employees based on their estimated fair market value on
the date of grant. SFAS No.&nbsp;148 provides alternative methods of transition for
a voluntary change to a fair value based method of accounting for stock-based
compensation. As allowed by SFAS No.&nbsp;123, the Company has opted to continue to
apply the existing accounting rules contained in APB No.&nbsp;25, &#147;Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees.&#148; SFAS No.&nbsp;123 and SFAS No.&nbsp;148 have had no effect on
the Company&#146;s financial position or results of operations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company records unearned compensation related to equity instruments
that are issued at prices which are below the fair market value of the
underlying stock on the measurement date. Such unearned compensation is
amortized ratably over the vesting period of the related equity instruments.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company applies APB No.&nbsp;25 and related interpretations in accounting
for its stock option plans for grants to employees. Accordingly, no
compensation cost is recognized for its stock option plans unless options are
issued at exercise prices that are below the market price on the measurement
date. Had compensation cost for the Company&#146;s stock option plans been
determined based on the fair market value at the grant dates for awards under
those plans consistent with the fair value method, the Company&#146;s net (loss)
income per share would have been reflected by the following pro forma amounts
for the years ended July&nbsp;31, 2002, 2003 and 2004:

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March&nbsp;2004, the Financial Accounting Standard Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) issued an
exposure draft entitled &#147;<I>Share-Based Payment, an Amendment of FASB Statements
Nos. 123 and 95,&#148; </I>which eliminates the ability to account for share-based
compensation transactions using APB No.&nbsp;25, <I>&#147;Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees.&#148; </I>The exposure draft would require stock-based compensation to
employees to be recognized as a cost in the financial statements and that such
cost should be measured according to the fair value of the stock options. The
proposed requirements in the exposure draft would be effective for fiscal years
beginning after June&nbsp;15, 2005, or fiscal year 2006 for the Company. The FASB
intends to issue a final Statement in late 2004. In order to determine the
impact on its consolidated financial statements, Forgent will continue to
monitor the progress on this exposure draft.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March&nbsp;2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force issued consensus No.&nbsp;03-1
(&#147;EITF 03-1&#148;), &#147;The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and its
Application to Certain Investments.&#148; The consensus applies to certain
investments in debt and security securities accounted for under Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (&#147;SFAS&#148;) No.&nbsp;115, &#147;Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,&#148; and SFAS No.&nbsp;124, &#147;Accounting for
Certain Investments Held by Not-for-Profit Organizations.&#148; EITF 03-1 provides
a three-step model to evaluate whether an investment is considered impaired,
whether that impairment is other than temporary and the measurement of an
impairment loss. The impairment accounting guidance is effective for reporting
periods beginning after June&nbsp;15, 2004, or the Company&#146;s first fiscal quarter of
2005, and disclosure requirements are effective for annual periods ending after
June&nbsp;15, 2004, or the Company&#146;s 2005 fiscal year. The adoption of this
interpretation is not expected to have a material effect on the Company&#146;s
consolidated results of operations, consolidated financial position or
consolidated cash flows.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>3. ACQUISITIONS</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During fiscal year 2004, Forgent acquired certain assets and the
operations of Network Simplicity Software Inc., a privately held provider of
web-based scheduling solutions. As a result of the acquisition, the acquired
software products were molded into the Company&#146;s &#147;NetSimplicity&#148; software
product line. NetSimplicity&#146;s flagship product, Meeting Room&nbsp;Manager, is an
easy-to-use web-based tool that schedules rooms, people and resources globally.
Another NetSimplicity product, Visual Asset Manager, is a network and
web-based solution that allows businesses to effectively track and manage their
assets, including computers, printers, software and employees. These acquired
software products are targeted for small to medium sized companies and
departments or divisions of large enterprises. This strategic acquisition
allowed the Company to expand its market opportunities into the small to medium
sized business market.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgent purchased Network Simplicity Software Inc. for approximately
$3,315, consisting of $2,115 in cash and assumed liabilities, and approximately
$1,200 in potential future cash considerations. The $2,115 represents the
amount recorded as the purchase price of the acquisition, which was accounted
for as a purchase of assets. Accordingly, the purchase price was allocated to
the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired based on their
estimated fair values

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During April&nbsp;2004, $358 of the potential future cash considerations was
earned by the seller of Network Simplicity Software Inc., recorded as an
adjustment to the purchase price and allocated to acquired software. The
remaining $842 tied to future contingencies will be recorded as additional
purchase price when, and if, the amounts are paid.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of this acquisition, Forgent&#146;s workforce grew by ten
employees, and the acquired workforce remained based in Richmond, British
Columbia, Canada. Additionally, NetSimplicity&#146;s results of operations since
October&nbsp;6, 2003 have been included in the Company&#146;s Consolidated Statement of
Operations for the year ended July&nbsp;31, 2004.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During fiscal year 2002, Forgent acquired certain assets and liabilities
in a purchase business combination structured as an asset purchase of Global
Scheduling Solutions, Inc., a global provider of enterprise conference room
scheduling and resource management solutions. This business combination was
completed in order for Forgent to expand the quality and reach of its then
enterprise software sales and marketing efforts and to acquire an enterprise
scheduling software solution to complement its previous Video Network Platform
solution.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgent paid Global Scheduling Solutions, Inc. a combination of $3,750 in
cash, $250 held in escrow for representations and warranties, $700 tied to
certain future contingent &#147;earn-out&#148; payments and the assumption of certain
liabilities. The $700 liability was dependent upon the purchased assets
generating a certain level of net revenue between April&nbsp;2002 and September
2002. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase of assets. Accordingly,
the purchase price was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible
assets acquired based on their estimated fair values at the date of
acquisition. Total cost in excess of the tangible and intangible assets
acquired of $5,229 was recorded as goodwill. The following table shows the
amounts assigned to each major asset and liability class as of the date of
acquisition:

result of finalizing the valuation of the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed. As of January&nbsp;31, 2003, the Company no longer had any liabilities owed
to Global Scheduling Solutions, Inc. As of July&nbsp;31, 2004, the acquired
goodwill was fully impaired (see Note 4).

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the second fiscal quarter of 2004, Forgent faced declining revenues
related to its ALLIANCE software products and services. On the other hand,
Forgent experienced increasing revenues related to its NetSimplicity software
products and services. Additionally, management learned that while indicators
of demand existed for ALLIANCE, issues regarding price sensitivity, lengthy
sales cycle and integration with enterprise infrastructures were preventing
ALLIANCE from achieving the revenues that management originally anticipated.
Starting in January&nbsp;2004, management reviewed its software segment, the related
cash flows from its ALLIANCE and NetSimplicity product lines and re-evaluated
its strategy regarding growing revenues from this segment. As a result, the
ALLIANCE assets were impaired.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to SFAS No.&nbsp;86, &#147;Accounting for the Costs of Software to Be Sold,
Leased, or Otherwise Marketed,&#148; and SFAS No.&nbsp;144, &#147;Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,&#148; Forgent evaluated the
recoverability of its long-lived assets, including the equipment and
capitalized software development costs, related to the ALLIANCE efforts. Based
on the projected negative cash flows related to ALLIANCE, Forgent fully
impaired the $4,748 in net capitalized software development costs and $211 in
equipment related to ALLIANCE. Additionally, Forgent impaired $100 of certain
prepaid assets that specifically supported ALLIANCE. Due to the decrease in
software and professional services revenues and Forgent&#146;s shift in its
go-forward strategy for its software segment, the Company was also required to
perform an impairment analysis in accordance with SFAS No.&nbsp;142, &#147;Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets.&#148; As part of the impairment analysis, Forgent
determined the implied fair value of goodwill based on a discounted cash flow
model. As a result of this valuation, Forgent recorded a $5,042 impairment of
its goodwill related to its acquisitions of Vosaic, LLC and Global Scheduling
Solutions, Inc. The technology obtained from these acquisitions supported the
development efforts on ALLIANCE and its predecessor, Forgent&#146;s Video Network
Platform. The $10,101 impairment charge related to ALLIANCE was recorded to
the Consolidated Statement of Operations, with $4,838 in cost of sales and
$5,263 in operating expenses.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the change in focus of its software segment, Forgent also evaluated
the recoverability of its intangible assets and long-lived assets related to
its NetSimplicity product line in accordance with SFAS No.&nbsp;142 and SFAS No.
144. These assets included fixed assets and intangible assets. Based on the
projected positive cash flow related to NetSimplicity, Forgent did not record
any impairment charge related to its NetSimplicity assets for the year ended
July&nbsp;31, 2004.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January&nbsp;2004, the Company closed its sales office in Melville, New
York. Management was unable to sublease the vacated space and upon review of
the future discounted cash flows related to this lease, management recorded an
impairment charge of $78. Additionally, management analyzed the discounted
cash flows related to its Wild Basin

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">property lease and subleases over the remainder of the lease term. Although
Forgent was able to sublease the vacated space more quickly than originally
anticipated, the rates on the subleases were less than originally anticipated
due to depressed current market rates. Therefore, management calculated the
economic value of the lost sublease rental income and recorded an additional
charge of $1,465. Also during the second fiscal quarter of 2004, Forgent
analyzed its recorded leasehold improvements at its Wild Basin property. This
analysis indicated that certain leasehold improvements were no longer of value.
Therefore, management recorded an impairment charge of $183 related to these
leasehold improvements. The $1,726 impairment related to the Wild Basin and
New York leases and the leasehold improvements were recorded as part of
operating expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year
ended July&nbsp;31, 2004. As of July&nbsp;31, 2004, Forgent had settled its lease
obligations on its office in Melville, New York, remained obligated to make
lease payments in accordance with the original terms of its Wild Basin property
lease and had $1,865 recorded as a liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet
related the Wild Basin property.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the fiscal year ended July&nbsp;31, 2003, Forgent recorded impairment
losses on the Consolidated Statement of Operations as follows:

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November&nbsp;2002, the GSS development operations in Atlanta, Georgia, were
relocated to Forgent&#146;s headquarters in Austin, Texas. Management was unable to
sublease the vacated space and upon review of the future undiscounted cash
flows related to this lease, management recorded an impairment charge of $21.
Additionally, management analyzed the discounted cash flows related to its Wild
Basin property lease and subleases over the remainder of the lease term.
Although Forgent was able to sublease the vacated space more quickly than
originally anticipated, the rates on the subleases were considerably less than
originally anticipated due to depressed then current market rates. Therefore,
management calculated the economic value of the lost sublease rental income and
recorded an additional charge of $481. Forgent remained obligated to make
lease payments in accordance with the original terms of both leases. Both the
Atlanta and Wild Basin lease impairments were recorded as part of continuing
operations on the Company&#146;s Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year
ended July&nbsp;31, 2003.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgent&#146;s discontinued integration and videoconferencing hardware services
businesses were located at its facilities in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania,
which leases approximately 41 thousand square feet. As a result of the sale of
Forgent&#146;s integration business, approximately 19% of the total lease space was
subleased to SPL, based on then current market values. As a result of the sale
of Forgent&#146;s videoconferencing hardware services business to Gores in July
2003, approximately 37% of the total lease space was subleased to Gores, based
on then current market values. SPL and another subtenant subleased the
remaining 63% of the total lease space during fiscal year 2003. However, in
October&nbsp;2003, SPL&#146;s sublease terminated and the subtenant vacated its leased
space. Therefore, management reviewed the undiscounted cash flows of this
lease and the related subleases, determined the economic value of the lost
sublease rental income and recorded a charge of $454. Forgent remained
obligated to make lease payments in accordance with the original terms of the
lease. Since Forgent fully discontinued its operations in King of Prussia, the
lease impairment for this facility was recorded as part of discontinued
operations on the Company&#146;s Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year
ended July&nbsp;31, 2003.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the 2003 fiscal year, Forgent recorded $312 in accrued interest on
both outstanding notes receivable from VTEL Products Corporation (&#147;VTEL&#148;) and
fully reserved the accrued interest. Management agreed with VTEL&#146;s management
during the first fiscal quarter of 2003 to offset Forgent&#146;s accounts payable to
VTEL with its accounts receivable, notes receivable and interest receivable
from VTEL. The Forgent liability was fully offset with the accounts

default, thus relieving $693 of the related reserves. Since the initial $5,967
charge to reserve the VTEL notes receivable was reported as part of the asset
impairment from continuing operations, the related reduction of the reserves is
also reported as part of the asset impairment from continuing operations for
the year ended July&nbsp;31, 2003. No cash was exchanged with these transactions.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, the ongoing difficult economic environment and its
associated negative impact on the Company&#146;s software business during fiscal
year 2003 represented an indicator of a possible impairment on the Company&#146;s
software business. Therefore, the Company was required to perform an
impairment analysis in accordance with SFAS No.&nbsp;142, &#147;Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets&#148; to determine the fair value of the assets and liabilities of
its software business. As a result of this analysis, Forgent recorded a $1,331
impairment of its goodwill related to its acquisition of GSS. This impairment
was recorded as part of continuing operations on the Company&#146;s Consolidated
Statement of Operations for the year ended July&nbsp;31, 2003.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the fiscal year ended July&nbsp;31, 2002, Forgent recorded impairment
losses on the Consolidated Statement of Operations as follows:

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s OnScreen24&#153; operations, which were folded back into
Forgent&#146;s core operations in January&nbsp;2001, developed a video streaming
technology, which is a server application with the abilities to create video
e-mail programs and to store streamed video for later non-real time playback.
Initially, management intended to leverage these efforts and further develop
this technology as an added feature to its VNP software. Based upon customer
feedback regarding the VNP software during fiscal year 2002, customers did not
need advanced features but desired fundamental network management applications
with more robust device level support and valued added network level
instrumentation for ISDN and IP networks to enable them to understand and
monitor how well their networks were performing. Therefore, management
determined the video streaming technology would not be used in the development
of VNP. As a result, the $2,381 capitalized software development costs
associated with this technology was impaired during the year ended July&nbsp;31,
2002 and was reported as part of cost of sales from continuing operations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the disposition of the products business segment in fiscal year
2002, the VTEL personnel relocated from Forgent&#146;s headquarters at 108 Wild
Basin Road in Austin, Texas to VTEL&#146;s headquarters at 9208 Waterford Centre
Blvd. in Austin, Texas. This relocation left a vacancy of approximately 52
thousand rentable square feet, or 38% of the total lease space. Additionally,
Forgent had existing unoccupied space inventory due to the downsizing of the
Company relating to its restructurings. In fiscal year 2002, Forgent was able
to sublease some of the vacated space, but was unable to fully sublease the
space due to the economic downturn during the year. Therefore, management
analyzed the future undiscounted cash flows related to the lease on the Wild
Basin property and determined the economic value of the lost sublease rental
income. As a result, Forgent recorded a $2,063 impairment charge for the
unleased space as of July&nbsp;31, 2002. However, Forgent remained obligated to
make lease payments in accordance with the original terms of the lease.
Additionally, Forgent received two subordinated promissory notes from VTEL as a
result of the sale of the products business segment. VTEL did not remit
payment on its first subordinated promissory note due in April&nbsp;2002, as
stipulated in the sales agreement. As a result of this default and due to the
uncertainty in collecting both of the outstanding notes from VTEL, the Company
recorded a $5,967 charge for the reserve of both notes from VTEL for the year
ended July&nbsp;31, 2002. These impairments were reported as part of continuing
operations on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>5. RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During fiscal year 2004, Forgent streamlined its software operations to be
more commensurate with its software revenue base and implemented a leaner cost
structure, which included reducing headcount and closing certain sales offices
to conform to the Company&#146;s new operating structure. As a result of this
restructuring, Forgent terminated 62 employees, or 58% of the workforce, which
affected 33 employees in sales and marketing, 22 employees in research and
development and seven employees in general and administrative functions. The
designated employees were terminated upon the announcement of the reduction and
were assisted with outplacement support services and severance. Additionally,
Forgent closed its sales offices in McLean, Virginia and Houston, Texas. In
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (&#147;SFAS&#148;) No.&nbsp;146,
&#147;Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities,&#148; the Company
recorded a one-time charge of $616 for termination benefits and $12 related to
the office closings during the year ended July&nbsp;31, 2004. As of July&nbsp;31, 2004,
the Company had a liability of $4 related to the restructuring activities.
This liability will be paid during the first fiscal quarter of 2005.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During fiscal year 2002, the Company restructured its organization, which
involved the termination of 65 employees, or 17% of the workforce, who were
assisted with outplacement support and severance. The reduction affected 16
employees in Austin, Texas, 30 employees in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, and
19 employees in remote and international locations. The restructuring was the
result of eliminating certain business elements that did not contribute to
Forgent&#146;s core competencies at that time as well as efforts to increase
efficiencies and to significantly reduce administrative costs. All of the
employees were terminated and the Company recorded a one-time charge of $818 in
the first quarter of fiscal 2002 for the restructuring. This charge is included
in the loss from discontinued operations on the Consolidated Statement of
Operations. As of July&nbsp;31, 2002, all of the involuntary termination benefits
had been paid.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>6. SALE OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the first fiscal quarter of 2004, the Company sold $1,746 of its
outstanding accounts receivable, without any recourse to Silicon Valley Bank in
order to maintain cash balances at levels considered appropriate by management.
Silicon Valley Bank purchased the assets at face value, less fees of
approximately 1.2% of the face value of the accounts receivable sold and a
one-time annual set-up fee of $10. The Company received proceeds from Silicon
Valley Bank of $1,713. During fiscal year 2002, the Company sold $9,279 of its
outstanding accounts receivable, without any recourse, in efforts to recapture
cash balances lost due primarily to an unanticipated significant drop in sales
from its discontinued operations and the remaining payments of outstanding
payables related to its discontinued operations. Silicon Valley Bank purchased
the assets at face value, less a fee of approximately 1.8% of the face value of
the accounts receivable sold and a one-time annual set-up fee of $13. The
Company received proceeds from Silicon Valley Bank of $9,100.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the provisions of SFAS No.&nbsp;140, &#147;Accounting for Transfers and
Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities,&#148; which
Forgent adopted as of January&nbsp;31, 2002, a transfer of receivables may be
accounted for as a sale if the following three conditions are met: (1)&nbsp;the
transferred assets are isolated from the transferor, (2)&nbsp;the transferee has the
right to pledge or sell the transferred assets and (3)&nbsp;the transferor does not
maintain control over the transferred assets. Accordingly, the Company recorded
the transfers of the accounts receivable as sales of assets, excluded the
related receivables from the Consolidated Balance Sheet and recorded related
expenses of $179 and $33 for the years ended July&nbsp;31, 2002 and July&nbsp;31, 2004,
respectively. Excluding the accounts receivable sold as part of the
divestiture of the videoconferencing hardware services business (see Note 7),
no other accounts receivable were sold during the year ended July&nbsp;31, 2003.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>7. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On July&nbsp;3, 2003, Forgent sold substantially all of the assets of its
videoconferencing hardware services business (&#147;Services Business&#148;), based in
King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, to an affiliate of Gores Technology Group
(&#147;Gores&#148;), a privately held international acquisition and management firm. The
divestiture was a strategic move designed to enable Forgent to focus on growing
its intellectual property licensing business, growing its software and
professional services business, increasing its cash balances, improving its
overall gross margin and reducing its operating expenses. The assets sold
included accounts receivable, inventory, fixed assets, certain prepaid assets,
and goodwill. As consideration for the sale of the Services Business, the
Company received $7,350 in cash, which was net of a $400 transaction extension
fee, and the assumption of substantially all of the Services Business&#146;
liabilities, including deferred maintenance revenue, identified accounts
payable and capital lease obligations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An additional $2,250 in cash was held for possible purchase price
adjustments and indemnity claims. During fiscal year 2004, Forgent negotiated
the final resolution of the purchase price adjustments with Gores. As a
result, Forgent received $575 in cash from Gores in January&nbsp;2004. As of July
31, 2004, the remaining $1,000 in cash was held in escrow for indemnity claims.
Details of these escrowed funds and other important information are set forth
in the Company&#146;s proxy statement for fiscal year 2002. Forgent cannot provide
any assurances that it will receive some or any of the remaining funds still
held in escrow.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgent assigned its lease for approximately six thousand square feet of
office space in Kennesaw, Georgia to Gores, which was accepted by the landlord
with no further obligations by Forgent. This office space was utilized as a
sales office for the Services Business. Furthermore, Forgent did not remain
contingently liable for performance on existing contracts or future contracts
entered into by Gores. The Company does not have any continuing involvement in
the go-forward operations of the Services Business.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the sale of the Services Business, Forgent and Gores
entered into a transition services agreement, whereby the Company will provide,
for a fee at actual cost, certain transition services for Gores related to the
assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the sale. Forgent and Gores also
entered into a reseller agreement, whereby Gores may resell the Company&#146;s
software products, and a co-marketing arrangement, whereby the Company will
receive a commission for referring videoconferencing related service business
to Gores. Gores retained approximately 70 employees employed by the Services
Business. For the year ended July&nbsp;31, 2003, Forgent incurred a loss of $1,954
on the disposal of the Services Business. During fiscal year 2004, the Company
recorded $573 in income from discontinued operations. This income resulted
from cash received from Gores in January&nbsp;2004 related to the sale of the
Services Business and the residual activity related to the disposal of the
Services Business. The Company did not conduct any business from this business
line during the year ended July&nbsp;31, 2004.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April&nbsp;2002, Forgent sold inventory and certain other assets related to
its integration business to SPL Integrated Solutions (&#147;SPL&#148;), a leading
nationwide integrator that designs and installs large-display videoconferencing
systems and fully integrated multimedia systems for corporations, educational
institutions and government agencies. As a result of the sale, Forgent received
$150 in cash and a $282 note receivable from SPL, which was fully paid as of
July&nbsp;31, 2003. SPL absorbed 15 members of Forgent&#146;s Professional Services
Integration team and re-located to Forgent&#146;s videoconferencing hardware
services facility in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, where the combined team of
engineers and technicians managed and executed the delivery of audio-video
system integration and support. The assets related to the integration business
were sold for approximately their net book value and thus an immaterial amount
of gain was recorded during fiscal year 2002.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January&nbsp;2002, Forgent sold the operations and substantially all of the
assets of its products business segment, including the VTEL name, to VTEL
Products Corporation (&#147;VTEL&#148;), a privately held company created by the former
Vice-President of Manufacturing and two other senior management members of the
products business segment. As a result, the Company received cash of $500, a
90-day subordinated promissory note, bearing interest at an annual rate of five
percent, for $967, a 5-year subordinated promissory note, bearing interest at
an annual rate of five percent, for $5,000 and 1,045 shares of common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, representing 19.9% of the new company&#146;s fully
diluted equity. Additionally, Forgent and VTEL entered into a general license
agreement, in which VTEL was granted certain non-exclusive rights in and to
certain patents, software, proprietary know-how and information of the Company
that was used in the daily operations of the products business segment. The
group of management who purchased the products segment (now referred to as
VTEL) put up $500 of their own money at the closing. In addition, VTEL also
received a $750 line of credit from a bank, which was not guaranteed by
Forgent. The facilities lease was signed over to VTEL, which was accepted by
the landlord with no further obligations by Forgent. Furthermore, Forgent did
not remain contingently liable for performance on existing contracts or future
contracts entered into by the newly formed entity. The

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Company does not have any continuing involvement in the go-forward operations
of VTEL. It does not have veto power or any means to exercise influence over
the operations of that company. The Company has made no guarantees with respect
to any business matters as they relate to VTEL nor are there any situations
whereby the Company would be required to reassume any obligations of VTEL.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to uncertainties regarding VTEL&#146;s future business, Forgent fully
reserved its equity interest in VTEL. VTEL did not remit payment on its first
subordinated promissory note due in April&nbsp;2002, as stipulated in the sales
agreement. As a result of this default and due to the uncertainty in collecting
the two outstanding notes from VTEL, the Company recorded a $5,967 charge for
the reserve of both notes from VTEL for the year ended July&nbsp;31, 2002. This
charge was accounted for as part of continuing operations on the Company&#146;s
Consolidated Statement of Operations. Despite the low probability of
collection, management continues its efforts on collecting these outstanding
notes receivables. Since the sale of the products business occurred several
months after it was originally anticipated to close, and since the operations
performed significantly worse than expected, an additional loss of $8,171 was
recorded to discontinued operations in fiscal year 2002. At the end of fiscal
year 2001, the Company estimated the loss from the disposal of the products
business segment to be $1,120 and recorded an additional $255 in expenses

associated with the completion of the sale during fiscal year 2002.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the sales of the videoconferencing hardware services,
integration and products businesses, the Company has presented these businesses
as discontinued operations on the accompanying consolidated financial
statements. Since all three businesses were sold as of July&nbsp;31, 2003, no net
assets from discontinued operations are presented on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets as of July&nbsp;31, 2003 or as of July&nbsp;31, 2004. However, the operating
results of the videoconferencing hardware services, integration and products
businesses included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the fiscal
years ended July&nbsp;31, 2002, 2003 and 2004 are as follows:

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During fiscal years 2003 and 2004, the Company repurchased 709 and 170
shares of its Common Stock for $1,374 and $495, respectively. These purchased
shares remained in treasury as of the end of fiscal year 2004. The repurchase
of stock resulted in an increase in income per share of $0.02 in fiscal year
2003 and no change in fiscal year 2004.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>STOCK AND STOCK OPTION PLANS</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgent has three stock option plans, the 1989 Stock Option Plan (the
&#147;1989 Plan&#148;), the 1996 Stock Option Plan (the &#147;1996 Plan&#148;) and the 1992
Director Stock Option Plan (the &#147;1992 Plan&#148;). The 1989 Plan and the 1996 Plan
both provide for the issuance of non-qualified and incentive stock options to
employees and consultants of the Company. Stock options are generally granted
at the fair market value at the time of grant, and the options generally vest
ratably over 48&nbsp;months and are exercisable for a period of ten years beginning
with date of grant. Effective June&nbsp;1999, the 1989 Plan expired whereby the
Company can no longer grant options under the 1989 Plan; however, options
previously granted remain outstanding. The 1992 Plan provides for the issuance

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, options are exercisable immediately upon grant. However, stock
issued upon exercise of a stock option is subject to repurchase by the Company
at the exercise price until the option vesting period has elapsed. At July&nbsp;31,
2004, options to purchase 1,430 shares were vested. At July&nbsp;31, 2004, no
unvested options had been exercised.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On April&nbsp;29, 1993, Forgent adopted an Employee Stock Purchase Plan
(&#147;Employee Plan&#148;), which enables all employees to acquire Forgent stock under
the plan. The Employee Plan authorizes the issuance of up to 1,350 shares of
Forgent&#146;s Common Stock. The Employee Plan allows participants to purchase
shares of the Company&#146;s Common Stock at a price equal to the lesser of (a)&nbsp;85%
of the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date of the grant of the
option or (b)&nbsp;85% of the fair market value of the Common Stock at the time of
exercise. Common Stock issued under the Employee Plan totaled 99 shares, 178
shares and 73 shares, respectively, for the years ended July&nbsp;31, 2002, 2003 and
2004.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>RESTRICTED STOCK PLAN</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December&nbsp;17, 1998, the Company adopted a restricted stock plan (the
&#147;1998 Plan&#148;). The 1998 Plan authorizes the issuance of up to one million shares
of Forgent&#146;s Common Stock to be used to reward, incent and retain employees.
During fiscal year 2004, the Company issued 35 shares under the 1998 Plan with
a weighted-average grant

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">date fair market value of $3.07 and recognized $41 in related expense during
the year ended July&nbsp;31, 2004. During fiscal year 2003, the Company issued 19

of $1.94 and recognized $36 in related expense during the year ended July&nbsp;31,

Plan with a weighted-average grant date fair market value of $2.64 and
recognized $85 in related expense during the year ended July&nbsp;31, 2002.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>MODIFICATIONS TO OPTIONS</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On July&nbsp;18, 2002, the Company modified the change of control agreements of
certain officers of the Company. The original option agreements accelerated the
vesting schedule of the officers&#146; unvested options three months for every year
of employment in the event of a change of control as defined in the plan. The
modified agreements vest all unvested options upon a change of control,
regardless of length of service. As of July&nbsp;18, 2002, the potential charge
related to this modification was approximately $591 and will be recognized upon
a change of control. As there is no pending or anticipated change of control
event, the Company has not recognized a charge. In addition, the maximum
severance allowed under the agreements was reduced from 1.8 times annual salary
to 1.0 times annual salary.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>11. DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company sponsors a defined contribution 401(k) plan that is available
to substantially all employees. The plan may be amended or terminated at any
time by the Board of Directors. The Company, although not required to, has
provided matching contributions to the plan of $135, $57 and $46 for the years
ended July&nbsp;31, 2002, July&nbsp;31, 2003 and July&nbsp;31, 2004, respectively. These
contributions were recorded as expenses in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>12. REVENUE CONCENTRATION</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixty-five percent of the Company&#146;s total revenue for the year ended July
31, 2004 was generated by one-time intellectual property license agreements
with three companies. Thirty-five percent of the Company&#146;s total revenue for
the year ended July&nbsp;31, 2003 was generated by one-time intellectual property
license agreements with three companies. Fifty-three percent of the Company&#146;s
total revenue for the year ended July&nbsp;31, 2002 was generated by one-time
intellectual property license agreements with two companies. While the Company
does not anticipate any additional intellectual property revenue from these
companies, it continues to actively seek licenses with other users of its
technology. Additionally, the U.S. patent expires in October&nbsp;2006 and its
foreign counterparts expire in September&nbsp;2007.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>13. EARNINGS (LOSS)&nbsp;PER SHARE</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted
earnings (loss)&nbsp;per common share for the years ended July&nbsp;31, 2002, 2003 and
2004. Approximately 3,701 options, 2,596 options and 2,274 options in
fiscal years 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively, were not included in the
computation of the dilutive stock options because the effect of such options
would be antidilutive.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At July&nbsp;31, 2004, the Company had federal net operating loss carryforwards
of approximately $147,891, research and development credit carryforwards of
approximately $5,352 and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of
approximately $280. The net operating loss and research and development credit
carryforwards will expire in varying amounts from 2005 through 2024, if not
utilized. Minimum tax credit carryforwards do not expire and carry forward
indefinitely.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of various acquisitions performed by the Company in prior
years, utilization of the net operating losses and credit carryforwards may be
subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the &#147;change in ownership&#148;
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The annual limitation may
result in the expiration of net operating losses before utilization.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of realizing the benefits of
its favorable tax attributes in future tax returns, the Company has placed a
valuation allowance against its net deferred tax asset. Accordingly, no
deferred tax benefits have been recorded for the tax years ended July&nbsp;31, 2002,
2003 and 2004. The valuation allowance increased by approximately $7,003 during
the year ended July&nbsp;31, 2004 primarily due to operating losses not benefited.
Approximately $7,976 of the valuation allowance relates to tax benefits for
stock option deductions included in the net operating loss carryforward which,
when realized, will be allocated directly to contributed capital to the extent
the benefits exceed amounts attributable to book deferred compensation expense.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undistributed earnings of the Company&#146;s foreign subsidiaries are
considered permanently reinvested and, accordingly, no provision for U.S.
federal or state income taxes has been provided thereon.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s provision (benefit)&nbsp;for income taxes attributable to
continuing operations differs from the expected tax expense (benefit)&nbsp;amount
computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate of 34% to income
before income taxes for the years ended July&nbsp;31, 2002, 2003 and 2004 primarily
as a result of the following:

(AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA OR OTHERWISE NOTED)</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current portion of the capital lease obligations is included in other
accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the sale agreement of the products business segment, Forgent
assigned the lease for its former manufacturing facility in Austin, Texas to
the new company, VTEL Corporation, who assumed all obligations under the
existing lease. Therefore, these lease payments are excluded from the minimum
operating lease payments presented above. Similarly, the lease payments for
the Company&#146;s former service sales office in Kennesaw, Georgia are excluded
from the minimum operating lease payments since this lease was assigned to
Gores as part of the sale of the videoconferencing hardware services business.
Gores assumed all obligations under this existing lease. Forgent may
periodically make other commitments and thus become subject to other
contractual obligations. However, management believes these commitments and
contractual obligations are routine in nature and incidental to the Company&#146;s
operations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total rent expense under all operating leases for the years ended July&nbsp;31,
2002, 2003 and 2004 was $3,497, $1,399 and $2,018, respectively. During the
years ended July&nbsp;31, 2002, 2003 and 2004, the Company received $708, $585 and
$1,307 respectively, in rental income under sub-leasing arrangements. These
amounts offset against rental expense in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations. At July&nbsp;31, 2004, future minimum lease payments receivable under
non-cancelable sub-lease arrangements totaled $2,851 for all future years and
sub-tenant deposits totaled $183.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of July&nbsp;31, 2004, the Company had a $748 liability remaining on its
books related to a Tenant Improvement Allowance that was paid to the Company by
the landlord for its Wild Basin property in Austin, Texas. The liability is
amortized monthly as a reduction in rental expense over the life of the lease
on a straight-line basis. Approximately $661 of this liability is reported as
part of long-term liabilities on the Company&#146;s Consolidated Balance Sheet.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of July&nbsp;31, 2004, Forgent had a $2,100 liability related to impairment
charges for the economic value of the lost sublease rental income at its
properties in Austin, Texas and King of Prussia, Pennsylvania. The liability
is amortized monthly as a reduction in rental expense based on the difference
between the actual subtenant rental income and the expected subtenant rental
income. Approximately $1,623 of this liability is reported as part of
long-term liabilities on the Company&#146;s Consolidated Balance Sheet.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>CONTINGENCIES</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is the defendant or plaintiff in various actions that arose in
the normal course of business. In the opinion of management, the ultimate
disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse affect on the
Company&#146;s financial condition, results of operation or cash flows.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April&nbsp;2004, Forgent&#146;s wholly-owned subsidiary, Compression Labs, Inc.
(&#147;CLI&#148;), initiated litigation against 31 companies for infringement of United
States Patent No.&nbsp;4,698,672 in the United States District Court for the Eastern
District of Texas, Marshall Division, seeking injunctive relief against sales
of infringing products and monetary damages, among other relief sought. The
defendants consist of Adobe Systems Incorporated; Agfa Corporation; Apple
Computer, Incorporated; Axis Communications, Incorporated; Cannon USA; Concord
Camera Corporation; Creative Labs, Incorporated; Dell Incorporated; Eastman
Kodak Company; Fuji Photo Film Co U.S.A.; Fujitsu Computer Products of America;
Gateway, Inc.; Hewlett-Packard Company; International Business Machines Corp.;
JASC Software; JVC Americas Corporation; Kyocera Wireless Corporation;
Macromedia, Inc.; Matsushita Electric Corporation of America; Oce&#146; North
America, Incorporated; Onkyo Corporation; PalmOne, Inc.; Panasonic
Communications Corporation of America; Panasonic Mobile Communications
Development Corporation of USA; Ricoh Corporation; Riverdeep, Incorporated
(d.b.a. Broderbund); Savin Corporation; Thomson S.A.; Toshiba Corporation; and
Xerox Corporation. Additionally, in August&nbsp;2004, CLI initiated litigation
against another 11 companies for infringement of United States Patent No.
4,698,672. The defendants consist of Acer America Corporation; AudioVox
Corporation; BancTec, Inc.; BenQ America Corporation; Color Dreams, Inc. (d/b/a
StarDot Technologies); Google Inc.; ScanSoft, Inc.; Sun Microsystems Inc.; TiVo
Inc.; Veo Inc.; and Yahoo! Inc. Forgent has since settled with two of the
defendants.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty-four of the defendants have filed against CLI and Forgent in the
U.S. Federal Court for Delaware, seeking declaratory relief that the &#145;672
patent is not infringed, is unenforceable, and is invalid, among other
assertions. Additionally, three other defendants have filed suit against CLI
and Forgent in the U.S. District Court for Northern California, San Jose
Division, the U.S. District Court for Delaware and the U.S. District Court for
Northern California, Oakland Division, seeking similar declaratory relief.
Forgent and CLI have moved to stay, dismiss or transfer the Delaware actions,
asserting that all such issues should be heard in the U.S. District for the
Eastern District, Marshall Division, rather than in Delaware. Although Forgent
is currently unaware of any other suits against CLI and itself, it is

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">possible that other defendants, and/or other accused infringers, could
join in the pending Delaware actions or file similar suits for declaratory
relief in Delaware or elsewhere.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&nbsp;2003, the Company received notification from the Federal Trade
Commission (the &#147;FTC&#148;) that it is conducting a non-public investigation to
determine whether the Company may have engaged in violation of the Federal
Trade Commission Act by reason of the alleged involvement of CLI in the JPEG
standard-setting process during the 1980&#146;s and very early 1990&#146;s and its
subsequent licensing of the &#145;672 patent, which the Company believes is
infringed by the implementation of that standard. If the FTC proceeds with an
investigation and thereafter determines that the Company acted improperly,
further proceedings before the FTC could ensue, which could result in a
challenge to the Company&#146;s &#145;672 patent licensing program. The Company believes
that CLI has not acted improperly and advised the FTC as such. In April&nbsp;2004,
Forgent received a Subpoena Duces Tecum (&#147;Subpoena&#148;) and a Civil Investigative
Demand (&#147;CID&#148;) in this FTC proceeding. The Company responded in May&nbsp;2004 by
filing a petition to quash and/or limit the Subpoena and CID. Forgent has not
since received any further communication from the FTC on this matter.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February&nbsp;2003, the Company received a letter from legal counsel for the
independent executrix of the Estate of Gordon Matthews, asserting that the
Company was obligated to pay the independent executrix of the Estate of Gordon
Matthews for the asserted value of services claimed to have been rendered by
Mr.&nbsp;Matthews in connection with his alleged involvement in the Company&#146;s Patent
Licensing Program. In February&nbsp;2003, the Company initiated an action in the
261st District Court in Travis County Texas, styled Forgent Networks, Inc. v.
Monika Matthews, et al., for the purposes of declaring that the Company has no
obligation to the defendant. In that action, the defendant has filed a counter
claim asserting that the independent executrix of the Estate of Gordon Matthews
is entitled to recover in quantum meruit for the reasonable value of the work
and services claimed to have been provided by Gordon Matthews, a former member
of the board of directors and consultant to the Company, which the defendant
asserts is at least $5.0&nbsp;million. The Company does not believe the counter
claim has merit and intends to continue to vigorously pursue declaratory relief
from the court that no liability is due to the independent executrix of the
Estate of Gordon Matthews.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>16. SEGMENT INFORMATION</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, Forgent managed its business primarily along the lines of two
reportable segments: Solutions and Products. The Solutions segment provided a
wide variety of maintenance, network consulting and support services to
customers, and designed and installed custom integrated visual communication
systems primarily in meetings spaces of large corporations. In April&nbsp;2002, the
Company sold its integration business within this segment and in July&nbsp;2003, the
Company sold its videoconferencing hardware services business within this
segment. Thus, the entire Solutions segment is accounted for as discontinued
operations in the consolidated financial statements. The Products segment
designed, manufactured and sold multi-media visual communication products to
customers primarily through a network of resellers, and to a lesser extent
directly to end-users. As a result of the sale of the Products segment in
January&nbsp;2002, the Products segment is also accounted for as discontinued
operations in the consolidated financial statements.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the Company operates in two different segments: intellectual
property licensing and software and professional services. Forgent&#146;s
intellectual property licensing business is currently focused on generating
licensing revenues relating to the Company&#146;s data compression technology
embodied in U.S. Patent No.&nbsp;4,698,672 and its foreign counterparts and is
currently conducted through the Company&#146;s wholly-owned subsidiary, Compression
Labs, Inc. Forgent&#146;s software and professional services business provides
customers with scheduling and asset management software as well as add-on
software customization, installation, training, network consulting, hardware,
software maintenance services and other comprehensive related services. The
accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note 2.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company evaluates the performance as well as the financial results of
its segments. Included in the segment operating income (loss)&nbsp;is an allocation
of certain corporate operating expenses. The prior years&#146; segment information
has been restated to present the Company&#146;s reportable segments as they are
currently defined. The Company does not identify assets or capital expenditures
by reportable segments. Additionally, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer do not evaluate the segments based on these criteria.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports it files
under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded,
processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the
Securities and Exchange Commission&#146;s rules and forms. Such controls include
those designed to ensure that information for disclosure is communicated to
management, including the Chairman of the Board and the Chief Executive Officer
(&#147;CEO&#148;), as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CEO and Chief Financial Officer, with the participation of management,
have evaluated the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s disclosure controls and
procedures as of July&nbsp;31, 2004. Based on their evaluation, they have
concluded, to the best of their knowledge and belief, that the disclosure
controls and procedures are effective. No changes were made in the Company&#146;s
internal controls over financial reporting during the year ended July&nbsp;31, 2004,
that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
the Company&#146;s internal controls over financial reporting.
