<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are a biopharmaceutical company committed to applying our scientific leadership in the field of cellular metabolism to transform the lives of patients with
cancer and rare genetic metabolic disorders, or RGDs, which are a subset of orphan genetic metabolic diseases. Metabolism is a complex biological process involving the uptake and assimilation of nutrients in cells to produce energy and facilitate
many of the processes required for cellular division and growth. We focus our efforts on using cellular metabolism, an unexploited area of biological research with disruptive potential, as a platform for developing potentially transformative small
molecule medicines. Our most advanced cancer product candidates are AG-221 and AG-120, which target mutated isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 and 1, or IDH2 and IDH1, respectively, and AG-881, which targets both mutated IDH1 and mutated IDH2. These
mutations are found in a wide range of hematological malignancies and solid tumors. The lead product candidate in our RGD programs, AG-348, targets pyruvate kinase-R for the treatment of pyruvate kinase deficiency. Pyruvate kinase deficiency is a
rare disorder that often results in severe hemolytic anemia due to inherited mutations in the pyruvate kinase enzyme within red blood cells. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The clinical
development strategy for all of our product candidates includes a precision approach with initial study designs that allow for genetically or biomarker defined patient populations, enabling the potential for proof of concept early in clinical
development, along with the potential for accelerated approval. Our ability to identify, validate and drug novel targets is enabled by a set of core capabilities. Key proprietary aspects of our core capabilities in cellular metabolism include our
ability to measure the activities of numerous metabolic pathways in cells or tissues in a high throughput fashion and our expertise in &#147;flux biochemistry.&#148; This refers to the dynamic analysis of how metabolites, which are intermediates or
small molecule products of metabolism, accumulate or diminish as they are created or chemically altered by multiple networks of metabolic enzymes. Complex mathematical modeling of metabolic pathways, enzymatic activity and the flux of metabolites
through metabolic enzymatic reactions within diseased tissues allow us to identify novel biological parameters that can be measured to characterize a disease state or the effect of therapy, or biomarkers, and targets for drug discovery. </P>

set of life-sustaining chemical transformations within the cells of living organisms. The conversion of nutrients into energy via enzyme-catalyzed reactions allows organisms to grow and reproduce, maintain their structures, and respond to their
environments. The chemical reactions of metabolism are organized into metabolic pathways, in which one chemical is transformed through a series of steps into another chemical, by a sequence of enzymes. Enzymes catalyze quick and efficient reactions,
serve as key regulators of metabolic pathways, and respond to changes in the cell&#146;s environment or signals from other cells. We believe our deep understanding of metabolic pathways within normal cells enables us to identify altered metabolic
pathways within abnormal cells such as in rapidly proliferating cancers and RGDs. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Fundamental differences in the metabolism of normal cells and rapidly
proliferating cancer cells were first discovered by Otto Warburg more than 80 years ago&#151;an observation that earned him the Nobel Prize. Warburg demonstrated that in contrast to normal cells, which convert nutrients, such as sugar, into energy
via a process known as the Krebs cycle, cancer cells ferment their sugar into lactic acid&#151;a process known as aerobic glycolysis. It is now known that this allows the cancer cells to generate the building blocks they need to grow rapidly. The
ability of the cancer cell to &#147;rewire&#148; its metabolic pathways to fuel its growth and survival has spawned an entirely new field of cancer biology known as cancer metabolism or tumor metabolism. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Cancer and cancer metabolism </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Cancer is a disease
characterized by unregulated cell growth. Cancer typically develops when the repair of genetic material in normal cells begins to fail and genes that regulate cell growth become disrupted. Carcinogens, or cancer causing agents, such as radiation,
chemicals and hormones, can trigger changes to the genetic material of a cell, and typically prompt this disruption. Cells that have been disrupted may become cancerous, leading to changes in the cells&#146; DNA, and ultimately uncontrolled growth.
Cancer cells can spread to other areas of the body, or metastasize, and form tumors, which can destroy normal tissue or organs. Risk factors for cancer include family history, age, diet, and exogenous factors, such as exposure to ultraviolet
sunlight and smoking. Cancers can be classified in stages to document disease severity, measured in stages of I to IV, generally based on tumor size, involvement of lymph nodes, and metastases. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The most common methods of treating patients with cancer are surgery, radiation and drug therapy. A cancer patient often receives treatment with a combination
of these methods. These treatment regimens are often associated with side effects, including fatigue, infection, nausea and vomiting and pain. Surgery and radiation therapy are particularly effective in patients in whom the disease is localized.
Physicians generally use systemic drug therapies in situations in which the cancer has spread beyond the primary site or cannot otherwise be treated through surgery. The goal of drug therapy is to kill cancer cells or to damage cellular components
required for rapid growth and survival of cancer cells. In many cases, drug therapy entails the administration of several different drugs in combination. Over the past several decades, drug therapy has evolved from non-specific drugs that kill both
healthy and cancerous cells to drugs that target specific molecular pathways involved in cancer. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Cytotoxic chemotherapies </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The earliest approach to cancer treatment was to develop drugs, referred to as cytotoxic drugs, that kill rapidly proliferating cancer cells through
non-specific mechanisms, such as disrupting cell metabolism or causing damage to cellular components required for survival and rapid growth. While these drugs, (e.g., CYTOXAN<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>,

Adriamycin<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>) have been effective in the treatment of some cancers they act in an indiscriminate manner, killing healthy as well as
cancerous cells. Due to their mechanism of action, many cytotoxic drugs have a narrow dose range above which the toxicity causes unacceptable or even fatal levels of damage and below which the drugs are not effective in eradicating cancer cells.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Targeted therapies </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The next
approach to pharmacological cancer treatment was to develop drugs, referred to as targeted therapeutics, that target specific biological molecules in the human body that play a role in rapid cell growth and the spread of cancer. Targeted
therapeutics are designed to preferentially kill cancer cells and spare normal cells, to improve efficacy and minimize side effects. The drugs are designed to either attack a target that causes uncontrolled growth of cancer cells because of either a
specific genetic alteration primarily found in cancer cells but not in normal cells or a target that cancer cells are more dependent on for their growth in comparison to normal cells. Examples of effective targeted therapies include Herceptin<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>, Avastin<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> and Zelboraf<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Emerging areas </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Several new approaches to
develop novel cancer treatments are underway. They include: treatment with drugs or other methods that stimulate the normal immune system to attack the cancer (immuno-oncology); antibody drug conjugates (e.g., Kadcyla<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>) that carry a powerful chemotherapy payload that is only released into the cancer cell; and drugs that target the changes in gene activity that occurs in cancer cells (epigenetics). </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Cancer metabolism is a new and exciting field of biology that provides a fundamentally different approach to treating cancer. Cancers become addicted to
certain fuel sources and inherently alter their cellular machinery to change how they consume and utilize nutrients. Cancer cells increase the transport of nutrients into the cell by 200-400 fold compared to normal cells while also mutating
metabolic enzymes to generate metabolites that fuel growth and altering gene expression of enzymes to divert energy production. Collectively, these changes afford cancer cells the ability to generate the building blocks that drive tumor growth.
Inhibiting key enzymes in cancer cell specific metabolic pathways has the potential to disrupt tumor cell proliferation and survival without affecting normal cells, thus providing a powerful new intervention point for discovery and development of
novel targeted cancer therapeutics. Our research is directed at identifying such metabolic targets and discovering medicines against them. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Validation of
the concept of cancer cell metabolic rewiring and excessive nutrient uptake comes from the widespread use of positron emission tomography, or PET, to detect cancers. This medical imaging technology relies on the uptake of nutrients, namely sugar,
into cells. Patients are injected with a radioactively labeled form of sugar, which is more rapidly consumed by cancer cells given their profound requirement for nutrients relative to normal tissues. PET imaging precisely locates cancerous areas
throughout the body and provides for both a diagnostic and prognostic tool throughout cancer therapy. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The metabolic rewiring of cancer cells can also be
linked to specific genetic alterations in oncogenes (which are genes that transform normal cells into tumor cells) and tumor suppressor genes (which are genes that are anti-oncogenic) responsible for cell signaling. These mutations in signaling
pathways can drive excessive uptake of nutrients and altered metabolic pathways, thereby causing cancer formation. This cross talk between cell signaling and metabolism offers multiple opportunities to treat cancer by combining our therapies
directed against metabolic enzymes with existing or emerging standards of care. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Rare genetic metabolic disorders </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Rare genetic metabolic disorders, a subset of orphan genetic metabolic diseases, are a broad group of more than 600 orphan genetic diseases caused by mutations
of single metabolic genes. In these disorders, the defect of a single metabolic enzyme disrupts the normal functioning of a metabolic pathway, leading to either aberrant accumulation of &#147;upstream&#148; metabolites which may be toxic or
interfere with normal function or reduced ability to synthesize essential &#147;downstream&#148; metabolites or other critical cellular components. RGDs are also referred to as congenital metabolic diseases or rare genetic disorders of metabolism.

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Most of these diseases are rare or ultra-rare orphan diseases, often with severe or life-threatening features. A
disorder is considered orphan if it affects fewer than 200,000 people in the United States, or fewer than five per 10,000 people in the European Union. In a study in British Columbia, the overall incidence of RGDs was estimated to be 70&nbsp;per
100,000 live births or one in 1,400 births, overall representing more than approximately 15% of single gene disorders in the population. Incidence of a single RGD can vary widely but is generally rare, usually equal to or less than one per 100,000
births. Many RGDs are likely to be under-diagnosed given the lack of available therapies or diagnostics and the rarity of the condition. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Current
treatment options for these disorders are limited. Diet modification or nutrient supplementation can be beneficial in some RGDs. Several of these disorders, from a group known as lysosomal storage diseases, have been treated successfully with enzyme
replacement therapy, or ERT, the therapeutic administration of a functional version of the defective enzyme. Examples of ERTs for lysosomal storage disorders include Fabrazyme<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> for Fabry
disease, Myozome<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> for Pompe disease, Cerezyme<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> for Gaucher disease, and
Elaprase<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> for Hunter syndrome. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Unfortunately, most mutations driving RGDs are intracellular and
not amenable for treatment with enzyme replacement therapies. As a result, despite the promising progress made for patients with a small group of these diseases, the vast majority of patients with RGDs have few therapeutic options available, and the
standard of care is palliative, meaning treatment of symptoms with no effect on underlying disease mechanisms. We are taking a novel small molecule approach to correct the metabolic defects within diseased cells with a goal of developing
transformative medicines for patients. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We focus on RGDs that share the following common set of features: </P>

cellular metabolism within diseased tissues enables the development of methods to measure the effect of a drug on the target of interest and the patient, or pharmacodynamic markers, and patient selection strategies for clinical development.
Utilizing our approach we identify altered metabolic pathways within abnormal cells. Altered metabolic pathways generate disease-specific metabolic fingerprints, comprising patterns of metabolite levels, which are the amounts of particular
metabolites, that can be exploited in both discovery and development of novel therapeutics. Metabolites make ideal biomarkers because they are readily measured in the target tissues and blood. Metabolic biomarkers can identify appropriate patients
for clinical trials, serve as pharmacodynamics markers to characterize medicine/target engagement in patients, and permit the monitoring of patient response to therapy. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We will only progress our drug candidates forward into phase 1 clinical trials if we have the ability to select patients who are most likely to respond to a
given therapy based on biomarkers, for example, genetic or metabolic markers. While many factors are considered critical to maximize the probability of technical success in the drug development process, perhaps none is more important than
identifying highly specific and selective molecules aimed at the best possible targets for therapy coupled with the patients most likely to respond to that therapy. Our goal is to develop increasing confidence in the target and the patient
population prior to entering human clinical trials and then initiate those first human trials in a patient population that has been selected based on target dependence using a biomarker. This approach, known as personalized or precision medicine, is
used in the industry to lead to the potential for clear proof of concept in early human trials, along with the potential for accelerated approval. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Targeting Mutated Isocitrate Dehydrogenase (IDH) for the Treatment of Cancer </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The isocitrate dehydrogenase, or IDH, protein is a critical enzyme in the citric acid cycle, also known as the tricarboxylic acid, or Krebs, cycle. The Krebs
cycle is centrally important to many biochemical pathways and is one of the earliest established components of cellular metabolism. The Krebs cycle converts an essential cellular metabolite called isocitrate into another metabolite,
alpha-ketoglutarate (<FONT STYLE="FONT-FAMILY:SYMBOL">&#097;</FONT>-ketoglutarate), both of which are critically important for cellular function and the creation of energy. In humans, there are three forms of the IDH enzyme, IDH1, IDH2, and IDH3,
but only IDH1 and IDH2 appear to be mutated in cancers. IDH1 and IDH2 catalyze the same reaction but in different cellular compartments: IDH1 is found in the cytoplasm of the cell and IDH2 in the mitochondria. Tumor cells are generally observed to
carry either an IDH1 or IDH2 mutation, but not both. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Using our proprietary metabolic platform, we and our collaborators examined the mutated pathway and
discovered that the mutated IDH enzymes had adopted a novel &#147;gain of function&#148; activity that allows only the mutated IDH enzyme to produce large amounts of a metabolite called 2-hydroxygluturate, or 2HG. We believe that the excessive
levels of the metabolite 2HG produced by the tumor fuel cancer growth and survival via multiple cellular changes that lead to a block in cell maturation, or differentiation. We believe that inhibition of these mutated proteins will lead to clinical
benefit for the subset of cancer patients whose tumors carry these mutations. We have identified selective development candidates that target and inhibit the mutated forms of IDH1 and IDH2. To date, our early clinical data of AG-221 and AG-120, our
lead inhibitors of mutant IDH2 and IDH1, respectively, demonstrate a mechanism of response that is consistent with preclinical studies, including substantial reduction of plasma 2HG levels, as well as evidence of cellular differentiation and
normalization of cell counts in the bone marrow and blood. This differentiation effect is distinct from that seen with traditional chemotherapeutics commonly used to treat acute myeloid leukemia, or AML. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">To date, IDH1 and IDH2 mutations have been found to be prevalent in a broad range of advanced hematologic and solid tumors. The following tables summarize our
current initial estimates on the occurrence of IDH2 and IDH1 mutations in hematologic and solid tumors. We believe our estimates may expand as more cancer treatment centers screen for these IDH mutations. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>AG-221: lead IDH2 program </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">AG-221 is an orally available, selective, potent inhibitor of the mutated IDH2 protein, making it a highly targeted therapeutic candidate for the treatment of
patients with cancers that harbor IDH2 mutations, including those with acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, who have a historically poor prognosis. In June 2014, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted us orphan drug designation for AG-221
for treatment of patients with AML. In August 2014, we announced that the FDA granted fast track designation to AG-221 for treatment of patients with AML that harbor an IDH2 mutation. We have been evaluating AG-221 in several clinical trials
evaluating both hematological and solid tumor cancers with IDH2 mutations. To date, all clinical data reported by us in hematological cancers highlights that the mechanism of response is consistent with preclinical studies, including substantial
reduction of plasma 2HG levels, as well as evidence of cellular differentiation and normalization of cell counts in the bone marrow and blood. This differentiation effect is distinct from that seen with traditional chemotherapeutics commonly used to
treat AML. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In September 2013, we initiated our first phase 1 multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation clinical trial to assess the safety, clinical
activity, and tolerability of AG-221 in patients with advanced hematologic malignancies with an IDH2 mutation. In June 2014, Celgene exercised its option to an exclusive global license for development and commercialization of AG-221 under a
collaboration agreement between us and Celgene, which focuses on cancer metabolism, or the 2010 Agreement. Under the 2010 Agreement, Celgene is responsible for all development costs for AG-221. We are eligible to receive up to $120.0 million in
milestone payments and a tiered royalty on any net sales of products containing AG-221. In January 2016, in conjunction with the initiation of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">AG-221</FONT> phase 3 trials we received a milestone payment of $25.0
million. We also have the right to conduct a portion of any commercialization activities for AG-221 in the United States. In addition to contributing our scientific and translational expertise, we will continue to conduct some clinical development
and regulatory activities within the AG-221 development program in collaboration with Celgene. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In October 2014, we initiated four expansion cohorts in
our ongoing phase 1 clinical trial of AG-221 in patients with IDH2 mutant-positive hematologic malignancies to assess the safety and tolerability of AG-221 at 100 mg once daily oral dose in approximately 100 patients with IDH2 mutant-positive
hematologic malignancies, including AML. In the expansion cohorts, we evaluated relapsed or refractory AML patients 60 years of age and older, relapsed or refractory AML patients under age 60, untreated AML patients who decline standard of care
chemotherapy and patients with other IDH2 mutant-positive advanced hematologic malignancies. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In May 2015, we announced that our ongoing phase 1 clinical
trial of AG-221 had been expanded to add an additional more homogenous cohort of 125 patients with IDH2 mutant-positive AML who are in second or later relapse, are refractory to second-line induction or reinduction treatment, or have relapsed after
allogeneic transplantation. Consistent with the previous expansion cohorts, AG-221 is administered at a dose of 100 mg once daily. The primary objectives of the trial are to confirm the safety and clinical activity of AG-221 in a select, highly
resistant AML population. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In October 2015, Celgene, in collaboration with us, initiated IDHENTIFY, an international phase 3, multi-center, open-label,
randomized clinical trial designed to compare the efficacy and safety of AG-221 versus conventional care regimens in patients 60 years or older with IDH2 mutant-positive AML that is refractory to or relapsed after second- or third-line therapy. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In December 2015, we reported additional clinical data, as of September&nbsp;1, 2015, from the dose escalation phase and expansion cohorts of the ongoing
phase 1 clinical trial, which was transitioned to a phase 1/2 trial in May 2015, evaluating single agent AG-221, which included 209 response-evaluable enrolled patients with IDH2 mutant-positive AML. The new data were presented at the 2015 American
Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exposition in Orlando, Florida and showed investigator-assessed objective responses in 79 out of 209 response-evaluable patients. Of the 79 patients who achieved an objective response, there were 37
complete remissions (CR), three complete remissions with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp), 14 marrow complete remissions (mCR), three complete remissions with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) and 22 partial

remissions (PR). A CR is determined by using well-established criteria, which requires no evidence of leukemia in the bone marrow and blood accompanied by full restoration of all blood counts to
normal ranges. A CRp means all the criteria for CR are met except that platelet counts are outside of the normal range. Platelets are one of the three major types of blood cells. A mCR means that there is no evidence for leukemia in the marrow but
the blood counts have not fully restored. A CRi means there is no evidence for leukemia in the marrow but the neutrophils, a subset of white blood cells responsible for fighting bacterial infections, are outside the normal range. A partial response
means all the criteria for CR are met except that the immature defective blood cells, or leukemia, in the bone marrow are in the 5% to 25% range and have been decreased by at least 50% over pretreatment. Of the 159 patients with relapsed or
refractory AML, 59 achieved an objective response, including 29 CRs, one CRp, nine mCRs, three CRis and 17 PRs. Of the 24 patients with AML who declined standard of care chemotherapy, 10 achieved an objective response, including four CRs, one CRp,
one mCR and four PRs. Of the 14 patients with MDS, seven achieved an objective response, including three CRs, one CRp and three mCRs. Responding relapsed or refractory AML patients were on the trial for up to 18 months with a median duration of
treatment of 6.8 months, ranging from 1.8 to 18 months. Responses were durable, with median response duration of 6.9 months in patients with relapsed or refractory AML. A safety analysis was conducted for all 231 treated patients. The majority of
adverse events reported by investigators were mild to moderate, with the most common being nausea, diarrhea, fatigue and febrile neutropenia. The serious adverse events, or SAEs, observed during the trial were mainly disease related. Twenty-three
percent of patients had treatment-related SAEs, including notably differentiation syndrome (4 percent), leukocytosis (4 percent) and nausea (2 percent). Drug-related Grade 5 SAEs included atrial flutter (one patient), cardiac tamponade (one
patient), pericardial effusion (one patient) and respiratory failure (one patient). Dose escalation has been completed and a maximum tolerated dose, or MTD, has not been reached. The first four expansion cohorts have completed enrollment. AG-221
continued to show favorable drug exposure and pharmacokinetics at all doses tested with substantial reductions in plasma levels of 2HG, which is produced by the mutated IDH2 and IDH1 proteins, to the level observed in healthy volunteers. In 2016,
Celgene, in collaboration with us, intends to initiate an expansion arm of our phase 1/2 clinical trial, evaluating AG-221 in high-risk MDS patients. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Also in December 2015, we announced the initiation of a phase 1b, multicenter, international, open-label clinical trial to evaluate the safety and clinical
activity of AG-221 or AG-120 in combination with induction and consolidation therapy in patients with newly diagnosed AML with an IDH2 or IDH2 mutation who are eligible for intensive chemotherapy. The trial will evaluate continuous dosing for up to
one year with AG-221 administered at an initial oral dose of 100 mg once daily in patients with an IDH2 mutation or AG-120 administered at an initial oral dose of 500 mg once daily in patients with an IDH1 mutation. AG-221 or AG-120 will be
administered with two types of AML induction therapies (cytarabine with either daunorubicin or idarubicin) and two types of AML consolidation therapies (mitoxantrone with etoposide [ME] or cytarabine). </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the first quarter of 2016, Celgene, in collaboration with us, intends to initiate a phase 1/2 frontline combination clinical trial, to be conducted by
Celgene, of either AG-221 or AG-120 in combination with VIDAZA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> (azacitidine) in newly diagnosed AML patients not eligible for intensive chemotherapy, with a phase 1 component to determine the

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">AG-120 is an orally available, selective, potent inhibitor of the mutated IDH1 protein, making it a highly targeted therapeutic candidate for the treatment of
patients with cancers that harbor IDH1 mutations. Mutations in IDH1 have been identified in difficult to treat hematologic and solid tumor cancers, including AML, chondrosarcoma and cholangiocarcinoma where both the treatment options and prognosis
for patients are poor. In March 2014, we initiated two phase 1, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation and expansion clinical trials for AG-120, one designed to assess the safety, clinical activity and tolerability of AG-120 in patients with
advanced hematologic malignancies and the second designed to evaluate the safety, clinical activity and tolerability of AG-120 in patients with advanced solid tumors, each as a single agent. Both trials are only enrolling patients that carry an IDH1
mutation. On May&nbsp;18, 2015, we announced that the FDA granted fast track designation to AG-120 for treatment of patients with AML that harbor an IDH1 mutation. On June&nbsp;10, 2015, the FDA granted us orphan drug designation for AG-120 for
treatment of patients with AML. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Four expansion cohorts have been added to the ongoing phase 1 clinical trial of AG-120 in patients with advanced
hematologic malignancies. These four expansion cohorts will evaluate AG-120 in 200 patients with IDH1 mutant-positive advanced hematologic malignancies. The first cohort will evaluate a more homogenous population of 125 AML patients who are in
second or later relapse, are refractory to second-line induction or reinduction treatment, or have relapsed after allogeneic transplantation. The second cohort will evaluate 25 untreated AML patients. The third cohort will evaluate 25 patients with
other non-AML IDH1 mutant-positive relapsed or refractory advanced hematologic malignancies. The fourth cohort will evaluate patients with relapsed IDH1 mutant-positive AML not eligible for the first arm or standard of care chemotherapy. AG-120 is
administered at a 500 mg once daily oral dose, in 28-day cycles. The trial&#146;s primary objectives are to confirm the safety and clinical activity of AG-120. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In November 2015, we reported clinical data from the dose-escalation portion of our ongoing phase 1 clinical trial evaluating AG-120 in patients with IDH1
mutant-positive advanced solid tumors, including glioma, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, or IHCC, and chondrosarcomas who received AG-210 administered from 200 mg to 1200 mg total daily doses. The data were presented at the AACR-NCI-EORTC
International Conference on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics in Boston. As of the September&nbsp;3, 2015 data cut-off, 62 patients had been treated with single agent AG-120, of which 55 were response-evaluable. Seven of the 11
response-evaluable patients with IDH1 mutant-positive chondrosarcoma had stable disease, with five of these patients maintaining stable disease for six months or more. One of the 20 patients with IDH1 mutant-positive IHCC had a partial response and
11 patients had stable disease, with six such patients maintaining stable disease for six months or more. Ten of the 20 patients with IDH1 mutant-positive glioma had stable disease, with four of these patients maintaining stable disease for six
months or more. One of the four patients with other IDH1 mutant-positive solid tumors had stable disease. Treatment with AG-120 showed substantial reduction of 2HG in plasma and tumor tissue, and imaging results suggest that AG-120 can lower 2HG
levels in the brain. AG-120 was well tolerated, with the majority of adverse events reported by investigators being mild to moderate. The most common investigator-reported adverse events were nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, anemia and QT prolongation.
The majority of reported SAEs were disease related. A MTD has not been reached. We are currently enrolling four expansion cohorts of 25 patients each in (i)&nbsp;low grade glioma with at least six months of prior scans to assess volumetric changes,
(ii)&nbsp;second-line cholangiocarcinoma, (iii)&nbsp;high grade, or metastatic, chondrosarcoma, and (iv)&nbsp;other solid tumors with an IDH1 mutation, who will receive the recommended dose of 500 mg of AG-120 once daily. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In December 2015, we reported new data, as of October&nbsp;1, 2015, from the ongoing phase 1 clinical trial evaluating single agent AG-120, which included 87
enrolled patients with IDH1 mutant-positive advanced hematologic malignancies, of which 78 were from the dose-escalation phase and nine were from the expansion phase. The data were presented at the 2015 ASH Annual Meeting and Exposition in Orlando,
Florida and showed investigator-assessed objective responses in 27 out of 78 response-evaluable patients on AG-120. Of the 27 patients who achieved an objective response, there were 12 CRs, seven CRps, six mCRs, one CRi and one PR.

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Pyruvate kinase, or PK, is the enzyme involved in the second to last reaction in glycolysis&#151;the conversion of glucose into lactic acid. This enzyme is
critical for the survival of the cell and has several tissue-specific isoforms (PKR, PKL, PKM1 and PKM2). PKR is the isoform of pyruvate kinase that is present in red blood cells. Mutations in PKR cause defects in red cell glycolysis and lead to a
hematological RGD known as pyruvate kinase deficiency, or PK deficiency. Glycolysis is the only pathway available for red blood cells to maintain the production of ATP, or Adenosine-5&#146;-triphosphate, which transports chemical energy within cells
for metabolism. Accordingly, total absence of the PKR gene is not compatible with life. PK deficiency leads to a shortened life span for red blood cells and is the most common form of non-spherocytic hemolytic anemia in humans. The disease is
autosomal recessive, meaning children inherit one mutated form of PKR from one parent and the second mutated form from the other parent. Children with the disease produce PKR enzyme that has only a fraction of the normal level of activity (generally
&lt;50%). Parents of affected children have only one copy of the mutated PKR enzyme and are clinically normal. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">PK deficiency is a rare genetic disorder
and disease understanding is still evolving. Several published epidemiology studies estimated prevalence of PK deficiency between three to nine affected patients per million. We estimate that there are approximately 2,400 diagnosed patients in the
United States and EU5 countries (United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Spain), and we believe that the disease is likely under-diagnosed. There is no unique ethnic or geographic representation of the disease. The disease manifests by mild to
severe forms of anemia caused by the excessive premature destruction of red blood cells. The precise mechanism for the destruction is not well understood but is thought to result from membrane instability secondary to the metabolic defect caused by
the low level of PKR enzyme. The hemolysis is &#147;extra-vascular&#148; in that the red blood cells are destroyed in small capillaries or organs and not spontaneously breaking open in the circulation. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>AG-348: lead pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency program </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">AG-348 is an orally available small molecule and a potent activator of the wild-type (normal) and mutated PKR enzyme, which has resulted in restoration of ATP
levels and a decrease in 2,3-DPG levels in blood sampled from patients with PK deficiency in nonclinical studies. The wild-type PKR activity of AG-348 allowed the study of enzyme activation in healthy volunteers, providing an opportunity to
understand the safety, dosing and pharmacodynamic activity of AG-348 prior to entering a proof-of-concept study in patients. On March&nbsp;24, 2015, the FDA granted us orphan drug designation for AG-348 for treatment of patients with PK deficiency.

AG-348 as a novel, first-in-class, oral activator of both wild-type and mutated PKR enzymes. In these phase 1 clinical trials, dosing of AG-348 over 14-days in healthy volunteers resulted in a
dose-dependent activation of the PKR pathway as evidenced by a substantial increase in ATP and decrease in 2,3-DPG levels, which are key biomarkers of PKR activity and primary indicators of PK deficiency. These data support the hypothesis that
AG-348 treatment may similarly enhance PKR activity in patients with PK deficiency and thus correct the underlying defect of the disease. Results presented were from 64 healthy volunteers who received either AG-348 or placebo, which included 48
people from the completed SAD trial and 16 people in the first two cohorts of the MAD trial, which recently completed dosing. Complete safety results were reported from the SAD phase 1 clinical trial and showed that AG-348 was well tolerated.
Although the MAD trial remained blinded, no serious adverse events had been reported in the first two analyzed cohorts. AG-348 also showed a favorable pharmacokinetic profile with rapid absorption, low variability and dose-proportional increase in
exposure following both single and multiple doses. The observed dose-dependent changes in 2,3-DPG and ATP blood levels seen are consistent with a substantial increase in PKR enzymatic activity. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On June&nbsp;12, 2015, we reported final clinical data from the phase 1 MAD clinical trial of AG-348 in healthy volunteers and the first data from a natural

at 15 mg, 60 mg, 120 mg, 360 mg or 700 mg twice daily or 120 mg once daily in six sequential cohorts. The study showed that AG-348 was well tolerated, with most adverse events occurring in the highest dose group (700 mg), with all but one being mild
to moderate. Thirty-two of 36 healthy volunteers receiving AG-348 completed the study. Two volunteers receiving AG-348 withdrew due to adverse events, including drug eruption (60 mg) and Grade 3 liver function test abnormalities (700 mg), which
resolved after treatment discontinuation. Two additional AG-348 volunteers (both 700 mg) withdrew consent due to nausea or vomiting. Serum hormone changes consistent with reversible aromatase inhibition were observed. AG-348 also showed a favorable
pharmacokinetic profile with rapid absorption, low to moderate variability and a dose-proportional increase in exposure following multiple doses. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As
predicted by the mechanism of action of AG-348, there was a robust activation of pyruvate kinase as evidenced by a decrease in 2,3-DPG (2,3-diphosphoglycerate) and increase in ATP (adenosine triphosphate) in blood of healthy volunteers. The decrease
in 2,3-DPG was approximately 50 percent for doses 120 mg and higher with levels returning back to baseline approximately 72 hours after AG-348 was discontinued. There was also an approximately 50 percent increase in ATP in blood with AG-348 at doses
60 mg and higher in healthy volunteers. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In June 2015, we initiated DRIVE PK, a global phase 2, first-in-patient, open-label safety and efficacy clinical

on the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary or intellectual property rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary and intellectual property position by, among other methods, filing U.S.,
international and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing
technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary and intellectual property position. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We file patent applications directed to our key
product candidates, including AG-221, AG-120, AG-881, AG-348 and AG-519, in an effort to establish intellectual property positions regarding new chemical entities relating to these product candidates as well as uses of new chemical entities in the
treatment of diseases. We also seek patent protection with respect to biomarkers that may be useful in selecting the right patient population for therapies with our product candidates. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we had a portfolio of pending U.S.
and foreign patent applications. A significant portion of our pending patent applications pertain to our key development programs, including AG-221, AG-120, AG-881, AG-348 and AG-519, some of which have been issued as patents. </P>

requirements are met. In the future, if and when our product candidates receive approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on issued patents covering those products, depending upon the length
of the clinical trials for each medicine and other factors. There can be no assurance that any of our pending patent applications will issue or that we will benefit from any patent term extension or favorable adjustment to the term of any of our

position for our product candidates and technologies will depend on our success in obtaining effective patent claims and enforcing those claims if granted. However, patent applications that we may file or license from third parties may not result in
the issuance of patents. We also cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents. Any issued patents that we may receive in the future may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. For example, we cannot be
certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending third-party patent applications. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology or therapeutics to which we have rights, we may have to
participate in interference proceedings in the USPTO to determine priority of invention, which could result in substantial costs to us, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. In addition, because of the extensive time required for clinical
development and regulatory review of a product candidate we may develop, it is possible that, before any of our product candidates can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following
commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of any such patent. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition to patents, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how and
continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, scientific advisors, employees and consultants,
and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also have agreements requiring assignment of inventions with selected consultants, scientific advisors and collaborators. The confidentiality agreements are designed to protect our
proprietary information and, in the case of agreements or clauses requiring invention assignment, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. </P>

significant competition for any of our product candidates for which we obtain market approval. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Many of our competitors may have significantly greater
financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved medicines than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the
pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and
management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be
significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The key competitive factors affecting the
success of all of our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the effectiveness of companion diagnostics in guiding the use of related therapeutics, the level of generic competition and the

that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any medicines that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their medicines more
rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other
third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic medicines. There are many generic medicines currently on the market for the indications that we are pursuing, and additional medicines are expected to become available on a generic basis
over the coming years. If our therapeutic product candidates are approved, we expect that they will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic medicines. </P>

studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical
trials, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. </P>

submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. Following commencement of a clinical trial under an IND, the FDA may place a clinical hold on that trial. A clinical hold is an order issued by the FDA to the
sponsor to delay a proposed clinical investigation or to suspend an ongoing investigation. A partial clinical hold is a delay or suspension of only part of the clinical work requested under the IND. For example, a specific protocol or part of a
protocol is not allowed to proceed, while other protocols may do so. No more than 30 days after imposition of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, the FDA will provide the sponsor a written explanation of the basis for the hold. Following
issuance of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, an investigation may only resume after the FDA has notified the sponsor that the investigation may proceed. The FDA will base that determination on information provided by the sponsor correcting
the deficiencies previously cited or otherwise satisfying the FDA that the investigation can proceed. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, an IRB representing each institution
participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct a continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. The IRB must review and
approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific
timeframes to the National Institutes of Health for public dissemination on their ClinicalTrials.gov website. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Human clinical trials are typically

small number of healthy human subjects or, in certain indications such as cancer, patients with the target disease or condition (e.g., cancer) and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible,
to gain an early indication of its effectiveness and to determine optimal dosage. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Phase 2. </I></B>The drug is administered to a

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Phase 3. </I></B>These clinical trials are commonly referred to as &#147;pivotal&#148; studies, which denotes a study which presents the
data that the FDA or other relevant regulatory agency will use to determine whether or not to approve a drug. The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled
clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Phase 4</I></B>. Post-approval studies may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies are used to gain additional
experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be
submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. In addition, IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA for any of the following: serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions; findings from
other studies or animal or <I>in vitro</I> testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug; and any clinically important increase in the case of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or
investigator brochure. The FDA or the sponsor or the data monitoring committee may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB&#146;s requirements or if the drug has been
associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. The FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data submitted. </P>

application for marketing approval. Specifically, on April&nbsp;28, 2008, the FDA amended its regulations governing the acceptance of foreign clinical studies not conducted under an investigational new drug application as support for an IND or a new
drug application. The final rule provides that such studies must be conducted in accordance with GCP, including review and approval by an independent ethics committee, or IEC, and informed consent from subjects. The GCP requirements in the final
rule encompass both ethical and data integrity standards for clinical studies. The FDA&#146;s regulations are intended to help ensure the protection of human subjects enrolled in non-IND foreign clinical studies, as well as the quality and integrity

together with detailed information relating to the product&#146;s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug product for one or more
indications. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to an application user fee, currently exceeding $2.3 million, and the sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to annual product and establishment user fees,
currently exceeding $114,000 per product and $585,000 per establishment. These fees are typically increased annually. Certain exceptions and waivers are available for some of these fees, such as an exception from the application fee for drugs with
orphan designation and a waiver for certain small businesses, an exception from the establishment fee when the establishment does not engage in manufacturing the drug during a particular fiscal year, and an exception from the product fee for a drug
that is the same as another drug approved under an abbreviated pathway. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The FDA conducts a preliminary review of an NDA generally within 60 calendar days
of its receipt and strives to inform the sponsor by the 74th day after the FDA&#146;s receipt of the submission to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information
rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for
filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review process of NDAs. Under that agreement, 90% of applications seeking approval of New Molecular Entities, or NMEs, are meant to be
reviewed within ten months from the date on which FDA accepts the NDA for filing, and 90% of applications for NMEs that have been designated for &#147;priority review&#148; are meant to be reviewed within six months of the filing date. For
applications seeking approval of drugs that are not NMEs, the ten-month and six-month review periods run from the date that FDA receives the application. The review process and the Prescription Drug User Fee Act goal date may be extended by the FDA
for three additional months to consider new information or clarification provided by the applicant to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is or will be manufactured. These pre-approval

before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, as a condition of
approval, the FDA may require an applicant to develop a REMS. REMS use risk minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. To determine whether a REMS is needed, the
FDA will consider the size of the population likely to use the product, seriousness of the disease, expected benefit of the product, expected duration of treatment, seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the product is a new
molecular entity. REMS can include medication guides, physician communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU may include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing
or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The FDA may require a REMS before approval or post-approval if it becomes aware of a serious risk associated with use of the product.
The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of a product. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The FDA is required to refer an application for a
novel drug to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a
recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. </P>

the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. For fast track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA and
the FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track product&#146;s application before the application is complete. This rolling review may be available if the FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the
sponsor, that a fast track product may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and the FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. However, the FDA&#146;s time
period goal for reviewing a fast track application does not begin until the last section of the application is submitted. In addition, the fast track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer
supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Second, in 2012, Congress enacted the Food and Product Administration Safety and Innovation
Act, or FDASIA. This law established a new regulatory scheme allowing for expedited review of products designated as &#147;breakthrough therapies.&#148; A product may be designated as a breakthrough therapy if it is intended, either alone or in
combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more
clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to breakthrough therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the
development process; providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval; involving more senior staff in the review process; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the review team; and taking other steps to
design the clinical trials in an efficient manner. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Third, the FDA may designate a product for priority review if it is a product that treats a serious

by-case basis, whether the proposed product represents a significant improvement when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased
effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment-limiting product reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, and evidence of safety and
effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten the FDA&#146;s goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten
months to six months. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under Section&nbsp;524 of the FDCA, the FDA is authorized to award a priority review voucher to sponsors of certain tropical
disease product applications that meet the criteria specified in the Act. A priority review voucher may be used by the sponsor who obtains it or it may be transferred to another sponsor who may use it to obtain priority review for a different
application. Priority review vouchers can result in the acceleration of review and approval of a product candidate by up to four months; the sponsor using the voucher must pay an extra user fee to support the review of the application, however. That
fee is not subject to waivers, exemptions or reductions. In order to be eligible for a tropical disease priority review voucher, the application must be: for a listed tropical disease; submitted under Section&nbsp;505(b)(1) of the FDCA or
Section&nbsp;351 of the Public Health Service Act after September&nbsp;27, 2007; for a product that contains no active ingredient that has been approved in any other application under those statutory provisions; and must qualify for priority review.
The FDA has identified in guidance those product applications for the prevention or treatment of tropical diseases that may qualify for a priority review voucher. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Accelerated approval pathway </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The FDA may grant
accelerated approval to a product for a serious or life-threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that
is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a condition when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible
morbidity or mortality, or IMM, and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or
lack of alternative treatments. Products granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign, or other
measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a measurement
of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a product, such as an effect on IMM. The FDA has limited experience with accelerated approvals based on intermediate clinical endpoints, but has
indicated that such endpoints generally may support accelerated approval where the therapeutic effect measured by the endpoint is not itself a clinical benefit and basis for traditional approval, if there is a basis for concluding that the
therapeutic effect is reasonably likely to predict the ultimate clinical benefit of a product. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in
settings in which the course of a disease is long and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a product, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. Thus,
accelerated approval has been used extensively in the development and approval of products for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical
disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large trials to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The accelerated approval pathway is usually
contingent on a sponsor&#146;s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the product&#146;s clinical benefit. As a result, a product candidate approved on this basis is subject
to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. </P>

the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response
letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA&#146;s
satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional
information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If the FDA approves a product, it
may limit the approved indications for use for the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further
assess the drug&#146;s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including
REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, many types of
changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. </P>

distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and
promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing,
annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their
establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often
require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that
the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur
after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements,
may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In 1984, with passage of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the FDCA, Congress established an abbreviated regulatory scheme authorizing the FDA to approve generic
drugs that are shown to contain the same active ingredients as, and to be bioequivalent to, drugs previously approved by the FDA pursuant to NDAs. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an abbreviated new drug application, or
ANDA, to the agency. An ANDA is a comprehensive submission that contains, among other things, data and information pertaining to the active pharmaceutical ingredient, bioequivalence, drug product formulation, specifications and stability of the
generic drug, as well as analytical methods, manufacturing process validation data and quality control procedures. ANDAs are &#147;abbreviated&#148; because they generally do not include preclinical and clinical data to demonstrate safety and
effectiveness. Instead, in support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may rely on the preclinical and clinical testing previously conducted for a drug product previously approved under an NDA, known as the reference-listed drug, or RLD.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Specifically, in order for an ANDA to be approved, the FDA must find that the generic version is identical to the RLD with respect to the active
ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form, the strength of the drug and the conditions of use of the drug. At the same time, the FDA must also determine that the generic drug is &#147;bioequivalent&#148; to the innovator drug. Under
the statute, a generic drug is bioequivalent to a RLD if &#147;the rate and extent of absorption of the drug do not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the listed drug.&#148; </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Upon approval of an ANDA, the FDA indicates whether the generic product is &#147;therapeutically equivalent&#148; to the RLD in its publication &#147;Approved
Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,&#148; also referred to as the &#147;Orange Book.&#148; Physicians and pharmacists consider a therapeutic equivalent generic drug to be fully substitutable for the RLD. In addition, by operation
of certain state laws and numerous health insurance programs, the FDA&#146;s designation of therapeutic equivalence often results in substitution of the generic drug without the knowledge or consent of either the prescribing physician or patient.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, the FDA may not approve an ANDA until any applicable period of non-patent exclusivity for the RLD has expired. The

entity, or NCE, is a drug that contains no active moiety that has previously been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. An active moiety is the molecule or ion responsible for the physiological
or pharmacological action of the drug substance. In cases where such NCE exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, in
which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product approval. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The FDCA also provides for a period of three
years of exclusivity if the NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the approval of the application. This
three-year exclusivity period often protects changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination or indication. Three-year exclusivity would be available for a drug product that contains a
previously approved active moiety, provided the statutory requirement for a new clinical investigation is satisfied. Unlike five-year NCE exclusivity, an award of three-year exclusivity does not block the FDA from accepting ANDAs seeking approval
for generic versions of the drug as of the date of approval of the original drug product. The FDA typically makes decisions about awards of data exclusivity shortly before a product is approved. </P>

Amendments and permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by, or for, the applicant. If the 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on FDA&#146;s previous
findings of safety and effectiveness is scientifically and legally appropriate, it may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or

six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non-patent and orphan exclusivity. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a
written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA&#146;s request, the additional protection
is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection cover the product are extended by six
months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve another application. With regard to patents, the six-month pediatric exclusivity period will not attach to any patents
for which an ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant submitted a paragraph IV patent certification, unless the NDA sponsor or patent owner first obtains a court determination that the patent if valid and infringed by the proposed product. </P>

Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a drug product as an &#147;orphan drug&#148; if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in
which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. A company must request orphan drug
designation before submitting an NDA for the drug and rare disease or condition. If the request is granted, the FDA will disclose the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential use. Orphan drug designation does not shorten the PDUFA goal
dates for the regulatory review and approval process, although it does convey certain advantages such as tax benefits and exemption from the PDUFA application fee. </P>

the product generally will receive orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve another sponsor&#146;s marketing application for the same drug for the same
indication for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. Orphan exclusivity does not block the approval of a different drug for the same rare disease or condition, nor does it block the approval of the same drug for different
indications. If a drug designated as an orphan drug ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan drug application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity. Orphan exclusivity will not bar
approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if a subsequent product with the same drug for the same indication is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing
a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Patent term restoration and

restoration, under the Hatch-Waxman Act, which permits a patent restoration of up to five years for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review. Patent term extension is generally available only for drug products whose
active ingredient has not previously been approved by the FDA. The restoration period granted is typically one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA
and the ultimate approval date. Patent term extension cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product&#146;s approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug product is eligible for the
extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. A patent that covers multiple drugs for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The
United States PTO reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension in consultation with the FDA. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>FDA approval and regulation of

approval or clearance of that diagnostic, known as a companion diagnostic, at the same time that the FDA approves the therapeutic product. In August 2014, the FDA issued final guidance clarifying the requirements that will apply to approval of
therapeutic products and <I>in vitro</I> companion diagnostics. According to the guidance, for novel drugs, a companion diagnostic device and its corresponding therapeutic should be approved or cleared contemporaneously by the FDA for the use
indicated in the therapeutic product&#146;s labeling. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If FDA determines that a companion diagnostic device is essential to the safe and effective use of
a novel therapeutic product or indication, FDA generally will not approve the therapeutic product or new therapeutic product indication if the companion diagnostic device is not approved or cleared for that indication. Approval or clearance of the
companion diagnostic device will ensure that the device has been adequately evaluated and has adequate performance characteristics in the intended population. The review of <I>in vitro</I> companion diagnostics in conjunction with the review of our
therapeutic treatments for cancer will, therefore, likely involve coordination of review by the FDA&#146;s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and the FDA&#146;s Center for Devices and Radiological Health Office of In Vitro Diagnostics Device
Evaluation and Safety. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the FDCA, <I>in vitro</I> diagnostics, including companion diagnostics, are regulated as medical devices. In the United

registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post-market surveillance. Unless an exemption applies, diagnostic tests require marketing clearance or approval
from the FDA prior to commercial distribution. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a medical device are premarket notification, also called 510(k) clearance, and premarket approval, or PMA approval. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and preclinical data and the submission to and review by the
FDA, can take several years or longer. It involves a rigorous premarket review during which the applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device&#146;s safety and effectiveness and information about the device and
its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. PMA applications are subject to an application fee, which exceeds $250,000 for most PMAs. In addition, PMAs for certain devices must generally include the
results from extensive preclinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the device for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. In particular, for a diagnostic, a PMA application
typically requires data regarding analytical and clinical validation studies. As part of the PMA review, the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturer&#146;s facilities for compliance with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which imposes
elaborate testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance requirements. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">PMA approval is not guaranteed, and the FDA may ultimately respond to
a PMA submission with a not approvable determination based on deficiencies in the application and require additional clinical trial or other data that may be expensive and time-consuming to generate and that can substantially delay approval. If the
FDA&#146;s evaluation of the PMA application is favorable, the FDA typically issues an approvable letter requiring the applicant&#146;s agreement to specific conditions, such as changes in labeling, or specific additional information, such as
submission of final labeling, in order to secure final approval of the PMA. If the FDA&#146;s evaluation of the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. A not
approvable letter will outline the deficiencies in the application and, where practical, will identify what is necessary to make the PMA approvable. The FDA may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA
approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and then the data submitted in an amendment to the PMA. If the FDA concludes that the applicable criteria have been met, the FDA will issue a PMA for the approved
indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought by the applicant. The PMA can include post-approval conditions that the FDA believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things,
restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution. Once granted, PMA approval may be withdrawn by the FDA if compliance with post approval requirements, conditions of approval or other regulatory standards are not maintained or problems are
identified following initial marketing. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">After a device is placed on the market, it remains subject to significant regulatory requirements. Medical
devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved. Device manufacturers must also establish registration and device listings with the FDA. A medical device manufacturer&#146;s manufacturing processes
and those of its suppliers are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging and shipping of
medical devices. Domestic facility records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the FDA. The FDA also may inspect foreign facilities that export products to the United States. </P>

sell any drug products in those foreign countries. Even if a manufacturer obtains FDA approval of a product, it must still obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials
or marketing of the product in those countries. To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug or biological product in the European Union, a manufacturer must submit a marketing authorization application to the European Medicines Agency
or EMA. For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to

application is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human use or CHMP. Accelerated evaluation may
be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases. These are defined as circumstances in which a medicinal product is expected to be of a &#147;major public health interest.&#148; Three cumulative criteria must be fulfilled in such circumstances: the
seriousness of the disease, such as heavy disabling or life-threatening diseases, to be treated; the absence or insufficiency of an appropriate alternative therapeutic approach; and anticipation of high therapeutic benefit. In these circumstances,

as to the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other government authorities. Even if our product candidate is approved, sales of our products will depend, in
part, on the extent to which third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, provide coverage, and establish adequate
reimbursement levels for, such products. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once
coverage is approved. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity, and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party
payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic
studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable marketing approvals. Nonetheless, product candidates may not be considered medically
necessary or cost effective. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover our product candidate could reduce physician utilization of our products once approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial
condition. Additionally, a payor&#146;s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor&#146;s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure
that other payors will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the product, and the level of coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. Third-party reimbursement and coverage may not be available to enable us to
maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The containment of healthcare costs also has
become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on
reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit a
company&#146;s revenue generated from the sale of any approved products. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which

subject to governmental control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory marketing approval for a product and may require us to conduct a clinical trial that compares the
cost effectiveness of our product candidate or products to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in our commercialization efforts. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after
a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular drug candidate to currently available therapies or so called health technology assessments, in
order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the
prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the
market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for products, but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Recently, many countries in the European Union have increased the

the European Union. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. Political, economic and
regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various European Union member states, and parallel trade, i.e., arbitrage
between low-priced and high-priced member states, can further reduce prices. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing

product candidate and may never have a product candidate approved for commercialization. We have financed our operations primarily through private placements of our preferred stock, our initial public offering and the concurrent private placement,
our follow-on public offerings and our collaboration agreements with Celgene focused on cancer metabolism. We have devoted substantially all of our efforts to research and development. We are in clinical development stages of our product candidates
and expect that it will be many years, if ever, before we have a product candidate ready for commercialization. Although we may from time to time report profitable results, such as during the three months ended September&nbsp;30, 2014, which was the
result of the recognition of previously deferred collaboration revenue upon the amendment of the 2010 Agreement, we expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future. The net losses we incur

eventually commercialize a medicine or medicines with significant market potential. This will require us to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including completing preclinical testing and clinical trials of our product candidates,
obtaining marketing approval for these product candidates, manufacturing, marketing and selling those medicines for which we may obtain marketing approval and satisfying any post-marketing requirements. We may never succeed in these activities and,
even if we do, may never generate revenue that are significant or large enough to achieve profitability. We are currently in clinical testing stages for our lead product candidates. If we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or
increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable would decrease the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, maintain our research and development efforts, expand our
business or continue our operations. A decline in the value of our company could also cause our stockholders to lose all or part of their investment. </P>

we continue the research and development of, initiate and continue clinical trials of, and seek marketing approval for, our product candidates. In addition, if we obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur
significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution to the extent that such sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution are not the responsibility of Celgene or other collaborators.
Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we would be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and
development programs or future commercialization efforts. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We expect that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of

estimate as to how long we expect our existing cash and cash equivalents, to be able to continue to fund our operations is based on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently
expect. Further, changing circumstances, some of which may be beyond our control, could cause us to consume capital significantly faster than we currently anticipate, and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned. Our future capital
requirements will depend on many factors, including: </P> <P STYLE="font-size:6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

the discovery phase under the 2010 Agreement. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, ownership interests will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or
other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional
debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. In addition, securing financing could require a substantial amount of time and attention from our management and may divert a disproportionate amount of their attention away from day-to-day
activities, which may adversely affect our management&#146;s ability to oversee the development of our product candidates. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If we raise funds through

Our operations to date have been limited to organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, acquiring and developing our technology, identifying potential product candidates and undertaking preclinical and clinical studies
of our product candidates. All of our product candidates are still in preclinical and clinical development. We have not yet demonstrated our ability to successfully complete any clinical trials, including large-scale, pivotal clinical trials, obtain
marketing approvals, manufacture a commercial scale medicine, or arrange for a third party to do so on our behalf, or conduct sales and marketing activities necessary for successful commercialization. Typically, it takes about 10 to 15 years to
develop one new medicine from the time it is discovered to when it is available for treating patients, assuming that it successfully completes all stages of research and development and achieves marketing approval, all of which is highly uncertain.
Consequently, any predictions you make about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other known and unknown factors. We will need to transition from a company with
a research focus to a company capable of supporting commercial activities. We may not be successful in such a transition. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We expect our financial
condition and operating results to continue to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Accordingly, you should not rely upon the results of any quarterly or
annual periods as indications of future operating performance. </P>

approach, we focus our development activities on genetically or biomarker defined patients most likely to respond to our therapies. As a result, the potential patient populations for our clinical trials are narrowed, and we may experience
difficulties in identifying and enrolling a sufficient number of patients in our clinical trials. In particular, the successful completion of our clinical development programs for AG-348 and AG-519 for the treatment of PK deficiency is dependent
upon our ability to enroll a sufficient number of patients with PK deficiency. PK deficiency is a rare disease with a small patient population. Further, there are only a limited number of specialist physicians that regularly treat patients with PK
deficiency and major clinical centers that support PK deficiency are concentrated in a few geographic regions. The small population of patients, the nature of the disease and limited trial sites may make it difficult for us to enroll enough patients

may have similar eligibility criteria as our current or future clinical trials. For example, Novartis International AG, or Novartis, is currently conducting a phase 1 clinical trial of its IDH1 mutant inhibitor, IDH305, in patients with advanced
malignancies, and this trial may compete with our clinical trials of AG-120 and/or AG-881 for eligible patients with hematological and/or other malignancies harboring an IDH1 mutation. Competition for these patients may make it difficult for us to
enroll enough patients to complete our clinical trials for AG-120 or <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">AG-881</FONT> in a timely and cost-effective manner. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Furthermore, we rely on contract research organizations, or CROs, and clinical trial sites to ensure the proper and timely conduct of our clinical trials and
while we have agreements governing their committed activities, we have limited influence over their actual performance. Our or our collaborators&#146; inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients for our clinical trials would result in
significant delays or may require us to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether. Enrollment delays in our clinical trials may result in increased development costs for our product candidates, which would cause the value of our company to
decline and limit our ability to obtain additional financing. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>If serious adverse side effects or unexpected characteristics are identified during

product candidates are still in clinical stage development and their risk of failure is high. It is impossible to predict when or if any of our product candidates will prove effective or safe in humans or will receive marketing approval. Adverse
events or undesirable side effects caused by, or other unexpected properties of, our product candidates could cause us, any future collaborators, an institutional review board or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials of
one or more of our product candidates and could result in a more restrictive label, or the delay or denial of marketing approval by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. If adverse effects were to arise in patients being treated with
any of our product candidates, it could require us to halt, delay or interrupt clinical trials of such product candidate or adversely affect our ability to obtain requisite approvals to advance the development and commercialization of such product
candidate. If any of our product candidates is associated with adverse events or undesirable side effects or has properties that are unexpected, we, or any future collaborators, may need to abandon development or limit development of that product
candidate to certain uses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective. Many compounds that initially showed promise in earlier
stage testing for treating cancer, RGDs or other diseases have later been found to cause side effects that prevented further development of the compound. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The outcome of preclinical studies and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials, and interim results of clinical
trials do not necessarily predict success in future clinical trials. Many companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in late-stage clinical trials after achieving positive results in earlier
development, and we could face similar setbacks. The design of a clinical trial can determine whether its results will support approval of a product and flaws in the design of a clinical trial may not become apparent until the clinical trial is well
advanced. We have limited experience in designing clinical trials and may be unable to design and execute a clinical trial to support marketing approval. In addition, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and
analyses. Many companies that believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval for the product candidates. Even if we, or future collaborators,
believe that the results of clinical trials for our product candidates warrant marketing approval, the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree and may not grant marketing approval of our product candidates. </P>

for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable medicines. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate

investigational new drug application, or IND, to convert one of every three co-commercialized licensed programs into a split licensed program, for which we retain the United States rights. Due to the limited exercise period, we may have to choose
whether a co-commercialized program will be a split licensed program before we have as much information as we would like on another co-commercialized program, including whether and when such co-commercialized program may receive FDA acceptance of
the applicable IND. Our IDH2 program is not a split licensed program. We have chosen AG-120, and our IDH1 program, as our first split licensed program. As a result of such incomplete information or due to incorrect analysis by us, we may select a
split licensed program that later proves to have less commercial potential than an alternative or none at all. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>If we are unable to successfully

that our success may depend, in part, on our ability to develop companion diagnostics, which are assays or tests to identify an appropriate patient population for these drug candidates. There has been limited success to date industry-wide in
developing these types of companion diagnostics. To be successful, we need to address a number of scientific, technical and logistical challenges. We have little experience in the development of diagnostics and may not be successful in developing
appropriate diagnostics to pair with any of our therapeutic product candidates that receive marketing approval. Companion diagnostics are subject to regulation by the FDA and similar regulatory authorities outside the United States as medical
devices and require separate regulatory approval prior to commercialization. Given our limited experience in developing diagnostics, we rely and expect to continue to rely in part or in whole on third parties for their design and manufacture. We
also depend on Celgene for the development of diagnostics for some of our cancer therapeutic product candidates. If any parties, including without limitation Celgene or us, or any third parties engaged by Celgene or us are unable to successfully

</I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The development and commercialization of new drug products is highly competitive. We face competition with respect to our current product
candidates, and we and our collaborators will face competition with respect to any product candidates that we or they may seek to develop or commercialize in the future, from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and
biotechnology companies worldwide. There are a number of large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that currently market and sell products or are pursuing the development of products for the treatment of the disease indications for which we
are developing our product candidates, such as acute myelogenous leukemia and high risk myelodysplasia. Some of these competitive products and therapies are based on scientific approaches that are the same as or similar to our approach, and others
are based on entirely different approaches, for example, in the area of RGDs. Potential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent
protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are developing most of our initial
product candidates for the treatment of cancer. There are a variety of available drug therapies marketed for cancer. In many cases, these drugs are administered in combination to enhance efficacy, and cancer drugs are frequently prescribed off-label
by healthcare professionals. Some of the currently approved drug therapies are branded and subject to patent protection, and others are available on a generic basis. Many of these approved drugs are well established therapies and are widely accepted
by physicians, patients and third-party payors. Insurers and other third-party payors may also encourage the use of generic products. We expect that if our product candidates are approved, they will be priced at a significant premium over
competitive generic products. This may make it difficult for us to achieve our business strategy of using our product candidates in combination with existing therapies or replacing existing therapies with our product candidates. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are also pursuing product candidates to treat patients with RGDs. There are a variety of treatment options available, including a number of marketed enzyme
replacement therapies, for treating patients with RGDs. In addition to currently marketed therapies, there are also a number of products that are either enzyme replacement therapies or gene therapies in various stages of clinical development to
treat RGDs. These products in development may provide efficacy, safety, convenience and other benefits that are not provided by currently marketed therapies. As a result, they may provide significant competition for any of our product candidates for
which we obtain marketing approval. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There are also a number of product candidates in preclinical or clinical development by third parties to treat cancer
and RGDs by targeting cellular metabolism. These companies include large pharmaceutical companies, including AstraZeneca plc, Eli Lilly and Company, Roche Holdings Inc. and its subsidiary Genentech, Inc., GlaxoSmithKline plc, Merck&nbsp;&amp; Co.,
Novartis with its IDH1 mutant inhibitor IDH305, Pfizer, Inc., and Genzyme, a Sanofi company. There are also biotechnology companies of various sizes that are developing therapies to target cellular metabolism, including Alexion Pharmaceuticals,
Inc., BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc., Calithera Biosciences, Inc., Cornerstone Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Forma Therapeutics Holdings LLC, Shire Biochem Inc., Raze Therapeutics, Inc. and Selvita S.A. Our competitors may develop products that are more
effective, safer, more convenient or less costly than any that we are developing or that would render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive. In addition, our competitors may discover biomarkers that more efficiently measure metabolic
pathways than our methods, which may give them a competitive advantage in developing potential products. Our competitors may also obtain marketing approval from the FDA or other regulatory authorities for their products more rapidly than we may
obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development,
manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources
being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller and other clinical stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These third
parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary
for, our programs. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Even if we or our collaborators are able to commercialize any product candidates, such products may become subject to
unfavorable pricing regulations, third-party reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives, which would harm our business. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The
commercial success of our product candidates will depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of our product candidates will be paid by third-party payors, including government health administration
authorities and private health coverage insurers. If coverage and reimbursement is not available, or reimbursement is available only to limited levels, we, or any future collaborators, may not be able to successfully commercialize our product
candidates. Even if coverage is provided, the approved reimbursement amount may not be high enough to allow us, or any future collaborators, to establish or maintain pricing sufficient to realize a sufficient return on our or their investments. In
the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for products exists among third-party payors and coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process
is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied
consistently or obtained in the first instance. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There is significant uncertainty related to third-party payor coverage and reimbursement of newly
approved drugs. Marketing approvals, pricing and reimbursement for new drug products vary widely from country to country. Some countries require approval of the sale price of a drug before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review
period begins after marketing or product licensing approval is granted. In some foreign markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. As a result, we, or any
future collaborators, might obtain marketing approval for a product in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay commercial launch of the product, possibly for lengthy time periods, which may negatively impact the
revenue we are able to generate from the sale of the product in that country. Adverse pricing limitations may hinder our ability or the ability of any future collaborators to recoup our or their investment in one or more product candidates, even if
our product candidates obtain marketing approval. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Patients who are provided medical treatment for their conditions generally rely on third-party payors
to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their treatment. Therefore, our ability, and the ability of any future collaborators, to commercialize any of our product candidates will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and
reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from third-party payors. Third-party payors decide which medications they will cover and establish reimbursement levels. The healthcare industry is acutely focused on cost
containment, both in the United States and elsewhere. Government authorities and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications, which could affect our ability
or that of any future collaborators to sell our product candidates profitably. These payors may not view our products, if any, as cost-effective, and coverage and reimbursement may not be available to our customers, or those of any future
collaborators, or may not be sufficient to allow our products, if any, to be marketed on a competitive basis. Cost-control initiatives could cause us, or any future collaborators, to decrease the price we, or they, might establish for products,
which could result in lower than anticipated product revenue. If the prices for our products, if any, decrease or if governmental and other third-party payors do not provide coverage or adequate reimbursement, our prospects for revenue and
profitability will suffer. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There may also be delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs, and coverage may be
more limited than the indications for which the drug is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Moreover, eligibility for reimbursement does not imply that any drug will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our
costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. Reimbursement rates may vary, by way of example, according to the use of the product and the clinical setting in which it is used. Reimbursement rates may also be based on
reimbursement levels already set for lower cost drugs or may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, increasingly,
third-party payors are requiring higher levels of evidence of the benefits and clinical outcomes of new technologies and are challenging the prices charged. We cannot be sure that coverage will be available for any product candidate that we, or any
future collaborator, commercialize and, if available, that the reimbursement rates will be adequate. Further, the net reimbursement for drug products may be subject to additional reductions if there are changes to laws that presently restrict
imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. An inability to promptly obtain coverage and adequate payment rates from both government-funded and private payors for any of our product candidates
for which we, or any future collaborator, obtain marketing approval could significantly harm our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize products and our overall financial condition. </P>

related to the testing of our product candidates in human clinical trials and will face an even greater risk if we or they commercially sell any medicines that we or they may develop. If we or our collaborators cannot successfully defend ourselves
or themselves against claims that our product candidates or medicines caused injuries, we could incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in: </P>

practices, or cGCP, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA, the Competent Authorities of the Member States of the European Economic Area and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for all of our products in clinical development.
Regulatory authorities enforce these cGCPs through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites. If we or any of these third parties fail to comply with applicable cGCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical
trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot assure you
that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical trials comply with cGCP regulations. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with product produced under current good
manufacturing practices, or cGMP, regulations. Our failure to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process. We also are required to register ongoing clinical trials and

these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to

obtained is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize medicines and technology similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our medicines and technology may be adversely affected.
</I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States and other countries with respect
to our proprietary medicines and technology. We seek to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the United States and abroad related to our novel technologies and medicines that are important to our business. We do not yet
have issued patents for all our lead product candidates in all markets we intend to commercialize. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The patent prosecution process is expensive and
time-consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and
development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. Although we enter into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to patentable aspects of our research and development output, such as our
employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, contract research organizations, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose such output
before a patent application is filed, thereby jeopardizing our ability to seek patent protection. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We may in the future license patent rights that are
valuable to our business from third parties, in which event we may not have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain the patents, covering technology or medicines underlying such licenses.
We cannot be certain that these patents and applications will be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. If any such licensors fail to maintain such patents, or lose rights to those patents, the rights
we have licensed may be reduced or eliminated and our right to develop and commercialize any of our products that are the subject of such licensed rights could be adversely affected. In addition to the foregoing, the risks associated with patent
rights that we license from third parties also apply to patent rights we own. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally
is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain.
Our pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued that protect our technology or medicines or that effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and medicines. Changes in either the patent
laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection. The laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the
laws of the United States. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after
filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our owned or licensed patents or pending patent applications, or that we were the first to file for patent protection of
such inventions. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Assuming the other requirements for patentability are met, prior to March 2013, in the United States, the first to make the claimed
invention was entitled to the patent, while outside the United States, the first to file a patent application was entitled to the patent. Beginning in March 2013, the United States transitioned to a first inventor to file system in which, assuming
the other requirements for patentability are met, the first inventor to file a patent application will be entitled to the patent. We may be subject to a third-party preissuance submission of prior art to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or

its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, and our patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated
or held unenforceable, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and medicines. Given the amount of time
required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our intellectual property may not provide
us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We may become involved in lawsuits to

infringe our patents and other intellectual property rights. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time consuming. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court
may decide that a patent of ours is invalid or unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation
proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some
of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Third parties may initiate legal proceedings

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our commercial success depends upon our ability and the ability of our collaborators to develop, manufacture, market and sell our product candidates and use
our proprietary technologies without infringing the proprietary rights and intellectual property of third parties. The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual
property rights. We have in the past and may in the future become party to, or threatened with, adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our medicines and technology, including interference
proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. For example, in 2011, The Leonard and Madlyn Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute at the Abramson Cancer Center of the University of Pennsylvania initiated a lawsuit against us, one of
our founders, Craig B. Thompson, M.D., and Celgene, alleging misappropriation of intellectual property and, in 2012, the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania initiated a similar lawsuit against us and Dr.&nbsp;Thompson. Each of these lawsuits
was settled in 2012. No other legal proceedings have been filed against us to date. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future. If we or one of our collaborators are
found to infringe a third party&#146;s intellectual property rights, we or they could be required to obtain a license from such third party to continue developing and marketing our medicines and technology. However, we or our collaborators may not
be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we or our collaborators were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors and other third parties access to the same
technologies licensed to us. We or our collaborators could be forced, including by court order, to cease developing and commercializing the infringing technology or medicine. In addition, we or our collaborators

these individuals have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such individual&#146;s current or former employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we
fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and
be a distraction to management. Other than the litigation initiated by the Leonard and Madlyn Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute at the Abramson Cancer Center of the University of Pennsylvania and by the Trustees of the University of

proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses, and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the
results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Such litigation or
proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing or distribution activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to
adequately conduct such litigation or proceedings. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources and more mature and developed
intellectual property portfolios. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace. </P>

proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position. With respect to our proprietary cellular metabolism technology platform, we consider trade secrets and know-how to be our primary intellectual property. Trade secrets and know-how can be
difficult to protect. In particular, we anticipate that with respect to this technology platform, these trade secrets and know-how will over time be disseminated within the industry through independent development, the publication of journal

Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our product candidates and the activities associated with their development and commercialization, including their design, testing, manufacture, safety,
efficacy, recordkeeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution, export and import, are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory agencies in the United States and by the EMA and
comparable regulatory authorities in other countries. Failure to obtain marketing approval for a product candidate will prevent us from commercializing the product candidate. We and our collaborators have not received approval to market any of our
product candidates from regulatory authorities in any jurisdiction. We have only limited experience in filing and supporting the applications necessary to gain marketing approvals and expect to rely on third-party contract research organizations to
assist us in this process. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Securing marketing approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to
the various regulatory authorities for each therapeutic indication to establish the product candidate&#146;s safety and efficacy. Securing regulatory approval also requires the submission of information about the product manufacturing process to,
and inspection of manufacturing facilities by, the relevant regulatory authority. Our product candidates may not be effective, may be only moderately effective or may prove to have undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities or other
characteristics that may preclude our obtaining marketing approval or prevent or limit commercial use. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The process of obtaining marketing approvals, both
in the United States and abroad, is expensive, may take many years if additional clinical trials are required, if approval is obtained at all, and can vary substantially based upon a variety of factors, including the type, complexity and novelty of
the product candidates involved. Changes in marketing approval policies during the development period, changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations, or changes in regulatory review for each submitted product application, may
cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application. The FDA and comparable authorities in other countries have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data is
insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies. In addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent marketing approval of a product
candidate. Any marketing approval we or our collaborators ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the approved medicine not commercially viable. </P>

leukemia, or AML, that harbor an IDH2 and IDH1 mutation, respectively. If a drug is intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and the drug demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for this
disease or condition, the drug sponsor may apply for FDA fast track designation. The FDA has broad discretion whether or not to grant fast track designation, so even if we believe a particular product candidate is eligible for such designation, the
FDA may decide not to grant it. Even though AG-221 and AG-120 have received fast track designation for treatment of patients with AML that harbor an IDH2 and IDH1 mutation, respectively, we may not experience a faster development process, review or

The regulatory approval process outside the United States generally includes all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. In addition, in many countries outside the United States, a product be approved for reimbursement before the
product can be approved for sale in that country. We or our collaborators may not obtain approvals from regulatory authorities outside the United States on a timely basis, if at all. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory

the manufacturing processes, post-approval clinical data, labeling, advertising and promotional activities for such medicine, will be subject to continual requirements of and review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. These requirements
include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration and listing requirements, cGMP requirements relating to quality control and manufacturing, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and
documents, and requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping. Even if marketing approval of a product candidate is granted, the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the medicine
may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, or contain requirements for costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the medicine, including the requirement to implement a risk evaluation and mitigation

deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits
stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our

eligible for sale in the public market to the extent permitted by the provisions of various vesting schedules and Rule 144 and Rule 701 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, and, in any event, we have filed a

significant percentage of our capital stock. As a result, if these stockholders were to choose to act together, they would be able to significantly influence all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, as well as our management and
affairs. For example, these persons, if they choose to act together, could significantly influence the election of directors and approval of any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. This concentration of voting

stockholders, and new investors could gain rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Our ability to use
our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under Section&nbsp;382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended, if a company undergoes an &#147;ownership change,&#148; generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation&#146;s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss
carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes (such as research tax credits) to offset its post-change taxable income or taxes may be limited. Our prior equity offerings and other changes in our stock ownership, some of which are outside of our
control, may have resulted or could in the future result in an ownership change. For example, in 2012, we completed a review of our changes in ownership through December&nbsp;31, 2011, and determined that we had two qualified ownership changes since
inception. The changes of ownership will result in net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards that we expect to expire unutilized. If additional limitations were to apply, utilization of a portion of our net operating loss
and tax credit carryforwards could be further limited in future periods and a portion of the carryforwards could expire before being available to reduce future income tax liabilities. </P>

initiatives and corporate governance practices. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As a public company, and particularly since January&nbsp;1, 2015 when we ceased to be an
&#147;emerging growth company,&#148; we have incurred and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing
requirements of The NASDAQ Global Select Market and other applicable securities rules and regulations impose various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and
corporate governance practices. Stockholder activism, the current political environment and the current high level of government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations. Our management and other personnel will need
to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly. In addition,
stockholder activism, the current political environment and the current high level of government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Pursuant to Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Section&nbsp;404, we are required to furnish with our periodic Exchange Act reports a
report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting and are required to include with our annual report an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting
firm. To achieve compliance with Section&nbsp;404, we have engaged in a process to document and evaluate our internal control over financial reporting, which has been, and will continue to be, both costly and challenging. In this regard, we will
need to continue to dedicate internal resources, engage outside consultants and adopt a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, continue steps to improve control processes as appropriate,
validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting. Despite our efforts, there is a risk that we will not be able to
conclude, from time to time, that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as required by Section&nbsp;404. If we identify one or more material weaknesses, it could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a
loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Because we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock in

dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business. In addition, the terms of any future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends. As a
result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be the sole source of gain for our stockholders for the foreseeable future. </P>

biopharmaceutical company committed to applying our scientific leadership in the field of cellular metabolism to transform the lives of patients with cancer and rare genetic metabolic disorders, or RGDs, which are a subset of orphan genetic
metabolic diseases. Metabolism is a complex biological process involving the uptake and assimilation of nutrients in cells to produce energy and facilitate many of the processes required for cellular division and growth. We focus our efforts on
using cellular metabolism, an unexploited area of biological research with disruptive potential, as a platform for developing potentially transformative small molecule medicines. Our most advanced cancer product candidates are AG-221 and AG-120,
which target mutated isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 and 1, or IDH2 and IDH1, respectively, and AG-881, which targets both mutated IDH1 and mutated IDH2. These mutations are found in a wide range of hematological malignancies and solid tumors. The lead
product candidate in our RGD programs, AG-348, targets pyruvate kinase-R for the treatment of pyruvate kinase deficiency. Pyruvate kinase deficiency is a rare disorder that often results in severe hemolytic anemia due to inherited mutations in the
pyruvate kinase enzyme within red blood cells. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In April 2010, we entered into a discovery and development collaboration and license agreement, or the
2010 Agreement, with Celgene Corporation, or Celgene, focused on targeting cancer metabolism. The goal of the collaboration under the 2010 Agreement is to discover, develop and commercialize disease-altering therapies in oncology arising out of our
cancer metabolism research platform that have achieved development candidate status. On December&nbsp;8, 2014, Celgene elected to extend the period of its exclusivity for an additional year to April 2016. The extension marks the final year of the
discovery phase and Celgene will maintain its exclusive option to certain drug candidates that emerge from our cancer metabolism research platform through April 2016. We received a $20.0 million payment as a result of the extension in May 2015. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the terms of the 2010 Agreement, we lead research, preclinical and early development efforts through phase 1, while Celgene received an option to obtain
exclusive rights either upon Investigational New Drug application, or IND, acceptance or at the end of phase 1 to further develop and commercialize medicines emerging from our cancer metabolism research. Celgene would lead and fund global
development and commercialization of development candidates for which it exercises its option to obtain a co-commercialization license, and we would retain development and commercialization rights in the United States for development candidates for
which we exercise our option to retain a split license. On all programs under the 2010 Agreement for which Celgene exercises its option, we are eligible to receive up to $120.0 million in milestone-based payments as well as royalties on any sales.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We nominated AG-221 and AG-120 during the discovery phase of the collaboration under the 2010 Agreement. In June 2014, Celgene exercised its exclusive
option to license AG-221 and gained worldwide development and commercialization rights for AG-221. In addition to contributing our scientific and translational expertise, we continue to conduct certain clinical development and regulatory activities
within the AG-221 development program while transitioning responsibilities to Celgene, which will lead later development activities. Celgene exercised its exclusive option to license development and commercialization rights to AG-120 outside the
United States during the three months ended March 31, 2015. We retain U.S. development and commercialization rights for AG-120. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">During April 2015, we selected a third novel IDH mutant inhibitor, AG-881, for clinical development. On
April&nbsp;27, 2015, we entered into a joint worldwide development and profit share collaboration and license agreement with Celgene and our wholly owned subsidiary, Agios International Sarl, which was organized in Switzerland in April 2015, entered
into a collaboration and license agreement with Celgene International II Sarl. We refer to these agreements collectively as the AG-881 Agreements. The AG-881 Agreements establish a worldwide collaboration focused on the development and
commercialization of AG-881 products. Under the terms of the AG-881 Agreements, we received initial upfront payments totaling $10.0 million in May 2015 and are eligible to receive up to $70.0 million in milestone-based payments. We and Celgene will
equally split all worldwide development costs, subject to specified exceptions, as well as any profits from any net sales of, or commercialization losses related to, licensed AG-881 products. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Since inception, our operations have focused on organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, assembling our core capabilities in
cellular metabolism, identifying potential product candidates, undertaking preclinical studies and conducting clinical trials. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through funding received from the 2010 Agreement, the AG-881
Agreements, private placements of our preferred stock, our initial public offering of our common stock and concurrent private placement of common stock to an affiliate of Celgene and our follow-on public offerings. Substantially all of our revenue
to date has been collaboration revenue received from Celgene. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Since inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net losses were $117.7
million, $53.5 million and $39.4 million for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $248.7 million. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and
operating losses over the next several years. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from year to year. We anticipate that our expenses will increase significantly as we continue to advance and expand clinical development activities for our lead
programs, AG-221, AG-120, AG-881 and AG-348, as well as AG-519, our second product candidate that is a potent activator of the PKR enzyme; continue to discover and validate novel targets and drug product candidates; expand and protect our

substantive milestones, specifically reviewing factors such as the degree of certainty in achieving the milestone, the research and development risk and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the milestone, as well as the level of effort and
investment required and whether the milestone consideration is reasonable relative to all deliverables and payment terms in the arrangement. This evaluation includes an assessment of whether (a)&nbsp;the consideration is commensurate with either
(1)&nbsp;the entity&#146;s performance to achieve the milestone or (2)&nbsp;the enhancement of the value of the delivered item(s) as a result of a specific outcome resulting from the entity&#146;s performance to achieve the milestone, (b)&nbsp;the

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The following summarizes our most advanced current research and development programs. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>AG-221: lead IDH2 program </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">AG-221 is an orally
available, selective, potent inhibitor of the mutated IDH2 protein, making it a highly targeted therapeutic candidate for the treatment of patients with cancers that harbor IDH2 mutations, including those with acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, who
have a historically poor prognosis. On June&nbsp;16, 2014, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, granted us orphan drug designation for AG-221 for treatment of patients with AML. On August&nbsp;13, 2014, we announced that the FDA granted
fast track designation to AG-221 for treatment of patients with AML that harbor an IDH2 mutation. We have been evaluating AG-221 in several phase 1 dose-escalation clinical trials evaluating both hematological and solid tumor cancers with IDH2
mutations. To date, all clinical data reported by us in hematological cancers highlights that the mechanism of response is consistent with preclinical studies, including substantial reduction of plasma 2-hydroxygluturate, or 2HG, levels, as well as
evidence of cellular differentiation and normalization of cell counts in the bone marrow and blood. This differentiation effect is distinct from that seen with traditional chemotherapeutics commonly used to treat AML. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In June 2014, Celgene exercised its option to an exclusive global license for development and commercialization of AG-221 under the 2010 Agreement. Under the
2010 Agreement, Celgene is responsible for all development costs for AG-221. We are eligible to receive up to $120.0 million in milestone payments and a tiered royalty on any net sales of products containing AG-221. In January 2016, in conjunction
with the initiation of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">AG-221</FONT> phase&nbsp;3 trials we received a milestone payment of $25.0 million. We also have the right to conduct a portion of any commercialization activities for AG-221 in the United
States. In addition to contributing our scientific and translational expertise, we will continue to conduct some clinical development and regulatory activities within the AG-221 development program in collaboration with Celgene. </P>

available, selective, potent inhibitor of the mutated IDH1 protein, making it a highly targeted therapeutic candidate for the treatment of patients with cancers that harbor IDH1 mutations. Mutations in IDH1 have been identified in difficult to treat
hematologic and solid tumor cancers, including AML, chondrosarcoma and cholangiocarcinoma where both the treatment options and prognosis for patients are poor. In March 2014, we initiated two phase 1, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation and
expansion clinical trials for AG-120, one designed to assess the safety, clinical activity and tolerability of AG-120 as a single agent in patients with advanced hematologic malignancies and the second designed to evaluate the safety, clinical
activity and tolerability of AG-120 in patients with advanced solid tumors. Both trials are only enrolling patients that carry an IDH1 mutation. On May&nbsp;18, 2015, we announced that the FDA granted fast track designation to AG-120 for treatment
of patients with AML that harbor an IDH1 mutation. On June&nbsp;10, 2015, the FDA granted us orphan drug designation for AG-120 for treatment of patients with AML. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Celgene exercised its exclusive option to license development and commercialization rights to AG-120 outside the United States during the three months ended
March&nbsp;31, 2015. We had previously elected to exercise our option to retain development and commercialization rights to AG-120 in the United States in January 2014. Upon Celgene&#146;s exercise of its exclusive option under the terms of our 2010
Agreement, Celgene leads development and commercialization outside the United States, and we lead development and commercialization in the United States. Celgene is responsible for future development and commercialization costs specific to countries
outside the United States, we are responsible for future development and commercialization costs specific to the United States, and we and Celgene will equally fund the future global development costs of AG-120 that are not specific to any
particular region or country. Celgene is eligible to receive tiered royalties on any net sales in the United States. We are eligible to receive tiered royalties on any net sales outside the United States and up to $120.0 million in payments on
achievement of certain milestones. We are also eligible to receive an additional one-time payment of $25.0 million upon the dosing of the last patient in an Agios-sponsored phase 2 clinical trial for <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">AG-120.</FONT>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Revenue.</I> In July 2014, we amended our 2010 Agreement with Celgene which resulted in the application of new
accounting guidance to the agreement. As a result of the amendment, we were required to evaluate the agreement under the new revenue recognition accounting guidance on a prospective basis, which resulted in additional revenue being recognized. Prior
to the July 2014 amendment, arrangement consideration was recognized ratably over the estimated period of performance. Under this new guidance, the best estimate of selling price of all undelivered units of accounting was estimated and was
determined to be less than the combination of future contractual consideration to be received and the remaining deferred revenue balance at the amendment date. As a result, we immediately recognized revenue on the amendment date related to the
excess of total consideration over the best estimate of selling price of undelivered elements, which fundamentally relates to previously delivered elements under the agreement and includes the exclusive global license for development and
commercialization of AG-221 and the reimbursement of on-going development costs related to AG-221 through the amendment date. For the period January&nbsp;1, 2014 through the amendment date, we recognized a total of $42.7 million in revenue under the
previous accounting guidance and upon the modification. We recognized $22.7 million in revenue related to the units of accounting subsequent to the modification date. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, we recognized $59.1 million in revenue
under the new accounting guidance, which includes $27.8 million upon delivery of the ex-U.S. license for AG-120 and U.S. and ex-U.S. licenses for AG-881. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Research and development expense.</I> The increase in research and development expenses was primarily attributable to net increases of $8.5&nbsp;million in
external services and $32.9&nbsp;million in internal expenses; both of these increases are inclusive of $25.2&nbsp;million in reimbursement of certain costs related to AG-221, AG-120 and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">AG-881,</FONT> which are
recorded as a reduction of research and development expenses. During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, we recognized certain cost reimbursements related to our on-going development activities under our IDH programs for which we are no longer
acting as the principal in the transaction as a reduction of research and development expenses. No cost reimbursements were recorded as a reduction of research and development expenditures during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014. </P>

guidance to the agreement. As a result of the amendment, we were required to reevaluate the agreement under the new revenue recognition accounting guidance on a prospective basis. Prior to the July 2014 amendment, arrangement consideration was
recognized ratably over the estimated period of performance. Under this new guidance, the best estimate of selling price of all undelivered units of accounting was estimated and was determined to be less than the combination of future contractual
consideration to be received and the remaining deferred revenue balance at the amendment date. As a result, we immediately recognized revenue on the amendment date related to the excess of total consideration over the best estimate of selling price
of undelivered elements, which fundamentally relates to previously delivered elements under the agreement and includes the exclusive global license for development and commercialization of AG-221 and the reimbursement of on-going reimbursable costs
related to AG-221 through the amendment date. For the period January&nbsp;1, 2014 through the amendment date, we recognized a total of $42.7 million in revenue under the previous accounting guidance and upon the modification. We recognized $22.7

profits of $5.0 million, $50.0 million and $250.0 million, respectively, from sales of the product. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we have not commercialized a brain cancer therapy product. </TD></TR></TABLE>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of
$375.9 million, consisting primarily of investments in U.S. Treasuries and certificates of deposit. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates,
particularly because our investments are in short-term marketable securities. Our marketable securities are subject to interest rate risk and could fall in value if market interest rates increase. Due to the short-term duration of our investment
portfolio and the low risk profile of our investments, we do not believe an immediate 10% change in interest rates would have a material effect on the fair market value of our investment portfolio. We have the ability to hold our marketable
securities until maturity, and therefore we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a change in market interest rates on our investments. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are also exposed to market risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We have contracts with contract research organizations that are
located in Asia and Europe that are denominated in foreign currencies. We are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency rates in connection with these agreements. We do not currently hedge our foreign currency exchange rate risk. As of
December&nbsp;31, 2015 and December&nbsp;31, 2014, we had minimal or no liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (&#147;Agios&#148; or &#147;the Company&#148;) is a biopharmaceutical company committed to the fundamental
transformation of patients&#146; lives through scientific leadership in the field of cancer metabolism and rare genetic metabolic disorders. The Company has built a unique set of core capabilities in the field of cellular metabolism, with the goal
of making transformative, first or best in class medicines. The Company&#146;s therapeutic areas of focus are cancer and rare genetic metabolic disorders, which are a broad group of more than 600 rare genetic diseases caused by mutations, or
defects, of single metabolic genes. In both of these areas, the Company is seeking to unlock the biology of cellular metabolism to create transformative therapies. The Company is located in Cambridge, Massachusetts. </P>

as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 of $284.7 million and will require substantial capital for research and product development. The future success of the Company is dependent on its ability to develop its product candidates and ultimately upon its ability
to attain profitable operations. The Company is subject to a number of risks similar to other life science companies, including, but not limited to, risks related to the successful discovery and development of its drug candidates, raising additional
capital, development of new technological innovations by its competitors, protection of proprietary technology, and market acceptance of the Company&#146;s products. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition to the Company&#146;s existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, the Company is eligible to earn a significant amount of milestone
payments and is entitled to additional cost reimbursements under its collaboration agreement with Celgene. At December&nbsp;31, 2015, the Company believes its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, totaling $375.9 million, are sufficient
to fund operations for a period of at least 12 months from the balance sheet date. </P>

Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements include the Company&#146;s accounts and the accounts of the Company&#146;s wholly owned subsidiaries, Agios Securities Corporation and Agios International Sarl. All intercompany transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#147;GAAP&#148;). </P>

statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Company&#146;s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual
results could differ from those estimates. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Revenue recognition </I></B></P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In January 2011, the Company adopted the FASB Accounting Standards Update (&#147;ASU&#148;) No.&nbsp;2009-13,<I> Multiple-Element Revenue Arrangements
</I>(&#147;ASU No.&nbsp;2009-13&#148;)<I>,</I> which was codified within ASC 605-25, on a prospective basis for all revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified after the adoption date. The 2010 Agreement was entered into prior to
January&nbsp;1, 2011 and the Company initially applied its prior accounting policy with respect to the arrangement. Under this policy, when evaluating multiple element arrangements, the Company considered whether the components of the arrangement
should be accounted for individually as separate units of accounting if (1)&nbsp;the elements have stand-alone value, and (2)&nbsp;the Company is able to estimate the fair value of all undelivered elements under the arrangement. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In July 2014, the Company amended its collaboration agreement with Celgene. The amendment was determined to be a material modification pursuant to ASU
No.&nbsp;2009-13. As a result of the amendment, the Company was required to reevaluate the agreement under ASC 605-25, and began recognizing revenue for the arrangement under this guidance on a prospective basis, as discussed further in Note 3. As
required, all new contracts or modifications to existing contracts, including the AG-881 Agreements entered into in April 2015 and discussed further in Note 3, will be accounted for under ASC 605-25. </P>

each unit of accounting to determine the appropriate revenue recognition. In the event that a deliverable of a multiple element arrangement does not represent a separate unit of accounting, the Company recognizes revenue from the combined units of

recognize revenue contingent upon the achievement of a milestone in its entirety in the period in which the milestone is achieved, only if the milestone meets all the criteria within the guidance to be considered substantive. In accordance with ASU
2010-17, at the inception of each arrangement that includes milestone payments, the Company evaluates each contingent payment on an individual basis to determine whether they are considered substantive milestones, specifically reviewing factors such
as the degree of certainty in achieving the milestone, the research and development risk and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the milestone, as well as the level of effort and investment required and whether the milestone consideration
is reasonable relative to all deliverables and payment terms in the arrangement. This evaluation includes an assessment of whether (a)&nbsp;the consideration is commensurate with either (1)&nbsp;the entity&#146;s performance to achieve the
milestone, or (2)&nbsp;the enhancement of the value of the delivered item(s) as a result of a specific outcome resulting from the entity&#146;s performance to achieve the milestone, (b)&nbsp;the consideration relates solely to past performance and

management to make assumptions with respect to the expected term of the option, the expected volatility of the common stock consistent with the expected life of the option, risk-free interest rates and expected dividend yields of the common stock.
For awards subject to service-based vesting conditions, the Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, equal to the grant date fair value of stock options on a straight-line basis over the requisite service

unrealized loss position. The aggregate fair value of debt securities in an unrealized loss position at December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014 was $207.4 million and $236.9 million, respectively. There were no individual securities that were in a
significant unrealized loss position or that had been in an unrealized loss position for greater than one year as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014. The Company evaluated its securities for other-than-temporary impairment and considered the decline
in market value for the securities to be primarily attributable to current economic and market conditions. It is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the securities and the Company does not intend to do so prior to the
recovery of the amortized cost basis. Based on this analysis, these marketable securities were not considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014. </P>

which simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes. ASU 2015-17 requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. ASU 2015-17 is effective for financial statements
issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 (and interim periods within those fiscal years) with early adoption permitted. ASU 2015-17 may be either applied prospectively to all deferred tax assets and liabilities or retrospectively to
all periods presented. The Company elected to early adopt ASU 2015-17 prospectively in the fourth quarter of 2015. As a result, all deferred tax assets and liabilities will be presented as noncurrent on the consolidated balance sheet. There was no
impact on our results of operations as a result of the adoption of ASU <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">2015-17.</FONT> </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In August 2014, the FASB issued
Accounting Standards Update (&#147;ASU&#148;) No.&nbsp;2014-15, <I>Presentation of Financial Statements &#150; Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40)</I>. The ASU requires all entities to evaluate for the existence of conditions or events that raise
substantial doubt about the entity&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the issuance date of the financial statements. The accounting standard is effective for interim and annual periods ending after December&nbsp;15,
2016, and is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements, but may impact the Company&#146;s footnote disclosures. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In
May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No.&nbsp;2014-09, <I>Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)</I>. The ASU provides for a single comprehensive model for use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most
current revenue recognition guidance. The accounting standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2016 with no early adoption permitted. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No.&nbsp;2015-14, <I>Revenue from
Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date</I>, which deferred the effective date of ASU No.&nbsp;2014-09 to annual periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2017, along with an option to permit early adoption as of the

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In April 2010, the Company entered into a collaboration agreement focused on cancer metabolism with Celgene, a related party through ownership of the
Company&#146;s common stock. The agreement was amended in October 2011 and July 2014, as described below (the agreement together with the amendments, the &#147;2010 Agreement&#148;). The goal of the collaboration is to discover, develop and
commercialize disease-altering therapies in oncology based on the Company&#146;s cancer metabolism research platform. The Company will initially lead discovery, preclinical and early clinical development for all cancer metabolism programs under the
collaboration. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The discovery phase of the 2010 Agreement was scheduled to expire in April 2014, subject to Celgene&#146;s option to extend the discovery
phase for up to an additional two years with additional funding to the Company. In December 2013, Celgene elected to extend the term of the initial discovery phase from four years to five years, to April 2015, in exchange for the payment of a $20.0
million extension fee which was received in May 2014. In December 2014, Celgene elected to exercise its final option to extend the term of the initial discovery phase one additional year, to April 2016, in exchange for the payment of a $20.0 million
extension fee which was received in May 2015. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Pursuant to the 2010 Agreement, the Company is responsible for nominating development candidates, of which
two required confirmation by the Joint Research Committee (&#147;JRC&#148;) during the discovery phase. During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2012 the Company nominated its first development candidate (AG-221) and during the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2013 the Company nominated its second development candidate (AG-120), both of which have been confirmed by the JRC pursuant to the 2010 Agreement. For each development candidate, Celgene elected to progress such development
candidate into preclinical development, which required the Company to conduct studies to meet the requirements for filing an Investigational New Drug application (&#147;IND&#148;), or IND-enabling studies. Subsequently, the Company was required to
file an IND for each of the two development candidates and, upon the FDA&#146;s acceptance of the INDs, Celgene requested that the Company conduct an initial phase 1 clinical trial relating to each of the two development candidates. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Celgene may elect to convert each discovery program for which the Company has nominated a development candidate into a co-commercialized licensed program, the
attributes of which are described below. The Company has the right, exercisable during a specified period following FDA acceptance of the applicable IND, to convert one of every three co-commercialized licensed programs into a split licensed
program, for which the Company will retain the United States rights, other attributes of which are further described below. In June 2014, Celgene exercised its option to an exclusive global license for the development and commercialization of the
Company&#146;s isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (&#147;IDH2&#148;) program, AG-221. The Company elected to retain U.S. rights to its isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (&#147;IDH1&#148;) program, AG-120, in January 2014. Celgene exercised its rights to this
program during the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2015. In addition, Celgene may license certain discovery programs that the Company does not nominate or the JRC does not confirm as a development candidate and for which Celgene will lead and fund
global development and commercialization. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In July 2014, the Company amended the 2010 Agreement to allow for more flexibility in the design and conduct
of phase 1 clinical trials and additional nonclinical and/or clinical activities that the Company agreed to perform at Celgene&#146;s request. The amendment further modified the mechanism and timing for payments to be made with respect to such
development activities. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the 2010 Agreement, the Company is eligible to receive up to $120.0 million in potential milestone payments payable for

in milestone payments upon achievement of specified regulatory milestone events, and (iii)&nbsp;a $25.0 million milestone payment upon achievement of a specified commercial milestone event. The Company is also eligible to receive additional
milestone payments specific to co-commercialized licensed programs and split licensed programs. In addition, the Company is eligible to receive a substantive milestone payment of $22.5 million upon achievement of an early clinical development
milestone event for certain co-commercialized licensed programs. In connection with the first split licensed program under the collaboration, the Company&#146;s IDH1 program, AG-120, the Company is eligible to receive an additional one-time payment
of $25.0 million upon the dosing of the last patient in a Company-sponsored phase 2 clinical trial. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition to the milestone payments described
above, for each co-commercialized licensed program, the Company will be reimbursed for all eligible development costs of the related phase 1 multiple ascending dose clinical trial. The initial costs will be reimbursed as a milestone payment equal to
the greater of $5.0 million or eligible development costs incurred by the Company upon the earlier of the determination of the maximum tolerated dose or Celgene&#146;s election to license the program. Subsequent to the initial milestone payment,
development costs will be reimbursed on a quarterly basis. In addition to the milestone payments described above, for each split licensed program, the Company is eligible for reimbursement of the costs of disease-specific expansion cohort(s) that
support the initiation of a subsequent pivotal clinical trial. Costs will be reimbursed as a milestone payment equal to the lesser of $10.0 million or fifty percent of the eligible costs for the disease-specific expansion cohort(s) upon the first
patient dosed under the pivotal clinical trial. The maximum amount for the milestone payment will be $10.0 million for each split licensed program regardless of the number of disease-specific expansion cohorts and pivotal trials undertaken for each
split licensed program. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company may also receive royalties at tiered, low- to mid-teen percentage rates on net sales and has the option to
participate in the development and commercialization of certain products in the United States. The royalty payments will be recognized as revenue in the period in which they are earned. In January 2016, the Company determined that a substantive
development milestone was achieved and received a milestone payment of $25.0 million, which will be recognized as revenue in the same period. No other milestone or royalty payments under the 2010 Agreement have been earned. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The term of the agreement will continue, unless earlier terminated by either party, until the expiration of the last-to-expire of all royalty terms with
respect to all royalty-bearing products. Celgene may terminate the agreement for convenience in its entirety or with respect to one or more programs upon ninety days written notice to the Company. Either the Company or Celgene may terminate the
agreement in its entirety or with respect to one or more programs, if the other party is in material breach and fails to cure such breach within the specified cure period; however, if such breach relates solely to a specific program, the
non-breaching party may only terminate the agreement with respect to such program. Either the Company or Celgene may terminate the agreement in the event of specified insolvency events involving the other party. </P>

2010 Agreement, the Company concluded that none of the identified deliverables had stand-alone value and, therefore, accounted for the deliverables as a single unit of accounting. The Company further concluded it was unable to estimate the fair
value of the undelivered items within the 2010 Agreement. Upfront consideration of approximately $121.2 million received was recognized on a straight-line basis through the period over which the Company expected to fulfill its performance
obligations (the performance period), which was initially determined to be 6 years. In addition, Celgene purchased 5,190,551 shares of Series B convertible preferred stock (Series B Preferred Stock) at a price of $1.70 per share, resulting in net
proceeds to the Company of approximately $8.8 million. The Company determined the price paid by Celgene for the Series B Preferred Stock represented a premium over the fair value of the Company&#146;s Series B Preferred Stock as determined by the
implied value of the Series B Preferred Stock pursuant to a contemporaneous valuation analysis that allocated the equity value of the Company to the various classes of its then-outstanding securities. The Company accounted for the $3.1 million
premium as additional consideration under the agreement and recognized the premium as revenue on a straight-line basis over the performance period. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For

evidence and third party evidence were not available. The Company then allocated the total arrangement consideration, which included the remaining deferred revenue balance at the modification date and other consideration that was deemed to be
determinable at the modification date, to each unit of accounting based on its best estimate of selling price. The difference between the total arrangement consideration and the best estimate of selling price of the undelivered items was recorded as

December&nbsp;31, 2015, the Company paid annual maintenance payments totaling $53,000 to certain of the licensors, which are recorded as research and development expense. The Company has the option to renew these licenses on an annual basis in

If the development candidate is derived from a new chemical class created by the service provider, the milestone will be two times the discounted upfront labor costs. If the development candidate is not derived from a new chemical class created by
the service provider, the milestone will be equal to the discount on services provided to date. No milestone payment is due if no development candidate is declared within the five year period. In addition, should no development candidate be declared
within three years and the Company remains active with the program, the service provider may, at its discretion, elect to request reimbursement of the discount on services provided to date and forgo the milestone payment. The election must be
provided in writing within thirty days of the end of the three-year period. The accumulated discounted labor costs through December&nbsp;31, 2015 are approximately $2.1 million. The Company has not accrued for the accumulated discount under the
reimbursement option as the Company is currently unable to determine the probability of a development candidate being declared within a three-year period. </P>

increase, to be added on the first day of each fiscal year, beginning with the fiscal year ending December&nbsp;31, 2014 and continuing until the expiration of the 2013 Plan, equal to the lesser of (i)&nbsp;2,000,000 shares of common stock,
(ii)&nbsp;4% of the outstanding shares of common stock on such date or (iii)&nbsp;an amount determined by the Company&#146;s Board of Directors. On January&nbsp;1, 2016 and 2015, the annual increase for the 2013 Plan resulted in an additional

performance-based and service-based vesting criteria were granted by the Company. However, certain performance-based stock options issued in prior periods were still outstanding as of December&nbsp;31, 2015. Performance-based vesting criteria for
options primarily relate to milestone events specific to the Company&#146;s corporate goals, including but not limited to certain preclinical and clinical development milestones related to the Company&#146;s product candidates. Stock-based
compensation expense associated with these performance-based stock options is recognized if the performance condition is considered probable of achievement using management&#146;s best estimates. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, certain of the
performance-based milestones had been achieved. The achievements of certain other milestones have been deemed probable and therefore the related expense either has been fully recognized or is being recognized over the remaining service period. The
achievement of the remaining milestones was deemed to be not probable as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and, therefore, no expense has been recognized related to these awards. During the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, the Company
recognized stock-based compensation expense of $0.4&nbsp;million, $0.9 million, and $0.9 million, respectively, related to stock options with performance-based vesting criteria. </P>

December&nbsp;31, 2015, pursuant to the 2013 Plan, the Company granted 100,270 performance stock units (&#147;PSUs&#148;) to certain employees. Each PSU entitles the holder to receive, at the achievement of the performance-based and service-based
criteria, a specified number of shares of the Company&#146;s stock. Performance-based vesting criteria primarily relate to milestone events specific to the Company&#146;s corporate goals, specifically regulatory development milestones related to the
Company&#146;s product candidates. Stock-based compensation expense associated with these PSUs is recognized if the performance condition is considered probable of achievement using management&#146;s best estimates. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015,

committee appointed by the Company&#146;s Board of Directors. Under the 2013 ESPP, each offering period is six months, at the end of which employees may purchase shares of common stock through payroll deductions made over the term of the offering
period. The per-share purchase price at the end of each offering period is equal to 85% of the closing price of one share of the Company&#146;s common stock at the beginning or end of the offering period, whichever is lower, subject to Internal
Revenue Service limits. The Company issued 17,150 shares during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 under the 2013 ESPP. No shares were issued during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014. The 2013 ESPP provides participating employees with the
opportunity to purchase up to an aggregate of 327,272 shares of the Company&#146;s common stock. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company recorded $0.4 million and $0.1 million of

through July 2013, it alone does not have the relevant company-specific historical data to support its expected volatility. As such, the Company has used a weighted-average of expected volatility based on the volatilities of a representative group
of publicly traded biopharmaceutical companies, which also includes the Company. For purposes of identifying representative companies, the Company considered characteristics such as number of product candidates in earlier stages of product
development, area of therapeutic focus, length of trading history, companies&#146; stage of life cycle, size, and relevant financial metrics. The expected volatility has been determined using a weighted-average of the historical volatilities of the
representative group of companies for a period equal to the expected term of the option grant. The Company intends to continue to consistently apply this process using similar entities until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company uses the &#147;simplified method&#148; as prescribed by the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No.&nbsp;107,<I> Share
Based Payments</I>, to estimate the expected term of stock option grants. Under this approach, the weighted-average expected life is presumed to be the average of the contractual term (ten years) and the weighted-average vesting term of the
Company&#146;s stock options, taking into consideration multiple vesting tranches. The Company utilizes this method due to lack of historical exercise data and the plain-vanilla nature of the Company&#146;s share-based awards. </P>

estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The Company based its estimate of forfeitures on data from a representative group of publicly traded biopharmaceutical
companies, as the Company does not currently have sufficient history, and records the stock-based compensation expense only on the awards that are expected to vest. To date forfeitures have been less than 5.0% of total grants. </P>

approximately $10.6 million. If not utilized, the credits begin to expire at various dates through 2035. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Included in the carryforwards above, the Company
has federal and state net operating loss carry forward (NOLs) related to stock compensation in the amount of $72.3 million and $74.2 million, respectively that is not included in deferred tax assets. When the excess stock-based compensation related
to NOL carryover tax assets are realized, the benefit will be credited directly to stockholders&#146; equity. Utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards and credits may be subject to annual limitations as prescribed by federal and state
statutory provisions. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating loss carryforwards prior to its utilization. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Utilization of the
NOLs and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to ownership change limitations that have occurred previously or that could occur in the future, as provided by Section&nbsp;382 of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986 (&#147;Section 382&#148;), as well as similar state provisions. Ownership changes may limit the amount of NOLs and tax credit carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income and tax, respectively. In general, an
ownership change, as defined by Section&nbsp;382, results from transactions that increase the ownership of 5% shareholders in the stock of a corporation by more than 50 percent in the aggregate over a three-year period. During 2011, the Company
completed a study through December&nbsp;31, 2011, to determine whether any ownership change has occurred since the Company&#146;s formation and has determined that transactions have resulted in two ownership changes, as defined by Section&nbsp;382.
The impact of the ownership changes have been reflected in the Company&#146;s deferred tax assets in the table above. There could be additional ownership changes in the future that could further limit the amount of NOLs and tax credit carryforwards
that the Company can utilize. The Company will complete a full analysis of the tax attribute carryforwards prior to any utilization. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As required by ASC
740, management of the Company has evaluated the positive and negative evidence bearing upon the realizability of its deferred tax assets. During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2011, management determined that it was more likely than not that it
would realize a portion of its deferred tax assets because of the Company&#146;s ability to carryback future losses for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, the Company reversed approximately $10.7 million of the valuation allowance on its
deferred tax assets in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2011, representing the amount of deferred tax assets that will be realized in 2012 and 2013, the year available for carryback. The Company utilized certain of the deferred tax assets, including
net operating losses, generated in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013 to reduce its federal income taxes payable in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013 and 2012. For the remainder of the Company&#146;s deferred tax assets, management determined
that it is more likely than not that the Company may not realize the benefit and has recorded a valuation allowance of approximately $121.9 million and $69.4 million at December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The valuation allowance increased
by $52.5 million in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company applies the accounting guidance in ASC 740 related to accounting for uncertainty
in income taxes. The Company&#146;s reserves related to taxes are based on a determination of whether, and how much of, a tax benefit taken by the Company in its tax filings or positions is more likely than not to be realized following resolution of
any potential contingencies present related to the tax benefit. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, the Company had no unrecognized tax benefits. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax
expense. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company is subject to taxation in the United States and Switzerland. The statute of limitations for assessment by the Internal Revenue
