ITEM 1. BUSINESS
================================================================================

GENERAL

ALPHA PRO TECH, LTD. (the "Company") was incorporated in the State of Delaware
on July 1,1994 as a successor to a business that was organized in 1983. The
Company's executive offices are located at 60 Centurian Drive, Suite 112,
Markham Ontario, Canada L3R 9R2, and its telephone number is (905) 479-0654. The
Company's web site is located at www.alphaprotech.com. Information contained on
our web site is not part of this report.

BUSINESS

The Company develops, manufactures and markets disposable protective apparel and
consumer products for the cleanroom, industrial, medical, dental, food service
and consumer markets. The Company operates through three divisions: apparel;
mask and shield; and extended care. The Company's products are primarily sold
under the "Alpha Pro Tech" brand name, but are also sold for use under private
label.

The Company's products are classified into five groups: Disposable protective
apparel consisting of a complete line of shoecovers, headcovers, gowns,
coveralls and labcoats; infection control products consisting of a line of face
masks and face shields; extended care products consisting of a line of mattress
overlays, wheelchair covers, geriatric chair surfaces, operating room table
surfaces and pediatric surfaces; food industry apparel consisting of a line of
automated shoecovers, sleeve protectors, aprons, and face shields; and consumer
products consisting of a line of pet bedding and pet toys. The Company's
products as classified above are grouped into three segments. The Apparel
segment consisting of disposable protective apparel and food industry apparel;
the Mask/Shield segment consisting of infection control products; and the
Extended Care segment consisting of extended care products and consumer
products.

The Company's current strategy is to not only grow its cleanroom business
through its exclusive agreement with VWR Scientific Products, but to also focus
on its other core businesses which include medical, dental, industrial safety,
pet and food service. As part of its current strategy, emphasis is being placed
on developing innovative products and processes and sourcing raw materials and
finished goods globally which are expected to increase capacity and gross
margins.

                                       2
<Page>

The Company's products are used primarily in hospitals, clean rooms,
laboratories, industrial and dental offices and are distributed principally in
the United States through a network presently consisting of 2 purchasing groups,
9 major distributors, approximately 900 additional distributors, approximately
24 independent sales representatives and a Company sales and marketing force of

DISPOSABLE PROTECTIVE APPAREL

The Apparel division was established April 1, 1994. The products manufactured
include many different styles of shoecovers, headcovers, gowns, coveralls, lab
coats, and other miscellaneous products. These are manufactured in Mexico and
China.

MASKS AND FACE SHIELDS

The facemasks come in a wide variety of filtration efficiencies and styles. The
Company's patented Positive Facial Lock(R) feature provides a custom fit to the
face to prevent blow-by for better protection. Combine this feature with the
Magic Arch (R), that holds the mask away from the nose and mouth and creates a
breathing chamber, and you have a quality disposable facemask.

The term "blow-by" is used to describe the potential for infectious material
entering or escaping a facemask without going through the filter as a result of
gaps or openings in the face mask.

All of the face shields are made from an optical-grade polyester film, and have
a permanent anti-fog feature. This provides the wearer with extremely
lightweight, distortion-free protection that can be worn for hours and will not
fog up from humidity and/or perspiration. An important feature of all eye and
face shields is that they are disposable. This eliminates a chance of cross
infection between patients and saves hospitals the expense of sterilization
after every use.

EXTENDED CARE

The Extended Care Division began with the Company's Unreal Lambskin(R) pressure
sore and bed patient monitoring system product lines. The Unreal Lambskin (R) is
used to prevent decubitus ulcers or bedsores on long term care patients. The bed
patient monitoring system offers nurses an alarm system that can tell when
patients try to get out of bed. This helps nursing and other extended and long
term care facilities to comply with the Omnibus Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of
1987 mandate to work towards using no restraints to control residents or
patients in these facilities.

FOOD INDUSTRY

A patented automated shoecover machine in combination with a patented laminated
material has allowed the Company to develop a shoecover that is being used by
McDonald's Corporation through a Supply Agreement and is being tested by a
number of other restaurant chains. The balance of the food industry products are
manufactured by the apparel division.

CONSUMER PRODUCTS

The Consumer Product Division uses the Company's existing medical products and
technologies for general consumer purposes. The Unreal Lambskin (R) is being
packaged for the retail pet bed market and pet toys.

MARKETS

The Company's products are sold to the following markets: Infection Control
Products, (Masks and Shields) and disposable protective apparel are sold to the
Medical and Dental market and the Industrial and Cleanroom markets; Unreal
Lambskin and Medi-Pads are sold to the Extended Care market; Pet Bedding and Pet
Toys are sold to the Consumer market; and automated shoecovers are sold to the
Food Industry, Medical, Industrial and Cleanroom market. The Company has
expanded its marketing efforts for the Food Industry to include apparel, such as
sleeve protectors and aprons as well as shields.

                                       4

DISTRIBUTION

The Company relies for the sale of its products primarily on a network of
independent distributors which include the following:

*       VWR Scientific
*       Allegiance Healthcare
*       McKesson HBOC
*       Medline Industries
*       Blain Supply
*       Owens and Minor
*       Cameron & Barkley
*       Berkeley Medical Resources
*       Henry Schein, Inc.

These nine major United States distributors to the best of the Company's
knowledge, all sell competing products.

Sales to our largest customer represented 65.2% of total sales for 2001, 62.5%
for 2000, and 57.85% for 1999.

The Company's agreements with its largest distributor provides for exclusive
distribution rights with respect to eye and face shields, masks and disposable
apparel for sale to the Industrial/Cleanroom market place. In order to retain
such exclusivity, the distributor has agreed to purchase at least 95% of the
prior years distributor sales at cost. Since the beginning of its relationship
with such supplier, the minimum requirement has been met each year.

The loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on the Company's
business.

The Company does not generally have backlog orders, as orders are usually placed
for shipment and shipped within 30 days. The Company anticipates no problem in
fulfilling orders as they are placed.

MANUFACTURING

The Company's mask production facility is located in a 24,500 square foot
building at 903 West Center Street, Bldg. E, North Salt Lake, Utah.

A 25,000 square foot facility located at 615 North Parker Drive, Janesville,
Wisconsin is used to manufacture the Company's Extended Care products and
consumer products including a line of pet beds and pet toys.

The Company's disposable protective apparel production is located in three
facilities, a 50,000 sq. ft. facility located at 1287 Fairway Drive in Nogales,
Arizona which is used for cutting, warehousing and shipping and a 30,000 sq. ft.
facility located at Ave. Abolardo L. Rodriguez y Novena, Benjamin Hill, Sonora
Mexico, which is used for sewing. The lease on a third facility, a 19,500 square
foot facility at Kennedy Drive #6 in Sonora, Mexico, expires on June 30,
2002.This facility recently became vacant and is not being renewed due to an
emphasis on China manufactured goods.

In 2001 the Company began subcontracting the manufacturing of some of its goods
previously manufactured in Mexico to contractors in China. These goods are
manufactured pursuant to the Company's specifications and quality assurance
guidelines. Certain proprietary products are being made in China using material
supplied by the Company.

The Company has a material coating and automated shoecover facility of 36,000
square feet located at 2224 Cypress Street, Valdosta, Georgia.

                                       5
<Page>

The Company has multiple suppliers of the materials used to produce its
products. In that regard, the Company currently has no problems, and does not
anticipate any problems, with respect to the sources and availability of the
materials needed to produce its products. The business of the Company is not
subject to seasonal considerations. It is necessary for the Company to have
adequate finished inventory in stock, and the Company generally maintains a
two-to-three month supply of product.

COMPETITION

The Company faces substantial competition from numerous other companies,
including some companies with greater marketing and financial resources. The
Company's major competitor in the medical and dental markets is Kimberly Clark
of Fort Worth, Texas. Other large competitors would include Minnesota Mining and
Manufacturing Corporation (3M), Johnson & Johnson, White Knight/Precept,
Allegiance Health Care Corp., and Medline Industries Inc. The Company's major
competitors in the industrial and cleanroom market are Kimberly Clark, 3M,
Kappler USA, Dupont and Allegiance Health Care. In the extended care market,
Skil-care, Glenoit Mills and JT Posey Co. are the principal competitors, and in
the consumer products market, principal competitors include Flexmat Corporation
and Lazy Pet Company. The Company has entered the food service market with a new
type of product, and expects competition from companies who provide floor
treatment and manufacturers of safety boots such as Shoes For Crews and Traction
Plus. However, the Company believes that the quality of its products, along with
the price and service provided, will allow it to remain competitive in the
disposable apparel market.

Allegiance Health Care Corp. and Medline Industries Inc. are distributors of the
Company's products.

The Company is not required to obtain regulatory approval from the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration ("FDA") with respect to the sale of its products. The
Company's products are, however, subject to prescribed "good manufacturing
practices" as defined by the FDA and its manufacturing facilities are inspected
by the FDA every two years to assure compliance with such "good manufacturing
practices." The Company is marketing a Particulate Respirator that meets the new
O.S.H.A. respirator guidelines and which has been approved by the National
Institute for Safety and Health (NIOSH). This product is designed to help
prevent the breathing in of the tuberculosis virus.

The Company does not anticipate that any federal, state and local provisions
which have been or may be enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of
materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the
environment, will have any material effect upon the capital expenditures,
earnings or competitive position of its business.

PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS

PATENTS

The Company's policy is to protect its intellectual property rights, products,
designs and processes through the filing of patents in the United States and
where appropriate in Canada and other foreign countries. At present, the Company
has 14 United States patents relating to its MEDS, Add-A-Mask, Coverall, 1/2
Coverall, Combo Cone, Combo, Positive Facial Lock and Shieldmate products, a
U.S. patent on the automated shoecover and the shoecover process and a fluid
impervious and non-slip fabric for the Company's Aqua Trak shoecover. In
addition, the Company has a U.S. patent on a method to fold and put on sterile
garments. The Company believes that its patents may offer a competitive
advantage, but there can be no assurance that any patents, issued or in process,
will not be circumvented or invalidated. The Company also intends to rely on
trade secrets and proprietary know-how to maintain and develop its commercial
position.

The various United States patents issued have remaining durations of
approximately 5 to 15 years before expiration.

                                       6

TRADEMARKS

Many of the Company products are sold under various trademarks and trade names
including Alpha Pro Tech. The Company believes that many of its trademarks and
trade names have significant recognition in its principal markets and takes
customary steps to register or otherwise protect its rights in its trademarks
and trade names.

with the Confederation of Mexican Workers, exists for its Mexican employees.

ITEM 7.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
          CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

FISCAL 2001 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2000

Alpha Pro Tech, Ltd. ("Alpha" or the "Company") reported income before provision
for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2001 of $1,206,000 as compared
to $1,659,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000, representing a decrease of
$453,000 or 27.3%. The decrease is attributable primarily to an increase in
selling, general and administrative expenses of $647,000, and an increase in
depreciation and amortization of $71,000, partially offset by an increase in
gross profit of $194,000, due to higher sales and gross profit margin and a
decrease in other expenses of $71,000.

Alpha reported net income for the year ended December 31, 2001 of $786,000 as
compared to $1,460,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000, representing a
decrease of $674,000 or 46.2%. The decrease is attributable to a decrease in
income before provision for income taxes of $453,000 discussed above and an
increase in income taxes of $221,000. Fiscal 2001 was the fourth consecutive
year of profitability and management expects to remain profitable in 2002.

SALES Consolidated sales for the year ended December 31, 2001 increased to
$21,333,000 from $21,130,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000, representing
an increase of $203,000 or 1.0%. Consolidated sales for the eight months ended
August 31, 2001 were 10.8% ahead of the same period in 2000. The company
attributes the lower than normal sales for the last four months of 2001 to the
events of September 11th, which disrupted normal business and caused an economic
downturn in most industries. Orders booked in 2002 have returned to normal
levels and management expects increased sales in 2002, which would be the
seventh consecutive year.

Sales for the Apparel Division for the year ended December 31, 2001 were
$14,091,000 as compared to $13,507,000 for the same period of 2000. The Apparel
Division sales increase of $584,000 or 4.3% was due primarily to increased sales
to the Company's largest distributor. This distributor has reported record
annual sales for the sixth consecutive year to its customers of the Company's
products. Management expects the Company's sales to this distributor should
remain strong and continue to grow.

Mask and eye shield sales decreased by $152,000 or 2.8% to $5,209,000 in 2001
from $5,361,000 in 2000. The decrease is primarily the result of a decline in
industrial mask sales, partially offset by growth in medical mask and medical
shield sales and dental mask sales.

Sales from the Company's Extended Care and other related products, which
includes a line of pet beds, decreased by $229,000 or 10.1% to $2,033,000 for
the year ended December 31, 2001 from $2,262,000 for the year ended December 31,
2000. The decrease in sales of $229,000 is primarily the result of a decrease in
sales of consumer fleece products including pet beds and a decrease in medical
fleece product sales.

                                       10

The Medical market, which includes a line of face masks, eye shield and fleece
bed pads, increased by $154,000, or 4.8% year to date, to $3,333,000 for the
year ended December 31, 2001 as compared to $3,179,000 for the year ended
December 31, 2000. Medical face masks and eye shield sales increased during
2001, but fleece bed pads sales decreased. Medical mask and eye shield sales
should improve over the next twelve months.

Dental market sales increased by approximately $57,000 or 3.7%, to $1,593,000
for the year ended December 31, 2001 as compared to $1,536,000 for the same
period in 2000. In 2001 the Company hired a Dental sales specialist and the
results of his efforts are expected to improve the Company's dental market
revenue in 2002.

Sales in the Pet Supply market, in which the Company markets a line of pet beds
decreased $34,000 or 3.5%, to $941,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001,
compared to $975,000 for same period in 2000.

In the Food Service market, sales for the year ended December 31, 2001 were
$231,000 compared to $175,000 in the same period of 2000, an increase of $56,000
or 32.0%. The Company continues to work with its existing customers, and in
January 2002, announced a new distribution agreement with a food service
distributor to sell and distribute Alpha Pro Tech's line of personal safety
products starting February 2002. The Company has also introduced new products to
its major customer that continue to generate positive feedback. Management is
confident that increased exposure and new product launches to the Food Service
sector will result in added revenues over the next twelve months.

Management believes that the Company is positioned to grow revenue in its
markets of Industrial Safety, Clean Room, Medical, Dental and Food Service in
fiscal 2002.

COST OF GOODS SOLD Cost of goods sold, excluding depreciation and amortization,
increased to $12,247,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $12,238,000
for the same period in 2000. As a percentage of net sales, cost of goods sold
decreased to 57.4% in 2001 from 57.9% in 2000. Gross profit margin increased to
42.6% for the year ended December 31, 2001 from 42.1% for the same period in
2000.

Gross profit margin in 2001 was negatively affected by severance payouts of
approximately $80,000 to 86 employees on the closing of one facility in Mexico
and a reduction of employees in a second facility in Mexico. The Company decided
in the first half of 2001 to downsize its operations in Mexico in order to shift
some of its manufacturing to China. Excluding the severance payouts, gross
margin would have increased to 43.0% for the year ended December 31, 2001 from
42.1% for the same period in 2000.

Management expects gross profit margin to continue to improve over the next
twelve months due to an increased emphasis on products being manufactured in
China.

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Selling, general and administrative
expenses increased by $647,000 or 9.5% to $7,481,000 for the year ended December
31, 2001 from $6,834,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000. As a percentage
of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 35.1% in
the year ended December 31, 2001 from

                                       11
<Page>

32.3% for the same period in 2000. The increase in selling, general and
administrative expenses primarily consists of increased payroll related costs of
$350,000; increased travel and commission expenses of $73,000; increased rent
and utilities of $78,000, and increased insurance and general office expenses of
$72,000.

Management expects selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage
of net sales to decrease as sales increase in 2002.

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION Depreciation and amortization expense increased by
$71,000 to $476,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $405,000 for the
same period in 2000. The increase is primarily attributable to the acquisition
of a new extrusion coating machine and new mask machines.

INCOME FROM OPERATIONS Income from operations decreased by $524,000 or 31.7%, to
$1,129,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001 as compared to income from
operations of $1,653,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000. The decrease in
income from operations is due to an increase in selling, general and
administrative expenses of $647,000, an increase in depreciation and
amortization of $71,000, partially offset by an increase in gross profit of
$194,000.

Income from operations for 2001 was adversely affected by two events. The first
being total severance payouts and other costs of approximately $134,000 on the
closing of one facility in Mexico and a reduction of employees in a second
Mexican facility for a total reduction of 144 employees. The Company decided in
the first half of 2001 to downsize its Mexican operations in order to shift some
of its manufacturing to China. The second event was September 11th, which
significantly affected sales for the last four months of the year. Consolidated
sales for the eight months ended August 31, 2001 were 10.8% ahead of the same
period in 2000. The company attributes the lower than normal sales for the last
four months of 2001 to the events of September 11th, which disrupted normal
business and caused an economic downturn in most all industries.

NET INTEREST Net interest expense increased by $27,000 to $21,000 for the year
ended December 31, 2001 from net interest income of $6,000 for the year ended
December 31, 2000. Interest expense increased by $3,000 to $14,000 for the year
ended December 31, 2001 from $11,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000. The
increase in net interest expense is due to higher borrowings, decreased interest
income, partially offset by lower interest rates, and a decreased number of
outstanding capital leases. Interest income decreased by $25,000, to $36,000 for
the year ended December 31, 2001 from $61,000 in the same period of 2000 due to
an overall decrease in interest rates.

INCOME BEFORE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES Income before provision for income
taxes for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $1,206,000 as compared to
$1,659,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000, representing a decrease of
$453,000 or 27.3%. The net decrease of $453,000 for the year ended December 31,
2001, compared to the same period in 2000 is attributable primarily, to an
increase in selling, general and administrative expenses of $647,000 and an
increase in depreciation and amortization of $71,000, partially offset by an
increase in gross profit of $194,000 and a decrease in other expenses of
$71,000.

                                       12

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES The provision for income taxes for the year ended
December 31, 2001 was $420,000, as compared to $199,000 for the year ended
December 31, 2000. The increase in income taxes is due to net operating losses
(NOL's) from prior years being utilized during three quarters of 2000. The
estimated tax rate is 34% in 2001.

NET INCOME Net income for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $786,000 compared
to net income of $1,460,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000, a decrease of
$674,000 or 46.2%. The net income decrease of $674,000 is comprised of a
decrease in income from operations of $524,000, of which $134,000 ($80,000 in
cost of goods sold and $54,000 in SG&A) relates to severance payouts on
downscaling Mexican facilities and moving manufacturing to China and an increase
in net interest expense of $27,000 and an increase in income taxes of $221,000,
partially offset by a decrease in other expenses of $98,000.

The chief executive officer and president are entitled to a combined bonus equal
to 10% of the pre-tax profits of the company. A bonus of $134,000 has been
accrued in 2001 as compared to $183,000 in 2000.

FISCAL 2000 COMPARED TO FISCAL 1999

Alpha Pro Tech, Ltd. reported income before provision for income taxes for the
year ended December 31, 2000 of $1,659,000 as compared to $1,147,000 for the
year ended December 31, 1999, representing an increase of $512,000 or 44.63%.
The increase is attributable primarily to higher sales and gross profit margin
of $907,000 and a decrease in net interest expense of $130,000, partially offset
by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses of $482,000 and
an increase in depreciation and amortization of $43,000.

Alpha reported net income for the year ended December 31, 2000 of $1,460,000 as
compared to net income of $1,129,000 for the year ended December 31, 1999,
representing an improvement of $331,000 or 29.3%. The increase is attributable
to an increase in income before provision for income taxes of $512,000 and
offset by an increase in income taxes of $181,000.

SALES Consolidated sales for the year ended December 31, 2000 increased to
$21,130,000 from $20,235,000 for the year ended December 31, 1999, representing
an increase of $895,000 or 4.4%.

Sales for the Apparel Division for the year ended December 31, 2000 were
$13,507,000 as compared to $12,883,000 for the same period of 1999. The Apparel
Division sales increase of $624,000 or 4.9% was due to increased sales to the
Company's largest distributor. This distributor has reported record annual sales
for the fifth consecutive year to its customers of the Company's products.

Mask and eye shield sales increased by $288,000 or 5.7% to $5,361,000 in 2000
from $5,073,000 in 1999. This increase is primarily the result of growth in
dental mask of 10.2%, growth in medical mask sales of 8.6%, partially offset by
a decline in industrial mask sales of 3.4%. The industrial mask sales decrease
is the result of a soft second quarter.

                                       13

Sales from the Company's Extended Care Unreal Lambskin(R) (and other related
products, which includes a line of pet beds), decreased by $17,000 or 0.8% to
$2,262,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000 from $2,279,000 for the year
ended December 31, 1999. The slight decrease in sales of $17,000 is primarily
the result of a decrease in medical fleece product sales partially offset by an
increase in pet bed sales.

The Medical market, which includes a line of face masks and fleece bed pads,
were down by $462,000 or 12.7% for the year ended December 31, 2000, compared to
the same period in 1999. Fleece bed pads sales decreased and medical face masks
sales increased during the year ended December 31, 2000.

Dental market sales increased by approximately $143,000 or 10.2% for the year
ended December 31, 2000 as compared to the same period in 1999. The Company is
working with national dental distributors to increase the Company's share of the
Dental market.

Sales in the Pet supply market, in which the Company markets a line of pet beds,
were up $130,000 or 13.3% for the year ended December 31, 2000 as compared to
the same period in 1999.

In the Food Service market, sales for the year ended December 31, 2000 were
$175,000 compared to $56,000 in the same period of 1999, an increase of $119,000
or 212.5%.

COST OF GOODS SOLD Cost of goods sold increased to $12,238,000 for the year
ended December 31, 2000 from $12,250,000 for the same period in 1999. As a
percentage of net sales, cost of goods sold decreased to 57.9% in 2000 from
60.5% in 1999. Gross profit margin increased to 42.1% for the year ended
December 31, 2000 from 39.5% for the same period in 1999.

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Selling, general and administrative
expenses increased by $482,000 or 7.6%, to $6,834,000 for the year ended
December 31, 2000, from $6,352,000 for the year ended December 31, 1999. As a
percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses increased
to 32.3% in the year ended December 31, 2000 from 31.4% in the same period of
1999. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses primarily
consists of increased payroll related costs of $392,000; increased public
company expenses of $50,000, including investor relations, stock exchange
listing fees, options/warrants issued for services, annual report and annual
meeting costs, stock transfer costs and costs associated with SEC reporting
requirements; and increased marketing, commissions and travel expenses of
$256,000. This was partially offset by decreased office, telephone, factory,
insurance and general expenses of $154,000, decreased professional fees of
$40,000 and decreased rent of $22,000.

DEPRECIATION & AMORTIZATION Depreciation and amortization expense increased by
$43,000 to $405,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000 from $362,000 for the
same period in 1999. The increase is primarily attributable to increased
depreciation on the automated shoecover machines and the introduction of new
mask machines.

                                       14
<Page>

INCOME FROM OPERATIONS Income from operations increased by $382,000 or 30.1%, to
$1,653,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000 as compared to income from
operations of $1,271,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase in
income from operations is due to an increase in gross profit of $907,000,
partially offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses
of $482,000 and an increase in depreciation and amortization of $43,000.

NET INTEREST Net interest expense decreased by $130,000 or 104.8% to net
interest income of $6,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000 from net interest
expenses of $124,000 for the year ended December 31, 1999. The decrease in net
interest expense is due to lower borrowings, lower interest rate, decreased
interest on capital leases and increased interest income. Interest income
increased by $22,000, to $61,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000 from
$39,000 in the same period of 1999. In 2000, the Company re-negotiated its
credit facility from an asset-based loan to a traditionally based line of
credit. The Company has a $4,041,000 credit facility with the bank, consisting
of a line of credit of up to $3,500,000, a term note of $225,000 and a equipment
loan of $316,000, with interest at prime plus 1.0% on the credit line, prime
plus 1.0% on the term loan and a 10.25% fixed rate on the equipment loan. The
line of credit expires in May 2003, the term note expires in April 2003 and the
equipment loan expires in November 2005.

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES Provision for income taxes increased by $181,000 or
1,005.6% to $199,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000 from $18,000 for the
year ended December 31, 1999. The increase in income tax is due to net operating
losses (NOL's) from prior years being utilized during all of 1999 and only
through three quarter in 2000.

NET INCOME Net income for the year ended December 31, 2000 was $1,460,000
compared to net income of $1,129,000 for the year ended December 31, 1999, an
improvement of $331,000 or 29.3%. The net income increase of $331,000 is
comprised of an increase in income from operations of $382,000, a decrease in
interest expense of $130,000, partially offset by an increase in income taxes of
$181,000.

The chief executive officer and president are entitled to a combined bonus equal
to 10% of the pre-tax profits of the company. A bonus of $183,000 has been
accrued in 2000 as compared to $125,000 in 1999.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

As of December 31, 2001, the Company had cash of $1,372,000 and working capital
of $6,445,000. During the year ended December 31, 2001, cash increased by
$241,000 and accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased by $136,000. The
increase in the Company's cash is primarily due to a decrease in accounts
receivable, income from operations, and net proceeds from notes payable,
partially offset by to a significant increase in inventories, the purchase of
property and equipment and the repurchase of common stock. The Company has a
$4,301,000 credit facility with a bank, consisting of a line of credit of up to
$3,500,000, a term note of $225,000 and equipment loans of $576,000, with
interest at prime plus 0.5% on the credit line, prime plus 1.0% on the term loan
and an 8.5% fixed rate on the equipment loans. At December 31, 2001, the prime
interest rate was 4.75%. The line of credit expires in May 2003, the term note
expires in April 2003 and the equipment loans expire between December 2005, and
September 2006. At December 31, 2001, the Company's unused line of credit is
$2,266,000.

Net cash provided from operations was $1,305,000 for the year ended December 31,
2001 compared to $2,091,000 for the same period of 2000. The Company's
generation of cash from operations of $1,305,000 for the year ended December 31,
2001 is down primarily due to a decrease in net income, an increase in
inventory, an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets partially offset by
a decrease in accounts receivable.

The Company's investing activities have consisted primarily of expenditures for
property and equipment of $1,143,000 increases in intangible assets of $15,000
partially offset by proceeds of $113,000 on the sale of fixed assets, for a
total of $1,045,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to $896,000
for the year ended December 31, 2000.

The Company expects to purchase $200,000 in 2002 for additional equipment. The
Company intends to lease equipment whenever possible.

During the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company's cash used in financing
activities resulted primarily from the buy-back of 471,700 of Company's common
shares at a cost of $506,000 and payments on capital leases of $32,000,
partially offset by a net increase in the Company's loans payable of $461,000
and the exercise of options to purchase 76,000 shares of the Company's common
stock for which the Company received $58,000. The Company announced in December
1999 that the Board of Directors approved the buy-back of up to $500,000 of its
outstanding common stock. In January 2001, the Company announced that its Board
of Directors had approved the buy-back of an additional $500,000 of the
Company's outstanding common stock. As of December 31, 2001, the Company has
bought back 877,900 common shares at a cost of $1,036,000.

The Company believes that cash generated from operations, its current cash
balance, and the funds available under its credit facility, will be sufficient
to satisfy the Company's projected working capital and planned capital
expenditures for the foreseeable future.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS") No. 141, "Business Combinations",
which is effective for all business combinations for which the date of
acquisition is after June 30, 2001. SFAS No. 141 also establishes specific
criteria for the recognition of intangible assets. The Company will adopt SFAS
No. 141 for acquisitions completed after June 30, 2001 in preparing its
financial statements. The Company did not make any acquisitions in 2001.

In June 2001, the FASB issued No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets",
which is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2002 and interim periods within those fiscal years. SFAS No.
142 primarily addresses the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets
subsequent to their acquisition. The Company does not believe that the adoption
of SFAS No. 142 will have significant effect on the earnings and financial
position of the Company.

In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations", which is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal
years beginning after June 15, 2002 and interim periods within those fiscal
years. SFAS No. 143 addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations
associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated
asset retirement costs. It applies to legal obligations associated with the
retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction,
development, and (or) the normal operation of a long-lived asset, except for
certain obligations of lessees. The Company has evaluated this new pronouncement
and has determined that it will not have any effect on its financial position
and results of operations.

In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment of
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets", which is effective for financial statements
issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001 and interim periods
within those fiscal years. SFAS No. 144 addresses financial accounting and
reporting for the disposal of long-lived assets. The Company is currently
evaluating the potential impact, if any, the adoption of SFAS No. 144 will have
on its financial position and results of operations.

ITEM 7a.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET
            RISK

We manufacture some products in Mexico and subcontract the manufacture of some
products in China. The Company's results of operations could be negatively
effected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates due to
stronger economic conditions in those countries.

The Company doesn't expect any significant effect on its results of operations
from inflationary or interest and currency rate fluctuations.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying

results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in

generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion,
the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index presents
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in
conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial
statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
Company's management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these

conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards
generally accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a

statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

1.   THE COMPANY

     Alpha Pro Tech, Ltd. (the Company) manufactures and distributes a variety
     of disposable mask, shield, shoecover and apparel products and woundcare
     (fleece) products. Most of the Company's disposable apparel, mask and
     shield products and woundcare products are distributed to medical, dental,
     industrial and clean room markets, predominantly in the United States of
     America.

2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
     The consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts
     of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Alpha Pro Tech, Inc. (APT),
     as well as APT's wholly-owned subsidiary, DPI De Mexico (DPI). All
     significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

     INVENTORIES
     Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined
     using the first-in, first-out method. Provision is made for slow-moving,
     obsolete or unusable inventory.

     PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
     Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and
     amortization and is depreciated and amortized using the straight-line
     method over the shorter of the respective useful lives of the assets or the
     related lease terms as follows:

     Factory equipment                  9-20 years
     Office furniture and equipment     5-7 years
     Leasehold improvements             4-6 years
     Vehicles                           5 years

     Expenditures for renewals and betterments are capitalized whereas costs of
     maintenance and repairs are charged to operations in the period incurred.

     INTANGIBLE ASSETS
     The excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of assets
     acquired and liabilities assumed has been recorded as goodwill and is being
     amortized using the straight-line method over 8 years. Patent rights and
     trademarks are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight-line
     method over their estimated useful lives of 8-17 years.

     LONG-LIVED ASSETS
     Impairment of long-lived assets is determined in accordance with Statement
     of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121 (SFAS 121), "Accounting for the
     Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and of Long- Lived Assets to be Disposed
     Of." SFAS 121 requires that long-lived assets and certain identifiable
     intangible assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
     circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be
     recoverable.

     STOCK OPTIONS ISSUED FOR SERVICES
     Options to purchase common stock and warrants to purchase common stock that
     are granted to nonemployees in exchange for services are valued at their
     estimated fair value at the measurement date and are expensed over the
     period the services are rendered. Effective January 1, 2000, the Company's
     policy is to no longer grant stock options and warrants to nonemployees.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     REVENUE RECOGNITION
     Sales are recognized when goods are shipped to customers, upon which time
     title and risk of loss passes. Sales are reduced for anticipated sales
     returns and allowances.

     STOCK BASED COMPENSATION
     As allowed by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (SFAS
     123), "Accounting for Stock-based Compensation," which recommends, but does
     not require, a method based on the fair value of equity instruments awarded
     to employees to account for stock-based compensation, the Company applies
     the intrinsic value method prescribed by APB Opinion No. 25, "Accounting
     for Stock Issued to Employees" to account for its stock-based compensation.
     The Company also provides pro forma disclosure in the notes to the
     financial statements of the differences between the fair value method and
     the intrinsic value method as required by SFAS 123 (Note 8).

     INCOME TAXES
     The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with Statement of
     Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 (SFAS 109), "Accounting for Income
     Taxes." This statement requires an asset and liability approach for
     accounting for income taxes. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce
     the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets unless it is more likely than
     not such assets will be realized (Note 9).

     NET INCOME PER SHARE
     The following table provides a reconciliation of both the net income and
     the number of shares used in the computations of "basic" earnings per share
     ("EPS"), which utilizes the weighted average number of shares outstanding
     without regard to potential shares, and "diluted" EPS, which includes all
     such shares.

     TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES
     The Company has adopted the United States dollar as its functional
     currency. Transactions in foreign currencies during the reporting periods
     are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate prevailing
     at the transaction date. Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign
     currencies at each period end are translated at the exchange rate in effect
     at that date and are immaterial in amount. Transaction gains or losses on
     foreign exchange are reflected in net income for the periods presented and
     are not significant in amount.

     RECLASSIFICATIONS
     Certain 2000 and 1999 balances have been reclassified to conform to the
     current year's presentation.

     USE OF ESTIMATES
     The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity
     with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
     America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
     the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
     assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements
     and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
     period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

     FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
     The fair value of financial instruments including cash, accounts
     receivable, notes receivable, accounts payable and notes payable
     approximate their respective book values at December 31, 2001 and 2000.

     NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
     In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
     Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. ("SFAS") 141, BUSINESS
     COMBINATIONS. SFAS 141 requires that the purchase method of accounting be
     used for all business combinations for which the date of acquisition is
     after June 30, 2001. SFAS 141 also establishes specific criteria for the
     recognition of intangible assets. The Company will adopt SFAS 141 for
     acquisitions completed after June 30, 2001 in preparing its financial
     statements.

     In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 142, GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE
     ASSETS. SFAS 142 primarily addresses the accounting for goodwill and
     intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition. SFAS 142 is effective
     for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. The Company will adopt
     SFAS 142 as of January 1, 2002 and has determined that the adoption of SFAS
     No. 142 will not have a significant effect on the earnings and financial
     position of the Company. As of December 31, 2001, the Company had
     unamortized goodwill of $55,000.

     In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, ACCOUNTING FOR ASSET RETIREMENT
     OBLIGATIONS, which addresses financial accounting and reporting for
     obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets
     and the associated asset retirement costs. The Company has evaluated this
     new pronouncement and has determined that it will not have any effect on
     its financial position and results of operations.

     In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, ACCOUNTING FOR THE IMPAIRMENT
     OF DISPOSAL OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS, which addresses financial accounting and
     reporting for the disposal of long-lived assets. The Company is currently
     evaluating the potential impact, if any, the adoption of SFAS No. 144 will
     have on its financial position and results of operations.

     Sales by region are based on the countries in which the customers are
     located. The Company did not generate sales from any single foreign country
     that was significant to the Company's consolidated sales.

12.  MAJOR CUSTOMER AND CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK

     The Company sells significant amounts of product to a large distributor on
     credit terms. Net sales to this distributor were 65.2%, 62.5% and 57.8% of
     total net revenue for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Trade receivables
     from this distributor were 54.5% and 67.9% of total trade receivables for
     2001 and 2000, respectively. Management believes that adequate provision
     has been made for risk of loss on all credit transactions.


13.  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

     Included in the notes receivable and other assets balance at December 31,
     2001 and 2000 are notes receivable of $55,000 and $36,000, respectively
     from officers of the Company.
