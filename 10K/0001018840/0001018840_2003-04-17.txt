                                     PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

GENERAL.

Abercrombie & Fitch Co., a Delaware corporation ("A&F"), through its
subsidiaries (collectively, A&F and its subsidiaries are referred to as
"Abercrombie & Fitch" or the "Company"), is a specialty retailer which operates
stores selling casual apparel, personal care and other accessories for men,
women and kids under the Abercrombie & Fitch, abercrombie and Hollister Co.
brands. As of February 1, 2003, the Company operated 597 stores in the United
States.

A&F's Internet Web site is www.abercrombie.com (this uniform resource locator,
or URL, is an inactive textual reference only and is not intended to incorporate
A&F's Web site into this Annual Report on Form 10-K). Since November 15, 2002,
A&F has made available free of charge, on its Web site, its annual report on
Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and
amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or
15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as soon as reasonably practicable
after A&F electronically files such material with, or furnishes it to, the
Securities and Exchange Commission.

DESCRIPTION OF OPERATIONS.

General.

The Abercrombie & Fitch brand was established in 1892 and became well known as a
supplier of rugged, high-quality outdoor gear. Famous for outfitting the safaris
of Teddy Roosevelt and Ernest Hemingway and the expeditions of Admiral Byrd to
the North and South Poles, Abercrombie & Fitch goods were renowned for their
durability and dependability - and Abercrombie & Fitch placed a premium on
complete customer satisfaction with each item sold. In 1992, a new management
team began repositioning Abercrombie & Fitch as a more fashion-oriented casual
apparel business directed at men and women with a youthful lifestyle, targeted
at 18 to 22-year-old college students. In reestablishing the Abercrombie & Fitch
brand, the Company combined its historical image for quality with a new emphasis
on casual American style and youthfulness.

In 1997, the Company introduced the A&F Quarterly (a catalogue/magazine), which
is a lifestyle magazine focused on the college experience, and subsequently
added a catalogue format. The Company launched a web-based store featuring
lifestyle pieces, such as AFTV, located at its Internet Web site,
www.abercrombie.com, in 1998. Products comparable to those carried at
Abercrombie & Fitch stores can be purchased through the Quarterly, the
catalogue, and on its Web site.

The Company launched abercrombie, which targets 7 to 14-year-old boys and girls,
in 1998. These stores offer fashion-oriented casual apparel in the tradition of
Abercrombie & Fitch style and quality. A lifestyle web-based store located at
www.abercrombiekids.com (this uniform resource locator, or URL, is an inactive
textual reference only and is not intended to incorporate the Web site into this
Annual Report on Form 10-K) was introduced in 2000, where products comparable to
those carried at abercrombie can be purchased on-line.

The Hollister Co. brand was launched in 2000. Hollister Co. is a West Coast
oriented lifestyle brand targeted at 14 to 17-year-old high school guys and
girls, at lower price points than Abercrombie & Fitch. Hollister Co. has
established a lifestyle Internet Web site at www.hollisterco.com (this uniform
resource locator, or URL, is an inactive textual reference only and is not
intended to incorporate the Web site into this Annual Report on Form



                                       2

10-K) but, as yet, no merchandise is available through the Web site. Merchandise
is planned to be available by July 2003.

At the end of fiscal year 2002, the Company operated 597 stores. The following
table shows the changes in the number of retail stores operated by the Company
for the past five fiscal years:

</TABLE>

Financial Information about Segments.

In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 131,
"Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information," the
Company determined its operating segments on the same basis that is used
internally to evaluate performance and allocate resources. The operating
segments identified by the Company, Abercrombie & Fitch, abercrombie and
Hollister Co., have been aggregated and are reported as one reportable segment.
The Company aggregates the operating segments because they meet the aggregation
criteria set forth in SFAS No. 131. Operating segments may be aggregated if they
are similar in each of the following areas: economic characteristics, nature of
products, nature of production processes, distribution method and nature of
regulatory environment.

Further information on the reportable segment and operating segments of the
Company may be found in ITEM 7-Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Suppliers.

During fiscal year 2002, the Company purchased merchandise from approximately
186 suppliers and factories located throughout the world. In fiscal year 2002,
the Company sourced approximately 9% of its apparel through Koos Manufacturing,
8% through Direct Source Industries and 6% through Wooliston Garment, Inc. In
addition to purchases from Koos Manufacturing, Direct Source Industries and
Wooliston Garment, Inc., the Company purchased merchandise directly in foreign
markets with other vendors. Additional merchandise was purchased in the domestic
market, some of which is manufactured overseas. Excluding purchases from Koos
Manufacturing, Direct Source Industries and Wooliston Garment, Inc., no more
than 5% of the merchandise purchased by the Company originated from any single
manufacturer. The Company pursues a global sourcing strategy that includes
relationships with vendors in over 40 countries. Any event causing a sudden
disruption in these sourcing operations, either political or financial, could
have an adverse effect on the Company's operations. Substantially all of the
Company's foreign purchases of merchandise are negotiated and paid for in U.S.
dollars.



                                       3
<PAGE>


Distribution and Merchandise Inventory.

Most of the merchandise and related materials for the Company's stores are
shipped to its distribution center in New Albany, Ohio where the merchandise is
received and inspected. Merchandise and related materials are distributed to the
Company's stores using contract carriers.

The Company's policy is to maintain sufficient quantities of inventory on hand
in its retail stores and distribution center so that it can offer customers a
full selection of current merchandise. The Company emphasizes rapid turnover and
takes markdowns where required to keep merchandise fresh and current with
fashion trends.

Seasonal Business.

The Company views the retail apparel market as having two principal selling
seasons, Spring and Fall. As is generally the case in the apparel industry, the
Company experiences its peak sales activity during the Fall season. This
seasonal sales pattern results in increased inventory during the back-to-school
and Christmas selling periods. During fiscal year 2002, the highest inventory
level approximated $221.5 million at the November 2002 month-end and the lowest
inventory level approximated $132.2 million at the February 2002 month-end.

Store Operations and Expansion.

The Company's stores and point-of-sale marketing are designed to convey the
principal elements and personality of each brand. The store design, furniture,
fixtures and music are all carefully planned and coordinated to create a
shopping experience that is consistent with the Abercrombie & Fitch, abercrombie
or Hollister lifestyle.

The Company's sales associates, or brand representatives, are a central element
in creating the entertaining, yet comfortable, atmosphere of the stores. In
addition to providing a high level of customer service, the brand
representatives reflect the casual, energetic attitude of the brand and culture.

The Company maintains a uniform appearance throughout its store base, for each
concept, in terms of merchandise display and location on the selling floor.
Store managers receive detailed store plans that dictate fixture and merchandise
placement to ensure uniform execution of the merchandising strategy at the store
level. Standardization, by concept, of store design and merchandise presentation
also creates a cost savings in store furnishings, maximizes usage and
productivity of selling space and allows the Company to efficiently open new
stores.

Trademarks.

The Abercrombie & Fitch, abercrombie and Hollister Co. trademarks, and certain
other trademarks, either have been registered or are the subject of pending
trademark applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and
with registries of many foreign countries. The Company believes that its
products are identified by its trademarks and, thus, its trademarks are of
significant value. Each registered trademark has a duration of 20 years and is
subject to an indefinite number of renewals for a like period upon appropriate
application. The Company intends to continue the use of each of its trademarks
and to renew each of its registered trademarks.

Other Information.

Additional information about the Company's business, including its revenues and
profits for the last three years, plus gross square footage is set forth under
the caption ITEM 7-Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

COMPETITION.

The sale of apparel and personal care products through retail stores, catalogues
and e-commerce is a highly competitive business with numerous competitors,
including individual and chain fashion specialty stores and department stores.
Fashion, price, service, store location, selection and quality are the principal
competitive factors in retail store sales and on-line sales.

The Company is unable to estimate the number of competitors or its relative
competitive position due to the large number of companies selling apparel and
personal care products through retail stores, catalogues and e-commerce.

ASSOCIATE RELATIONS.

On March 28, 2003, the Company employed approximately 22,000 associates (none of
whom were party to a collective bargaining agreement), approximately 18,700 of
whom were part-time. In addition, temporary associates are hired during peak
periods, such as the Holiday season.

The Company believes its relationship with associates is good.

ITEM 2.       PROPERTIES.

The Company's headquarters and support functions (consisting of office,
distribution and shipping facilities) are located in New Albany, Ohio and owned
by the Company.

All of the retail stores operated by the Company are located in leased
facilities, primarily in shopping centers throughout the continental United
States. The leases expire at various dates principally between 2003 and 2015.

Typically, when space is leased for a retail store in a shopping center, all
improvements, including interior walls, floors, ceilings, fixtures and
decorations, are supplied by the tenant. In certain cases, the landlord of the
property may provide a construction allowance to fund all or a portion of the
cost of improvements. The cost of improvements varies widely, depending on the
size and location of the store. Rental terms for new locations usually include a
fixed minimum rent plus a percentage of sales in excess of a specified amount.
Certain operating costs such as common area maintenance, utilities, insurance
and taxes are typically paid by the tenant.

As of February 1, 2003, the Company's 597 stores were located in 48 states and
the District of Columbia as follows:

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

The Company is a defendant in lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of
business.

On January 13, 1999, a complaint was filed against many national retailers in
the United States District Court for the Central District of California. The
complaint (1) purported to be filed on behalf of a class of unnamed garment
workers, (2) related to labor practices allegedly employed on the island of
Saipan, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, by apparel manufacturers
unrelated to the Company, some of which have sold goods to the Company, and (3)
sought injunctive, unspecified monetary and other relief. On September 29, 1999,
the action was transferred to the United States District Court for the District
of Hawaii. Thereafter, the plaintiffs moved for leave to amend their complaint
to add A&F and others as additional defendants. That motion was granted and, on
April 28, 2000, an amended complaint was filed which added A&F and others as
defendants, but did not otherwise substantively alter either the claims alleged
or the relief sought by the plaintiffs. A&F joined with other retailer
defendants in moving to dismiss the amended complaint. Certain of the other
defendants also moved to transfer the action to Saipan. On June 23, 2000, the
District Court of Hawaii ordered the case to be transferred to the United States
District Court for the District of the Northern Mariana Islands. Plaintiffs
filed a Petition for Writ of Mandamus challenging the transfer and on March 22,
2001, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued an order denying the Petition
for Writ of Mandamus, thus allowing the case to be transferred to the United
States District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands. The defendants' motion
to dismiss the first amended complaint for failure to state a claim upon which
relief can be granted was denied in part and granted in part on November 26,
2001. As to the partial granting of the motion, the Court also granted the
plaintiffs leave to amend to cure any pleading defects in a second amended
complaint. Plaintiffs filed their motion for class certification on December 13,
2001 and their second amended complaint, which added neither new parties nor
claims but realleged claims previously dismissed, on December 17, 2001. The
motion for class certification was heard on February 14, 2002. The motion for
preliminary approval of settlement as to certain other retailer defendants was
also heard the same date. A motion to dismiss the second amended complaint was
heard on March 19, 2002. On May 10, 2002, the Court granted in part and denied
in part the motion to dismiss the second amended complaint as to the remaining
RICO claim and granted the motion to dismiss the second amended complaint as to
the Common Law Peonage claim, the Anti-Peonage statutory claim, and the Alien
Tort Claims Act claim. Plaintiffs were given leave to file a third amended
complaint. The motions for class certification and preliminary approval of
settlement as to certain other retailer defendants were also granted. A third
amended complaint was filed on July 25, 2002. This case was recently submitted
to the Court for approval of a settlement that includes A&F. The settlement does
not involve any admission of wrongdoing and involves no payment by A&F.
Conditional approval was granted on October 31,



                                       6

2002 and the fairness hearing was on March 22, 2003. There has been no ruling on
the fairness hearing as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

A&F is aware of 20 actions that have been filed against A&F and certain of its
officers and directors on behalf of a purported, but as yet uncertified, class
of shareholders who purchased A&F's Class A Common Stock between October 8, 1999
and October 13, 1999. These 20 actions have been filed in the United States
District Courts for the Southern District of New York and the Southern District
of Ohio, Eastern Division alleging violations of the federal securities laws and
seeking unspecified damages. On April 12, 2000, the Judicial Panel on
Multidistrict Litigation issued a Transfer Order transferring the 20 pending
actions to the Southern District of New York for consolidated pretrial
proceedings under the caption In re Abercrombie & Fitch Securities Litigation.
On November 16, 2000, the Court signed an Order appointing the Hicks Group, a
group of seven unrelated investors in A&F's securities, as lead plaintiff, and
appointing lead counsel in the consolidated action. On December 14, 2000,
plaintiffs filed a Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint (the "Amended
Complaint") in which they did not name as defendants Lazard Freres & Co. and
Todd Slater, who had formerly been named as defendants in certain of the 20
complaints. A&F and other defendants filed motions to dismiss the Amended
Complaint on February 14, 2001.

A&F is aware of three actions that have been filed where a purported class of
employees and former employees of the Company allege that the Company required
its associates to wear a "uniform" which in two of the three actions is
allegedly in violation of California law. These two complaints were served on
February 4, 2003 and February 10, 2003 in the Superior Courts of San Francisco
County and Los Angeles County, respectively. In the third action, which was
filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of
Pennsylvania on March 14, 2003, the "uniform," which when purchased, allegedly
drove associates' wages below the federal minimum wage. In each claim, the
plaintiff, on behalf of his or her class, seeks injunctive relief and economic,
liquidated damages in an unspecified amount.

A&F believes that the actions against it are without merit and intends to defend
vigorously against them. However, A&F does not believe it is feasible to predict
the outcome of these proceedings. The timing of the final resolution of these
proceedings is also uncertain.

In addition, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC")
initiated a formal investigation regarding trading in the securities of A&F and
the disclosure of sales forecasts in October 1999, and the Ohio Division of
Securities requested information from A&F regarding these same matters. A&F was
notified on April 3, 2003 that the SEC investigation has been terminated and no
enforcement action has been recommended.

A&F has not paid dividends on its shares of Class A Common Stock in the past and
does not presently plan to pay dividends on the shares. It is presently
anticipated that earnings will be retained and reinvested to support the growth
of the Company's business. The payment of any future dividends on shares will be
determined by the A&F Board of Directors in light of conditions then existing,
including earnings, financial condition and capital requirements, restrictions
in financing agreements, business conditions and other factors.

On March 27, 2003, there were approximately 5,000 shareholders of record.

purchase plan, associates who own shares through A&F-sponsored retirement plans
and others holding shares in broker accounts under street name, A&F estimates
the shareholder base at approximately 55,000.

NET SALES

Fourth Quarter 2002

Net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 were $534.5 million, up 15% over
2001's fourth quarter net sales of $466.6 million. Comparable store sales
decreased 4% for the quarter.

By merchandise concept, comparable store sales ("comps"), defined as sales in
stores that have been open for at least one year, for the quarter were as
follows: Abercrombie & Fitch's comps declined in the mid-single digits, with
womens posting a positive comp and mens a negative comp. Comps for the kids'
business, abercrombie, were similar to the adult business with girls posting a
positive comp increase during the quarter and boys a negative comp. Comps in
Hollister were positive in double digits.

By regions, comps were strongest in the West and weakest in the Midwest.

Given continued uncertainty in the economy, the Company entered the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2002 with an approach designed to protect both the bottom line
and the aspirational quality of the brands. The Company continued to
strategically use direct mail and bounce-back promotions, but, overall, a much
less aggressive approach to promotions was undertaken compared to 2001.

The pre-Christmas selling environment was very challenging and, as expected,
comp store sales were negative for the fourth quarter prior to Christmas. Comps
improved significantly after Christmas, resulting in a flat comp for December
2002. January 2003 comps were positive 3%, which reflected strong sales of
winter clearance, and positive results from the initial spring assortment.

From a merchandising standpoint, womens continued to outperform mens. Key
classifications in womens during the quarter included woven shirts, knit tops,
outerwear, pants, sweats and underwear. Mens continued to be difficult and there
remained no solid trend industry-wide. However, knit tops and woven shirts
performed well during the quarter.

As for the kids' business, knit tops, sweats, woven tops, pants and outerwear
performed very well in girls. In boys, denim and sweats performed best. As in
the adult business, boys continued to be difficult.

In Hollister, girls continued to be more significant than guys, representing
approximately 65% of the overall business. For the quarter, the best performing
girls classifications were woven shirts, knit tops, sweats, skirts and denim. In
guys, denim, knit tops, graphic t-shirts, sweatshirts and accessories performed
best.

Sales in the e-commerce business grew by over 25% during the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2002 as compared to 2001. The Company remains on track to add a Hollister
e-commerce business for back-to-school 2003. The direct business (which includes
the Company's catalogue, the A&F Quarterly (a catalogue/magazine) and the
Company's Web sites) accounted for 5.0% of net sales in the fourth quarter of
2002 as compared to 4.5% in 2001.

Fourth Quarter 2001

Fourth quarter 2001 net sales increased 6% to $466.6 million from $439.4 million
in 2000. The increase was due to the addition of new stores offset by a 9%
decline in comps as compared with the previous year's 13-week period ended
February 3, 2001. The fourth quarter of 2001 was highly promotional and a number
of



                                       13
<PAGE>

promotional strategies, including direct mail, bouncebacks and selective price
point reductions, were employed to improve the sales trend from the third
quarter 2001.

By merchandise concept, Abercrombie & Fitch's comps declined in the high-single
digits with women's comps roughly flat for the quarter while men's comps were
negative double digits. Comps for our kids' business followed a similar trend to
the adult business with girls' comps much stronger than boys' comps.

By regions, comps were strongest in the Northeast and the West Coast and weakest
in the Southeast and Midwest.

From a merchandising standpoint, womens outperformed mens and generated strong
comp increases in denim, graphic tees and skirts. Newer women's classifications,
such as gymwear and lingerie performed well. Mens was difficult with no solid
industry-wide trend. Similar to womens, men's denim consistently performed well
and comps were strong through Christmas. However, men's outerwear and sweater
classifications had significant decreases.

In the kids' business, strong girls' categories were denim, skirts, knits and
accessories while sweaters and outerwear classifications were weak. Boys' strong
classifications were knits and denim.

In the adult e-commerce business, sales grew by over 27% during the fourth
quarter of 2001 compared to 2000. The Company's catalogue, the A&F Quarterly and
the Company's Web sites accounted for 4.5% of net sales in the fourth quarter of
2001 as compared to 5.0% in 2000. The decrease is primarily due to the Company
not producing an A&F Quarterly in the fourth quarter of 2001.

Fiscal 2002

Net sales for fiscal year 2002 reached $1.6 billion, up 17% over fiscal year
2001. The sales increase was attributable to the net addition of 106 stores
offset by a 5% comparable store sales decrease. The decline in comps was
primarily due to the weak performance in both the mens and boys. Men's comps
decreased in low-double digits for fiscal year 2002 while boys' comps decreased
in the mid-teens. For Spring 2003, the Company continues to maintain a cautious
approach in mens, focusing on delivering more new items more frequently. The
men's assortment for spring features a "vintage look" which is emphasized in
washes, colors and marketing. As in mens, a cautious approach will be maintained
in boys.

Overall, the women's and girls' businesses continued to increase in share of the
total business and accounted for greater than 57% of the adult and kids'
businesses, respectively, in fiscal year 2002. For the year, women's comps were
negative low-single digits while girls' comps were positive mid-single digits.
The Company will continue to focus on providing more frequent newness in both
womens and girls in 2003. Items will flow into the stores faster and remain in
stores for a shorter time period. This strategy gives the customer more new
items without an increase in inventory investment.

Hollister continued to perform well. For fiscal year 2002, sales per square foot
in Hollister stores were approximately 86% of the sales per square foot in
Abercrombie & Fitch stores in the same malls.

The Company's catalogue, the A&F Quarterly and the Company's Web sites
represented 4.7% of 2002 net sales compared to 4.2% in 2001.




                                       14
<PAGE>


Fiscal 2001

Net sales for the 2001 fiscal year increased 10% to $1.36 billion from $1.24
billion in 2000. The sales increase was attributable to the net addition of 137
stores offset by a 9% comparable store sales decrease. The decline in comps was
largely due to continued weakness in mens. Men's comps decreased in the
high-teens for the year; however, denim, knits and gymwear performed well.

Comps were up in the mid-single digits in womens for the 2001 fiscal year. The
strongest performing categories were denim, knits, skirts, gymwear and women's
accessories. Overall, womens increased as a percentage of the overall business.
In fiscal 2001, womens accounted for 55% of the total adult business.

In 2001, the kids' business had a mid-teen decline in comparable store sales for
the year with girls performing better than boys. As in the adult business, girls
outperformed boys.

For the 2001 fiscal year, sales per square foot in Hollister stores were
approximately 75% of the sales per square foot in Abercrombie & Fitch stores in
the same malls.

The Company's catalogue, the A&F Quarterly and the Company's Web sites
represented 4.2% of fiscal 2001 net sales compared to 3.8% of 2000 net sales.
Operating improvements in e-commerce fulfillment helped reduce the number of
backorders, increasing sales by improving in-stocks. The Company produced only
three A&F Quarterly's in fiscal 2001 versus four in 2000, dampening the increase
over the prior year in the direct business.

GROSS INCOME

Fourth Quarter 2002

The gross income rate (gross income divided by net sales) for the fourth quarter
of fiscal year 2002 was 45.5%, up 80 basis points from last year's rate of
44.7%. The increase in gross income rate resulted largely from an increase in
initial markup (IMU), partially offset by an increase in buying and occupancy
costs, as a percent of sales.

Continued progress in sourcing has been an important factor in improving the IMU
in all three concepts. The Company continued to make progress increasing the IMU
in Hollister, where IMU improved over 700 basis points versus the fourth quarter
of 2001.

Additionally, the Company's less aggressive approach to promotions during the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 resulted in selling at higher average retail
prices compared to the fourth quarter of 2001.

The increase in buying and occupancy costs, as a percent of sales, reflected the
inability to leverage fixed costs such as rent, depreciation and other real
estate related charges with a comp store decrease.

The Company ended the fourth quarter of 2002 with inventories up 12% per gross
square foot versus the fourth quarter of 2001 at cost.


                                       15
<PAGE>




Fourth Quarter 2001

The gross income rate during the fourth quarter of 2001 was 44.7%, down from
46.2% for the same period in 2000. The decrease was primarily due to an increase
in the markdown rate, attributable to the expected higher level of promotional
business. The planned promotional strategies for the quarter resulted in selling
at lower average retail prices. For the quarter, average unit retail prices
decreased in the low-double digits.

Additionally, buying and occupancy costs, expressed as a percentage of net
sales, increased as a result of the inability to leverage fixed expenses with
lower sales volume per average store. These decreases were partially offset by
higher IMU and tight control of inventory. The increase in IMU was a result of
continued improvement in the sourcing of merchandise, particularly in womens.

The tight control of inventory resulted in inventories being down 30% per gross
square foot at year-end 2001 as compared with year-end 2000. These low levels of
inventory provided downside profit protection as season-end merchandise was
significantly lower on a per square foot basis in the fourth quarter of 2001 as
compared to the same period in 2000.

Fiscal 2002

For fiscal 2002, the gross income rate was 41.1% versus 40.9% in 2001. The
increase was driven by improvements in IMU that were almost fully offset by
increased buying and occupancy costs, as a percentage of sales.

Tight control of inventory also protected gross income as the Company chased
inventory through most of the first half of 2002.

Fiscal 2001

For the 2001 fiscal year, the gross income rate decreased to 40.9% from 41.2% in
2000. The decrease was primarily attributable to higher buying and occupancy
costs. Buying and occupancy costs increased, as a percentage of net sales, due
to the deleveraging created by the decrease in comparable store sales. The
decrease was almost entirely offset by higher IMU as a result of continued
improvements in sourcing merchandise that reduced costs. The other factors in
protecting gross income were tight control of inventory, which resulted in
disciplined markdown control, and lower inventory shrinkage as a result of the
Company's continued emphasis on in-store operational controls.

GENERAL, ADMINISTRATIVE AND STORE OPERATING EXPENSES

Fourth Quarter 2002

The fourth quarter 2002 general, administrative and store operating expense rate
(general, administrative and store operating expenses divided by net sales) was
17.5% compared to 17.1% in the fourth quarter of 2001. The increase in rate
versus 2001 resulted primarily from an increase in home office expenses, largely
due to higher bonuses resulting from improved financial performance.

During the fourth quarter of 2002, store payroll hours were reduced by 9% per
average Abercrombie & Fitch adult store and 3% per average kids store. Store
hours are managed on a weekly basis in order to match hours with sales volume.
The control of payroll hours helped mitigate the effect of negative comps on the
store expense rate.



                                       16
<PAGE>

Efficiencies were also recognized in the distribution center and in the direct
business. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, productivity, as measured in
units processed per labor hour, was 39% higher than the fourth quarter of 2001.
For the quarter, more units were processed than the comparable period in 2001
with 20% fewer labor hours.

In the fourth quarter of 2002, fulfillment costs per order in the direct
business were down by over 19% compared to the fourth quarter of 2001.

Fourth Quarter 2001

The fourth quarter 2001 general, administrative and store operating expense rate
improved to 17.1% as compared to 17.9% in the fourth quarter of 2000. The
Company continued to tightly control expenses in both the stores and the home
office. These cost controls included limiting headcount additions, reducing home
office travel and store payroll hours, and decreasing relocation and recruiting
expenses.

Savings were also recognized in the new distribution center and in the direct
business. During the fourth quarter 2001, productivity in the distribution
center, as measured in units processed per labor hour, was over 50% higher than
fourth quarter 2000. In the direct business, fulfillment costs per order were
down by over 10%. These savings in general, administrative and store operating
expenses were partially offset by marketing costs incurred as part of the
promotional strategy implemented during the fourth quarter of 2001.

Fourth quarter 2000's general, administrative and store operating expenses were
unfavorably affected by one-time expenses related to the move to the new
distribution center and home office and the inclusion of a 14th week in the
fourth quarter of 2000.

Fiscal 2002

The full year general, administrative and store operating expense rate in 2002
was 21.5% versus 21.0% in 2001. The 2002 rate increase resulted from an increase
in store expenses, as a percentage of sales, due to the inability to leverage
fixed costs on a comp store sales decrease, as well as higher legal and
incentive compensation expenses.

Fiscal 2001

The full year general, administrative and store operating expense rate in 2001
was 21.0% versus 20.7% in 2000. The rate increase in 2001 was primarily due to
the inability to leverage fixed expenses as a result of the decrease in sales
volume per average store. The increase was partially offset by the Company's
focus on discretionary expense controls.

OPERATING INCOME

Fourth Quarter 2002

The operating income rate (operating income divided by net sales) was 28.0% for
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 compared to 27.6% for the same period in 2001.
Less aggressive promotional activities and higher average selling prices
increased the gross income rate in the current year's fourth quarter. This
improvement was offset somewhat by a higher general, administrative and store
operating expense rate.


                                       17
<PAGE>

Fiscal 2002

The operating income rate for the fiscal year 2002 was 19.6% versus 19.9% in
fiscal year 2001. The decline was attributable to a higher general,
administrative and store operating expense rate due to the inability to leverage
fixed costs on a comp store decrease. The increased expense rate was partially
offset by a gross income rate increase.

Fourth Quarter 2001 and Fiscal 2001

The operating income rate was 27.6% and 19.9% for the fourth quarter and fiscal
year of 2001, respectively, compared to 28.2% and 20.5% for the same periods in
2000. The decline in operating income rate in these periods was primarily due to
lower gross income percentages resulting from planned promotional strategies
executed in the fourth quarter of 2001. Lower general, administrative and store
operating expenses, expressed as a percentage of net sales, partially offset the
lower gross income rate in the fourth quarter of 2001. For the year, higher
general, administrative and store operating expenses, expressed as a percentage
of net sales, added to the decrease in operating income rate.

INTEREST INCOME AND INCOME TAXES

Fourth quarter and year-to-date net interest income were $1.3 and $3.8 million
in 2002 as compared with net interest income of $1.2 and $5.1 million for the
comparable periods in 2001. The decrease in net interest income in the
year-to-date period was a result of the Company's strategy at the beginning of
2002 to invest cash in tax-free securities due to the decline in short-term
market interest rates. Previously, the Company primarily invested in the
commercial paper market.

The tax-free investments contributed to a lower effective tax rate of 38.5% and
38.4% for the fourth quarter and year-to-date periods of 2002 as compared to
39.0% for both of 2001's comparable periods.

Net interest income was $1.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2001 and $5.1
million for the 2001 fiscal year compared with net interest income of $2.5
million and $7.8 million for the corresponding periods in 2000. The decrease in
net interest income for both the quarter and the year was due to the decline in
market interest rates. Net interest income in 2001 and 2000 was primarily from
short-term investments.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

The Company's continuing growth in net income affords it financial strength and
flexibility. A more detailed discussion of liquidity, capital resources and
capital requirements follows.

Net cash provided by operating activities is the Company's primary source of
liquidity and has grown steadily the past three years from $151.2 million in
2000 to $233.2 million in 2001 to $293.1 million in 2002. Current year net
income adjusted for depreciation and amortization was the primary source of
cash.

Additionally, in 2002, cash was provided from increases in accounts payable and
accrued expenses and income taxes payable.

Accounts payable increased in 2002 due to both the increased level of inventory
and timing of payments versus 2001.

Accrued expenses increased in 2002 due to the following: higher incentive
compensation expenses, resulting from the Company's improved financial
performance; higher store expenses and gift card liability, consistent with the
increase in store openings; and higher legal expenses.

The increase in income taxes payable in the current year was due primarily to a
change in the methodology being used to make estimated tax payments throughout
2002. This methodology was modified to more closely reflect interim liabilities
under the annualization method. In addition, the favorable impact of the
Company's stock-based compensation was significantly reduced reflecting the
lower stock prices during 2002 as compared to 2001.

Net deferred income taxes increased in 2002 primarily as a result of increasing
differences between book and tax depreciation methods due to the accelerated
growth of store openings the past few years and "bonus" accelerated depreciation
allowed under the Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002.

Inventories increased $35.3 million during 2002 and represented the primary use
of cash. Inventories at fiscal 2002 year-end were 12% higher on a gross square
foot basis versus fiscal 2001 year-end.



                                       19
<PAGE>

Other uses of cash were directly related to store growth and primarily consisted
of increases in capitalized store supplies and prepaid rent related to stores
(classified in other current assets).

The Company's operations are seasonal in nature and typically peak during the
back-to-school and Christmas selling periods. Accordingly, cash requirements for
inventory expenditures are highest during these periods.

Cash outflows related to investing activities were primarily for capital
expenditures (see the discussion in the "Capital Expenditures" section below)
related to new stores (net of construction allowances) with approximately $20
million invested in information technology and distribution center projects.
Investing activities also included purchases and maturities of marketable
securities. As of February 1, 2003, the Company held marketable securities with
original maturities of three to five months. The decrease in note receivable
resulted from the repayment of a promissory note by the Chairman (see Note 9 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements).

Financing activities during 2002, 2001 and 2000 consisted primarily of the
repurchase of 1,850,000 shares, 600,000 shares, and 3,550,000 shares,
respectively, of A&F's Class A Common Stock pursuant to previously authorized
stock repurchase programs.

The 2002 repurchase completed a previously authorized 6,000,000 share repurchase
program. At its August 2002 Board meeting, the Board of Directors authorized the
repurchase of an additional 5,000,000 shares of the Company's Class A Common
Stock. As of February 1, 2003, the total number of shares authorized and
available for repurchase was 5,000,000. In addition to stock repurchases,
financing activities also consisted of stock option exercises and restricted
stock issuances.

During the first nine months of 2002, the Company had available a $150 million
syndicated unsecured credit agreement. The Company also had a $75 million
facility for trade letters of credit. The trade letters of credit were issued to
numerous overseas suppliers and served as guarantees to the suppliers.

Effective November 14, 2002, the Company entered into a new $250 million
syndicated unsecured credit agreement (the "New Credit Agreement"), which
replaced both the then existing credit agreement (the "Old Credit Agreement")
and the trade letter of credit facility. Additional details regarding the New
Credit Agreement can be found in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(see Note 8).

Letters of credit totaling approximately $41.8 million were outstanding under
the New Credit Agreement at February 1, 2003. Letters of credit totaling
approximately $49.9 million were outstanding under the trade letter of credit
facility at February 2, 2002. No borrowings were outstanding under the New
Credit Agreement at February 1, 2003 or under the Old Credit Agreement at
February 2, 2002.

The Company has standby letters of credit in the amount of $4.7 million that
expire in one year. The beneficiary, a merchandise supplier, has the right to
draw upon the standby letters of credit if the Company has authorized or filed a
voluntary petition in bankruptcy. To date, the beneficiary has not drawn upon
the standby letters of credit.

As of February 1, 2003, the Company was committed to noncancelable leases with
remaining terms of one to fourteen years. These commitments include store leases
with initial terms ranging primarily from ten to fifteen years. A summary of
minimum rent commitments under noncancelable leases follows (dollars in

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES

Capital expenditures, net of construction allowances, totaled $93.0 million,
$126.5 million and $153.5 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
Additionally, the noncash accrual for construction in progress decreased $12.7
million in 2002 and increased $1.0 million and $9.5 million in 2001 and 2000,
respectively. Capital expenditures in 2002 related to new store construction
with approximately $20 million invested in information technology and
distribution center projects. Capital expenditures in 2001 and 2000 related to
the construction of a new office and distribution center, including the noncash
accrual for construction in progress, accounted for approximately $17 million
and $92 million of total capital expenditures in 2001 and 2000, respectively.
The office and distribution center were completed in 2001. The balance of
capital expenditures related primarily to new stores.

The Company anticipates spending $120 to $130 million in 2003 for capital
expenditures, of which $70 to $80 million will be for new stores construction.
The balance of expenditures primarily relates to improving the in-store
information technology structure, which should be complete for back-to-school,
and distribution center expansion. In addition, the Company has begun
construction planning for additional home office space to accommodate the growth
of Hollister.

The Company intends to add approximately 726,000 gross square feet for the three
concepts in 2003, which will represent a 17% increase over year-end 2002. It is
anticipated the increase will result from the addition of approximately 30 new
Abercrombie & Fitch stores, 10 new abercrombie stores and 70 new Hollister Co.
stores. Additionally, the Company plans to remodel 10 Abercrombie & Fitch
stores.

The Company estimates that the average cost for leasehold improvements and
furniture and fixtures for Abercrombie & Fitch stores opened in 2003 will
approximate $630,000 per store, after giving effect to landlord allowances. In
addition, inventory purchases are expected to average approximately $330,000 per
store.

The Company estimates that the average cost for leasehold improvements and
furniture and fixtures for abercrombie stores opened in 2003 will approximate
$485,000 per store, after giving effect to landlord allowances. In addition,
inventory purchases are expected to average approximately $130,000 per store.

The Company estimates that the average cost for leasehold improvements and
furniture and fixtures for Hollister Co. stores opened in 2003 will approximate
$650,000 per store, after giving effect to landlord allowances. In addition,
inventory purchases are expected to average approximately $230,000 per store.

The Company expects that substantially all future capital expenditures will be
funded with cash from operations. In addition, the Company has $250 million
available (less outstanding letters of credit) under its credit agreement to
support operations.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

The Company's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of
operations are based upon the Company's consolidated financial statements, which
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States ("GAAP"). The preparation of these financial statements
requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Since actual results may
differ from those estimates, the Company revises its estimates and assumptions
as new information becomes available.

The Company's significant accounting policies can be found in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements (see Note 2). The Company believes that the
following policies are most critical to the portrayal of the Company's financial
condition and results of operations.

Revenue Recognition - The Company recognizes retail sales at the time the
customer takes possession of the merchandise and purchases are paid for,
primarily with either cash or credit card. Catalogue and e-commerce sales are
recorded upon customer receipt of merchandise. Amounts relating to shipping and
handling billed to customers in a sale transaction are classified as revenue and
the related costs are classified as cost of goods sold. Employee discounts are
classified as a reduction of revenue. The Company reserves for sales returns
through estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions
that management believes to be reasonable.

Inventory Valuation - Inventories are principally valued at the lower of average
cost or market, on a first-in first-out basis, utilizing the retail method. The
retail method of inventory valuation is an averaging technique applied to
different categories of inventory. At A&F, the averaging is determined at the
stock keeping unit (SKU) level by averaging all costs for each SKU. An initial
markup is applied to inventory at cost in order to establish a cost-to-retail
ratio. Permanent markdowns, when taken, reduce both the retail and cost
components of inventory on hand so as to maintain the already established
cost-to-retail relationship. The use of the retail method and the recording of
markdowns effectively values inventory at the lower of cost or market. The
Company further reduces inventory by recording an additional markdown reserve
using the retail carrying value of inventory from the season just passed.
Markdowns on this carryover inventory represent estimated future anticipated
selling price declines. Additionally, as part of inventory valuation, an
inventory shrinkage estimate is made each period that reduces the value of
inventory for lost or stolen items. Inherent in the retail method calculation
are certain significant judgments and estimates including, among others, initial
markup, markdowns and shrinkage, which could significantly impact the ending
inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins. Management
believes that this inventory valuation method provides a conservative inventory
valuation as it preserves the cost-to-retail relationship in ending inventory.



                                       22
<PAGE>

Property and Equipment - Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment
are computed for financial reporting purposes on a straight-line basis, using
service lives ranging principally from 10-15 years for leasehold improvements
and 3-10 years for other property and equipment. Beneficial leaseholds represent
the present value of the excess of fair market rent over contractual rent of
existing stores at the 1988 purchase of the Abercrombie & Fitch business by The
Limited, Inc. (now known as Limited Brands, Inc., "The Limited") and are being
amortized over the lives of the related leases. The cost of assets sold or
retired and the related accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed
from the accounts with any resulting gain or loss included in net income.
Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Major renewals and
betterments that extend service lives are capitalized. Long-lived assets are
reviewed at the store level at least annually for impairment or whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that full recoverability is questionable.
Factors used in the evaluation include, but are not limited to, management's
plans for future operations, recent operating results and projected cash flows.

Income Taxes - Income taxes are calculated in accordance with SFAS No. 109,
"Accounting for Income Taxes," which requires the use of the liability method.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the difference
between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
liabilities and their respective tax bases. Inherent in the measurement of
deferred balances are certain judgments and interpretations of enacted tax law
and published guidance with respect to applicability to the Company's
operations. Significant examples of this concept include capitalization policies
for various tangible and intangible costs, income and expense recognition and
inventory valuation methods. No valuation allowance has been provided for
deferred tax assets because management believes the full amount of the net
deferred tax assets will be realized in the future. The effective tax rate
utilized by the Company reflects management's judgment of the expected tax
liabilities within the various taxing jurisdictions.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

The Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets."
The standard was effective February 3, 2002 for the Company. SFAS No. 142
addresses how intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group
of other assets should be accounted for in financial statements upon their
acquisition. It also addresses how goodwill and other intangible assets should
be accounted for after they have been initially recognized in the financial
statements. The adoption of SFAS No. 142 did not have an impact on the Company's
results of operations or its financial position in 2002.

SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," was effective
February 2, 2003 for the Company. The standard requires entities to record the
fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in
which it is a cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived
asset. Over time, the liability is accreted to its present value each period,
and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related
obligation for its recorded amount or the entity incurs a gain or loss upon
settlement. Because costs associated with exiting leased properties at the end
of lease terms are minimal, management anticipates that the adoption of SFAS No.
143 will not have a significant effect on the Company's results of operations or
its financial position.

SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets," was
effective February 3, 2002 for the Company. The standard addresses financial
accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets.
The adoption of SFAS No. 144 did not have a material impact on the Company's
results of operations or its financial position in 2002.



                                       23

In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantor's Accounting
and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, including indirect guarantees of
indebtedness of others, an interpretation of FASB Statements No. 5, 57, and 107
and rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34," that requires recognition of a
liability (at fair value) for guarantee contracts that have any of the following
characteristics:

    -    Contracts that contingently require the guarantor to make payments
         based on changes in an underlying, as defined by SFAS No. 133;
    -    Contracts that contingently require the guarantor to make payments
         based on another entity's failure to perform under an obligating
         agreement;
    -    Indemnification agreements;
    -    Indirect guarantees of the indebtedness of others.

In addition to the disclosures required by current GAAP related to guarantees,
this interpretation requires additional disclosures including:

    -    Details about the nature of the guarantee;
    -    The maximum potential amount of future payments (undiscounted);
    -    The current carrying amount of the liability for guarantor's obligation
         under the guarantee;
    -    The nature of any recourse provisions.

Guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002 must follow the new
accounting. The disclosure requirements were effective for the 2002 financial
statements and did not have an impact on the Company's results of operations or
its financial position in 2002. The recognition provisions will be adopted by
the Company in 2003 and are not expected to have a significant impact on the
Company's financial statements.

SFAS No. 145, "Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of
FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections," was effective February 2,
2003 for the Company. The standard rescinds FASB Statements No. 4 and 64 that
deal with issues relating to the extinguishment of debt. The standard also
rescinds FASB Statement No. 44 that deals with intangible assets of motor
carriers. The standard modifies FASB Statement No. 13, "Accounting for Leases,"
so that certain capital lease modifications must be accounted for by lessees as
sale-leaseback transactions. Additionally, the standard identifies amendments
that should have been made to previously existing pronouncements and formally
amends the appropriate pronouncements. The provisions of this standard related
to the rescission of SFAS No. 4 are in effect in 2003. The remaining provisions
of the statement were adopted by the Company for transactions occurring after
May 15, 2002.

SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
Activities," requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or
disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at fair value when the
liability is incurred. The provisions of the standard are effective for exit or
disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. The adoption of SFAS No.
146 did not have a significant impact on the Company's financial statements.

SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and
Disclosure-an Amendment to FASB No. 123," was issued on December 31, 2002.
Pursuant to this standard, companies that choose to adopt the accounting
provisions of FASB No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," will be
permitted to select from three transition methods (prospective, modified
prospective, and retroactive restatement).


                                       24
<PAGE>



Companies that choose not to adopt the accounting provisions of FASB No. 123
will be affected by the new disclosure requirements of FASB No. 148. The new
disclosures include tabular presentation of the following information for all
periods presented:

    1.   Net income and EPS (basic and diluted), as reported;
    2.   Compensation expense (if any), net of tax, included in reported net
         income;
    3.   Compensation expense that would have been included in net income had
         the company adopted the accounting provisions of FASB No. 123 for all
         awards granted, modified or settled since December 15, 1994;
    4.   Pro forma net income and earnings per share.

The transition and annual disclosure provisions of FASB No. 148 are effective
for the 2002 financial statements. The new interim disclosure provisions are
effective in the first quarter of 2003.

Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue 02-16, "Accounting by a Customer
(Including a Reseller) For Cash Consideration Received from a Vendor," addresses
the accounting treatment for cash vendor allowances received. The adoption of
EITF Issue 02-16 in 2003 did not have an impact on the Company's financial
position or results of operations.

IMPACT OF INFLATION

The Company's results of operations and financial condition are presented based
upon historical cost. While it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of
inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required, the Company
believes that the effects of inflation, if any, on its results of operations and
financial condition have been minor.

SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995

A&F cautions that any forward-looking statements (as such term is defined in the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) contained in this Form 10-K or
made by management of A&F involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to
change based on various important factors. The following factors, among others,
in some cases have affected and in the future could affect the Company's
financial performance and actual results and could cause actual results for 2003
and beyond to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any of the
forward-looking statements included in this Form 10-K or otherwise made by
management: changes in consumer spending patterns and consumer preferences; the
effects of political and economic events and conditions domestically and in
foreign jurisdictions in which the Company operates, including, but not limited
to, acts of terrorism or war; the impact of competition and pricing; changes in
weather patterns; market price of key raw materials; ability to source product
from its global supplier base; political stability; currency and exchange risks
and changes in existing or potential duties, tariffs or quotas; availability of
suitable store locations at appropriate terms; ability to develop new
merchandise; and ability to hire, train and retain associates.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

The Company maintains its cash and equivalents in financial instruments with
original maturities of 90 days or less. The Company also holds marketable
securities with original maturities of three to five months. These financial
instruments bear interest at fixed rates and are subject to interest rate risk
through lost income should interest rates increase. The Company does not enter
into financial instruments for trading purposes.

As of February 1, 2003, the Company had no long-term debt outstanding. Future
borrowings would bear interest at negotiated rates and would be subject to
interest rate risk. The Company does not believe that a hypothetical adverse
change of 10% in interest rates would have a material affect on the Company's
financial condition.

                               ABERCROMBIE & FITCH

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.     BASIS OF PRESENTATION

       Abercrombie & Fitch Co. ("A&F"), through its wholly-owned subsidiaries
       (collectively, A&F and its wholly-owned subsidiaries are referred to as
       "Abercrombie & Fitch" or the "Company"), is a specialty retailer of high
       quality, casual apparel for men, women and kids with an active, youthful
       lifestyle. The business was established in 1892.

       The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the historical
       financial statements of, and transactions applicable to, A&F and its
       wholly-owned subsidiaries and reflect the assets, liabilities, results of
       operations and cash flows on a historical cost basis.

2.     SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

       PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

       The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of A&F. All
       significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated
       in consolidation.

       FISCAL YEAR

       The Company's fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to January 31.
       Fiscal years are designated in the financial statements and notes by the
       calendar year in which the fiscal year commences. The results for fiscal
       years 2002 and 2001 represent the fifty-two week periods ended February
       1, 2003 and February 2, 2002. The results for fiscal year 2000 represent
       the fifty-three week period ended February 3, 2001.

       CASH AND EQUIVALENTS

       Cash and equivalents include amounts on deposit with financial
       institutions and investments with original maturities of less than 90
       days.

       MARKETABLE SECURITIES

       All investments with original maturities of greater than 90 days are
       accounted for in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
       Standards ("SFAS") No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt
       and Equity Securities." The Company determines the appropriate
       classification at the time of purchase. At February 1, 2003, the Company
       held investments in marketable securities that were classified as held to
       maturity based on the Company's positive intent and ability to hold the
       securities to maturity. Primarily all securities held by the Company at
       February 1, 2003 were municipal debt securities that mature within one
       year and are stated at amortized cost that approximates market value.

       INVENTORIES

       Inventories are principally valued at the lower of average cost or
       market, on a first-in first-out basis, utilizing the retail method.

       STORE SUPPLIES

       The initial inventory of supplies for new stores including, but not
       limited to, hangers, signage, security tags and point-of-sale supplies
       are capitalized at the store opening date. Subsequent shipments are
       expensed except for new merchandise presentation programs, which are
       capitalized.

       PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

       Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment are computed for
       financial reporting purposes on a straight-line basis, using service
       lives ranging principally from 10-15 years for leasehold improvements and
       3-10 years for other property and equipment. Beneficial leaseholds
       represent the present value of the excess of fair market rent over
       contractual rent of existing stores as of the 1988 purchase of the
       Abercrombie & Fitch business by The Limited, Inc. (now known as Limited
       Brands, Inc. "The Limited") and are being amortized over the lives of the
       related leases. The cost of assets sold or retired and the related
       accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed from the accounts
       with any resulting gain or loss included in net income. Maintenance and
       repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Major renewals and
       betterments that extend service lives are capitalized. Long-lived assets
       are reviewed at the store level at least annually for impairment or
       whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that full
       recoverability of net assets through future cash flows is in question.
       Factors used in the evaluation include, but are not limited to,
       management's plans for future operations, recent operating results and
       projected cash flows.

       INCOME TAXES

       Income taxes are calculated in accordance with SFAS No. 109, "Accounting
       for Income Taxes," which requires the use of the liability method.
       Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the
       difference between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing
       assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.

       Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
       in effect in the years in which those temporary differences are expected
       to reverse. Under SFAS No. 109, the effect on deferred taxes of a change
       in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the
       enactment date.

       SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY

       At February 1, 2003 and February 2, 2002, there were 150 million shares
       of $.01 par value Class A Common Stock authorized, of which 97.3 million
       and 98.9 million shares were outstanding at February 1, 2003 and February
       2, 2002, respectively, and 106.4 million shares of $.01 par value Class B
       Common Stock authorized, none of which were outstanding at February 1,
       2003 or February 2, 2002. In addition, 15 million shares of $.01 par
       value Preferred Stock were authorized, none of which have been issued.
       See Note 13 for information about Preferred Stock Purchase Rights.




                                       32
<PAGE>

       Holders of Class A Common Stock generally have identical rights to
       holders of Class B Common Stock, except that holders of Class A Common
       Stock are entitled to one vote per share while holders of Class B Common
       Stock are entitled to three votes per share on all matters submitted to a
       vote of shareholders.

       REVENUE RECOGNITION

       The Company recognizes retail sales at the time the customer takes
       possession of the merchandise and purchases are paid for, primarily with
       either cash or credit card. Catalogue and e-commerce sales are recorded
       upon customer receipt of merchandise. Amounts relating to shipping and
       handling billed to customers in a sale transaction are classified as
       revenue and the related costs are classified as cost of goods sold.
       Employee discounts are classified as a reduction of revenue. The Company
       reserves for sales returns through estimates based on historical
       experience and various other assumptions that management believes to be
       reasonable.

       CATALOGUE AND ADVERTISING COSTS

       Costs related to the A&F Quarterly, a catalogue/magazine, primarily
       consist of catalogue production and mailing costs and are expensed as
       incurred. Advertising costs consist of in-store photographs and
       advertising in selected national publications and are expensed when the
       photographs or publications first appear. Catalogue and advertising costs
       amounted to $33.4 million in 2002, $30.7 million in 2001 and $30.4
       million in 2000.

       STORE PREOPENING EXPENSES

       Preopening expenses related to new store openings are charged to
       operations as incurred.

       FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

       The recorded values of current assets and current liabilities, including
       receivables, marketable securities and accounts payable, approximate fair
       value due to the short maturity and because the average interest rate
       approximates current market origination rates.

       STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

       The Company reports stock-based compensation through the disclosure-only
       requirements of SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,"
       as amended by SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based
       Compensation-Transition and Disclosure-an Amendment to FASB No. 123," but
       elects to measure compensation expense using the intrinsic value method
       in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
       "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees." Accordingly, no compensation
       expense for options has been recognized as all options are granted at
       fair market value at the grant date. The Company does recognize
       compensation expense related to restricted share awards. If compensation
       expense related to options had been determined based on the estimated
       fair value of options granted in 2002, 2001 and 2000, consistent with the
       methodology in SFAS No. 123, the pro forma effect on net income and net
       income per basic and diluted share would have been as follows:

                  restricted share awards actually recognized in earnings
                  in each period presented.

       The pro forma effect on net income for 2002, 2001 and 2000 is not
       representative of the pro forma effect on net income in future years
       because it takes into consideration pro forma compensation expense
       related only to those grants made subsequent to May 19, 1998.

       The weighted-average fair value of all options granted during fiscal
       2002, 2001 and 2000 was $12.07, $14.96 and $8.90, respectively. The fair
       value of each option was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing
       model, which are included in the pro forma results above. For purposes of
       the valuation the following weighted-average assumptions were used: no
       expected dividends in 2002, 2001 and 2000; price volatility of 53% in
       2002, 54% in 2001 and 50% in 2000; risk-free interest rates of 4.3%, 4.7%
       and 6.2% in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively; assumed forfeiture rates
       of 15% in 2002 and 2001 and 10% in 2000; and expected lives of 5 years in
       2002, 2001 and 2000.

       EARNINGS PER SHARE

       Net income per share is computed in accordance with SFAS No. 128,
       "Earnings Per Share." Net income per basic share is computed based on the
       weighted-average number of outstanding shares of common stock. Net income
       per diluted share includes the weighted-average effect of dilutive stock
       options and restricted shares.

       Options to purchase 9,218,000, 5,630,000 and 9,100,000 shares of Class A
       Common Stock were outstanding at year-end 2002, 2001 and 2000,
       respectively, but were not included in the computation of net income per
       diluted share because the options' exercise prices were greater than the
       average market price of the underlying shares.

       USE OF ESTIMATES IN THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

       The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
       accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") requires management to make
       estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
       liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported
       amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Since
       actual results may differ from those estimates, the Company revises its
       estimates and assumptions as new information becomes available.

       RECLASSIFICATIONS

       Certain amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year
       presentation. The amounts reclassified did not have an effect on the
       Company's results of operations or shareholders' equity.

3.     ISSUANCES OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

       The Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 142,
       "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." The standard was effective
       February 3, 2002 for the Company. SFAS No. 142 addresses how intangible
       assets that are acquired individually or with a group of other assets
       should be accounted for in financial statements upon their acquisition.
       It also addresses how goodwill and other intangible assets should be
       accounted for after they have been initially recognized in the financial
       statements. The adoption of SFAS No. 142 did not have an impact on the
       Company's results of operations or its financial position in 2002.

       SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," was
       effective February 2, 2003 for the Company. The standard requires
       entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement
       obligation in the period in which it is a cost by increasing the carrying
       amount of the related long-lived asset. Over time, the liability is
       accreted to its present value each period, and the capitalized cost is
       depreciated over the useful life of the related obligation for its
       recorded amount or the entity incurs a gain or loss upon settlement.
       Because costs associated with exiting leased properties at the end of
       lease terms are minimal, management anticipates that the adoption of SFAS
       No. 143 will not have a significant effect on the Company's results of
       operations or its financial position.


                                       35
<PAGE>

       SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
       Assets," was effective February 3, 2002 for the Company. The standard
       addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or
       disposal of long-lived assets. The adoption of SFAS No. 144 did not have
       an impact on the Company's results of operations or its financial
       position in 2002.


       In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantor's
       Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, including indirect
       guarantees of indebtedness of others, an interpretation of FASB
       Statements No. 5, 57, and 107 and rescission of FASB Interpretation No.
       34," that requires recognition of a liability (at fair value) for
       guarantee contracts that have any of the following characteristics:

           -  Contracts that contingently require the guarantor to make payments
              based on changes in an underlying, as defined by SFAS No. 133;
           -  Contracts that contingently require the guarantor to make payments
              based on another entity's failure to perform under an obligating
              agreement;
           -  Indemnification agreements;
           -  Indirect guarantees of the indebtedness of others.

       In addition to the disclosures required by current GAAP related to
       guarantees, this interpretation requires additional disclosures
       including:

           -  Details about the nature of the guarantee;
           -  The maximum potential amount of future payments (undiscounted);
           -  The current carrying amount of the liability for the guarantor's
              obligation under the guarantee;
           -  The nature of any recourse provisions.

       Guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002 must follow the new
       accounting. The disclosure requirements were effective for the 2002
       financial statements and did not have an impact on the Company's results
       of operations or its financial position in 2002. The recognition
       provisions will be adopted by the Company in 2003 and are not expected to
       have a significant impact on the Company's financial statements.

       SFAS No. 145, "Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment
       of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections," was effective
       February 2, 2003 for the Company. The standard rescinds FASB Statements
       No. 4 and 64 that deal with issues relating to the extinguishment of
       debt. The standard also rescinds FASB Statement No. 44 that deals with
       intangible assets of motor carriers. The standard modifies FASB Statement
       No. 13, "Accounting for Leases," so that certain capital lease
       modifications must be accounted for by lessees as sale-leaseback
       transactions. Additionally, the standard identifies amendments that
       should have been made to previously existing pronouncements and formally
       amends the appropriate pronouncements. The provisions of this standard
       related to the rescission of SFAS No. 4 are in effect in 2003. The
       remaining provisions of the statement were adopted by the Company for
       transactions occurring after May 15, 2002.



       SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
       Activities," requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit
       or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at fair value
       when the liability is incurred. The provisions of the standard are
       effective for exit or



                                       36

       disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. The adoption of
       SFAS No. 146 did not have a significant impact on the Company's financial
       statements.


       SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and
       Disclosure-an Amendment to FASB No. 123," was issued on December 31,
       2002. Pursuant to this standard, companies that choose to adopt the
       accounting provisions of FASB No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
       Compensation," will be permitted to select from three transition methods
       (prospective, modified prospective, and retroactive restatement).

       Companies that choose not to adopt the accounting provisions of FASB No.
       123 will be affected by the new disclosure requirements of FASB No. 148.
       The new disclosures include tabular presentation of the following
       information for all periods presented:

           1.   Net income and earnings per share (basic and diluted),
                as reported;
           2.   Compensation expense (if any), net of tax, included in reported
                net income;
           3.   Compensation expense that would have been included in net income
                had the Company adopted the accounting provisions of FASB No.
                123 for all awards granted, modified or settled since December
                15, 1994;
           4.   Pro forma net income and earnings per share.

       The transition and annual disclosure provisions of FASB No. 148 are
       effective for the 2002 financial statements. The new interim disclosure
       provisions are effective in the first quarter of 2003.

       Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue 02-16, "Accounting by a
       Customer (Including a Reseller) For Cash Consideration Received from a
       Vendor," addresses the accounting treatment for cash vendor allowances
       received. The adoption of EITF Issue 02-16 in 2003 did not have an impact
       on the Company's financial position or results of operations.

       Annual store rent is comprised of a fixed minimum amount, plus contingent
       rent based on a percentage of sales exceeding a stipulated amount. Store
       lease terms generally require additional payments covering taxes, common
       area costs and certain other expenses.

       Income taxes payable included net current deferred tax assets of $6.0
       million and $4.9 million at February 1, 2003 and February 2, 2002,
       respectively.

       Under a tax sharing arrangement with The Limited, who owned 84.2% of the
       outstanding Common Stock through May 19, 1998, the Company was
       responsible for and paid to The Limited its proportionate share of income
       taxes calculated upon its separate taxable income at the estimated annual
       effective tax rate for periods prior to May 19, 1998. Amounts paid to The
       Limited totaled $1.4 million, $20 thousand and $829 thousand in 2002,
       2001 and 2000, respectively. Amounts paid directly to taxing authorities
       were $82.3 million, $94.3 million and $111.7 million in 2002, 2001 and
       2000, respectively. The amount paid to The Limited during 2002
       constituted a final tax sharing payment pursuant to an agreement to
       terminate the tax sharing agreement entered into with The Limited as of
       May 19, 1998. As a result, the Company has been indemnified by the
       Limited for any federal, state or local income taxes asserted with
       respect to The Limited for all periods prior to May 19, 1998.

       No valuation allowance has been provided for deferred tax assets because
       management believes that it is more likely than not that the full amount
       of the net deferred tax assets will be realized in the future.

8.     LONG-TERM DEBT

       The Company entered into a $250 million syndicated unsecured credit
       agreement (the "New Credit Agreement") on November 14, 2002 to replace
       both a $150 million syndicated unsecured credit agreement (the "Old
       Credit Agreement") and a separate $75 million facility for the issuance
       of trade letters of credit. The primary purposes of the New Credit
       Agreement are for trade and stand-by letters of credit and working
       capital. The New Credit Agreement is due to expire on November 14, 2005.
       The New Credit Agreement has several borrowing options, including
       interest rates that are based on the agent bank's "Alternate Base Rate,"
       or a LIBO Rate. Facility fees payable under the New Credit Agreement are
       based on the Company's ratio (the "leverage ratio") of the sum of total
       debt plus 800% of forward minimum rent commitments to EBITDAR for the
       trailing four-fiscal-quarter period and currently accrues at .225% of the
       committed amounts per annum. The New Credit Agreement contains
       limitations on indebtedness, liens, sale-leaseback transactions,
       significant corporate changes including mergers and acquisitions with
       third parties, investments, restricted payments (including dividends and
       stock repurchases), hedging transactions and transactions with
       affiliates. The New Credit Agreement also contains financial covenants
       requiring a minimum ratio of EBITDAR for the trailing four-fiscal-quarter
       period to the sum of interest expense and minimum rent for such period,
       as well as a maximum leverage ratio. Letters of credit totaling
       approximately $41.8 million were outstanding under the New Credit
       Agreement at February 1, 2003. Letters of credit totaling approximately
       $49.9 million were outstanding under the $75 million facility for the
       issuance of trade letters of credit at February 2, 2002. No borrowings
       were outstanding under the New Credit Agreement at February 1, 2003 or
       under the Old Credit Agreement at February 2, 2002.

9.     RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

       Shahid & Company, Inc. has provided advertising and design services for
       the Company since 1995. Sam N. Shahid Jr., who serves on A&F's Board of
       Directors, has been President and Creative Director of Shahid & Company,
       Inc. since 1993. Fees paid to Shahid & Company, Inc. for services
       provided during fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000 were approximately $1.9
       million, $1.8 million and $1.7 million, respectively. These amounts do
       not include reimbursements to Shahid & Company, Inc. for expense incurred
       while performing these services.

       On January 1, 2002, A&F loaned the amount of $4,953,833 to its Chairman,
       a major shareholder of A&F, pursuant to the terms of a replacement
       promissory note, which provided that such amount was due and payable on
       December 31, 2002. The outstanding principal under the note did not bear
       interest as the net sales threshold, per the terms of the note, was met.
       This note was paid in full by the Chairman on December 31, 2002.

       This note constituted a replacement of, and substitute for, several
       promissory notes dated from November 17, 1999 through May 18, 2001.

10.    STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED SHARES

       Under A&F's stock plans, associates and non-associate directors may be

       A total of 1,046,000, 19,000 and 102,000 restricted shares were granted
       in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, with a total market value at grant
       date of $28.0 million, $.6 million and $2.3 million, respectively. Of the
       restricted shares granted in 2002, 1,000,000 shares were awarded to the
       Company's Chairman, which become vested on December 31, 2008 provided the
       Chairman remains continuously employed by the Company through such date.
       The remaining restricted share grants generally vest either on a
       graduated scale over four years or 100% at the end of a fixed vesting
       period, principally five years. The market value of restricted shares is
       being amortized as compensation expense over the vesting period,
       generally four to five years. Compensation expenses related to restricted
       share awards amounted to $2.3 million, $3.9 million and $4.3 million in
       2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

11.    RETIREMENT BENEFITS

       The Company participates in a qualified defined contribution retirement
       plan and a nonqualified supplemental retirement plan. Participation in
       the qualified plan is available to all associates who have completed
       1,000 or more hours of service with the Company during certain 12-month
       periods and attained the age of 21. Participation in the nonqualified
       plan is subject to service and compensation requirements. The Company's
       contributions to these plans are based on a percentage of associates'
       eligible annual compensation. The cost of these plans was $5.6 million in
       2002, $3.9 million in 2001 and $3.0 million in 2000.

       Effective February 2, 2003, the Company established a Supplemental
       Executive Retirement Plan to provide additional retirement income to its
       Chairman. Subject to service requirements, the Chairman will receive a
       monthly prorated share of his final average compensation (as defined in
       the Plan) for life.

12.    CONTINGENCIES

       The Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings. Although it is
       not possible to predict with any certainty the eventual outcome of any
       legal proceedings, it is the opinion of management that the ultimate
       resolution of these matters will not have a material impact on the
       Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position.


                                       42
<PAGE>


       The Company has standby letters of credit in the amount of $4.7 million
       that expire in 1 year. The beneficiary, a merchandise supplier, has the
       right to draw upon the standby letters of credit if the Company has
       authorized or filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy. To date, the
       beneficiary has not drawn upon the standby letters of credit.

       The Company enters into agreements with professional services firms, in
       the ordinary course of business and, in most agreements, indemnifies
       these firms from any harm. There is no financial impact on the Company
       related to these indemnifications.

13.    PREFERRED STOCK PURCHASE RIGHTS

       On July 16, 1998, A&F's Board of Directors declared a dividend of .50 of
       a Series A Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock Purchase Right
       (Right) for each outstanding share of Class A Common Stock, par value
       $.01 per share (Common Stock), of A&F. The dividend was paid to
       shareholders of record on July 28, 1998. Shares of Common Stock issued
       after July 28, 1998 and prior to the Distribution Date described below
       will be issued with a Right attached. Under certain conditions, each
       whole Right may be exercised to purchase one one-thousandth of a share of
       Series A Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock at an initial price of
       $250. The Rights initially will be attached to the shares of Common
       Stock. The Rights will separate from the Common Stock and a Distribution
       Date will occur upon the earlier of 10 business days after a public
       announcement that a person or group has acquired beneficial ownership of
       20% or more of A&F's outstanding shares of Common Stock and become an
       "Acquiring Person" (Share Acquisition Date) or 10 business days (or such
       later date as the Board shall determine before any person has become an
       Acquiring Person) after commencement of a tender or exchange offer which
       would result in a person or group beneficially owning 20% or more of
       A&F's outstanding Common Stock. The Rights are not exercisable until the
       Distribution Date.

       In the event that any person becomes an Acquiring Person, each holder of
       a Right (other than the Acquiring Person and certain affiliated persons)
       will be entitled to purchase, upon exercise of the Right, shares of
       Common Stock having a market value two times the exercise price of the
       Right. At any time after any person becomes an Acquiring Person (but
       before any person becomes the beneficial owner of 50% or more of the
       outstanding shares), A&F's Board of Directors may exchange all or part of
       the Rights (other than Rights beneficially owned by an Acquiring Person
       and certain affiliated persons) for shares of Common Stock at an exchange
       ratio of one share of Common Stock per Right. In the event that, at any
       time following the Share Acquisition Date, A&F is acquired in a merger or
       other business combination transaction in which A&F is not the surviving
       corporation, the Common Stock is exchanged for other securities or assets
       or 50% or more of A&F's assets or earning power is sold or transferred,
       the holder of a Right will be entitled to buy, for the exercise price of
       the Rights, the number of shares of Common Stock of the acquiring company
       which at the time of such transaction will have a market value of two
       times the exercise price of the Right.

       The Rights, which do not have any voting rights, expire on July 16, 2008,

To the Board of Directors and
Shareholders of Abercrombie & Fitch Co:

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related
consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity and cash flows present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Abercrombie & Fitch
Co. and its subsidiaries at February 1, 2003 and February 2, 2002, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended February 1, 2003 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company's management; our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We
conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards
generally accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

2002 STOCK OPTION PLAN FOR ASSOCIATES

In January 2002, the Board of Directors of A&F adopted the 2002 Associates Plan,
which is administered by the Compensation Committee. The 2002 Associates Plan
reserves for issuance up to 5,000,000 shares of Common Stock of A&F upon the
exercise of non-qualified stock options ("NSOs") granted and to be granted under
the 2002 Associates Plan. Shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of
NSOs



                                       48
<PAGE>

will be made available from shares currently held or subsequently acquired
by A&F as treasury shares. The number of shares of Common Stock authorized for
issuance under the 2002 Associates Plan and the number of shares subject to
previously granted but unexercised NSOs will be subject to adjustment for any
future stock splits, stock dividends or other changes in A&F's corporate
structure affecting the shares of Common Stock.

Eligibility for Participation

Associates of A&F and its subsidiaries who are selected by the Compensation
Committee are eligible to participate in the 2002 Associates Plan. No NSOs may
be granted under the 2002 Associates Plan to outside directors.

Terms of NSOs

The exercise price of NSOs granted under the 2002 Associates Plan has been and
will be equal to 100% of the fair market value of A&F's Common Stock on the
grant date. Payment of the exercise price may be made in cash, or at the
discretion of the Compensation Committee, shares of Common Stock already owned
by the option holder. Each NSO has and will have a term of ten years from its
grant date. The Compensation Committee will determine the vesting schedule for
each NSO at the time of grant and may accelerate the exercisability of any NSO
at any time. The NSOs become fully exercisable in the event of defined changes
of control of A&F. If an option holder's employment is terminated by reason of
total disability, the NSOs may thereafter be exercised in full for the first
nine months that the option holder receives benefits under A&F's long-term
disability program, subject to their stated term. If an option holder's
employment is terminated by reason of death, the NSOs may thereafter be
exercised in full for a period of one year after the date of the option holder's
death or any other period which the Compensation Committee determines, subject
to their stated term. If an option holder's employment is terminated for any
other reason, any exercisable NSOs held by the option holder at the date of
termination may be exercised for the period specified in the option agreement or
as otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee. At the discretion of the
Compensation Committee, the NSOs may have a tax withholding feature.

ITEM 14.      CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Within the 90-day period prior to the filing of this report, A&F management,
including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an
evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's
disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-14(c)
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based on that evaluation, the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company's
disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the date of that
evaluation to ensure that material information relating to the Company is made
known to them, particularly during the period for which this Annual Report on
Form 10-K has been prepared. There have been no significant changes in internal
controls, or in factors that could significantly affect internal controls,
subsequent to the date the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
completed their evaluation.
