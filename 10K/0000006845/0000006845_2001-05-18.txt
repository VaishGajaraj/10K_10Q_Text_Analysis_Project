ITEM 1.   BUSINESS

The Company
-----------

Apogee Enterprises, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State of
Minnesota in 1949. The Company, through its subsidiaries, is a leader in
technologies involving the design and development of value-added glass products,
services and systems for the non-residential building, commercial and automotive
markets. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms "Company" and "Apogee"
as used herein refer to Apogee Enterprises, Inc. and its subsidiaries.

During fiscal 2001, the Company realigned its reporting segments to match the
markets they serve in order to underscore the Company's growth potential and to
reflect its changing business mix and focus. The new segments are Architectural
Products and Services (Architectural), Large-Scale Optical Technologies (LSO)
and Automotive Replacement Glass and Services (Auto Glass). The Architectural
segment designs, engineers, fabricates and installs the walls of glass and
windows comprising the outside skin of commercial and institutional buildings.
The LSO segment develops and produces high technology glass that enhances the
visual performance of products for the display, imaging and picture framing
industries. The Auto Glass segment fabricates, repairs and replaces automobile
windshields and windows. Financial information about the Company's segments can
be found in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of Apogee
Enterprises, Inc. contained elsewhere in this report. See "Index of Financial
Statements and Schedules." Prior periods have been restated to reflect these new
segments.

During fiscal 2001, the Company completed the sale of substantially all of the
assets of VIS'N Service Corporation (VIS'N), a non-auto glass focused,
third-party administered claims processor, in two separate transactions. In
fiscal 2000, the Company completed the sale of 100% of the stock of its
large-scale domestic curtainwall business, Harmon, Ltd., and the divestiture of
the detention/security operations. Combined with the fiscal 1998 exit from
international curtainwall operations, these transactions effectively removed the
Company from the large-scale construction business and the third-party
administered claims processing business. Accordingly, these businesses are
presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements
and notes. Prior periods have been restated.

Architectural Products and Services (Architectural)
---------------------------------------------------

The companies within the Architectural segment design, engineer, fabricate and
install the walls of glass and windows comprising the outside skin of commercial
and institutional buildings. The businesses in this segment include: Viracon,
the leading global fabricator of coated, high-performance architectural glass;
Harmon, Inc., the Company's full service building glass installation and
maintenance business; Wausau Window & Wall Systems, a manufacturer of custom,
non-residential aluminum window systems and curtainwall; and Linetec, one of the
largest U.S. architectural paint and anodizing finishers.

Viracon fabricates finished glass products and provides glass-coating services.
This operating unit purchases flat, unprocessed glass in bulk quantities from
which a variety of glass products are fabricated, including insulated,
heat-processed and laminated architectural glass, security glass and laminated
industrial glass.

The Viracon unit is able to fabricate all types of architectural glass
(insulated, laminated and combinations of both) at its Owatonna, Minnesota and
its Statesboro, Georgia facilities. Combined with its glass coating
capabilities, the unit is able to provide a full range of products from these
facilities. Viracon will continue to meet complex requirements and lead in
innovation with an increase in silkscreening capacity and the introduction of a
highly reflective, energy-efficient glass in fiscal 2002.

Insulated glass, comprised of two or more pieces of glass separated by a sealed
air space, is used in architectural and residential applications for thermal
control. Laminated glass consists of two or more pieces of glass fused with a
plastic interlayer and is used primarily for strength and safety in skylights
and in security applications. Viracon's reflective and low-emissivity coatings
reduce energy costs and provide innovative design features for window and
curtainwall systems. Low-emissivity coatings are an invisible, metallic film
deposited on glass which selectively limits the transfer of heat through the
glass. Low-emissivity coated glass represents a fast-growing segment of both
residential and nonresidential glass markets.

Viracon markets its products nationally and overseas to glass distributors,
contractors and industrial glass fabricators. A substantial portion of its glass
product is delivered to customers by Viracon's fleet of company-owned trucks,
providing "backhaul" capability for its raw materials, thereby reducing shipping
time, transportation costs and breakage expense.

Harmon, Inc. offers complete design, engineering, installation and replacement
or glazing services for commercial, institutional and other buildings. Harmon,
Inc. emphasizes projects that are relatively small in comparison to Apogee's
discontinued large-scale curtainwall operations. While the installation of
building glass in new construction projects is the core business, service and
retrofit


                                       3
<PAGE>

construction of older buildings are adding to growth. This unit offers 24-hour
replacement service for storm or vandalism damage. In-house engineering
capabilities allow Harmon, Inc. to duplicate the original design or create a
completely new appearance for renovated buildings.

Wausau Window & Wall Systems (Wausau) designs and manufactures high-quality,
thermally-efficient aluminum window and curtainwall systems. These products meet
high standards of wind load capacity and resistance to air and moisture
infiltration. Wausau's aluminum window frame designs are engineered to be
thermally efficient, utilizing high-strength polyurethane to limit the transfer
of heat or cold through the window frame. Products are marketed through a
nationwide network of distributors and a direct sales staff. Sales are made to
building contractors and to building owners for retrofitting older buildings.
Wausau maintains design and product engineering staffs to prepare aluminum
window and curtainwall system designs to fit customers' needs and to originate
new product designs.

Linetec has two metal-coating facilities which provide anodized and
fluoropolymer coatings to metal. Anodizing is the electrolytic process of
putting a protective, often colored, oxide film on light metal, typically
aluminum. Fluoropolymer coatings are high quality paints which are sometimes
preferred over anodizing because of the wider color selection. Coatings are
applied to window and curtainwall components for industrial metal fabricators
(including Wausau), as well as other companies' metal, plastic, wood or glass
products. A significant portion of Linetec's revenues are generated from
painting home and commercial shutters.

Large-Scale Optical Technologies (LSO)
--------------------------------------

LSO companies develop and produce high technology glass that enhances the visual
performance of products for the display, imaging and picture framing industries.
Businesses in this segment include: Tru Vue, a leading U.S. value-added glass
and matboard manufacturer for the art and framing industry; and Viratec Thin
Films, a leading global producer of optical thin film coatings for the display
and imaging markets.

Tru Vue is one of the largest domestic manufacturers of value-added picture
framing glass. Tru Vue provides its customers with a full array of picture
framing glass products, including clear, reflection control, which diminishes
reflection and enhances clarity, and conservation glass, which substantially
blocks ultraviolet rays to protect artwork. Tru Vue compliments its glass
product offering with sales of conservation picture framing matboard. The
products are distributed primarily through independent distributors which, in
turn, supply local picture framing markets. In fiscal 2001, Tru Vue expanded its
pre-framed art business through the acquisitions of Balangier Fine Art and
Designs, and Corporate Art Services, Inc. Also, by demonstrating the financial
benefit of moving to value-added glass, Tru Vue converted three mass
merchandisers and 1,000 frame shops from plain framing glass to TruGuard(TM),
its proprietary glass that protects pictures and art from deteriorating in
sunlight, in fiscal 2001. In anticipation of converting additional frame shops
and mass merchandisers this year, Tru Vue will install a second production line
for this product.

Viratec develops advanced, optical-display and imaging coatings for glass and
other surfaces. These products are used in anti-glare computer screens,
high-quality optical components and high performance mirror products for the
imaging industry. Viratec markets optical display and imaging products to both
domestic and overseas customers. These customers provide further assembly,
marketing and distribution to end-users. Viratec's Optium(TM) coating line was
relocated in fiscal 1999 from Minnesota to southern California, a location
closer to the flow of customers' computer monitor supply chains. This facility
will be closed during fiscal 2002 following notice received in late fiscal 2001
that its primary customer planned to discontinue its computer monitor operations
in southern California, thereby eliminating the need for Viratec's facility in
southern California. The facility closing is not expected to have a significant
impact on the Company's fiscal 2002 operating results.

Automotive Replacement Glass and Services (Auto Glass)
------------------------------------------------------

Auto Glass companies fabricate, repair and replace automobile windshields and
windows. Businesses in this segment include: Harmon AutoGlass, the nation's
second largest chain of retail auto glass replacement and repair stores; and
Viracon/Curvlite, a leading U.S. fabricator of aftermarket foreign and domestic
car windshields.

Harmon AutoGlass, a Minneapolis-based company, is the second largest auto glass
retailer in the United States. Harmon AutoGlass opened its first shop over 50
years ago in downtown Minneapolis and today has grown to 454 retail service
centers, including co-branded facilities, in 44 states and 820 mobile
installation vehicles. In addition to its own shops, Harmon AutoGlass has a
network of more than 4,000 affiliated auto glass retailers across the country.

In an effort to enhance efficiency, geographic coverage and customer service in
the distribution of auto replacement glass, the Company and PPG Industries
combined their U.S. automotive replacement glass distribution businesses in July
2000 to create a new entity, PPG Auto Glass, LLC (PPG Auto Glass), of which the
Company has a 34 percent interest. As part of the arrangements with this joint
venture, Harmon has committed, under a long-term contract, to purchase a
majority of its replacement windshield needs from the joint venture. Harmon
AutoGlass also eliminated two layers of field management to bring leadership
closer to the customer


                                       4
<PAGE>

and closed 37 under-performing shops, or about 11 percent of total facilities
while maintaining service coverage in all impacted markets. Harmon AutoGlass has
also outsourced to APAC Customer Services, Inc. for call center insurance
claims processing to improve customer service and obtain a technological
advantage.

Harmon AutoGlass has a diverse customer base, including insurance companies,
commercial fleets and consumers. While Harmon AutoGlass' primary business is
windshield repair and replacement, some Harmon AutoGlass retail stores also
offer an inventory of flat glass for home window repair and table tops. Harmon
AutoGlass' Web site provides information on safety and technology, and allows
customers to locate stores and conveniently schedule appointments online.

Harmon AutoGlass is committed to its values of safety, quality, expertise and
customer service. Harmon AutoGlass believes that it has one of the best customer
satisfaction ratings in the industry. Harmon AutoGlass is an industry leader in
employee training by having all of its technicians participate in a rigorous
internal certification program. Harmon AutoGlass also requires technicians to be
certified by the National Auto Glass Association.

Viracon/Curvlite (Curvlite) fabricates replacement windshields for foreign and
domestic automobiles and laminated glass parts for the RV and bus industries.
Under a long-term agreement with PPG Industries, Inc. (PPG), Curvlite's
automotive replacement glass production is dedicated to PPG, and Curvlite is now
fabricating approximately 500 different parts, about half the number
manufactured previously.

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
-----------------------------------------

None of the Company's operating units are significantly dependent upon any one
supplier. The Company believes a majority of its raw materials (bulk flat glass,
aluminum extrusions, automotive glass and related materials) are available from
a variety of domestic sources.

Trademarks and Patents
----------------------

The Company has several nationally recognized trademarks and trade names which
it believes have significant value in the marketing of its products. Harmon
AutoGlass(R), Viratec(R), Tru Vue(R), TruGuard(R), Linetec(R) and Glass Depot(R)
are registered trademarks and Optium(TM) is a listed trademark of the Company.
PPG Auto Glass is a trademark of PPG Industries. Viratec Thin Films has obtained
several patents pertaining to its glass coating methods. However, no single
patent is considered to be material to the Company.

Customers
---------

The customer base of the Company is a diverse group which includes retailers,
distribution outlets, general and sub-contractors, OEM manufacturers and
end-users. No one customer accounts for 10% or more of the Company's
consolidated revenues, although, due to the auto glass distribution joint
venture with PPG, PPG Auto Glass has become the primary customer of Curvlite,
the Auto Glass segment's manufacturer of replacement windshields for the
automobiles. In the opinion of management, the loss of any single customer would
not have a material long-term adverse effect on the Company.

Backlog
-------

At March 3, 2001, the Company's total backlog of orders considered to be firm
was $200,218,000 compared with $175,137,000 at February 26, 2000. Of this
amount, approximately $190,000,000 of orders were in the Architectural segment.

Competition
-----------

The Company's businesses are in industries that are, in general, fairly mature
and highly competitive. Businesses in the Architectural and LSO segments
(Viracon, Viratec and Tru Vue) compete with several large integrated glass
manufacturers and numerous smaller specialty fabricators. Product pricing and
service are the primary competitive factors in these markets. Harmon, Inc.
competes against local and regional construction companies where primary
competitive factors are quality engineering and service. Wausau competes against
several major aluminum window manufacturers while Linetec competes against
regional paint and anodizing companies. These companies primarily serve the
custom portion of the construction market in which the primary competitive
factors are product quality, reliable service and the ability to provide
technical engineering and design services. The Auto Glass segment competes with
other auto glass shops, glass warehouses, car dealers, body shops and
fabrication facilities on the basis of pricing and customer service. Its
competition consists of national and regional chains as well as significant
local competition.


                                       5

Markets
-------

The Architectural Products and Services (Architectural) companies design,
engineer, fabricate and install the walls of glass and windows comprising the
outside skin of commercial and institutional buildings. The markets that these
businesses serve are very competitive, price sensitive and affected by changes
in the commercial construction industry as well as, in general, economic
conditions.

The Large-Scale Optical Technologies (LSO) companies develop and produce high
technology glass that enhances the visual performance of products for display,
imaging and picture framing industries. The markets that these businesses serve
are very competitive, highly responsive to new products and price sensitive.

The Automotive Replacement Glass and Services (Auto Glass) companies fabricate,
repair and replace automobile windshields and windows. The market that these
businesses serve tends to be cyclical in nature and is influenced by a variety
of factors, including weather, new car sales, speed limits, road conditions, the
economy, and average annual number of miles driven. This market's pricing
structure has changed significantly in recent years as insurance companies seek
volume pricing at discounted rates from historical levels and attempt to enter
into preferred or exclusive provider arrangements with a limited number of
providers. Consequently, margins have narrowed at the retail, wholesale and
manufacturing levels, in which the Auto Glass segment operates.

Research and Development
------------------------

The amount spent on research and development activities over the past three
fiscal years was $3.0 million in fiscal 2001, $2.4 million in fiscal 2000 and
$2.9 million in fiscal 1999. The Company's investment in TerraSun LLC relates to
a research and development venture of which the Company has a 50 percent
ownership. TerraSun is developing holographic optical technologies for lighting
and energy systems applications.

Environment
-----------

To comply with environmental regulations, Linetec's paint facility utilizes an
oxidizer to remove volatile organic compounds (VOC's) generated from the
spraying of solvent based paints. Linetec also sends excess paint and area
liquids to a certified waste treatment facility for disposal. In addition to
these processes, caustic soda is used in Linetec's anodizing operation. This is
then neutralized prior to discharge into a waste water treatment facility.

The Company's Tru Vue facility also has a process in which caustic soda is
neutralized prior to discharge into a waste water treatment facility. Tru Vue
also removes acid fumes through a wet-scrubbing system.

The Company's Viracon facility ships its scrap glass to a company that recycles
glass.

Employees
---------

The Company employed 5,912 persons at March 3, 2001, of whom approximately 696
were represented by labor unions. The Company is a party to 44 collective
bargaining agreements with several different unions. Approximately 18% of the
collective bargaining agreements will expire during fiscal 2002. The number of
collective bargaining agreements to which the Company is a party will vary with
the number of cities with active nonresidential construction contracts. The
Company considers its employee relations to be very good and has not recently
experienced any significant loss of work days due to strike.

Foreign Operations and Export Sales
-----------------------------------

During the years ended March 3, 2001, February 26, 2000 and February 27, 1999,
the Company's export sales, principally from Architectural operations, amounted
to approximately $40,001,000, $42,096,000 and $40,316,000, respectively.

1.       Space has been vacated, due to PPG Auto Glass joint venture, and is
         being considered for alternative uses or sale.
2.       Space has been vacated since the outsourcing arrangement with APAC and
         is being considered for alternative uses or sale.

In addition to the locations indicated above, at fiscal year-end, the Automotive
Replacement Glass and Services segment operated 287 Harmon AutoGlass retail
locations and 167 co-branded facilities nationally. The majority of such
locations are leased. Also, Architectural Products and Services' Harmon, Inc.
unit operated 14 leased locations. The Company owns 4 distribution centers that
are currently leased to PPG Auto Glass.

The Viracon/Curvlite plant, a Wausau Window & Wall Systems facility, the Linetec
paint facility, and the Call Center in Florida were constructed with the use of
proceeds from industrial revenue bonds issued by those cities. These properties
are considered owned, since at the end of the bond term, title reverts to the
Company.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
         -----------------

Apogee has been a party to various legal proceedings incidental to its normal
operating activities. In particular, like others in the construction industry,
the Company's discontinued construction business is routinely involved in
various disputes and claims arising out of construction projects, sometimes
involving significant monetary damages. Although it is impossible to predict the
outcome of such proceedings, the Company believes, based on facts currently
available to management, that none of such claims will result in losses that
would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
        -----------------------------------------------------------------------
        OF OPERATIONS
        -------------

Introduction
In fiscal 2001, Apogee experienced enhanced revenues and earnings primarily
through improved operational efficiencies, as well as through better equipment
utilization and increased market share. Highlights for the year included the
following:

o  Realignment of the reporting segments with the markets they serve to
   underscore Apogee's growth potential and to reflect Apogee's changing
   business mix and focus.
o  Completion of the ramp-up of the fiscal 2000 start-up of Apogee's
   Statesboro, Georgia plant to support Viracon's continued growth for
   high-end manufactured architectural glass.
o  Formation of PPG Auto Glass, LLC joint venture to enhance efficiency,
   geographic coverage and customer service in the distribution of auto
   replacement glass.
o  Improved operating efficiencies through cost reduction initiatives at
   Apogee's Harmon AutoGlass, which are expected to result in annual
   savings of $5 million.
o  Acquisition of two manufacturers in the $2 billion pre-framed art
   market, which expands the markets for Apogee's Tru Vue products.
o  Reduction of long-term debt to $104 million at the end of fiscal 2001
   from $164 million at the end of fiscal 2000.

Performance
Fiscal 2001 Compared To Fiscal 2000
Consolidated net sales increased 3% in fiscal 2001 to $865.2 million from $840.5
million in fiscal 2000. The results of the Auto Glass distribution unit, which
Apogee contributed to the PPG Auto Glass joint venture, were not included in
Apogee's continuing operations for the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2001,
as they were through the second quarter of fiscal 2001. Fiscal 2001 revenues
grew 11% compared to the prior year after being adjusted for the formation of
the joint venture. The majority of the increase is attributable to increased
unit production due to the full-year impact of plant expansions completed during
fiscal 2000, enhanced equipment utilization and the impact of fiscal year 2001
acquisitions. Additionally, fiscal 2001 comprised of 53 weeks while fiscal 2000
comprised of 52 weeks.

The following table illustrates the relationship between various components of
operations, stated as a percent of net sales, for each of the fiscal years in
the three-year period ended March 3, 2001. Fiscal 1999 results are restated to
reflect the effect of discontinued operations reported during fiscal 2000.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On a consolidated basis, cost of sales, as a percentage of net sales, fell to
79.3% for fiscal 2001, improving from 80.1% in fiscal 2000. The primary factors
underlying the resulting increase in gross profit percentage were improved
performance attributable to enhanced manufacturing performance within the
Architectural and Large-Scale Optical segments, as well as cost reduction
initiatives within the Automotive Replacement Glass segment. These improvements
were partially offset by higher general liability and health insurance related
expenses across all segments.

Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, as a percentage of sales,
decreased to 17.0% from 17.6%. After being adjusted for the formation of the PPG
Auto Glass joint venture, SG&A expenses decreased, as a percentage of sales,


                                       12
<PAGE>

from 18.5% in fiscal 2000. The primary factor for the decrease was due to the
cost reduction initiatives implemented at the Automotive Replacement Glass
segment, as well as reductions in expenses related to doubtful accounts across
all segments. These were offset by increases in amounts expensed for bonuses and
incentives.

Net interest expense rose slightly to $11.1 million, or 1.3% of sales, in fiscal
2001. The increase reflected higher weighted-average interest rates under the
Company's revolving credit agreement. This was somewhat offset by lower average
borrowing levels during fiscal 2001 as compared to fiscal 2000.

Apogee's equity in income from affiliated companies was $1.5 million in fiscal
2001 compared to an equity in loss from affiliated companies of $2.8 million a
year ago. Income associated with the Company's PPG Auto Glass joint venture,
including rationalization and other transaction related adjustments, was offset
by the Company's TerraSun research and development joint venture. The PPG Auto
Glass joint venture formed on July 29, 2000, combined the Company's and PPG's
U.S. automotive replacement glass distribution businesses into a newly formed
entity, PPG Auto Glass, LLC, with the Company having a 34% ownership interest in
the joint venture. Fiscal 2000 results were largely attributable to TerraSun.

Apogee's effective income tax rate of 39.9% of pre-tax earnings from continuing
operations decreased from the 50.8% of pre-tax earnings from continuing
operations reported in fiscal 2000. This reduction is due to the relationship of
book and tax differences as a percentage of pre-tax income.

Apogee's fiscal 2001 earnings from continuing operations increased to $13.4
million or $0.48 diluted earnings per share. This compared to earnings from
continuing operations of $3.1 million, or $0.11 diluted earnings per share, a
year earlier.

The Company reported earnings from operations of discontinued businesses of $1.6
million after tax, or $0.06 diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2001 as
compared to $9.1 million after tax, or $ 0.33 diluted earnings per share, a year
earlier.

Apogee's fiscal 2001 net earnings were $15.0 million, or $0.54 diluted earnings
per share. This compared to $12.2 million, or $0.44 diluted earnings per share,
a year ago. The return on average shareholders' equity was 10.5% in fiscal 2001
versus 9.1% for fiscal 2000.

Segment Analysis
During fiscal 2001, the Company realigned its operating business units into
three reporting segments. The following is a discussion on the results of
operations of these three business segments. See Note 17 "Business Segments
Data" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a three-year history
of each segment's net sales, operating income, identifiable assets, capital
expenditures, and depreciation and amortization.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Architectural Products and Services (Architectural). Architectural companies
design, engineer, fabricate and install the walls of glass and windows
comprising the outside skin of commercial and institutional buildings. The
businesses in this segment include: Viracon, the leading global fabricator of
coated, high-performance architectural glass; Harmon, Inc., the Company's full
service building glass installation and maintenance business; Wausau Window &
Wall Systems, a manufacturer of custom, non-residential aluminum window systems
and curtainwall; and Linetec, one of the largest U.S. architectural paint and
anodizing finishers.


                                       13
<PAGE>

Architectural net sales for fiscal 2001 increased 12% over fiscal 2000. Viracon
reported an increase in net sales of 18%, mostly due to the increased capacity
from the full-year impact associated with the completion of the Statesboro
facility. Additionally, strong customer demand for Viracon's high-performance
architectural glass products significantly improved sales volume. Harmon, Inc.
reported a 19% increase in net sales, primarily due to an increased number of
curtainwall installation projects and Linetec improved sales by 5%. These
increases were offset by a slow-down in shipments at Wausau Window & Wall
Systems due to the facility not being able to fill its available short lead-time
capacity during the second half of the year.

Operating income for the segment of $27.4 million represented an increase of 34%
over prior year. This was the result of increased production capacity and
improved utilization at Viracon as well as increased earnings at Harmon, Inc.
and Linetec. These increases were partially offset by reductions in earnings at
Wausau Window & Wall Systems.

The Architectural segment backlog, at March 3, 2001, remained at record levels
of $190.0 million, compared to $153.6 million at February 26, 2000.

Large-Scale Optical Technologies (LSO). LSO companies develop and produce high
technology glass that enhances the visual performance of products for the
display, imaging and picture framing industries. Businesses in this segment
include: Tru Vue, a leading U.S. value-added glass and matboard manufacturer for
the art and framing industry; and Viratec Thin Films, a leading global producer
of optical thin film coatings for the display and imaging markets.

LSO net sales of $90.8 million represented a 30% increase over fiscal 2000. Tru
Vue reported a 25% improvement in sales due to increased demand for their high
margin, value-added glass products. Additionally, Tru Vue expanded its
pre-framed art business through the acquisitions of Balangier Fine Art and
Designs, and Corporate Art Services, Inc. These acquisitions represent 40
percent of the Tru Vue increase for fiscal 2001 sales. Viratec reported a net
sales increase of 37% over fiscal 2000 levels due to strong operational
improvement that allowed for significant volume growth.

LSO operating income of $4.6 million for fiscal 2001 compared favorably to an
operating loss of $0.5 million for fiscal 2000. The increase was the result of
the increased sales volume at both of the segment's operations as well as the
impact of sales of higher margin products from Tru Vue and improved equipment
utilization at Viratec. These increases were offset by acquisition related
integration costs at Tru Vue and the impact of shut down costs for Viratec's San
Diego facility. The shut down of the San Diego facility will not have a material
impact on next year's financial results.

Automotive Replacement Glass and Services (Auto Glass). Auto Glass companies
fabricate, repair and replace automobile windshields and windows. Businesses in
this segment include: Harmon AutoGlass, the nation's second largest chain of
retail auto glass replacement and repair stores; and Viracon/Curvlite, a leading
U.S. fabricator of aftermarket foreign and domestic car windshields.

Auto Glass net sales decreased 12% to $333.3 million in fiscal 2001. Fiscal 2001
revenues for the segment grew 4% compared to the prior year after being adjusted
for the formation of the PPG Auto Glass joint venture. Net sales of the auto
glass retail unit decreased 2% compared with those of a year ago due, in part,
to soft demand for auto replacement glass services. The retail unit volume
decrease was offset by unit price increases. Market data indicates that unit
demand for replacement auto glass in the U.S. rose 4.2% during fiscal 2001. In
an effort to improve margins, Harmon AutoGlass closed retail facilities and
implemented strategies to reduce low margin business. This resulted in a
reduction in volume of 14.9%.

Auto Glass operating income increased to $1.4 million for fiscal 2001 from
operating income of $0.2 million in fiscal 2000. During fiscal 2001, as part of
the Company's initiative to maintain customer service and reduce costs, Harmon
AutoGlass reduced headcount through position eliminations, closed 37
underperforming stores, or nearly 11% of its retail locations, and transitioned
call center operations to APAC Customer Services, Inc. Harmon AutoGlass
continued to maintain a presence in most markets where shop closings occurred.
Viracon/Curvlite reported slightly increased operating income over the prior
year.

At the end of fiscal 2001, Auto Glass had 287 Harmon AutoGlass retail locations
and 167 co-branded facilities. The segment continues to explore opportunities to
increase utilization and improve efficiencies.

Discontinued Operations. During fiscal 2001, the Company completed the sale of
substantially all of the assets of VIS'N Service Corporation (VIS'N), a non-auto
glass focused, third-party administered claims processor, in two separate
transactions with no impact to net earnings. In fiscal 2000, the Company
completed the sale of 100% of the stock of its large-scale domestic curtainwall
business, Harmon, Ltd. In fiscal 1999, Apogee's Board of Directors authorized
the divestiture of the detention/security operations and the Company executed
the sale of the business. The sale of Harmon,


                                       14
<PAGE>

Ltd. and the Company's detention/security business combined with the fiscal 1998
exit from international curtainwall operations effectively removed the Company
from the large-scale construction business. Accordingly, these businesses are
presented as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements
and notes. Prior periods have been restated.

The Company reported after-tax operating income from the businesses reported as
discontinued operations for fiscal 2001 of $1.6 million. This was primarily the
result of cash collected from our international curtainwall operations during
fiscal 2001 that exceeded the anticipated receipts. For fiscal 2000, after-tax
earnings from discontinued operations were $9.1 million.

Fiscal 2000 Compared To Fiscal 1999
Consolidated net sales increased 7% to $840.5 million in fiscal 2000 compared to
fiscal 1999. Net sales increased 13% in the Architectural Products and Services
(Architectural) segment, and 19% at the Large-Scale Optical Technologies (LSO)
segment. Net sales at the Automotive Replacement Glass and Services (Auto Glass)
segment were flat compared to fiscal 1999.

On a consolidated basis, cost of sales, as a percentage of net sales, rose
slightly to 80.1%, up from 78.4% in fiscal 1999. The primary factors underlying
the resulting decline in gross profit were slower than anticipated production
ramp-ups within the Architectural and LSO segments along with increased costs to
increase production velocity at Viracon. Additionally, Apogee experienced
increased costs associated with meeting demand in these segments as well as a
decline in margin in the Auto Glass businesses. These factors were offset by
margin improvements at Harmon, Inc.

Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses grew by $20.8 million, or
16%. The primary factors for the growth were an increase in salaries, allowance
for doubtful accounts, marketing costs, outside services, information systems
and severance costs, offset by a decrease in bonuses and incentives. A portion
of the increased personnel costs represented classification variances associated
with the Company's many system conversions; quantification of such
classifications is not considered cost effective. Gross profit benefited as a
result of these classification variances.

Net interest expense rose 9% to $10.4 million in fiscal 2000. The increase
reflected higher weighted-average outstanding borrowing levels and to a lesser
extent, slightly higher interest rates under the Company's revolving credit
agreement.

Apogee's effective income tax rate was 50.8% of pre-tax earnings from continuing
operations, up substantially from the 37.6% rate recorded in fiscal 1999.

Apogee's equity in loss of affiliated companies was $2.8 million in fiscal 2000
compared to $1.4 million a year ago, largely associated with the Company's
TerraSun research and development joint venture.

Apogee's fiscal 2000 earnings from continuing operations declined to $3.1
million, or $0.11 diluted earnings per share. This compared to earnings from
continuing operations of $20.2 million, or $0.73 diluted earnings per share, a
year earlier.

Earnings from operations of discontinued businesses were $9.1 million after tax,
or $0.33 diluted earnings per share, compared to $5.0 million, or $0.18 diluted
earnings per share, a year earlier.

Apogee's fiscal 2000 net earnings were $12.2 million, or $0.44 diluted earnings
per share. This compared to $25.2 million, or $0.91 diluted earnings per share,
a year ago. The return on average shareholders' equity was 9.1% in fiscal 2000
versus 21.0% for fiscal 1999.

Segment Analysis
The following is a discussion of the results of operations of the Company's
three business segments. See Note 17 "Business Segments Data" in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for a three-year history of each segment's net
sales, operating income, identifiable assets, capital expenditures, and
depreciation and amortization.

Architectural Products and Services (Architectural). Net sales for the
Architectural segment for fiscal 2000 increased 13% to $394.1 million, while
operating income decreased 13% to $20.5 million for the year.

Viracon, the segment's architectural glass fabrication unit, reported a net
sales increase of 8%, while operating earnings decreased significantly in fiscal
2000 as compared to the prior year. The decrease in profitability was the result
of a decrease in earnings at the Owatonna, Minnesota plant and start-up losses
and slower than expected ramp-up at its Statesboro, Georgia facility. Operating
earnings at the Owatonna plant were down compared to fiscal 1999 due to reduced
operating rates and additional costs incurred to position the facility for
improved production velocity.


                                       15
<PAGE>

The Harmon, Inc. business had a solid year. Net sales grew by 29%, while
operating income rose by 75%. Continuing operating improvements and an emphasis
toward higher-margin business helped the unit's profitability.

Wausau Window & Wall Systems, which manufactures commercial windows, had
increased sales of 9% for the year. Operating income decreased for the facility
compared to fiscal 1999.

Linetec, which provides painting and anodizing services, leveraged higher net
sales into a significant operating income increase. This business also continued
to benefit from improvements in its engineering capabilities.

Large-Scale Optical Technologies (LSO). LSO reported a net sales improvement for
fiscal 2000 of 19% to $69.9 million while reporting a significant decrease in
earnings as compared to the prior year.

Tru Vue, the segment's value-added art framing glass and matboard fabrication
unit, posted a 9% improvement in sales, while earnings rose by 26%. These
results reflect increased penetration of the unit's value-added products and
increased capacity and efficiency due to the second quarter completion of a new
production facility in Chicago.

Viratec, which applies optical-grade coatings to glass and other substrates,
reported a net sales increase of 29%, while recording an operating loss. The
operating loss was primarily due to Viratec's flat glass operation which
encountered significant downtime with the start-up of its new vertical coater.
The vertical coater became operational in the third quarter but continued to
experience problems during the remainder of the year. Also, in mid-year,
Viratec's San Diego CRT coating operation lost significant production time
during a technology changeover to accommodate a new product.

Automotive Replacement Glass and Services (Auto Glass). During fiscal 2000 and
1999, Auto Glass operated auto glass businesses under the Harmon AutoGlass
(Harmon), Harmon Solutions Group (Solutions), Glass Depot and Viracon/Curvlite
brands. Due to an industry merger in 1997, Harmon became the second largest
company in the auto glass repair and replacement industry. Fiscal 2000 net sales
at Auto Glass remained flat as compared to fiscal 1999 net sales while operating
income decreased significantly.

Net sales of the Auto Glass retail unit decreased slightly compared with those
of fiscal 1999, although unit volume was flat. A significant operating loss was
recorded due to increased competitive pricing pressures in the retail business
and soft retail demand. Market data indicates that unit demand for replacement
auto glass in the U.S. fell nominally in 1999. Same-location retail net sales
decreased by 8%, while unit net sales were flat with last year. To respond to
changing market conditions, the business was restructured during fiscal 2000 to
reduce fixed cost overhead. In fiscal 2000, 17 retail auto facilities were
closed. In addition, employee headcount was reduced at auto glass headquarters
and to a lesser extent in the field workforce. In addition, retail coverage in
closed store markets was being maintained by mobile vans and service centers
operated from facilities shared with businesses outside of the Company. Unit
sales trends for the AutoGlass retail unit continued to outpace the industry.

The segment's manufacturing operation, Viracon/Curvlite, fabricates auto glass
for the replacement auto glass aftermarket. Viracon/Curvlite's net sales in
fiscal 2000 decreased slightly. The unit's National Distribution Center, which
offered other manufacturers' products as well as Viracon/Curvlite's products for
both domestic and foreign vehicles, and the AutoGlass Express program, a
delivery system to fill customer orders more quickly and completely, accounted
for an increase in unit sales. This increase was offset by a decrease in unit
sales for the broker program, resulting in a slight decrease in unit sales for
fiscal 2000, compared to fiscal 1999. About 61% of Viracon/Curvlite's net sales
were made to the Glass Depot unit in fiscal 2000.

At fiscal year-end, Auto Glass had 324 Harmon AutoGlass retail locations, 143
co-branded facilities and 77 Glass Depot distribution centers.

Discontinued Operations. In late fiscal 2000, Apogee's Board of Directors
authorized the exit from the Company's interest in VIS'N Service Corporation
(VIS'N), a non-auto glass focused, third-party administered claims processor. In
addition, during fiscal 2000, the Company completed the sale of 100% of the
stock of its large-scale domestic curtainwall business, Harmon, Ltd. In fiscal
1999, Apogee's Board of Directors authorized the divestiture of the
detention/security and domestic curtainwall operations. On December 3, 1998, the
segment executed the sale of its detention/security business, effective November
28, 1998. Combined with the fiscal 1998 exit from international curtainwall
operations, these transactions effectively remove the Company from the
large-scale construction business, in addition to the non-auto glass focused
third-party administered claims processing business. Accordingly, these
businesses are presented as discontinued operations in the accompanying
financial statements.


                                       16
<PAGE>

Operating results from the businesses reported as discontinued operations
improved significantly over fiscal 1999. For fiscal 2000, earnings from
discontinued operations were $9.1 million after-tax compared to $5.0 in fiscal
1999.

Capital expenditures                                 14,823       44,025

Debt to invested capital                               37.6%        50.2%

 Net cash provided by operating activities. Cash provided by continuing
operating activities was $61.6 million in fiscal 2001, an increase of $17.8
million compared to last year. The increase was due to improved cash flow
generated by the operating companies during the year, primarily from improved
results. The Company reduced working capital by $41.3 million during the year,
primarily related to contribution of inventory to the PPG Auto Glass joint
venture, but also due to continued focus on reducing working capital.

Net cash provided by investing activities. New capital investment in fiscal 2001
totaled $14.8 million, versus $44.0 million and $77.4 million in fiscal 2000 and
1999, respectively. This reduction is the result of focusing on the expenditures
made in the prior years by completing the start-up at Viracon's Statesboro
facility and of the vertical coater at Viratec's Faribault, Minnesota operation.
In addition, in fiscal 2001, the LSO segment expanded its pre-framed art
business by purchasing two high-end pre-framed art businesses. The aggregate
purchase price for these businesses was $3.6 million, including goodwill of $2.9
million.

During fiscal 2001, the Company entered into a $16 million sale/leaseback
associated with miscellaneous operating equipment. In Fiscal 2000, the Company
entered into a $13.4 million sale/leaseback associated with miscellaneous
operating equipment. The Company used the proceeds of these sale/leaseback
transactions to reduce the Company's long-term floating rate debt and replaced
it with eight-year fixed rate operating leases.

In fiscal 2002, the Company expects to incur capital expenditures as necessary
to maintain existing facilities and information systems. Fiscal 2002
expenditures are expected to be approximately $25 million.

Net cash used in financing activities. In May 1998, the Company obtained a
five-year, committed credit facility in the amount of $275 million. This credit
facility requires Apogee to maintain minimum levels of net worth and certain
financial ratios. The total commitment of the credit facility was reduced by the
sales price, net of taxes, of the fiscal 1999 sale of the detention/security
business, resulting in a committed credit facility of $253 million as of
February 27, 1999. The total commitment of the credit facility was also reduced
in April 2000, resulting in a committed credit facility of $200 million as of
March 3, 2001. The Company's receivables, inventory, equipment and intangibles
secure the credit facility. Based upon the Company's satisfaction of certain
financial covenants during fiscal 2001, the Company has the right to cause this
security interest to be released upon its request.

Long-term debt, including current installments of $0.3 million, stood at $104.5
million at March 3, 2001, down $60.0 million from a year earlier. The majority
of the Company's long-term debt consisted of bank borrowings. During fiscal
2000, $7.7 million of variable rate industrial revenue bonds were issued and the
resulting proceeds were loaned to the Company to finance a portion of the
Company's capital projects in Statesboro and San Diego.

In December 1998, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement,
which expires in fiscal 2004, which effectively converted $25 million of its
variable rate borrowings into a fixed rate obligation. In February 2000, the
Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement, which expires in fiscal
2003, which effectively converted $10 million of its variable rate borrowings
into a fixed rate obligation.

For fiscal 2002, the Company expects that outstanding borrowings will generally
decline over the course of the year. The company believes that cash from
operating activities and the available credit facility provide adequate
liquidity for the next 12 months.


                                       17
<PAGE>

Shareholders' Equity
At March 3, 2001, Apogee's shareholders' equity stood at $148.3 million, up 8%
from a year ago. Book value per share also rose to $5.33, up from $4.97 per
share a year ago, as outstanding common shares increased only nominally during
the year. Net earnings and the proceeds from the issuance of 118,000 shares of
common stock under our stock-based compensation plans accounted for the
increases, which were partly offset by dividends paid of $0.21 per share and the
repurchase of 36,000 shares of common stock.

Market Risks
The Company's principal market risk is sensitivity to interest rates, which is
the risk that changes in interest rates will reduce net earnings of the Company.
To manage the Company's direct risk from changes in market interest rates,
management actively monitors the interest sensitive components of the Company's
balance sheet, primarily debt obligations, as well as market interest rates in
order to minimize the impact of changes in interest rates on net earnings and
cash flow.

The primary measure of interest rate risk is the simulation of net income under
different interest rate environments. The approach used to quantify interest
rate risk is a sensitivity analysis. This approach calculates the impact on net
earnings, relative to a base case scenario, of rates increasing or decreasing
gradually over the next 12 months by 200 basis points. The aforementioned
changes in interest rates affecting the Company's financial instruments would
result in approximately a $400,000 impact to net earnings. As interest rates
increase, net earnings decrease; as interest rates decrease, net earnings
increase.

The Company uses interest swaps to fix a portion of its variable rate borrowings
from fluctuations in interest rates. As of March 3, 2001, the Company has
interest swaps covering $35 million of variable rate debt. The net present
liability associated with these swaps is $1.8 million at the end of fiscal 2001.

The Company has a policy of using forward exchange contracts to hedge its net
exposures, by currency, related to the foreign currency-denominated monetary
assets and liabilities, and future firm commitments of its operations. Forward
exchange contracts are also used from time to time to manage near-term foreign
currency cash requirements. The primary objective of these hedging activities is
to maintain an approximately balanced position in foreign currencies so that
exchange gains and losses resulting from exchange rate changes, net of related
tax effects, are minimized.

Given the Company's balanced foreign exchange position described above, a 10%
adverse change in foreign exchange rates upon which these contracts are based
would result in exchange losses from these contracts that would, in all material
respects, be fully offset by exchange gains on the underlying net monetary
exposures for which the contracts are designated as hedges. As of March 3, 2001,
the Company did not have any forward contracts outstanding as the Company had no
material foreign exchange exposure.

Impact of Inflation
Our financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis, which does not
completely account for the effects of inflation. However, since the cost of many
of our inventories is determined using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of
accounting, cost of sales, except for depreciation expense included therein,
generally reflects current costs.

The cost of glass, one of our primary raw materials, was essentially flat
compared with last year. We expect the cost of glass to increase slightly in
fiscal 2002. While our construction and supply contracts are at fixed prices,
the material components are usually based on firm quotes obtained from
suppliers. Labor costs, including taxes and fringe benefits, rose in fiscal 2001
and a moderate increase also can be reasonably anticipated for fiscal 2002.
Other costs are managed to minimize the inflationary pressures that exist in
markets for goods and services that Apogee's business operations require.

Forward Looking Statements

This discussion contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements reflect the
Company's current views with respect to future events and financial performance.
The words "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "intends," "estimate," "forecast,"
"project," "should" and similar expressions are intended to identify
"forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All forecasts and projections in this document
are "forward-looking statements," and are based on management's current
expectations or beliefs of the Company's near-term results, based on current
information available pertaining to the Company, including the risk factors
noted below.

The Company wishes to caution investors that any forward-looking statements made
by or on behalf of the Company are subject to uncertainties and other factors
that could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements. These

<PAGE>

uncertainties and other risk factors include, but are not limited to, those
noted below. There can be no assurances given that the ongoing reorganization
and realignment of Harmon AutoGlass will lead to successful operating results
now or in the future. Also, there can be no assurances that the ramp-ups of
plant capacity will lead to successful operating results for those companies now
or in the future. There can be no assurances that the closing of the Viratec San
Diego facility will not result in an additional charge to earnings. There can be
no assurances that PPG Auto Glass, Apogee's automotive replacement glass
distribution joint venture with PPG Industries, will achieve favorable
short-term or long-term operating results. In addition, in recent years, there
has been excess capacity at the distribution level of the automotive replacement
glass industry and margins have narrowed. There is no assurance PPG Auto Glass
will achieve any anticipated efficiencies or be able to improve or maintain
margins.

A number of other factors should be considered in conjunction with this report's
forward-looking statements, any discussion of operations or results by the
Company or its representatives and any forward-looking discussion, as well as
comments contained in press releases, presentations to securities analysts or
investors, or other communications by the Company. These other factors are set
forth in the cautionary statement filed as Exhibit 99 to the Company's Annual
Report on Form 10-K, and include, without limitation, cautionary statements
regarding changes in economic and market conditions, factors related to
competitive pricing, commercial building market conditions, management of growth
of business units, greater than expected costs or difficulties related to the
operation of the businesses, the impact of foreign currency markets, the
integration of acquisitions, the realization of expected economies gained
through expansion and information systems technology updates. New factors emerge
from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such
factors, nor can it assess the impact of each such factor on the business or the
extent to which any factor, or a combination of factors, may cause actual
results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking
statements.

         --------------------

On April 15, 1999, the Company determined not to re-engage its independent
auditors, KPMG Peat Marwick LLP ("KPMG") and appointed Arthur Andersen LLP as
its new independent auditors, effective immediately. This determination followed
the Company's decision to seek proposals from independent accounting firms,
including KPMG, with respect to the engagement of independent accountants to
audit the Company's financial statements for the fiscal year ending February 26,
2000. The decision not to re-engage KPMG and to retain Arthur Andersen was
approved by the Company's Board of Directors upon the recommendation of its
Audit Committee.

The reports of KPMG on the financial statements of the Company for its fiscal
years ended February 27, 1999 did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer
of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or
accounting principles. During the Company's two most recent fiscal years and the
subsequent interim period through April 15, 1999, (i) there were no
disagreements between the Company and KPMG on any matter of accounting
principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or
procedure which, if not resolved to the satisfaction of KPMG, would have caused
KPMG to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement
("Disagreement") in connection with its reports and (ii) there were no
reportable events ("Reportable Event"), as defined in Item 304 (a) (1) (v) of
Regulations S-K of the Securities and Exchange Commission, with the exception of
items related to internal control deficiencies of the Company's Asian
construction operations, including inadequate project accounting and review
procedures. The Company agreed with the characterization of said items as
reportable events and undertook appropriate actions to remedy the internal
control deficiencies.

The Company did not, during the Company's two most recent fiscal years prior to
the auditor change and the subsequent interim period through April 15, 1999,
consult with Arthur Andersen regarding (i) the application of accounting
principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type
of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Company's financial statements,
and either a written report was provided to the Company or oral advice was
provided that Arthur Andersen concluded was an important factor considered by
the Company in reaching a decision as to the accounting, auditing or financial
reporting issue, or (ii) any mater that was either the subject of a Disagreement
with KPMG or a Reportable Event.


                                       19

The Company reported the change in accountants on Form 8-K on April 22, 1999.
The Form 8-K contained a letter from KPMG, addressed to the Securities and
Exchange Commission stating that it agreed with the comments in clause (i) of
the second paragraph of the above statements, and was not in a position to agree
or disagree with the comments in the remainder of the above statements.

Report of Independent Public Accountants

To Apogee Enterprises, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Apogee
Enterprises, Inc. (a Minnesota corporation) and subsidiaries as of March 3, 2001
and February 26, 2000, and the related consolidated results of operations,
statements of shareholders' equity and cash flows for the years then ended.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Apogee Enterprises, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of March 3, 2001 and February 26, 2000, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial

fairly, in all material respects, the results of operations and cash flows of
Apogee Enterprises, Inc. and subsidiaries for the year ended February 27, 1999
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a
whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the fiscal 1999 information
set forth therein.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

     1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Related Data

Basis of Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Apogee and all majority-owned subsidiaries (the Company). As
explained in Note 11, the Company's curtainwall contracting and
detention/security contracting businesses are reported as discontinued
operations, along with the Company's interest in VIS'N Service Corporation. The
equity method is used to account for the Company's joint ventures. Intercompany
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain amounts from
prior-years' financial statements have been reclassified to conform with this
year's presentation.

Cash and Cash Equivalents. Investments with an original maturity of three months
or less are included in cash and cash equivalents.

Inventories. Inventories, which consist primarily of purchased glass and
aluminum, are valued at the lower of cost or market. Approximately 93% of the
inventories are valued by use of the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method, which
does not exceed market. If the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method had been used,
inventories would have been $3,135,000 and $3,127,000 higher than reported at
March 3, 2001, and February 26, 2000, respectively.

Property, Plant and Equipment. Property, plant and equipment are carried at
cost. Significant improvements and renewals are capitalized. Repairs and
maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation is computed on a
straight-line basis, based on estimated useful lives of 20 to 40 years for
buildings and 2 to 15 years for equipment.

Intangible Assets and Amortization. Intangible assets consist principally of the
excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired (goodwill) and are
amortized on a straight-line basis, primarily over 40 years. Amortization
expense amounted to $2,370,000, $2,287,000 and $2,060,000 in 2001, 2000 and
1999, respectively.

Long-Lived Assets. The carrying value of long-lived assets such as property,
plant and equipment and intangible assets is reviewed when circumstances suggest
that the assets have been impaired. If this review indicates that the long-lived
assets will not be recoverable based on the estimated undiscounted cash flows
over the remaining amortization period, the carrying value of such assets must
be reduced to estimated fair value. The Company has assets at a net book value
of $14 million associated with a portion of an Enterprise Resource Planning
(ERP) project, the majority of which is in service and is being amortized. In
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 121, the
Company will continue to monitor the viability of this investment.

Insurance Subsidiary. Prism Assurance, Inc. (Prism) is a wholly owned insurance
subsidiary that insures the Company's workers' compensation, general liability
and automobile liability risks. Prism invests in fixed maturity investments
which are classified as "available for sale" and are carried at market value as
prescribed by SFAS No. 115. Reserve requirements are established based on
actuarial projections of ultimate losses. Apogee also has accruals for losses
incurred prior to Prism's formation (1996). Losses estimated to be paid within
12 months are classified as accrued expenses, while losses expected to be
payable in later periods are included in other long-term liabilities.

Revenue Recognition. The Company recognizes revenue from construction contracts
on a percentage-of-completion basis, measured by the percentage of costs
incurred to date to estimated total costs for each contract. Contract costs
include materials, labor and other direct costs related to contract performance.
Provisions are established for estimated losses, if any, on uncompleted
contracts in the period in which such losses are determined. Amounts
representing contract change orders, claims or other items are included in sales
only when they have been approved by customers. Revenue from the sale of
products or services provided and the related cost of sales are recorded upon
shipment or as services are rendered.

Income Taxes. The Company accounts for income taxes as prescribed by SFAS No.
109, which requires use of the asset and liability method. This method
recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the future tax
consequences of temporary differences between financial and tax reporting.


                                      F-8
<PAGE>

Foreign Operations. The financial statements of foreign operations have been
translated to U.S. dollars, using the rules of SFAS No. 52. Balance sheet
accounts are stated in U.S. dollars, generally at the year-end exchange rate.
Results of operations are translated at average exchange rates for the
respective period.

     The Company may periodically enter into forward currency exchange contracts
to manage specific foreign currency exposures related to foreign construction
contracts, receivables and bank borrowings denominated in foreign currencies. As
of March 3, 2001, there were no forward contracts outstanding as the Company had
no material foreign currency exchange exposure. Gains and losses on forward
contracts related to receivables are recognized currently, while gains and
losses related to construction projects are deferred and accounted for as a part
of the related transaction.

Accounting Period. Apogee's fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to February
28. Fiscal year 2001 consisted of fifty-three weeks, while fiscal 2000 and 1999
each consisted of fifty-two weeks.

Accounting Estimates. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of
net sales and expenses during the reporting period. Amounts subject to
significant estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, insurance
reserves, reserves related to discontinued operations, and net sales recognition
for construction contracts, including the status of outstanding disputes and
claims. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

New Accounting Standards. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
SFAS No. 133 regarding accounting for derivative instruments and hedging
activities. SFAS No. 133, as amended by SFAS No. 137 and No. 138, establishes
accounting and reporting standards requiring that derivative instruments
(including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts) be
recorded in the balance sheet either as an asset or liability measured at fair
value. SFAS No. 133 requires changes in the derivative's fair value to be
recognized in earnings or, for derivatives that hedge market risk related to
future cash flows, in accumulated other comprehensive income, unless specific
hedge accounting criteria are met. The Company adopted SFAS No. 133 on March 4,
2001, which resulted in the Company recording the fair value of the interest
rate swaps described in Note 6 as a liability with an offsetting adjustment to
other comprehensive earnings.

     The Company provides products and services to the commercial and
institutional new construction and remodeling markets, the automotive
replacement glass market and selected consumer markets. There is no
concentration of credit risk due to the diversity of the markets, channels of
distribution, and the geographic location of customers. Allowances are
maintained for potential credit losses and such losses have been within
management's expectations.

     5 Investments


     The Company has acquired through joint venture, investments that are
accounted for by the equity method. The nature and extent of these investments
change over time.

     On July 29, 2000, the Company and PPG Industries combined their U.S.
automotive replacement glass distribution businesses in a new entity, PPG Auto
Glass, LLC (PPG Auto Glass) of which the Company has a 34 percent interest. On
March 3, 2001, the Company's investment in PPG Auto Glass was $32.2 million, of
which $7.6 million represents the unamortized excess of the cost of the
investment over the value of the underlying net tangible assets when the joint
venture was formed. This excess is being amortized over a life of 20 years.

     The Company's investment in TerraSun LLC relates to a research and
development joint venture of which the Company has a 50 percent interest.

In May 1998, the Company obtained a five-year, committed, secured credit
facility in the amount of $275 million. This credit facility requires the
Company to maintain minimum levels of net worth and certain financial ratios.
The


                                      F-11
<PAGE>

total commitment of the credit facility was reduced by the sales price, net
of taxes, of the sale of the detention/security business, resulting in a
committed credit facility of $253 million as of February 26, 2000. The total
commitment of the credit facility was again reduced in April 2000, resulting in
a committed credit facility of $200 million as of March 3, 2001. The majority of
the borrowings under the credit facility are made at a rate equal to three-month
LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) plus an applicable margin. The applicable
margin is calculated based upon the Company's financial ratios. At March 3,
2001, the applicable margin was 1.5%. The Company's receivables, inventory,
equipment and intangibles secure the credit facility. Based upon the Company's
satisfaction of certain financial covenants during fiscal 2001, the Company has
the right to cause this security interest to be released upon its request. At
March 3, 2001, the Company was in compliance with all of the financial covenants
of the credit facility.

     Selected information related to bank borrowings is as follows:

     In 2000, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement that
effectively converted $10 million of variable rate borrowings into a fixed rate
obligation. Under this agreement, which expires in 2003, the Company receives
payments at variable rates while making payments at a fixed rate of 7.21%. In
1999, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement that effectively
converted $25 million of variable rate borrowings into a fixed rate obligation.
Under this agreement, which expires in 2004, the Company receives payments at
variable rates while making payments at a fixed rate of 7.125%. The net interest
paid or received associated with these agreements is included in interest
expense. The net present liability associated with these interest rate swap
agreements was $1.8 million and $198,000 at March 3, 2001 and February 26, 2000,
respectively.

     8 Employee Benefit Plans

     The Company maintains a qualified defined contribution pension plan that
covers substantially all full-time, non-union employees. Contributions to the
plan are based on a percentage of employees' base earnings. Deposits of the
pension costs with the trustee are made annually. All pension costs were fully
funded or accrued as of year-end. Contributions to the plan were $4,734,000,
$4,920,000 and $4,209,000 in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

     The Company also maintains a 401(k) savings plan, which allows employees to
contribute 1% to 13% of their compensation. Apogee matches 30% of the first 6%
of the employee contributions. Contributions to the plan were $1,967,000,
$2,098,000 and $2,009,000 in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

     9 Shareholders' Equity and Stock Option Plans

     A class of 200,000 shares of junior preferred stock with a par value of
$1.00 is authorized, but unissued.

     The Company has a Shareholders' Rights Plan, under which each share of
outstanding common stock has an associated preferred share purchase right. The
rights are exercisable only under certain circumstances, including the


                                      F-12
<PAGE>

acquisition by a person or group of 10% of the outstanding shares of the
Company's common stock. Upon exercise, the rights would allow holders of such
rights to purchase common stock of Apogee or an acquiring company at a
discounted price, which generally would be 50% of the respective stock's current
fair market value.

     The 1997 Stock Option Plan and 1987 Stock Option Plan (the "Plans") each
provide for the issuance of up to 2,500,000 options to purchase Company stock.
Options awarded under these Plans, either in the form of incentive stock options
or nonstatutory options, are exercisable at an option price equal to the fair
market value at the date of award. The 1987 Plan has expired and no new grants
of stock options may be made under this Plan.

     The 1987 Partnership Plan, a plan designed to increase the ownership of
Apogee stock by key employees, allows participants selected by the Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors to use earned incentive compensation to
purchase Apogee common stock. The purchased stock is then matched by an equal
award of restricted stock, which vests over a predetermined period. Common
shares of 3,200,000 are authorized for issuance under the Plan. As of March 3,
2001, 2,514,000 shares have been issued or committed under the Plan. The Company
expensed $1,814,000, $786,000 and $1,926,000 in conjunction with the Partnership
Plan in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

     In accordance with the disclosure-only provisions of SFAS No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, no compensation cost has been
recognized with respect to the Plans. Had compensation cost for the Plans been
determined based on the fair value of the awards, the Company's net earnings
(loss) and earnings (loss) per share would have been reduced to the pro forma

     11 Discontinued Operations

     During fiscal 2001, the Company completed the sale of substantially all of
the assets of VIS'N Service Corporation (VIS'N), a non-auto glass focused,
third-party administered claims processor, in two separate transactions. In
fiscal 2000, Apogee's Board of Directors authorized the exit from the Company's
interest in VIS'N. In fiscal 2000, the Company completed the sale of 100% of the
stock of its large-scale domestic curtainwall business, Harmon, Ltd. In fiscal
1999, Apogee's Board of Directors authorized the divestiture of the
detention/security operations and the Company executed the sale the business.
Combined with the fiscal 1998 exit from international curtainwall operations,
these transactions effectively remove the Company from the large-scale
construction business and the third party administered claims processing
business. Accordingly, these businesses are presented as discontinued operations
in the consolidated financial statements and notes. Prior periods have been
restated.

     The 2000 effective income tax rate of 7.3% on discontinued operations was
due to a decrease in the valuation allowance resulting from the utilization of
certain tax assets that were previously reserved for.

     In fiscal 1998, the Company recorded pre-tax charges of $96.1 million
related to the international curtainwall operations. The charges included an
amount for the estimated loss on disputed construction contracts in Europe,
including the accrual of certain penalty amounts, and a provision for the
accrual of legal and related costs associated with the resolution of legal
proceedings related to organizational changes in the majority-owned European
curtainwall unit. The charges also included amounts for severance and
termination benefits for employees in France, Asia and the U.S., the write-down
of property and equipment and other long-term assets to their estimated net
salable value and other items such as lease termination costs. The charges also
reflected the estimated costs associated with exiting the European operations,
including the completion of certain remaining projects. In March 1998, the five
operating companies comprising the European curtainwall operations filed for
bankruptcy or commenced liquidation, effectively relinquishing control over
those entities.

     At March 3, 2001, accruals totaling $20.9 million represented the remaining
estimated future cash outflows associated with the exit from discontinued
operations. The majority of these cash expenditures are expected to be made
within the next two to three years. The primary components of the accrual relate
to the completion of certain construction projects, costs to exit VIS'N, legal
costs and other costs associated with the proceedings noted above.

     12 Acquisitions

     In fiscal 2001, the Large-Scale Optical Technologies segment expanded its
pre-framed art business by purchasing two high-end pre-framed art companies. The
purchase price of these businesses was $3.6 million, including $2.9 million of
goodwill.

     In fiscal 2000, the Auto Glass segment purchased the assets of one
distribution center. The purchase price of the acquisition was $2.0 million,
including $596,000 recorded as goodwill.

     During fiscal 1999, the Auto Glass segment purchased an 80% interest in an
insurance claims and policy processing outsource company (VIS'N). The aggregate
purchase price of the acquisition was $2.8 million. Goodwill of $3.4 million was
recorded and liabilities of $1.4 million were assumed.

     Unless noted, no liabilities were assumed in the above transactions. All of
the above transactions were accounted for by the purchase method. Accordingly,
the consolidated financial statements include the net assets and results of
operations from the dates of acquisition.

     13 Leases

     As of March 3, 2001, the Company was obligated under noncancelable
operating leases for buildings and equipment. Certain leases provide for
increased rentals based upon increases in real estate taxes or operating costs.
Future minimum rental payments under noncancelable operating leases are:

     Total rental expense was $21.8 million, $23.8 million and $24.5 million in
2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

     During fiscal 2001 and 2000, the Company entered into agreements for the
sale and leaseback of certain production equipment. The sale price of the
equipment was $16.0 million and $13.4 million, respectively. The Company has a
purchase option at projected future fair market value under the agreements. The
leases are classified as operating leases in accordance with SFAS No. 13,
Accounting for Leases.

     A gain of $9.7 million has been deferred and is being recognized over the
lease term. The unamortized portion of the deferred gain of $8.7 million is
included in the balance sheet captions accrued expenses and other long-term
liabilities. The average annual lease payment over the life of the lease is $4.5
million.

     14 Commitments and Contingent Liabilities

     At March 3, 2001, the Company had ongoing letters of credit related to its
risk management programs, construction contracts and certain industrial
development bonds. The total value of letters of credit under which the Company
is obligated as of March 3, 2001 was approximately $16.4 million.

     The Company has entered into a number of noncompete agreements, largely
associated with acquisitons. As of March 3, 2001, future payment of $4.0 million
were committed under such agreements.

     The Company has been a party to various legal proceedings incidental to its
normal operating activities. In particular, like others in the construction
industry, the Company's construction businesses are routinely involved in
various disputes and claims arising out of construction projects, sometimes
involving significant monetary damages. Although it is impossible to predict the
outcome of such proceedings, facts currently available indicate that no such
claims will result in losses that would have a material adverse effect on the
financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows of the Company.
