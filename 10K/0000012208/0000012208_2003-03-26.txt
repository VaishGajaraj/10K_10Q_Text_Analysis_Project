                                      P A R T  I
          ITEM 1. BUSINESS

          General

          Founded in 1957, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. ("Bio-Rad" or the
          "Company") was initially engaged in the development and
          production of specialty chemicals used in biochemical,
          pharmaceutical and other life science research applications.  In
          1967, the Company entered the field of clinical diagnostics with
          the development of its first test kit based on separation
          techniques and materials developed for life science research.
          Recognizing that the fields of clinical diagnostics and life
          science research were evolving toward more automated techniques,
          Bio-Rad expanded into the field of analytical and measuring
          instrument systems through internal research and development
          efforts and acquisitions in the late 1970's and 1980's.

          As Bio-Rad broadened its product lines, it also expanded its
          geographical market.  The Company has distribution
          channels in thirty countries outside the United States through
          subsidiaries whose primary focus is customer service and
          product distribution.

          On October 1, 1999 Bio-Rad acquired the stock of Pasteur Sanofi
          Diagnostics (PSD) and the rights to certain ancillary assets for
          $210 million.  PSD was founded by the Institut Pasteur to
          commercialize its diagnostic research, and holds certain
          exclusive licenses from the Institut Pasteur in the HIV and
          infectious disease diagnostic product market.  PSD also expanded
          the geographic reach and market penetration for the Company's
          product particularly in Latin America, Africa and France.

          During 2000 and 2001, the Company sold substantially all of its
          analytical instruments product lines.  These divestitures have
          allowed the Company to focus on its core segments of Life Science
          and Clinical Diagnostics.

          Bio-Rad manufactures and supplies the life science research,
          healthcare, analytical chemistry and other markets with a broad
          range of products and systems used to separate complex chemical
          and biological materials and to identify, analyze and purify
          their components.

          Description of Business

          Business Segments

          The Company operates in two industry segments designated as Life
          Science and Clinical Diagnostics.  Each operates in both the
          United States and international markets.  For a description of
          business and financial information on industry and geographic
          segments, see Note 15 on pages 27 through 29 of Exhibit 13.1,
          which is incorporated herein by reference.




                                          1

          Life Science Segment.

          Life science is the study of the characteristics, behavior, and
          structure of living organisms and their component systems.  Life
          science researchers use a variety of products and systems--
          including reagents, instruments, software and apparatus-- to
          advance the study of life processes, drug discovery,
          biotechnology and food pathogen testing, primarily within a
          laboratory setting.

          We focus on selected segments of the life science market--
          proteomics, genomics and cell biology -- for which we estimate
          2002 worldwide sales totaled approximately $3 billion.  The
          primary technological applications that we supply to these
          segments consist of electrophoresis, image analysis, molecular
          detection, chromatography, gene transfer, sample preparation and
          amplification.  The primary end-users in our sectors of the
          market are universities and medical schools, industrial research
          organizations, government agencies, pharmaceutical manufacturers,
          biotechnology researchers and food testing laboratories.

          Clinical Diagnostics Segment.

          The clinical diagnostics industry encompasses a broad array of
          technologies incorporated into a variety of tests used to detect,
          identify and quantify substances in blood or other bodily fluids
          and tissues.  The test results are used as aids for medical
          diagnosis, detection, evaluation, monitoring and treatment of
          diseases and other medical conditions.  The bulk of tests are
          performed in vitro (literally, "in glass"), while the remainder
          consists of in vivo ("in the body") tests.  The most common type
          of in vitro tests are routine chemistry tests that measure
          important health parameters, such as glucose, cholesterol or
          sodium, as part of routine blood checks.  Other diagnostic tests
          are more specialized and require more sophisticated equipment and
          materials than do routine tests.  These specialized tests are
          also lower-volume and higher-priced than routine tests.  We
          estimate that in 2002 sales to the global clinical diagnostics
          industry totaled approximately $22 billion.

          The primary end-users in the areas of the clinical diagnostics
          industry we target are hospital laboratories, reference
          laboratories, physician office laboratories, government agencies
          and other diagnostics manufacturers.

          Raw Materials and Components

          The Company utilizes a wide variety of chemicals, biological
          materials, electronic components, machined metal parts, optical
          parts, minicomputers and peripheral devices.  Most of these
          materials and components are available from numerous sources and
          the Company has not experienced difficulty in securing adequate
          supplies.




                                          2

          Patents and Trademarks

          We own numerous U.S. and international patents and patent
          licenses.  We believe, however, that our ability to develop and
          manufacture our products depends primarily on our knowledge,
          technology and special skills.  Under several patent license
          agreements, we pay royalties on the sales of certain products.
          We view these patents and license agreements as valuable assets.

          Seasonal Operations and Backlog

          The Company's business is not inherently seasonal, however, the
          European custom of concentrating vacation during the summer
          months usually has had a negative impact on third quarter sales
          volume and operating income.

          For the most part, the Company operates in markets characterized
          by short lead times and the absence of significant backlogs.
          Management has concluded that backlog information is not material
          to the Company's business as a whole.

          Sales and Marketing

          Each of Bio-Rad's segments maintains a sales force to sell its
          products on a direct basis.  Each sales force is technically
          trained in the disciplines associated with its products.  Sales
          are also generated  through direct mail advertising, exhibits at
          trade shows and technical meetings, telemarketing, the Company
          website and by extensive advertising in technical and trade
          publications.  Sales and marketing efforts are augmented by
          technical service departments that assist customers in effective
          product utilization and in new product applications.  Bio-Rad
          also produces and distributes technical literature and holds
          seminars for customers on the use of its products.

          Our customer base is broad and diversified.  In 2002, no single
          customer accounted for more than 2% of our total net sales.  Our
          sales are affected by certain external factors.  For example, a
          number of our customers, particularly in the Life Science
          segment, are substantially dependent on government grants and
          research contracts for their funding. A significant reduction of
          government funding would have a detrimental effect on the results
          of this segment.

          The Company is the leading provider of BSE (Bovine Spongiform
          Encephalopathy or mad cow) tests throughout the world.  A large
          portion of the revenue for this product is from government
          agencies currently mandating the use of the test.  Competition,
          pricing, changes in test standards, technology or a decrease in
          government demand could negatively impact the Company's future
          revenue from this product.

          Most of the Company's international sales are generated by
          wholly-owned subsidiaries and their branch offices in Australia,
          Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark,
          England, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Hungary,

                                          3
<page>



          India, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, the Netherlands, New
          Zealand, Norway, People's Republic of China, Poland, Portugal,
          Russia, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland,
          Taiwan and Thailand.  Certain of these subsidiaries also have
          manufacturing facilities.  While Bio-Rad's international
          operations are subject to certain risks common to foreign
          operations in general, such as changes in governmental
          regulations, import restrictions and foreign exchange
          fluctuations, the Company's international operations are
          principally in developed nations, which the Company regards as
          presenting no significantly greater risks to its operations than
          are present in the United States.

          Competition

          Most markets served by our product groups are competitive.  Our
          competitors range in size from start-ups to large multinational
          corporations. Reliable independent information on sales and
          market share of products produced by our competitors is not
          generally available.  We believe, however, based on our own
          marketing information, that while some competitors are dominant
          with respect to certain individual products, no one company,
          including us, is dominant with respect to a material portion of
          any segment of our business.

          Life Science Segment.  Because of the breadth of its product
          lines, Life Science does not face the same competitor for all of
          its products.  Competitors in this market include Amersham
          Biosciences, Invitrogen, Qiagen, Zeiss and Applied Biosystems.
          We compete primarily on meeting performance specifications.

          Clinical Diagnostics Segment.  Competitors in this segment range
          in size from small private companies to large multinational
          corporations.  We compete only in very specific market niches and
          do not attempt to pursue the most competitive general diagnostics
          markets.  We compete based on our technological ability to
          provide customers with very specific tests and believe we are
          usually a significant competitor within our market niche.
          Competitors include Abbott Laboratories, bioMerieux, Inc., Roche
          Diagnostics, BioChem Pharma, Inova, diaSorin and Medical Analysis
          Systems.

          Product Research and Development

          The Company conducts extensive product research and development
          activities in all areas of our business, employing  approximately
          500 people worldwide in these activities.  Research and
          development have played a major role in Bio-Rad's growth and are
          expected to continue to do so in the future.  Our research teams
          are continuously developing new products and new applications for
          existing products.  In our development and testing of new
          products and applications, we consult with scientific and medical
          professionals at universities, hospitals and medical schools, and
          in industry.  We spent approximately $82.9 million, $76.5 million
          and $68.1 million on research and development activities during
          the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively.

          Regulatory Matters

          The manufacturing, marketing and labeling of certain of our
          products (primarily diagnostic products) are subject to
          regulation in the United States by the Center for Devices and
          Radiological Health of the United States Food and Drug
          Administration (FDA) and in other jurisdictions by state and
          foreign government authorities.  FDA regulations require that
          some new products have pre-marketing approval by the FDA and
          require certain products to be manufactured in accordance with
          "good manufacturing practices," to be extensively tested and to
          be properly labeled to disclose test results and performance
          claims and limitations.

          As a multinational manufacturer and distributor of sophisticated
          instrumentation equipment, we must meet a wide array of
          electromagnetic compatibility and safety compliance requirements
          to satisfy regulations in the United States, the European
          Community and other jurisdictions.  The FDA must approve an
          export permit application before companies can market products
          outside the U.S. prior to the products' receipt of FDA approval.
          The requirements relating to testing and trials, product
          licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary widely among countries.

          Our operations are subject to federal, state, local and foreign
          environmental laws and regulations that govern such activities as
          emissions to air and discharges to water, as well as handling and
          disposal practices for solid, hazardous and medical wastes.  In
          addition to environmental laws that regulate our operations, we
          are also subject to environmental laws and regulations that
          create liabilities and clean-up responsibility for spills,
          disposals or other releases of hazardous substances into the
          environment as a result of our operations or otherwise impacting
          real property that we own or operate.  The environmental laws and
          regulations also subject us to claims by third parties for
          damages resulting from any spills, disposals or releases
          resulting from our operations or at any of our properties.

          Employees

          At December 31, 2002, Bio-Rad had approximately 4,600 full-time
          employees.  Fewer than 11% of Bio-Rad's 2,200 U. S. employees are
          covered by a collective bargaining agreement which will expire on
          November 7, 2006.  Many of Bio-Rad's non-U.S. full-time
          employees, especially in France, are covered by collective
          bargaining agreements.  Bio-Rad considers its employee relations
          in general to be good.

          Available Information

          The Company files annual, quarterly, and current reports, proxy
          statements, and other documents with the Securities and Exchange
          Commission (SEC) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  The
          public may read and copy any materials that the Company files
          with the SEC at the SEC's Public Reference Room at 450 Fifth
          Street, NW, Washington, DC 20549.  The public may obtain

          Most manufacturing and research facilities also house
          administration, sales and distribution activities.  In addition,
          we lease office and warehouse facilities in a variety of
          locations around the world.  The facilities are used principally
          for sales, service, distribution and administration for both
          segments.

          The Life Science segment's Richmond, California distribution and
          instrument manufacturing facility lease expires in November 2005.
          The Marnes la Coquette facility near Paris, France which served
          as the corporate headquarters for PSD, as well as a significant
          manufacturing and research facility has been renewed until
          December 31, 2005.

          The Company is currently building additional facilities at its
          Northern California headquarters.  Historically, adequate space
          to expand sales and distribution channels has been available and
          we have leased space as needed.

          INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT ON SUPPLEMENTAL SCHEDULE

          To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
          Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.

          We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Bio-Rad
          Laboratories, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of
          December 31, 2002, and for the year then ended, and have issued
          our report thereon dated February 5, 2003 (which report expresses
          an unqualified opinion and includes an explanatory paragraph
          concerning the application of procedures relating to certain
          disclosures of consolidated financial statement amounts related
          to the 2001 and 2000 consolidated financial statements that were
          audited by other auditors who have ceased operations); such
          consolidated financial statements and report are included in the
          Company's 2002 Annual Report to the Shareholders and are
          incorporated herein by reference.  Our audit also included the
          2002 consolidated financial statement schedule of the Company,
          listed in Item 15.  This consolidated financial statement
          schedule is the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our
          responsibility is to express an opinion based on our audit.  In
          our opinion, the consolidated 2002 financial statement schedule,
          when considered in relation to the 2002 basic consolidated
          financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all
          material respects the information set forth therein.  The
          financial statement schedules for the years ended December 31,
          2001 and 2000 were audited by other auditors who have ceased
          operations.  Those auditors expressed an opinion, in their report
          dated February 4, 2002, (February 6, 2002, as to a subsequent
          event), that such 2001 and 2000 financial statement schedules,
          when considered in relation to the 2001 and 2000 basic financial
          statements taken as a whole (prior to the disclosures referred to
          above), presented fairly in all material respects the information
          set forth therein.

          This report is a copy of the previously issued

          REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS ON SCHEDULE II

          To Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.:

          We have audited in accordance with auditing standards generally
          accepted in the United States, the consolidated financial
          statements included in Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.'s annual report
          to stockholders incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K, and
          have issued our report thereon dated February 4, 2002.  Our
          audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion on those
          statements taken as a whole.  The schedule listed in the index,
          Item 14(a)2, is the responsibility of the Company's management
          and is presented for the purposes of complying with the
          Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and is not part of the
          basic financial statements.  This schedule has been subjected to
          the auditing procedures applied in the audits of the basic
          financial statements and, in our opinion, fairly states in all
          material respects the financial data required to be set forth
          therein in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a
          whole.
