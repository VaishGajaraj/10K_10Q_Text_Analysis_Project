                                       P A R T  I
           ITEM 1. BUSINESS

           General

           Founded in 1957, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. ("Bio-Rad" or the
           "Company") was initially engaged in the development and
           production of specialty chemicals used in biochemical,
           pharmaceutical and other life science research applications.  In
           1967, the Company entered the field of clinical diagnostics with
           the development of its first test kit based on separation
           techniques and materials developed for life science research.
           Recognizing that the fields of clinical diagnostics and life
           science research were evolving toward more automated techniques,
           Bio-Rad expanded into the field of analytical and measuring
           instrument systems through internal research and development
           efforts and acquisitions in the late 1970's and 1980's.

           As Bio-Rad broadened its product lines, it also expanded its
           geographical market.  The Company has distribution
           channels in thirty countries outside the United States through
           subsidiaries whose primary focus is customer service and
           product distribution.

           On October 1, 1999 Bio-Rad acquired the stock of Pasteur Sanofi
           Diagnostics (PSD) and the rights to certain ancillary assets for
           $210 million.  PSD was founded by the Institut Pasteur to
           commercialize its diagnostic research, and holds certain
           exclusive licenses from the Institut Pasteur in the HIV and
           infectious disease diagnostic product market.  PSD also expanded
           the geographic reach and market penetration for the Company's
           product particularly in Latin America, Africa and France.

           During 2000 and 2001, the Company sold the majority of its
           analytical instruments product lines.  These divestitures will
           allow the company to focus on its core segments of Life Science
           and Clinical Diagnostics.

           Bio-Rad manufactures and supplies the life science research,
           healthcare, analytical chemistry and other markets with a broad
           range of products and systems used to separate complex chemical
           and biological materials and to identify, analyze and purify
           their components.

           Description of Business

           Business Segments

           The Company operates in two industry segments designated as Life
           Science and Clinical Diagnostics.  Each operates in both the
           United States and international markets.  For a description of
           business and financial information on industry and geographic
           segments, see Note 14 on pages 22 through 25 of Exhibit 13.1,
           which is incorporated herein by reference.




                                           1

           Life Science Segment.

           Life science is the study of the characteristics, behavior, and
           structure of living organisms and their component systems.  Life
           science researchers use a variety of products and systems--
           including reagents, instruments, software and apparatus-- to
           advance the study of life processes, drug discovery,
           biotechnology and food pathogen testing, primarily within a
           laboratory setting.

           We focus on selected segments of the life science market--
           proteomics, genomics and cell biology -- for which we estimate
           2001 worldwide sales totaled approximately $3 billion.  The
           primary technological applications that we supply to these
           segments consist of electrophoresis, image analysis, molecular
           detection, chromatography, gene transfer, sample preparation and
           amplification.  The primary end-users in our sectors of the
           market are universities and medical schools, industrial research
           organizations, government agencies, pharmaceutical manufacturers,
           biotechnology researchers and food testing laboratories.

           Clinical Diagnostics Segment.

           The clinical diagnostics industry encompasses a broad array of
           technologies incorporated into a variety of tests used to detect,
           identify and quantify substances in blood or other bodily fluids
           and tissues.  The test results are used as aids for medical
           diagnosis, detection, evaluation, monitoring and treatment of
           diseases and other medical conditions.  The bulk of tests are
           performed in vitro (literally, "in glass"), while the remainder
           consists of in vivo ("in the body") tests.  The most common type
           of in vitro tests are routine chemistry tests that measure
           important health parameters, such as glucose, cholesterol or
           sodium, as part of routine blood checks.  Other diagnostic tests
           are more specialized and require more sophisticated equipment and
           materials than do routine tests.  These specialized tests are
           also lower-volume and higher-priced than routine tests.  We
           estimate that in 2001 sales to the global clinical diagnostics
           industry totaled approximately $21 billion.

           The primary end-users in the areas of the clinical diagnostics
           industry we target are hospital laboratories, reference
           laboratories, physician office laboratories, government agencies
           and other diagnostics manufacturers.

           Raw Materials and Components

           The Company utilizes a wide variety of chemicals, biological
           materials, electronic components, machined metal parts, optical
           parts, minicomputers and peripheral devices.  Most of these
           materials and components are available from numerous sources and
           the Company has not experienced difficulty in securing adequate
           supplies.




                                           2

           Patents and Trademarks

           We own numerous U.S. and international patents and patent
           licenses.  We believe, however, that our ability to develop and
           manufacture our products depends primarily on our knowledge,
           technology and special skills.  Under several patent license
           agreements, we pay royalties on the sales of certain products.
           We view these patents and license agreements as valuable assets.

           Seasonal Operations and Backlog

           The Company's business is not inherently seasonal, however, the
           European custom of concentrating vacation during the summer
           months usually has had a negative impact on third quarter sales
           volume and operating income.

           For the most part, the Company operates in markets characterized
           by short lead times and the absence of significant backlogs.  The
           Company produces only limited instruments against an order
           backlog.  Management has concluded that backlog information is
           not material to the Company's business as a whole.

           Sales and Marketing

           Each of Bio-Rad's segments maintains a sales force to sell its
           products on a direct basis.  Each sales force is technically
           trained in the disciplines associated with its products.  Sales
           are also generated  through direct mail advertising, exhibits at
           trade shows and technical meetings, telemarketing, the Company
           website and by extensive advertising in technical and trade
           publications.  Sales and marketing efforts are augmented by
           technical service departments that assist customers in effective
           product utilization and in new product applications.  Bio-Rad
           also produces and distributes technical literature and holds
           seminars for customers on the use of its products.

           Our customer base is broad and diversified.  In 2001, no single
           customer accounted for more than 2% of our total net sales.  Our
           sales are affected by certain external factors.  For example, a
           number of our customers, particularly in the life science
           segment, are substantially dependent on government grants and
           research contracts for their funding. A significant reduction of
           government funding would have a detrimental effect on the results
           of this segment.

           Most of the Company's international sales are generated by
           wholly-owned subsidiaries and their branch offices in Australia,
           Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark,
           England, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Hungary, India,
           Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, the Netherlands, New
           Zealand, Norway, People's Republic of China, Poland, Portugal,
           Russia, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland,
           Taiwan and Thailand.  Certain of these subsidiaries also have
           manufacturing facilities.  While Bio-Rad's international
           operations are subject to certain risks common to foreign
           operations in general, such as changes in governmental

                                           3
 <page>



           regulations, import restrictions and foreign exchange
           fluctuations, the Company's international operations are
           principally in developed nations, which the Company regards as
           presenting no significantly greater risks to its operations than
           are present in the United States.

           Competition

           Most markets served by our product groups are competitive.  Our
           competitors range in size from start-ups to large multinational
           corporations. Reliable independent information on sales and
           market share of products produced by our competitors is not
           generally available.  We believe, however, based on our own
           marketing information, that while some competitors are dominant
           with respect to certain individual products, no one company,
           including us, is dominant with respect to a material portion of
           any segment of our business.

           Life Science Segment.  Because of the breadth of its product
           lines, Life Science does not face the same competitor for all of
           its products.  Competitors in this market include Amersham
           Biosciences, Qiagen, Zeiss and Applied Biosystems.  We compete
           primarily on meeting performance specifications.

           Clinical Diagnostics Segment.  Competitors in this segment range
           in size from small private companies to large multinational
           corporations.  We compete only in very specific market niches and
           do not attempt to pursue the most competitive general diagnostics
           markets.  We compete based on our technological ability to
           provide customers with very specific tests and believe we are
           usually a significant competitor within our market niche.
           Competitors include Abbott Laboratories, bioMerieux, Inc., Roche
           Diagnostics, BioChem Pharma, Inova, diaSorin and Medical Analysis
           Systems.

           Product Research and Development

           The Company conducts extensive product research and development
           activities in all areas of our business, employing  approximately
           470 people worldwide in these activities.  Research and
           development have played a major role in Bio-Rad's growth and are
           expected to continue to do so in the future.  Our research teams
           are continuously developing new products and new applications for
           existing products.  In our development and testing of new
           products and applications, we consult with scientific and medical
           professionals at universities, hospitals and medical schools, and
           in industry.  We spent approximately $76.5 million, $68.1 million
           and $51.2 million (excluding $15.5 million of purchased in-
           process research and development expense)on research and
           development activities during the years ended December 31, 2001,
           2000 and 1999, respectively.

           Regulatory Matters

           The manufacturing, marketing and labeling of certain of our
           products (primarily diagnostic products) are subject to
           regulation in the United States by the Center for Devices and

                                           4
 <page>



           Radiological Health of the United States Food and Drug
           Administration (FDA) and in other jurisdictions by state and
           foreign government authorities.  FDA regulations require that
           some new products have pre-marketing approval by the FDA and
           require certain products to be manufactured in accordance with
           "good manufacturing practices," to be extensively tested and to
           be properly labeled to disclose test results and performance
           claims and limitations.

           As a multinational manufacturer and distributor of sophisticated
           instrumentation equipment, we must meet a wide array of
           electromagnetic compatibility and safety compliance requirements
           to satisfy regulations in the United States, the European
           Community and other jurisdictions.  The FDA must approve an
           export permit application before companies can market products
           outside the U.S. prior to the products' receipt of FDA approval.
           The requirements relating to testing and trials, product
           licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary widely among countries.

           Our operations are subject to federal, state, local and foreign
           environmental laws and regulations that govern such activities as
           emissions to air and discharges to water, as well as handling and
           disposal practices for solid, hazardous and medical wastes.  In
           addition to environmental laws that regulate our operations, we
           are also subject to environmental laws and regulations that
           create liabilities and clean-up responsibility for spills,
           disposals or other releases of hazardous substances into the
           environment as a result of our operations or otherwise impacting
           real property that we own or operate.  The environmental laws and
           regulations also subject us to claims by third parties for
           damages resulting from any spills, disposals or releases
           resulting from our operations or at any of our properties.

           Employees

           At December 31, 2001, Bio-Rad had approximately 4,300 full-time
           employees.  Fewer than 12% of Bio-Rad's 2,100 U. S. employees are
           covered by a collective bargaining agreement which will expire on
           November 7, 2002.  Many of Bio-Rad's non-U.S. full-time
           employees, especially in France, are covered by collective
           bargaining agreements.  Bio-Rad considers its employee relations
           in general to be good.

           Most manufacturing and research facilities also house
           administration, sales and distribution activities.  In addition,
           we lease office and warehouse facilities in a variety of
           locations around the world.  The facilities are used principally
           for sales, service, distribution and administration for both
           segments.

           The Life Science segment's Richmond, California distribution and
           instrument manufacturing facility lease expires in November 2005.
           The Marnes la Coquette facility near Paris, France which served
           as the corporate headquarters for PSD, as well as a significant
           manufacturing and research facility has been renewed until
           December 31, 2005.

           The Company is currently reviewing plans to either build or lease
           additional facilities at or near its Northern California

          REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS ON SCHEDULE II

          To Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.:

          We have audited in accordance with auditing standards generally
          accepted in the United States, the consolidated financial
          statements included in Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.'s annual report
          to stockholders incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K, and
          have issued our report thereon dated February 4, 2002.  Our
          audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion on those
          statements taken as a whole.  The schedule listed in the index,
          Item 14(a)2, is the responsibility of the Company's management
          and is presented for the purposes of complying with the
          Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and is not part of the
          basic financial statements.  This schedule has been subjected to
          the auditing procedures applied in the audits of the basic
          financial statements and, in our opinion, fairly states in all
          material respects the financial data required to be set forth
          therein in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a
          whole.
