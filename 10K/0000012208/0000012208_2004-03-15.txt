    ITEM 1. BUSINESS

    General

    Founded in 1957, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. ("Bio-Rad" or the
    "Company") was initially engaged in the development and
    production of specialty chemicals used in biochemical,
    pharmaceutical and other life science research applications.  In
    1967, the Company entered the field of clinical diagnostics with
    the development of its first test kit based on separation
    techniques and materials developed for life science research.
    Recognizing that the fields of clinical diagnostics and life
    science research were evolving toward more automated techniques,
    Bio-Rad expanded into the field of analytical and measuring
    instrument systems through internal research and development
    efforts and acquisitions in the late 1970's and 1980's.

    As Bio-Rad broadened its product lines, it also expanded its
    geographical market.  The Company has distribution
    channels in over thirty countries outside the United States
    through subsidiaries whose primary focus is customer service and
    product distribution.

    On October 1, 1999 Bio-Rad acquired the stock of Pasteur Sanofi
    Diagnostics (PSD) and the rights to certain ancillary assets for
    $210 million.  PSD was founded by the Institut Pasteur to
    commercialize its diagnostic research, and holds certain
    exclusive licenses from the Institut Pasteur in the HIV and
    infectious disease diagnostic product market.  PSD also expanded
    the geographic reach and market penetration for the Company's
    products particularly in Latin America, Africa and France.

    During 2000 and 2001, the Company sold substantially all of its
    analytical instruments product lines.  These divestitures have
    allowed the Company to focus on its core segments of Life Science
    and Clinical Diagnostics.

    Bio-Rad manufactures and supplies the life science research,
    healthcare, analytical chemistry and other markets with a broad
    range of products and systems used to separate complex chemical
    and biological materials and to identify, analyze and purify
    their components.

    Description of Business

    Business Segments

    The Company operates in two industry segments designated as Life
    Science and Clinical Diagnostics.  Each operates in both the
    United States and international markets.  For a description of
    business and financial information on industry and geographic
    segments, see Note 15 on pages 27 through 29 of Exhibit 13.1,
    which is incorporated herein by reference.


                                   1
    <page>


    Life Science Segment.

    Life science is the study of the characteristics, behavior, and
    structure of living organisms and their component systems.  Life
    science researchers use a variety of products and systems--
    including reagents, instruments, software and apparatus-- to
    advance the study of life processes, drug discovery,
    biotechnology and food pathogen testing, primarily within a
    laboratory setting.

    We focus on selected segments of the life science market--
    proteomics, genomics and cell biology -- for which we estimate
    2003 worldwide sales totaled approximately $3.8 billion.  The
    primary technological applications that we supply to these
    segments consist of electrophoresis, image analysis, molecular
    detection, chromatography, gene transfer, sample preparation and
    amplification.  The primary end-users in our sectors of the
    market are universities and medical schools, industrial research
    organizations, government agencies, pharmaceutical manufacturers,
    biotechnology researchers and food testing laboratories.

    Clinical Diagnostics Segment.

    The clinical diagnostics industry encompasses a broad array of
    technologies incorporated into a variety of tests used to detect,
    identify and quantify substances in blood or other bodily fluids
    and tissues.  The test results are used as aids for medical
    diagnosis, detection, evaluation, monitoring and treatment of
    diseases and other medical conditions.  The bulk of tests are
    performed in vitro (outside the body), while the remainder
    consist of in vivo ("in the body") tests.  The most common type
    of in vitro tests are routine chemistry tests that measure
    important health parameters, such as glucose, cholesterol or
    sodium, as part of routine blood checks.  Other diagnostic tests
    are more specialized and require more sophisticated equipment and
    materials than do routine tests.  These specialized tests are
    also lower-volume and higher-priced than routine tests.  We
    estimate that in 2003 the global clinical diagnostics market
    totaled approximately $23.5 billion.

    The primary end-users in the areas of the clinical diagnostics
    industry we target are hospital laboratories, reference
    laboratories, physician office laboratories, government agencies
    and other diagnostics manufacturers.

    Raw Materials and Components

    The Company utilizes a wide variety of chemicals, biological
    materials, electronic components, machined metal parts, optical
    parts, minicomputers and peripheral devices.  Most of these
    materials and components are available from numerous sources and
    the Company has not experienced difficulty in securing adequate
    supplies.

                                   2

    <page>

    Patents and Trademarks

    We own numerous U.S. and international patents and patent
    licenses.  We believe, however, that our ability to develop and
    manufacture our products depends primarily on our knowledge,
    technology and special skills.  Under several patent license
    agreements, we pay royalties on the sales of certain products.
    We view these patents and license agreements as valuable assets.

    Seasonal Operations and Backlog

    The Company's business is not inherently seasonal, however, the
    European custom of concentrating vacation during the summer
    months usually has had a negative impact on third quarter sales
    volume and operating income.

    For the most part, the Company operates in markets characterized
    by short lead times and the absence of significant backlogs.
    Management has concluded that backlog information is not material
    to the Company's business as a whole.

    Sales and Marketing

    Each of Bio-Rad's segments maintains a sales force to sell its
    products on a direct basis.  Each sales force is technically
    trained in the disciplines associated with its products.  Sales
    are also generated through direct mail advertising, exhibits at
    trade shows and technical meetings, telemarketing, the Company
    website and by extensive advertising in technical and trade
    publications.  Sales and marketing efforts are augmented by
    technical service departments that assist customers in effective
    product utilization and in new product applications.  Bio-Rad
    also produces and distributes technical literature and holds
    seminars for customers on the use of its products.

    Our customer base is broad and diversified.  In 2003, no single
    customer accounted for more than 3% of our total net sales.  Our
    sales are affected by certain external factors.  For example, a
    number of our customers, particularly in the Life Science
    segment, are substantially dependent on government grants and
    research contracts for their funding. A significant reduction of
    government funding would have a detrimental effect on the results
    of this segment.

    The Company is the leading provider of BSE (Bovine Spongiform
    Encephalopathy or mad cow) tests throughout the world.  Revenues
    from the sales of testing products for BSE within our Life
    Science segment represented approximately 11% and 12% of
    consolidated net revenue in 2003 and 2002, respectively.  A large
    portion of the revenue for this product is from government
    agencies currently mandating the use of the test.  Competition,
    pricing, changes in test standards, technology or a decrease in
    government demand could negatively impact the Company's future
    revenue from this product.

    Most of the Company's international sales are generated by
    wholly-owned subsidiaries and their branch offices in Australia,

                                   3

    Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark,
    England, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary,
    India, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, the Netherlands, New
    Zealand, Norway, People's Republic of China, Poland, Portugal,
    Russia, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland,
    Taiwan and Thailand.  Certain of these subsidiaries also have
    manufacturing facilities.  While Bio-Rad's international
    operations are subject to certain risks common to foreign
    operations in general, such as changes in governmental
    regulations, import restrictions and foreign exchange
    fluctuations, the Company's international operations are
    principally in developed nations, which the Company regards as
    presenting no significantly greater risks to its operations than
    are present in the United States.

    Competition

    Most markets served by our product groups are competitive.  Our
    competitors range in size from start-ups to large multinational
    corporations. Reliable independent information on sales and
    market share of products produced by our competitors is not
    generally available.  We believe, however, based on our own
    marketing information, that while some competitors are dominant
    with respect to certain individual products, no one company,
    including us, is dominant with respect to a material portion of
    any segment of our business.

    Because of the breadth of its product lines, Life Science does
    not face the same competitor for all of its products.
    Competitors in this market include Amersham Biosciences,
    Invitrogen, Qiagen, Zeiss, Olympus, Leica, Nikon and Applied
    Biosystems.  We compete primarily based on meeting performance
    specifications.

    Competitors in the Clinical Diagnostics segment range in size
    from small private companies to large multinational corporations.
    We compete mainly in specific market niches and do not attempt to
    pursue the most competitive general diagnostics markets.  We
    compete based on our technological ability to provide customers
    with very specific tests and believe we are usually a significant
    competitor within our market niche.  Competitors include Abbott
    Laboratories, bioMerieux, Inc., Roche Diagnostics, BioChem
    Pharma, Inova, diaSorin and Medical Analysis Systems.

    Product Research and Development

    The Company conducts extensive product research and development
    activities in all areas of our business, employing approximately
    550 people worldwide in these activities.  Research and
    development have played a major role in Bio-Rad's growth and are
    expected to continue to do so in the future.  Our research teams
    are continuously developing new products and new applications for
    existing products.  In our development and testing of new
    products and applications, we consult with scientific and medical
    professionals at universities, hospitals and medical schools, and
    in industry.  We spent approximately $94.3 million, $82.9 million
    and $76.5 million on research and development activities during
    the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 respectively.

    Regulatory Matters

    The manufacturing, marketing and labeling of certain of our
    products (primarily diagnostic products) are subject to
    regulation in the United States by the Center for Devices and
    Radiological Health of the United States Food and Drug
    Administration (FDA) and in other jurisdictions by state and
    foreign government authorities.  FDA regulations require that
    some new products have pre-marketing approval by the FDA and
    require certain products to be manufactured in accordance with
    "good manufacturing practices," to be extensively tested and to
    be properly labeled to disclose test results and performance
    claims and limitations.

    As a multinational manufacturer and distributor of sophisticated
    instrumentation equipment, we must meet a wide array of
    electromagnetic compatibility and safety compliance requirements
    to satisfy regulations in the United States, the European
    Community and other jurisdictions.  The FDA must approve an
    export permit application before companies can market products
    outside the U.S. prior to the products' receipt of FDA approval.
    The requirements relating to testing and trials, product
    licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary widely among countries.

    Our operations are subject to federal, state, local and foreign
    environmental laws and regulations that govern such activities as
    emissions to air and discharges to water, as well as handling and
    disposal practices for solid, hazardous and medical wastes.  In
    addition to environmental laws that regulate our operations, we
    are also subject to environmental laws and regulations that
    create liabilities and clean-up responsibility for spills,
    disposals or other releases of hazardous substances into the
    environment as a result of our operations or otherwise impacting
    real property that we own or operate.  The environmental laws and
    regulations also subject us to claims by third parties for
    damages resulting from any spills, disposals or releases
    resulting from our operations or at any of our properties.

    Employees

    At December 31, 2003 Bio-Rad had approximately 4,800 full-time
    employees.  Fewer than 10% of Bio-Rad's 2,200 U. S. employees are
    covered by a collective bargaining agreement which will expire on
    November 7, 2006.  Many of Bio-Rad's non-U.S. full-time
    employees, especially in France, are covered by collective
    bargaining agreements.  Bio-Rad considers its employee relations
    in general to be good.

    Available Information

    The Company files annual, quarterly, and current reports, proxy
    statements, and other documents with the Securities and Exchange
    Commission (SEC) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  The
    public may read and copy any materials that the Company files

    ITEM 9a.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

    The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are
    designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in
    the Company's Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed,
    summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
    SEC's rules and forms.  These disclosure controls are also
    designed that such information is accumulated and communicated to
    the Company's management, including its Chief Executive Officer
    and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely
    decisions regarding required disclosure.  In designing and
    evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management
    recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well
    designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
    assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.
    Management is also required to apply its judgment in evaluating
    the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and
    procedures.

    As the end of the period covered by this report, the Company
    carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the
    participation of the Company's management, including the
    Company's Chief Executive Officer and the Company's Chief
    Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and
    operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures.
    Based on the foregoing, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and
    Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company's disclosure
    controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable
    assurance that material information relating to the Company is
    made known to management, including the Chief Executive Officer
    and Chief Financial Officer, particularly during the period when
    our periodic reports are being prepared.

                                   8

    There has been no change in the Company's internal controls over
    financial reporting during the Company's most recent fiscal
    quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
    materially affect, the Company's internal controls over financial
    reporting.

          INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT ON SUPPLEMENTAL SCHEDULE

    To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
    Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.

    We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Bio-Rad
    Laboratories, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31,
    2003 and 2002, and for the years then ended, and have issued our
    report thereon dated March 10, 2004 (which report expresses an
    unqualified opinion and includes explanatory paragraphs concerning the
    Company's change in it's method of accounting for goodwill and
    intangible assets and the application of procedures relating to
    certain disclosures and reclassifications of consolidated financial
    statement amounts related to the 2001 consolidated financial
    statements that were audited by other auditors who have ceased
    operations); such consolidated financial statements and report are
    included in the Company's 2003 Annual Report to the Shareholders and
    are incorporated herein by reference.  Our audit also included the
    2003 and 2002 consolidated financial statement schedule of the
    Company, listed in Item 15(a)2.  This consolidated financial statement
    schedule is the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion based on our audits.  In our
    opinion, the consolidated 2003 and 2002 financial statement schedules,
    when considered in relation to the 2003 and 2002 basic consolidated
    financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly in all material
    respects, the information set forth therein.  The financial statement
    schedules for the year ended December 31, 2001 were audited by other
    auditors who have ceased operations.  Those auditors expressed an
    opinion, in their report dated February 4, 2002, (February 6, 2002, as
    to a subsequent event), that such 2001 financial statement schedules
    considered in relation to the 2001 basic financial statements taken as
    a whole (prior to the disclosures and reclassifications referred to
    above), presented fairly, in all material respects, the information
    set forth therein.

    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS ON SCHEDULE II

    To Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.:

    We have audited in accordance with auditing standards generally
    accepted in the United States, the consolidated financial statements
    included in Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.'s annual report to stockholders
    incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K, and have issued our
    report thereon dated February 4, 2002.  Our audits were made for the
    purpose of forming an opinion on those statements taken as a whole.
    The schedule listed in the index, Item 14(a)2, is the responsibility
    of the Company's management and is presented for the purposes of
    complying with the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and is
    not part of the basic financial statements.  This schedule has been
    subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audits of the
    basic financial statements and, in our opinion, fairly states in all
    material respects the financial data required to be set forth therein
    in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole.
